  "title:": "Should I take a break from school",
  "text": "Ever since High school I have felt really unmotivated, and I just can't seem to focus on any work since. I really want to finish my Associates in Mechanical Engineering, but I am just struggling in my classes. I have failed pre-calc last year and Calc 1 attempting a summer class to try to get back on track. Currently retaking it and I am still getting D's and C's on my exams. Now it is worse having other classes piled on top. Barely passing Chem and my coding class. I am just frustrated at myself telling my parents I will do better, just to get the same results every time. I do not know if my mental health is contributing to bad grades. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated, Thanks.",

I felt more motivated finding a group to study with and copying their study hours and also have a mindset (idk if that\u2019s the right word) I think to help.. I thought about failing and having to move back home with my parents and wasting money and it motivated me not to fail..",

      "text": "Hey, not sure if you're still thinking about this, but I would say that your mental health is probably contributing to your problems. If you're unmotivated, focusing is very difficult. A lack of focus in turn makes it difficult to do well, which over time will make you unmotivated since your brain starts to think \"What's the point if I'm not going to succeed?\". Together a lack of focus and a lack of motivation create a negative feedback loop. I think you probably need to investigate both, as there might be multiple factors contributing to each. I started looking into ADHD (not suggesting you have it) and taking Vyvanse, which helped a fair bit with focus, but after burning out this semester I've realized that I need therapy to address my lack of motivation (which is probably connected to bad self-esteem).  \n\n\nBut it's okay to struggle, and it's okay to ask for help. It's natural to feel frustrated at yourself, but it's also unhealthy to believe your negative self-talk, so be careful and be kind to yourself.",

I\u2019m taking a look right now and going to get some counseling soon before i possibly take any medication. I do not want to give up. I\u2019ll stand back up and succeed. Again thank you for the advice!!",
