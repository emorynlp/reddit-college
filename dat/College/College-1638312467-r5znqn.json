If I did then maybe I could see myself gritting my teeth and putting in the work for a better future.\n\nBut the way I see it now it's just pointless work. I can't work hard on things unless I enjoy doing them. I cannot succeed in classes unless I like them. \n\nIn high school I was able to grip my teeth and work hard even though it was useless because I wanted to get into a good college, then get scholarships so it wouldn't cost a fuck ton.\n\nBut now here I am in my third semester and I'm bloody miserable. \nAnd so I've stopped trying. I've stopped putting in the work and effort.\n\nI know that what I'm doing might not be very smart for the long term. Because I'm prioritizing momentary satisfaction.",

I know what you mean, for both those classes I HATED going to class and avoided it as much as possible. My grades reflect that. I think sophomore year can be particularly hard as you are taking harder classes, but they are still not all that interesting compared to upper level courses. \n\n\nIt sounds like you genuinely like computer science and econ, just hate the classes you're in this semester. It happens and sometimes you just gotta slog through it. I think you should really focus on what got you going last semester to get that 3.8 and have that motivation. I bet it went beyond what classes you were in. \n\nIgnore the guy who just commented. He's being a passive aggressive dick for no reason. You sound like you have the intelligence and discipline to get your degree(s) you just need to find that drive.",

      "text": "It's not too late to start taking good steps. It might not be possible to pass your classes at this point, but you can try again another semester if that's what you want to do. \n\nIf college isn't the right path for you, that's fine, but you need to start thinking about some alternative ideas. If you can't pass your classes your college won't allow you to be enrolled anymore and live on campus, so I assume you will move back in with your parents. What's the plan from there? Will your parents be okay with you not being in school? Are you going to get a job and start figuring out a long term plan? Or are you going to try and reapply at a different college? Or a community college? It is very difficult to transfer into another 4 year college with a failing GPA unless you have some very extenuating circumstances.\n\nAlso, I highly recommend therapy. Even teletherapy if you can't manage to leave your dorm. It is likely your college has a counseling center. It is also likely your college has some kind of academic resources center or a career center. What resources can you utilize now while you are still on campus?\n\nYou can start with small steps, but you need to start working in the direction of some kind of small plan. Even if it's just a plan for the upcoming week. Your current trajectory is unsustainable, so do some damage control now to figure out the best plan of action for what's going to happen moving forward.",

      "text": "My first semester was all online and I had a 1.73 My second semester was in person and I got a bunch of the prereqs out of the way and I really really enjoyed it. And so I got a 3.8 and made it on the Dean's list.\n\nThis semester I'm on campus but my classes I've focused heavily on my majors ( comp sci and econ ) And I just haven't been able to succeed.\n\nThe worst part is is I know it's my fault. I just simply have not been putting in enough work. I've just been sitting in my dorm room all day watching YouTube playing video games not going to class instead of putting in the work necessary to pass and succeed in these classes.\n\nI have absolutely no excuse for three of the classes the professors are great the materials interesting to me, But for two of them maybe it's not the professor's fault maybe I'm just out of my league\n\nBecause the classes are totally fucking useless. The professors and two of my classes are just really bad in teaching and the materials super uninteresting to me. \n\nI basically feel like I have to teach myself statistics and accounting outside of class. And I was just never learned how to do that. In high school I would go in and I would work really really hard and so whenever I went home I really wouldn't have any work to do.\n\nAnd but now in college it's like I have to go to class and then I have to put in a fuck ton of effort outside of class in order to do well. And I'm just really not good about putting effort in outside of class.\n\nI think I'm much prefer a job. Were you just going in your work your ass off and then you go home and whenever you're home you don't have to do anything. \n\nWith college it's like you're always on the fucking job there's never a time where you can arrest and feel good about it. \nAnytime that you rest is time that you should be studying. \nI guess that's just work life balance that I need to sort out.\n\nThe frustrating thing is like I know how to succeed academically. I know how to do really well in classes. It just takes a lot of fucking work for me to do it.\n\nAnd looking at the school that I'm in looking at the future and if you're trajectory I it just doesn't feel like it's worth it in the moment and maybe that's a bad calculation. \n\nBecause I know college is mathematically worth it for people in the long term but. I just can't be bothered to put in the work.\n\nAnd I guess I could feel guilty because I'm kind of squandering or throwing away an opportunity that I have.\nBut to be honest I've talked to people who've graduated with comp side degrees from this school and they're still working at the fucking school we're not learning about the actual computer science that's happening in the real world It's a decades behind what's currently happening and so I feel that I go into the workforce I'm going to be totally unprepared.\n\nAnd so if I wanted to learn comps I would just teach it to myself\n\nLike that's the whole thing with college it's like if I want to learn something I should just teach myself these things instead of wasting the time at university\n\nBut I really haven't been using my \"free time\" Very wisely. I've been squandering and wasting it so instead of learning anything new whenever I am just working a job I just be working at job and it'd be kind of dead end\n\nWhat's a degree I would at least have something to show for all my work.\n\nI think routine is really important. And I think discipline is very very important. And I lack discipline. I lack will. Maybe I'll go out there for a while work a job that I hate and maybe I'll hate the job so much that I'm going to go back and do school.\n\nThat's another thing I feel bad about. This is a very cushy and a very easy thing to do to go to college.\n\nI guess it's not that easy, but. I've never had a fucking job in my life I'm 19 I haven't had a fucking job. Just because my parents, especially my dad, have pushed me so hard down the academic route. And if stress the importance of college my entire fucking life\n\nAnd I know it's true I know like hey I'll be better off if I do to get a degree. \nBut I just cannot get a degree just to get a fucking degree I want to learn shit and I feel like I'm not learning anything here. Maybe I'd learn more if I actually applied myself. \nI'm grateful I'm at least of pretty sound mind now. Because mental illness has been a struggle. But I haven't reached out for help so it's my fault. And I should be able to succeed even despite my mental illness and so it's it's my fault I just haven't worked hard enough I I've truly reaped what I've sewn.\n\nI haven't put in the effort until I haven't gotten the grades. Whenever I put in the effort I got the grades.\n\nI was able to put in the effort last semester because I really truly enjoyed what I was doing and what I was learning. \n\nBut now because I don't enjoy what I'm learning and doing I don't put in the effort.\n\nAnd so now I think the best course is to change major maybe change school for sure. This place is a shithole It's tiny and over expensive and the lack resources seriously.\n\nAnyway. I'm sorry for renting so much. Maybe you can use this as a cautionary tail.\n\nKeep going to class Don't skip class. Cuz what happened to me is I skipped a class and it became a habit. It's like smoking, not even once. \n\nIf you're going to do something Do it because you love doing it. That way it's easy to do it. Choose a major that you love not a major that you think will make you money, because you won't succeed. Hell maybe you will, after all I'm sure plenty of y'all are more motivated and determined than I am.\n\nBest of luck everyone.",

It\u2019s often a whiplash between that and forgiveness everyday. \nYou are correct on separating ability from worth and reevaluation. Though I feel it\u2019s somewhat out of our hands and inadvertently promoted by Society expecting students to take about 5 classes a year and join organizations, etc. while dealing with out-of-college concerns like home and family life or a job. All from the moment they start as freshmen (high school course load pales in retrospect). Granted you can take fewer classes, but that has its own issues, such as potentially not being applicable for financial aids.\n\nTo elaborate on a last point, I\u2019ve also found it freeing to let go and be willing to try again next time. Doesn\u2019t matter so much if I spend an extra year or whatnot. In a decade plus from all that\u2019ll matter is I managed to grow and succeed.",

      "text": "You've done a very good first step by addressing your problem and asking for ideas from people. Many students, maybe event most, can relate to what you're going through. Me too, but I'm putting my own story last in this comment.\n\nHere are my tips for you:\n\n* Talk to people. Many universities offer psychological counseling. It is very normal for students to use this service for any kind of problem. They have a lot of experience and may be able to point you in a direction. Talk to a professor that you trust. That professor may be able to help you to identify what could be interesting for you in your field. Find professionals on LinkedIn or in your region and ask if you can talk to them for a few minutes about their career paths. This can be inspiring and give you some pointers.\n* Search for a purpose. You said yourself that you don't have long-term goals at the moment. My problem was that I didn't know what it's like to work in real life. Everything in college seemed so theoretical and my brain couldn't make good connections between real problems and the class content. Maybe you have the opportunity to do an internship or take a student job in that field. You may find some purpose and the social connection to professionals can be really helpful. I think working as a student may be one of the things that saved me. \n* Re-evaluate your path. You don't have to study what you study. I've read that about 75% of students enter college undecided or change their major. Many students can't get into their preferred field or select a field based on the potential salary. It's totally normal to question what you're doing and re-adjust your life. There are simply too many options nowadays to give a definite answer to what one wants to do in life. There may be professional counselors who can help you. \n\nI didn't want to start with my story, but maybe it helps in some way. In my first five semesters in engineering, I had no clue of what I want to do with my degree and was very drained in every way possible. I just studied for the sake of passing exams without seeing the bigger picture. My fear of a failed future kept me going and unfortunately not the joy of studying. Only later, I discovered some things that sparked my interest and transformed me into becoming a passionate engineer. So much that I did research on satellites and space rovers, have a space business now, manage a Master's program and have taught space engineering to thousands of students. I don't mean to brag. On the contrary, I want to show that someone who is totally in the dark can find a way out... in time.",

It's hard to lose motivation when you think about graduating and immediately going into the field of your dreams. What you're doing now is very dangerous because you're going to regret this later down the road. I know it's easy to say \"tough it out\" but consider getting your sh*t together asap cus you're hurting no one but yourself. Good luck",

I\u2019m not sure what year you\u2019re in but I think the biggest piece of advice I can give to you or anyone struggling to keep themselves together in school is to simply just take a break. When I finished high school, I took a 3 year gap and went traveling and started figuring out who I was. It sounds cliche but if you truly enjoy doing something it will feel more of a learning opportunity rather than a task. It seems like you\u2019re not enjoying school or what you\u2019re trying to do. Taking some time for yourself is okay. Get back to it when you\u2019re ready and feel 100%. It\u2019s never too late to go back to school, it will always be there.",

I been diagnosed with high levels of adhd both as a kid as well as recently but never wanted to take the medication, I got fucked up enough on my own without it back then. But nowdays I don\u2019t really do much and my inner fiend has kinda disappeared so i feel more comfortable taking the meds, hopefully it helps. Might be a move for you to get tested for adhd as well. Get some addy to get you through college then get off if",
