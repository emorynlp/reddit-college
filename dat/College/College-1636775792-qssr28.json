  "title:": "Going from a big college to small town college for mental health reason",
  "text": "I'm one year into a college that has mentally fucked me up. The college is very very far from home. And I just hate it here. I feel my lowest here and I am contemplating life in general. Besides the course I am doing here isn't what I want to do with life anyway though my field is a very skill based one so it doesn't matter anyway. \n\nNow I'm going back home for 2 days to give an interview for another college. The college does have the course I'm looking for and it's closer to home. But the college gives no freedom to students at all and I live in a very small town. \n\nI just hope I'm not making a mistake in life by changing colleges at this minute into my career. \n\nIf it wasn't for my mental health I wouldn't do it. \nI'm so stressed cause I can't handle the stress of living far from my family doing something I do not enjoy nor wish to do for the rest of my life. And then making my parents go through the stress with me. \n\nBut I also know a lot of things about the new college are things i wouldn't like and may make me sadder than I am here.\n\nAm I making a mistake?\n\nEdit: I've reached desperation. I'm ready to just escape this place even if it means starting in a college I won't like but I'll be doing it in the same city as my home and doing a course I genuinely would love to pursue as a career.",

Or is it some Christian college with actual rules?\n\nSmall towns would be a definite no for me, but I know you\u2019re not me. How long have you been at the big college physically? If you were online all last year, Covid has definitely messed with people, but I\u2019d hope you could start to fit in.",
