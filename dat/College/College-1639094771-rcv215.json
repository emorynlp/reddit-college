  "text": "Hii so it is possible for me to get a 3.0 anytime soon? Im in my sophomore year. My gpa rn is a 2.4 I believe. This semester I got 3 Cs and a B. I joined a program outside of college to get some IT certificates so yea it was rough but at least ill have something on my resume. \n\nI plan on retaking a class I got an F in over the winter break since thats the main reason why my gpa tanked. And maybe take another required class since the load will be lighter. Anyone else had a bad gpa and was able to raised it?? If so how?",
