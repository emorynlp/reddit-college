  "title:": "I feel like colleges are scamming students with low-effort teaching. What can we do about it?",
  "text": "This subject, I\u2019m sure, gets us all teeming with anger. \n\nAnd the sad part is: almost all university students have been there.\n\nWhen you are at University you are paying hundreds of dollars for a credit hour. I am a resident of the state my university is in, so I pay $212 for a credit hour; when I have to take a typical three credit class I am paying $636 for a class; times five for a fifteen credit semester and that comes out to $3,180. For an out of state student that means you are going to pay $10,608 for a semester and $2,151 for one credit-hour class. \n\nWhen you have a terrible teacher that\u2019s some bullshit. \n\nSo that\u2019s why I am asking: where is the accountability for teachers? I know there are teacher reviews at the end of the semester but what use is that when you have already paid for the semester and have learned nothing? Why do teachers with bad reps amongst the student body continue to teach? \n\nStudents, why are we just letting this happen? \n\nAnd what can we do to stop it?\n\nI want to call out my university, The University of Florida, out on some bullshit. Why are these teachers who put no effort into their classes allowed to teach? \n\nI want to do something but I don\u2019t know what you should do to effectively end this! \n\n(Like I said, I know there are lecturer reviews at the end of the semester but I don\u2019t think these are really being acted upon. There are teachers with bad reps at my school amongst the student body.)\n\nHow can I make sure I am not being taken advantage of (more than usual lol) by my university?",

      "text": "I feel your pain.  At my school we have a set of Gen Ed courses you're supposed to take to graduate and 2 classes are language courses of whichever you want to take that are available. My time slot only allowed French and my god it is a ride. Firstly like every college scam we have to buy a book but with an online code that we could do hmwk online but here's the thing when we do it online it never matches up with the lesson on what we are learning. As well for some reason the prof has stated that shes not allowed to speak English and only does so but very quietly when the door is open so the \"department chair\" doesnt hear her speak so she speaks 96% of the class in French and attempts to use hand signals/gestures and points and expects us to understand it. \n\nMy issue is just the fact that this is our first time taking this language and speaking only in French to English speakers about how certain phrases or words or meanings in French is just absurd so we basically have to self teach; so the prof is essentially useless bc at home we have the online hmwk and in class we're just trying to figure out what's she saying, if pay thousands for tuition and get an online code to do hmwk and the teacher doesnt give us anything in return then what's the point of the prof anyways? I've been looking at the syllabus constantly to see if I can poke holes but idk if it's worth the time fighting for this nonsense, more so since I'll most likely have the same prof next semester bc to graduate you need 2 language course to graduate so I'm stuck in this hell. \n\nMore so I took japanese as well early on (had to drop for family reasons) and we needed no online code and the teacher spoke to us in English and Japanese but explained everything nicely and was right infront of the Language office so taking this class I assumed it would have some similar steps but I'm just as shocked on how bad it truly is. As well for the online hmwk you get 3 chances to do it properly and after that it would be input as wrong; so you're basically trying to teach yourself, trying to understand teacher, trying to understand text book (when you order it online it doesnt even come binded. Just sheets. Wtf.) And hope to pass. I fucking hate this class. ",

Talking with the student success facilitators, had no results. Talking wih the dean of the department, had no results. Talking with the dean of the school, had no results. Everything was empty promises and delay tatics even with 30-40 fellow students with the same complaints.\n\nThey didn't care because they already had our money and had no intention of providing proper teaching. One class I managed to get through by doing the text at home, the other I 'passed' with the teachers made up marks and to this day I still have no clue how to use that program *at all*. Every time I open it and try to follow the text I am reminded of the constant struggle I had butting heads wih the teacher and deans I get so stressed out, angry, frustrated, cant do a dang thing and shortly rage quit.\n\nThis was the largest and most well known college in our city.",

The school may have settled for someone who is cheaper to employ and can't go over budget. Or they fear not being able to fill the position in time. Or the teacher contributes something else meaningful to the school (research, leadership, etc.)\n\n>Students, why are we just letting this happen? And what can we do to stop it?\n\nProbably nothing other than continuing to fill out teacher reviews. You can try bringing it to the attention of your dean but your mileage with this strategy may vary. Costs and budget and keeping positions filled trumps all, because students will continue to pay the exorbitant costs of college because it is still more profitable to go to college in the long run than it is to not take that path (for the average person anyway).",

I told them I looked up how much we were paying for this class and asked them if they thought it was worth it and they said no. BUT they weren\u2019t angry, they didn\u2019t feel wronged more they were just mildly annoyed. and I knew it was because they were just happy the class was easy enough to pass because a lot of what college has become for some people is a check mark to get an entry-level position.  They are apathetic to how they got there and they don\u2019t care what price they have to pay. All I could think of was students who are supporting themselves through college or people who go back to college later to learn and the slap in the face it must be to be faced with this kind of shit.",

When universities hire new professors, they arent looking to see how good of a teacher they are, they are looking to see how well they know the subject, and how well they can translate that knowledge into research and real-world application. I know you are really mad at one specific professor but you have to realize that the school is taking steps. I go to UF and know that between this year and last, UF has hired over 500 new faculty members, and has received additional funding from the state to do so. Every person, at some point or another has had a bad professor, its an unavoidable issue. Do you honestly think that you wouldnt have run into a similar problem at any other university? I get that UF prioritizes the three main professional branches of the university (engineering, business, agriculture/bio) but its still ultimately up to the J-school to bring in new talent.",

If the student body really hates  them, students will find an alternative if possible. If a professor doesn't have enough students, their class is cancelled, they make no money. If that becomes a pattern, they're going to have an issue. Granted, sometimes... that professor is the \"one\" you're \"required\" to take and that sucks. \n\nI think the most powerful thing would be students refusing to take their class. It's also possible, other students like them or they're an \"easy a\" so some students still want their class even if it's boring if it means it won't hurt their GPA. \n\nIt's not too late to drop classes, so why havn't you yet if you hate them?",

While what you're experiencing is all too common at certain types of schools, it is far from universal. At teaching-centered schools (like liberal arts colleges) *teaching* is the primary duty of faculty and research comes second. Faculty who cannot demonstrate high-quality teaching consistently cannot earn tenure or promotion at those schools. Moreover, such institutions do not have graduate students (so no graduate TAs) and they generally rely far less on  adjunct/temporary faculty than large schools like yours. Teaching evaluations by students often play a major role in hiring/tenure/promotion at such schools, and they will generally take concerns about teaching raised by students seriously.\n\nWhen someone tells you \"all colleges are basically the same\" they are incorrect. Incidentally, they are often also incorrect when they tell you it's going to be cheaper to attend a huge public university rather than a small private college--- many students find that financial aid at private schools ends up making them cost the same or even less out-of-pocket as their state universities.",

She also doesn\u2019t know how to control a class, and the class tends to get out of her hand and discussion is dominated by two egomaniac kids we have in class who only want to talk about themselves. \n\nOne more class isn\u2019t taught by a professor. It\u2019s taught by a high school teacher, I shit you not. He\u2019s not bad, but he obviously has no barometer for the difference between his high school students and his college students.

      "text": "A big reason is because the career path to becoming a professor has very little to do with actual teaching. You don't get any training on how to teach a class effectively, how to comunicate technical ideas, how to make a lesson plan, etc. Getting a PhD is the minimum requirement to become a professor at most colleges/universities (aside from community colleges), but all the experience you gain through your PhD is about doing research not teaching. Yes, many PhD students *do* get some teaching experience by TAing but TAs aren't usually given any instruction on *how* to teach a class aside from maybe a day of orientation they have to go to their first year. And you often don't have any control over the content of the class(this varies widely by discipline). The professor you are TAing for will usually provide you with the course materials and assignments and your job is mostly to grade. \n\nBut more importantly, you are judged primarily on your research accomplishments than your teaching. Universities don't necessarily hire a professor because they think they will be great teachers. They hire them because they think they will be able to publish quality research and get awarded grants for their research, which in turn rakes in more money and prestige for the university. Yea, when hiring for tenure track positions they do consider what classes you've taught and your teaching evaluations. But arguably your publication record and research accomplishments are more important. A big part of the interview process is usually a pitch that describes the kind of research you plan to do as a professor at the university. And when you are being considered for tenure, one of the main focuses is on your research output during the time you've worked at the university.  \n\nOf course, everything I just described is probably more true for big research universities than say small liberal art colleges that don't have a graduate program. But ironically the \"best\", most prestigious schools are usually large, research universities...\n\nSo, basically, a lot of the garbage professors fall into two categories. They are professors who are actually really knowledgable about their field and good researchers but just horrible at communicating/teaching. Or they are adjuncts who have had little to no teaching experience yet.  ",

Then get enrolled in courses that have highly rated professors or professors that cater to your learning style.",

Unfortunately I think the amount of things you could do to impact a teacher\u2019s effort is minimal, which sucks. All I can think of is maybe going to office hours and asking questions about the material in order to force your professor to engage.

It's at least low-engagement teaching, but it's a necessary evil because it's not practical to have one-to-one teaching if it's hundreds of students in each class. \n\nIt's not like people haven't tried to get accountability for teaching in the classroom, but most of that is aimed at the lower grades, specifically high school. There is a lot of continuing education high school teachers have to go through to continue teaching, but I don't know if that necessarily translates into better teaching. \n\nJust curious as to what you describe as \"bad teaching\" in your classes currently? Teaching is like any other skill...it's like a bell curve. So most teachers fall somewhere in the middle and in the rare cases you get a really bad or really amazing teacher. ",

Some of the teachers are just garbage, some of them are outstanding. One of the best teachers I had taught an online history class that required no textbook. She found free online resources for us to use and created excellent assignments. I retained a lot of information from that class based on the modules she built. Yes, most of the other students complained that she was too hard and they didn't like doing the work. \n\nI have also taken classes where we had to buy a textbook with access code for $100 or just the code for $80. My kids were in high school and we all took it together. So instead of sharing one book, I ended up paying for three access codes to take idiotic quizzes and turn in homework assignments. It was absurd. We never even opened the textbook. The class met once a week and the teacher cancelled a few of those. She was an adjunct of course who taught at other colleges in the area. \n\nColleges should require departments to develop programs using as many free materials as possible and teachers should not be allowed to require students to purchase access codes. They already pay technology fees for Canvas/Blackboard and teachers who want to teach can create modules themselves with the quizzes, tests, and homework for students to use on those platforms. \n\nIn California they are always trying to raise tuition to pay their chancellors and presidents more money all while hiring part time adjuncts to actually provide the education students pay for.

Those profs have six years to build a scholarly portfolio that will either result in a job for life or getting fired.  While every university and department is slightly different, a research university like Florida probably emphasizes research at the expense of teaching.  No one ever got tenure for being an amazing teacher, but many have been denied tenure for being sub-par researchers.  You do the math.\n\nSome of those professors are tenured.  Presumably they've been through one of the most rigorous selection processes this side of the Navy Seals, but that process may not have focused much on teaching, and once tenured, promotion opportunities are still heavily research oriented.\n\nSome of those professors are \"true adjuncts\".  These are professionals with day jobs in industry who are hired to teach a class here or there to fill a gap and presumably to lend practical experience.  Many have no background at all in education or academia, and it will take them a while to get good at teaching.\n\nI think in the end what matters is what your university and department emphasize.  There are plenty of colleges that emphasize teaching and have great teachers -- community colleges and liberal arts colleges are often among this group.  Research universities typically are not.\n\n&#x200B;",

You can't even rely on student evaluations because they're known to be biased against women and minorities, so much so that one university termed their use a human rights violation. Your professors are often overworked, underpaid, and under appreciated by their community. ",

If you were constantly bogged down in work and barely keeping afloat, you probably wouldn't bother with extra work that won't be recognised. \n\nWhen it comes to research, there aren't really that many deadlines, and pretty much all of it is \"opt-in\" in some sense. That means we've never technically finished our work for the day or for the week. If I finish all of my marking then there are still infinite things I can do for my research. Those research tasks will help me in my career, whereas putting extra effort into teaching will not. Considering how cutthroat the academic job market is, I'm pretty well obligated to focus on research. Grants and publications don't go to researchers because they're good teachers. \n\nAnd I *do* do a lot of extra outreach work, but I recognise that it won't get me a job at the end of the day. In fact, I can name a few people who were purposely overlooked and even kicked out of their graduate programs because they were focussing too much on teaching and outreach and weren't publishing enough - they apparently weren't \"dedicated\", in spite of keeping on track and getting great results. In as many words, it's the universities themselves that tell us not to focus on teaching. It's very much a sort of Pareto principle in action. ",

              "text": "Students should definitely advocate that good teachers get paid a wage that reflects their teaching excellence and the contributions they make to your education.  \n\nBut the answer \"they have a big endowment\" is not really the right solution.  It's something a lot of critics understandably point to because it's a big number, but not enough people understand how endowments work generally and what that means for higher ed.\n\nFirst of all, the biggest portion of the endowment shouldn't ever be spent.  That's the point of an endowment:  you set aside money that will be invested, not spent, so that it throws off earnings which *can* be spent on things.  So a college with a $500M endowment doesn't, in fact, have $500M available to spend on making things better.  They aren't supposed to spend the $500M at all.  What they are supposed to do is invest the endowment and then use some of the interest to make stuff better (how much is usually decided by a policy set by the board or regents or trustees), and use the remainder of that interest to plow back into the corpus (that's the main part of the endowment) so the value is protected against inflation.\n\nNow, it is completely fair to say, \"Okay, what is my college doing with the interest/proceeds, and why isn't it spending it on paying adjuncts better?\" Well, one issue is that often times when people give money to the endowment, they give it with a purpose in mind and there are restrictions built into the gift agreement.  They may have given it for the music school and want any interest earned to support the symphonic bands.  Or they wanted it to support a cancer researcher.  Or they wanted it to go for financial aid.  That's what the college has to spend it on; their flexibility is limited.  And frankly, there probably aren't a lot of big-time donors that have given to the cause of paying adjuncts better.  \n\nNow, THAT SAID, spending the gift funds on financial aid or the symphony or whatever, sometimes frees up some of the general fund money the college was formerly spending on those things.  Not always!  Donors are likely to think, \"I want my money to help you give MORE aid; I don't want you to give the same aid you always have, and use the money you used to spend on aid for something else.\"  But where possible, a college might be able to free up some money thanks to the endowment proceeds. So from that standpoint, proceeds from the endowment may allow them to pay adjuncts better.  \n\nI know this got a little long, but I hear this kind of concern from students a lot--not understanding how and why a large endowment is being used.  The answer is, it probably is being used, but some of those uses are guided by the original donor.   I also think that endowment spending is typically pretty \"invisible\" to students because they don't have the time or the access to see the source of spending.   They may think their tuition dollars are paying for everything while the endowment does nothing.  But in fact, their tuition dollars are being supplemented in a number of areas by endowment proceeds.\n\nI'd like to see colleges do a lot better job explaining this!  My university's endowment is in the billions, and students are naturally very interested in how it is used. ",
