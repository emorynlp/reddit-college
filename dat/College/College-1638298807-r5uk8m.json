  "text": "Our professor asked us to identify a literature review, which is usually in most research papers. But I can't find such a section in this document. Is there no literature review present here, or am I missing something?\n\n[http://www.iiep.unesco.org/en/publication/shadow-education-system-private-tutoring-and-its-implications-planners](http://www.iiep.unesco.org/en/publication/shadow-education-system-private-tutoring-and-its-implications-planners)\n\nThe paper is the link, it is from UNESCO. I would appreciate any help, from what I gather such a section does not appear here, but maybe my lack of experience is not allowing me to see it. I am pretty much done with the paper review save by this section, any help is appreciated.",

I didn\u2019t read the article, but if your teacher asked you to find one it\u2019s there",

If the article references past data and other papers and generally establishes what the academic community *already knows* about the topic then that's the lit review. \n\nThe purpose of it is to establish a foundation for the rest of the paper to work off of. It's saying, \"Hey, here is what we already know.\" And then their methodology and case study/experiment/survey/whatever show what the author is doing that is built off of the content of the lit review and then the results/implications section of a paper is the glue that connects the previous knowledge and the new insights provided by the author's research.\n\nEdit: The thing loaded and I'd say section two is the lit review. From my own experience with polisci sources, which are generally structured like this paper, that looks like a lit review to me. But I'd still look at the other sections if I were you.",
