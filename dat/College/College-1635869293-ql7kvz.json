  "text": "hello,\n\ni\u2019m a sophomore, and i recently moved into a dorm where i share a room. i\u2019m a very sensitive sleeper and for the past couple of nights, i have not really gotten quality sleep because of hearing outside noises like my roommate moving and the community bathroom door opening and closing. not to mention the clock tower outside of my room that goes off every 15 minutes. i feel pretty physically shitty and it\u2019s getting worse every day lol. does anyone have any tips for getting better sleep? i have earplugs but they don\u2019t block out much, i\u2019m planning on getting a sleep mask soon too.",

Find some white noise that relaxes you, I was always a fan of rain outside a window, or (oddly enough) spaceship noises (low consistent drone that is insanely relaxing). I always did ear buds as I never wanted to deal with a roommate potentially being annoyed by a machine. You can also try pulling the sheet over your ear to help block some of it out too. I also always hung a bathrobe and a towel on a hook on the back of my door. Doesn't really do much but I always figured to more barriers to sound the better.",

I also used melatonin but it can be a bit heavy for some people so they user valerian root which seems to help a lot. fans or other videos on YouTube might help too",
