  "title:": "Should I type my Power Theory notes instead of hand write?",
  "text": "I\u2019m a first year Power Engineer. My prof basically skims through a PowerPoint slide that generalizes everything from a chapter, and we pretty much read the actual textbook chapters at home which the PowerPoint derived its info from. Think of the PowerPoint as like maybe 30 - 40% of the info, while the actual chapter in the book is obviously 100%. These chapters are fairly long, 30 pages on average I\u2019ve noticed and it takes me 4 - 6 hours just to pretty much \u201ccopy\u201d what I\u2019m reading in the book to my notes (it\u2019s a theory class, NOT any math or calculations) and this takes up a massive amount of time which to me seems pointless, since I\u2019m essentially re writing everything I\u2019m reading, when I could also use this time to study for my 5 other classes. Should I just type the notes on my laptop from the book? I feel like this way I\u2019m not focused on writing as much as possible to finish, but instead I\u2019ll actually read to understand the content, and then easily type up a few sentences to remember. In my math related classes that involve physics and calculations, obviously I hand write everything because there are formulas and calculations to remember, and everything is taught IN class, not a PowerPoint that expects you to go home and pretty much do several hours of work. Thoughts? I feel like I\u2019m writing so much that I\u2019m not even remember anything anymore, typing seems like the win for me but I don\u2019t know, please do help.",
