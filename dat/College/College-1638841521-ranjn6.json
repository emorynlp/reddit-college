      "text": "Don't worry, college is not all bad news! Awful professors exist, but so do excellent professors. I knew a couple awful professors, I knew over a dozen excellent professors. \n\nHour long exams are common. They sound scary, but once you get the format the make sense (and for anyone who thinks an hour long exam is scary, try doing a handwrite-an-essay-in-three-hours sort of exam, now those are anxiety-inducing!). Everyone at college feels nervous, especially at first. If you didn't feel nervous you should be worried you are overestimating yourself!\n\nHowever, bad news, there is no such thing as an universally easy or hard major. The difficulty of a major depends on what university you go to, and even then it is difficult to say if one major is harder than others, as majors as so different. A STEM exam is nothing like a philosophy paper, etc. Everyone likes to think their own major is the most difficult. Throw me into an upper-level math exam, and I would do awful. Tell me to go write a 20 page research paper on the cause of the Abbasid Revolution, I would excel. The situation would be reversed for most math majors.\n\nThe easiest majors are the ones you enjoy.  \nBest of luck!",

      "text": "It is what you make of it to some extent. My biggest advice is to try to get an idea of any red flag professors and avoid signing up for their classes. If you do find yourself in a class where you can tell it\u2019s not working then drop within the time frame to assure you get refunded for the course. It\u2019s a short window, but should be enough to get an idea of a professors expectations.\n\nSometimes however it really is just the student and how much effort they are willing to put in. I\u2019ve definitely seen threads that are professor bashing, but  when I read the story, the professor\u2019s attitude is a result of the student\u2019s disrespect towards the professor. \n\nYou\u2019re an \u201cadult\u201d in college and you\u2019re paying to be there so they expect you to act like you give a shit. If you don\u2019t, then you can\u2019t expect the professor to be thrilled, because you\u2019re essentially wasting their time and your classmate\u2019s time. \n\nJust take it serious, I like to think about it as a job. That being said, college isn\u2019t for everyone and if you get a feeling it\u2019s not right for you, don\u2019t force your way through and be miserable. You can always come back to it if you change your mind.",

Half of these reddits post are people complaining about failing because they fail to make any effort until it\u2019s too late. My advice to you is to practice time management and better study habits. You don\u2019t have to be the smartest kid but you have to have good study techniques to pass your classes. Also, use all the resources your campus offers (office hours, tutoring labs, SI sessions)!! You pay for them! Always keep up with your grades and don\u2019t expect your professor to guide you through everything. Be proactive!!!",

      "text": "As someone who\u2019s a senior in college, the vast majority of my professors have been great; I\u2019ve only ever had one who I can say was truly awful, but I still powered on through.\n\nI will also say that all majors are difficult in their own way. STEM requires a lot of math; social sciences and the like requires a lot of reading and writing. All are challenging but equally rewarding. I couldn\u2019t do an engineering degree, but my brother, who IS in STEM, has said he couldn\u2019t do my history degree. It\u2019s all about finding what works for you and what you\u2019re interested in learning about :)\n\nWork on your studying and note taking skills now! These are what I wished I had honed in on the most prior to starting college. Good luck!!!!",
