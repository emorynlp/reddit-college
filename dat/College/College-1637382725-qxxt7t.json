  "text": "Hey all,\n\nI'm in a predicament and it's the kind that can only happen to someone with social anxiety. Two years ago I mustered up the courage to leave home and live on campus in a dorm for six months before I had a massive nervous breakdown. In those six months, I made amazing friends, memories, passed all my courses and enjoyed living away from home except for the last few weeks leading up to the breakdown, where everything started to change. \n\nI went from bubbly and social to a recluse, crying all the time, sitting alone and straight up ignoring people because I felt so ugly, wrong and unworthy. My friendships started to deteriorate and I've lost contact with many of my friends since then (who still live at the dorm). I know this is on me, but it's cold hard facts. I moved home and have spent two years in hell, but I'm ready to try again, same college, same dorm, same people, and theres a chance they might recognise me.\n\nIve worked my ass off to secure a spot at this dorm again but I'm worried what the people who knew me might think. Will it be awkward? Weird? What do I do? \n\nTDLR: I'm returning to a dorm two years after a nervous breakdown where people know me and I'm scared of what they might think.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nThanks, friends x",

So going to the frats (he was a brother if I remember correctly) was weird for me as a 5th year so I can imagine how it would be for him. His reason to be off campus was legal. I could look it up online how the case proceeded but he was not convicted. I am not judging as he did graduate, last I heard (I followed him on Snapchat and I deleted the account) he was working for a insurance company and trying to be into disaffortunate  youth.\n\nThe other was someone who came back then dropped out again. \n\nMy college was high stress, I could go on for hours over my issues. But again I can tell you after all the abuse and stuff I am considered a success. And the people I was around all had issues (my family come to the conclusion if I told specific stories). My college years (first 4) for good and bad, had a president give the disaffortunate a chance with scholarship (there was a kid from my hs who went there -undergrad a year straight from reform school because he could play football but did drugs for a year). So they got the chance, you have to make the most of it and a ton transferred (I could easily have).\n\nagain I wish you luck",
