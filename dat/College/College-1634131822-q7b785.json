  "title:": "Converting A-Level and AS-Level to GPA score",
  "text": "I\u2019ve just started year 12 in the uk and I\u2019m signed on with a Sports Scholarship Recruitment Agency to help get me into a US college when I\u2019ve finished my A-levels.\n\nI\u2019m taking computer science, maths, and ICT, but I\u2019m thinking of dropping maths at the end of year 12 and taking an AS-Level in the subject.\n\nI was wondering if an grade at AS would work the same as a full A-Level grade when calculating my GPA score. I feel like it should as my understanding is that GPA is worked out by converting the uk grade to a US grade, and then converting that to a GPA score, adding all the scores together, and dividing by the amount of grades achieved. \n\nSo would it matter if I have an AS instead of a full A-Level? The only difference between the two I know of is that an AS can be done in one year, but awards you 40% of the UCAS points (needed for UK universities) that a full 2 year A-Level course awards. \n\nAny answers would be a big help.",

      "text": "So I\u2019m not too sure because I didn\u2019t do my O/A Level from the UK but from what I know, your O Level grade is your GPA and your A Level is used like AP credits, meaning they will just contribute to elective credits when you go to college\n\nEdit: just wanted to add that you should probably email your college admissions and they can help you (but also know that most Americans have no idea what A Levels are)",

              "text": "US colleges generally consist of major related coursework and then electives (which are basically classes you can take in whatever you want). AP (which are advanced placement) or A Level grades can convert to college credits and basically contribute to your total degree meaning you have to take less classes.",
