  "text": "When I completed the evaluations for my courses this semester, it showed the percentage of evaluations turned in. They were both around 20%. One still has a few days, but the other was due so I don't imagine many more will be submitted. \n\nI don't want to sound like I'm na\u00efve and I think they take every evaluation to heart. BUT I think it's important for students to give feedback on the courses. Especially if you have complaints- how can anyone expect improvements to be made if no one says anything. On the flip side, if there is something that really works about a course let them know that too!\n\nThere are probably some profs that don't care but I know if I was one, I'd like to know what was or wasn't working for my students. So I think we should all give them the benefit of the doubt and take 5 minutes to share our feedback. I think a lot of students blow this off, but I think it's important.",

      "text": "As a professor, thank you! I give extra credit to the class if we get to an 80% response rate (that way, the results are more representative). Low response rates mean that the diligent ones (who are probably doing well) and the angry ones (who probably are not doing so well) are likely taking it, leaving the broad middle underrepresented.\n\nI take the feedback seriously, and while some of it is not useful (i.e., someone upset because they never came to class/did the work and got the grade they earned, so they just blustered in the comments without saying anything constructive; a few others don't like being challenged, so it shows in the comments), most of it is either friendly/positive or helpful in some way. For example, I recently changed the allotted time on exams a little bit because I was seeing a pattern of \"not enough time\" that I then compared to actual exam performance and was able to validate.\n\nThank you for taking this process seriously, even if others don't!",
