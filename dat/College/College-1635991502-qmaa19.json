  "title:": "Majoring in Biophysics (Pre-med) but not good at the actual physics part and I dont know what to change it to?",
  "text": "In terms of majoring:\n\nI hate chemistry (I think its boring)\n\nI hate psychology/sociology.\n\nNueroscience is a nope\n\nI can deal with Bio\n\nI do love math though and today it just hit me and for a minute I considered changing my major to Math on the premed track. But Im not sure. Biophysics has all the courses I need, but I feel the actual physics part is impossible to do. Biophysics is basically all math and physics is math, but with long words. Like once I get to classes like Modern Physics, Quantez Mechanics, and Theoretical Physics I cant imagine how it cant be game over. That sounds hard af and my experience in AP C Mechanics in high school was aweful. Failed every test but it was curved so hard I got a B. I really really enjoy math and would continue on my current major if I didnt feel so defeated by the idea of physics? How hard is Biophysics really.",

          "text": "no its the right path 100 percent. I wrote in terms of major: its not something Im passionately into. I ultimatly want to be an Interventional Radiologist so someone who deals with physics and math alot. I dont think pre-med has a lot of chem. Only 4 semesters and its not like im dreading by chem now, just not a subject I can see myself do ECs with.",
