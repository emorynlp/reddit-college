  "text": "Hey, class so just a reminder that the last exam is going to be before the first day of finals to get it out the way. Hopefully, this will make things easier on you as I am sure that none of your other professors are thinking the same thing so you will have lots of time to focus on other exams. \n\n\nAlso, the final project will be due a full week before finals, again to make things easier for you. \n\n\nOh and the extra credit assignment that you will all be doing because the class average was 65% on the exams and quizzes will open up a few days before finals and you'll have till the end of the week to finish it. Just a reminder that since this is extra credit, I will not be grading anything that is not of good quality.\nIt is supposed to be a fun assignment so be creative! But don't deviate from the course material at all or you will get a zero.\n\nA few students have asked for clarification on how the optional final exam work. Basically, the final exam will replace your lowest exam score unless you get below 1 and 1/3s your highest exam score minus the extra credit points for that exam unless the extra credit points for that exam was 3/4ths higher than the lowest amount of extra credit points you received on any other the other exams, or if your score on the final was 60% or lower. I recommend that you only take the final if you absolutely need it as it can seriously damage your grade if you fail it. It is also comprehensive except for chapters 3, 5, 8, 13 and one chapter that we covered in class will be drawn randomly from a hat to be excluded from the final. \n\nGood luck on your exams I wish you all the best. \n\nSincerely, \n\n Professor",
