  "text": "How do you do them you need to withdraw in office hours? I need to get them to sign this form bc the school requires that you talk with them. What do I say? I'm going through health problems and don't want to disclose too much. It's also not the prof or class structure's problem. It just me. I understand why the class is structured the way it is. It's just my health is working against me this semester.",
