  "title:": "What looks better: 1 Bachelor's and 1 Master's or 3 Bachelor's degrees?",
  "text": "I'm almost done with my undergrad in psychology and I'm trying to figure out where to go from here. I don't have any particular career in mind and I really reject the idea (for myself) of picking a career path for life. I just have some things that really interest me and I love learning in general. But I also don't want to waste a ton of time and money if it's not going to look impressive.\n\nI'm just playing around with this idea, but it would probably look like this if I continued at the university I am at now: \n\n1. BA in Psychology and MA in Education\n\nOR\n\n2. BA in Psychology, BA in English, and BA in Child Development.\n\n\nEdit: thank you all SO much for your insight and advice!! I really appreciate it, it\u2019s given me a lot to think about. I\u2019m understanding now that getting a MA isn\u2019t going to lock me into one career for my whole life, it\u2019s going to give me more freedom than the 3 degrees. I think after I get my MA and get somewhat comfortable in a job, I\u2019ll just audit some classes at my local college.",

      "text": "A lot of people are saying hard pass based on the end result/end goal, but honestly I think it depends more on what it would take to get the additional bachelors versus what you would do with them after. \n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t consider it at all if it took more than 3 additional semesters (being fall, spring, summer OR fall, spring, fall, for example). It would be a definite yes to me if it took an additional 2 semesters or less and you got to keep any scholarships/funding you have. I would have to seriously think about it if it were going to take 3 semesters, and bring into consideration funding, and I just wouldn\u2019t do it if it were to take 2 more years or more. \n\nSo I guess it depends on where you\u2019re starting at to get all three degrees. Reading this post makes me think that you\u2019re in your senior year or at least really close to it. Are you on track to graduate on time? How many additional credits would it take for the English degree? And the child development degree? Once you figure out how many credits and what classes you need for your BA psych, figure out what classes overlap and what classes you\u2019d have to take in order to get both the Psych/Human Development and the Psych/English. \n\nWhere I went to school at, there were a few degrees (and minors) offered at the same campus that just had so many overlaps in course requirements that 90% of the students in one of those programs either double majored or did one major and 2-3 minors. Usually it would depend on where you were your freshman year with your math/chemistry sequence and how many credits (usually from dual enrollment) you were coming in with. If you pretty much placed below trigonometry your freshman year (so that you weren\u2019t taking Chem 1) by your freshman spring or sophomore fall semester, you were pretty much either taking the courses somewhere else, doing summer semesters, or staying 5 years to complete the necessary chemistry sequence for your degree. A lot of people figured, if it only takes an additional 4 classes for an additional major, and an additional 2-3 classes for a minor, why not add it it on? For many people those additional 4-8 classes were either the rest of their schedules for their fifth year, or they would take 2 full summer semesters or 3 part time summer semesters. It would actually save money versus only taking 3 credits during a summer semester. \n\nIf you\u2019re in a kind of similar situation and you can get away with double majoring (or getting all 3 degrees) within a year, do it. If you\u2019re not, then look into maybe double majoring in human development and minoring in English. Really play around with what your options are. Couch the classes yourself and then sit down with your advisor to talk about what you currently have completed, what you want to do, and what that would realistically look like. Talk with advisors in the English department about if they ever have kids double majoring in psych and what their schedules looked like (generally), and if they graduated on time. \n\nHaving multiple undergraduate degrees (and a high gpa) makes you a better candidate for masters and professional degrees in this day and age. If you can get as many as you can while you\u2019re in school, it can really do nothing but help you with getting a job or getting into a masters program. Does having 3 BAs and being a fresh grad with no work experience give you a leg up on another fresh grad with 1 BA and 1 minor? Would it make you do the job better? Nope. Not at all. But if I look at your CV/resume and I see that you got 3 BAs in the span of 5 years, I\u2019m going to be curious. I\u2019m going to ask you about it. I\u2019m going to ask why you did it and how you did it. And if you tell me anything along the lines of \u201cwell, I have an interdisciplinary interest in the cross sections of these fields, specifically xyz topics and I absolutely busted ass to get 3 degrees in five years and still managed to play on the volleyball team and have a good gpa\u201d or \u201cI really want to work as a <career>, which the psychology degree and the human development degree would adequately prepare me for and I also really have a passion for English. I was faced with the challenge of not graduating on time with my psychology degree, so I worked with an advisor to make the best out of the situation and was able to use my extra time on campus to be able to major in human development and English as well\u201d, I\u2019m going to take away that you are hardworking, driven, able to stay organized and handle your shit, that you know what you want and are willing to bend over backwards to get it, able to handle stress, and are mature and creative enough to be able to work with your school to make an \u201cimpossible feat\u201d happen. That, and if you were picking a candidate based on just a quick summary, would \u201cA student that went to xyz school and graduated with degree 1, 2, 3 and participated in 1, 2 wanting to study with us because ___\u201d or \u201cA student who went to xyz and graduated with a BA in psych who participated in 1, 2, 3 wanting to study with us because ___\u201d sound better? It might be wrong to quickly judge without in depth candidate interviews, but I guarantee you that jobs and graduate admissions both do quickly judge based on the first glance of your application.",
