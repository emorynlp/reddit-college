Do y\u2019all have any recommendations for places I can go online to refresh what I learned in high school English so that I will be prepared for 1301?\n\nSerious answers only, please.  I don\u2019t need anyone telling me to just not go or that I\u2019m too old.\n\nEDIT:  Thank you all for the suggestions and encouragement!!",
