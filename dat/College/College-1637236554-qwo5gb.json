  "text": "Apparently people record this class when he goes over the test answers(he doesn\u2019t let you keep the tests), fail the class, then take it again the next year and just memorize the answers to each of the questions since they\u2019re the same. It makes me mad cause I\u2019m about to fail just cause this guy can\u2019t realize that his tests are just too difficult and that people are beating the system. There are only 8 people left out of the 30 that started. Shouldn\u2019t that tell him that he should be changing things? One is a prodigy with an A and then 4 or so are going off of the recordings. I don\u2019t know how the rest are doing, but I don\u2019t have the questions so I\u2019m struggling really bad. I wanna go \u201cHey, you realize people only survive this class by cheating right?\u201d But I also don\u2019t wanna be THAT person.",

Just pointing out that he doesn\u2019t seem to get why so many people do poorly. He only has tests, so the tests are the problem. But the fail rate for this class is ridiculous and he needs to take accountability for that. This isn\u2019t on the students at this point, it\u2019s on him and the school to make adjustments so that the average person can pass without cheating.",

          "text": "Yes. I get tutoring from someone that took the class before. It\u2019s not really an issue of understanding the material though. It\u2019s the amount of material he gives us and the lack of focus he puts on the material he ends up putting on the test. The last test wasn\u2019t as bad and I got an 82%. However, with his other tests, he put the most mundane things. For example, he put a ton of focus on life cycles of plants. He told us this would be important to learn and to remember it for the test. It wasn\u2019t on there. Instead he had us define random structures that he barely mentioned(some he actually didn\u2019t mention at all). And I know this cause I listen back to his lectures religiously. How am I supposed to know thats on the test if it\u2019s not even mentioned? And since there are no slides or any organization to the lectures whatsoever, how does he even remember what he told us to begin with? Aside from listening back to the lectures, I make my own lab manuals, rewrite my notes, quiz myself and have others quiz me. I honestly don\u2019t think I can do anymore than I\u2019ve already done.",
