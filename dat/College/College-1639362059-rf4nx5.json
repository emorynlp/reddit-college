  "title:": "Dad trying to get me to take 17-18 credit hours next semester. Is it too much?",
  "text": "So basically, my dad wants me to take 18 credit hours by taking on another class. The reasoning for this is that I plan on transferring to university from a community college and need to take a few extra classes on top of what I am currently doing for my associates to apply for their engineering program. The problem is that I am taking calculus 1, chemistry and a chem lab, plus an English class. On top of this I have to spend two or three hours a week on work for my program that lets me attend community college for free. This all culminates into being 14 credit hours next semester already. I also work about 20 hours a week. I feel that this will be too much if I add another class on and was wondering if you all think it would be too much at once.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the advice, I didn't expect to get so many comments. I kind of am in the same boat as most of you after reading the comments. I believe it is too much. The thing is that I completely skipped my senior year of highschool, so even if I have to take an extra semester I would graduate around the same time I would have anyway. I'll try my best to convince my dad that 14 is enough.",

Then do the second sequence the next semester. That comes out to around 17-18 cr. \n\nI got through it, plenty of others do too. Yea, some people burnout, but intro classes are not as bad as you think. \n\nGenerally engineering school requires more credits in less forgiving classes, that\u2019s just how it is. If you don\u2019t do that then you will probably fall behind and have to take an extra 2 years which will take a lot of extra money. Even if you coop an extra year it can be financially rough.\n\nSo I would consider that before giving OP your advice. Not everyone has the financial luxury to take it easy.",

It\u2019s rough, and my GPA was fine, but not the best it could be. \n\nBut also, in most engineering disciplines that\u2019s the norm in order to graduate on time. \n\nI also did a co-op in order to pay off some of my degree, (They pay $30-40 at big companies like DOW, DuPont, etc) as an upperclassman.\n\nYou can take lower course loads in engineering, but it *will* extend the cost of your degree.\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily true for other majors- and OP wanted relevant advice. Unfortunately, most ABET accredited programs try to cram 4.5 years of classes into 4 years, so you get mandatory semesters with a high courseload. Unless you want to extend graduation and pay lots of extra money it\u2019s the way these programs are structured.\n\nOP said they were thinking about engineering, and so I\u2019m letting them know how ABET accredited programs (Most reputable programs in the US) work.\n\nI\u2019m saying this as someone who went through one of those programs. :/",

      "text": "GPA (especially in major related classes) is more important than how many classes you take in q semester. I\u2019m a physics major so I take the same intro classes as engineers and they\u2019re really tough so I wouldn\u2019t recommend taking so many. Instead try and find engineering internships/shadowing/jobs. That will help you out a TON when you apply to transfer. Keep a 4.0 GPA and get some extra curricular and you\u2019re set!",

I've had some needy, abusive 3hr classes and some breezy 5hr ones.\n\nIf you're going to invest in an 18hr semester definitely do your research into the expectations of the class and the professor. Just like buying a used car. You'll want to know before you buy",

I cant imagine doing 18 credits, that's essentially an extra lab or course. Quality over quantity my guy, make sure your grades are very good, as employers hire largely based off of GPA. Some employers even throw out resumes if you didnt obtain a certain GPA. Making it extremely hard to get a job in your field",
