  "text": "Don\u2019t mean to brag but I took six classes this semester and did the best I\u2019ve ever done. This is a huge deal for me I have ADHD and depression and anxiety. I\u2019m typically an ABC student. A lot is due to the fact that life is pretty much on hold and I\u2019m in a happy relationship now but I\u2019m very proud of myself for sticking through even though I had health issues at the end and lost motivation. I was able to get through this semester by delegating each day of the week to a single class and this helped me through most of the semester. That and agonizing over every single final I had. Congrats everyone for making it through this hard core change in the world.",

      "text": "Also holy cow I did not expect this many reactions? I was just so happy for once like the anxiety still hasn\u2019t dissipated though not going to lie. My biggest tip would be dont pull all nighters all it does is fuck you up in a constant cycle. Also have structure I was working out at like 5am going to work at 9-1, then I got home focused on school work and my dogs and household stuff. But I had a really good support system in my significant other who didn\u2019t complain when I had to study or do homework and everything. My dogs however did get pissed off. I feel very moved by this support I\u2019ve had a lot of issues academically and didn\u2019t really expect to do this well ever I just hope to keep it up. I\u2019m hoping to be able to continue with my last two semesters and graduate with a pretty okay GPA. I\u2019ve definitely had it easy during Covid because I didn\u2019t lose my job and I was already an online student and whatnot because I had been part time and that was the only way I could really get through school was by being able to schedule myself but I went through a lot last year with a horrific breakup, losing my ability to transfer to another school, doing work that wasn\u2019t the best for me mentally, and going through an abusive relationship PLUS I went to jail so dang...now I feel validated for caring this much. I\u2019m a fifth year student (bc mostly part time and transferring twice paperwork issues) and I really needed something to give so I appreciate it.",
