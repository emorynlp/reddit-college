I know profs who will grade you on just the 15 pages. You would lose points for not having a conclusion etc... and one of them would even dock an extra point for each page over the limit after docking the points for the content you 'didnt include'. \n\nJust a warning, but otherwise; NICE IM SO PROUD OF YOU",
