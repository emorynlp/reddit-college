  "text": "So I was an okay student in high school, somehow got in the Law School in my country (they accept 650 people and second year in a row there was a lack of people trying to get in) I took a gap year and failed my first year with passing only 1 class out of 6, 2 seminars and 2 english classes, now im repeating my first year and im feeling like a failure, I lack motivation even tho im interested in law and politics and want to do that in my life. Im afraid that I will be a failure as a man and that i will not finish college and will not find a job. Especially now with all corona thing... I hate myself for that. My parents are apsolutely great about the whole thing, supportive as much as they can be but all my friends are doing great and than i see myself lacking so far behind that im ashamed of myself. Average time in finishing my college is about 8 years but still...\nI guess im here for advice, some encouragement\ud83d\ude2c and please share stories if you want to\u263a\ufe0f",
