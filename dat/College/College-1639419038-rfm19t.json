  "text": "I\u2019m going to a community college for two years to save money, and then plan on transferring to a university to get my bachelors. What classes should I take? Should I do classes focused in the major I want to pursue or just general studies? I want to get a computer science degree, but sadly my community college only offers a computer support class online, and I don\u2019t do very well in online learning. What should I do?",

      "text": "You might want to start with researching the 4-yr institutions you want to transfer to, and find out what type of transfer credits they accept. Depending on the major you go into, that can be a little or a lot. If you're not in a dual admissions or program-to-program agreement with a 4-yr, then you probably want to stick with the general education courses. You can also speak with advisors or transfer counselors at your current school for recommendations on classes to take, but always confirm with the 4-yr univ to make sure you're on the right path.",
