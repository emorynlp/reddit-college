  "text": "Hi guys, I have been working on an environmental website for a sort of school/university project, and would appreciate if you could check it out and contribute. Its called Environmentality, and the goal is to create a large community of students (or anyone really) who upload any written work, be it news articles or essays, to the website with no barriers attached. I thought it was a good idea to create a large community of environmental student research and a platform for support and discussion.\n\n any ideas around improving the website would also be very much appreciated.\n\n[https://environmentality.net/](https://environmentality.net/)",
