  "text": "I need to take a Physical Science course with a lab for my IGETC. I\u2019m not good with math & im not a fan of physical science so I\u2019m wondering what is the EASIEST course with a lab to take so I could pass!!? Is \u201cPhysical Geography Lab\u201deasy?? That\u2019s like my only option right now because everything else seems hard & includes math.",

      "text": "Geog major here - depends on the prof really, if you don't want much math it probably is your best bet. I don't personally like physical geography, but I don't think it's a bad option and it shouldn't be horribly difficult. \n\nWhat are you interested in? Do you know what your other options are? If it's just like chemistry and physics, then yeah, go with geography - or maybe geology if that's offered?",
