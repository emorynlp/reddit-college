  "text": "I'm trying to register for spring classes and my account has two holds. One is for volunteering (I basically forgot and still need 30 hours), the other is for not paying my tuition, but I'm on a scholarship that covers everything but books. I'm so scared that these things will ruin my college career and I'll have to pay for classes I've taken and start back at square one. My depression is so severe and I can barely function day-to-day. Please tell me I can get through this.",

      "text": "You can definitely get through this. Despite how it may seem, the college wants to see you succeed because it makes them look good. I would just talk to whoever can help you or give you an exemption for the volunteering and just talk to the cashiers office and scholarship providers about the balance to find the misunderstanding. If youre resourceful enough to get a full scholarship, this wont be the end of the world. Good luck!",
