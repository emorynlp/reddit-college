  "text": "I have a B.S. paid for with $68k in student loans and work full time. I love learning but have no interest in going to grad school because I hated college. I basically worked and took a full course load for 6 years with bipolar and undiagnosed adhd and graduated just in time. I like working full time way more than what college was like when you have to work and to to school at the same time and are broke all the time. \n\nBut sometimes I really wish I could just take some college classes for fun. There are some language classes I want to take. I want to take a painting class. I want to learn computer science. But tuition ends up being like $1300 per class out of pocket. It\u2019s insane. Even if you audit it they want you to pay for basically full tuition for it except you get no record of having taken it. You can ask professors to sit in on a class for free space permitting but many professors won\u2019t allow it and say you have to go through the formal auditing process. \n\nIt\u2019s frustrating. I mean college is way too expensive for even new students without degrees but continuing education is extremely expensive. You\u2019re not getting a degree or any class credit so why does it have to be full price? And even alums can\u2019t get discounts on tuition after we took out $$$ in loans to pay you for a degree program? But you mail me a postcard every month giving me the Oliver Twist spiel. Yeah okay.",

      "text": "Community college should be cheaper, so you should look into that for \"for fun\" learning, at least for new topics. For computer science, I recommend CS50, which is a Harvard class that is posted for free online. I took it and honestly it was way higher quality than what my local schools offered. It also taught me enough to get me some opportunities I wouldn't have otherwise had, and it was totally free.\n\nFor languages, there's Duolingo, but it's better if you can find real life people to practice speaking with. There are probably online meetups or even some relatively cheap private tutors you can get for that.\n\nFor painting, same idea. I know my local library holds a painting class that meets every Saturday for 6 weeks and it only costs $120 for the whole thing. You might be able to find something like that near you.\n\nOnce you get beyond beginner level is when you really have to dump money for the education. But as long as you just want to dabble in beginner level learning for fun, it's very likely you can find resources that are *way* cheaper than  $1300 a class.",
