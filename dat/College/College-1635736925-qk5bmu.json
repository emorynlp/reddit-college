  "text": "I\u2019m going to graduate in May. I fantasize about the ceremony a lot. Because I\u2019m proud of myself and I think it\u2019ll be rewarding. I want to participate in all the fun trends and traditions. But I\u2019d unfortunately be losing out on a lot of money at work, since I won\u2019t be paid. And it\u2019s not close by. When I think about it, I\u2019m really excited about it. And I know my parents are, too. But some days I feel like I might just want to forget about it, and just have a party. At least I\u2019d still have the feeling of relief from finally being done. I\u2019m not really sure what to do. So just wondering, have any of you skipped out on your ceremony for any reason and then regretted it? (Or not)",

      "text": "I skipped my graduation, and have 0 regrets. \n\nThroughout high school the whole \"walking across the stage\" thing was so fantasized about since it would be a symbolic ending to an era. But honestly, each person's journey throughout high school is different and there is no one right way to end it. \n\nSitting for two hours and walking across the stage with the crowd half bored to get a piece of paper wasn't something that I personally \\*really\\* wanted to experience. Instead I chose to go out and celebrate with family and a few close friends. \n\nIf money is more important then go to work, if you believe these pictures are more important then go to graduation. If you really want to celebrate then throw a party like you mentioned- that way 10 years from now you won't have any regrets from not celebrating the end of high school one way or another.",

      "text": "I haven\u2019t graduated college yet, but I did graduate high school. I skipped my high school graduation. I did it for a good reason, I got accepted into a really good out-of-state university, and for various reasons, I had to move away before the graduation ceremony. At first, I thought nothing about it. It didn\u2019t really bothered me because I got into a school that literally nobody else in my high school made it in. So I had a sense of pride, and in my mind, it was \u201cworth it\u201d having to miss my graduation. But, when I saw the pictures of my friends and classmates in social media, I almost broke down in tears. I felt so depressed. I was legitimately really sad. I saw all the parties, the ceremony, I saw everyone\u2019s big smile on their faces. I felt really sad I wasn\u2019t there to experience that. \n\nI know high school is way, way different than college. But maybe you can find this story somewhat relatable. \nThe decision is ultimately yours. I hope you weight the pros and cons and take into account what is it that you really want. \n\n:)",

Didn\u2019t even put on my cap and gown, and I got my diploma in the mail. The day that I was supposed to walk the stage with my four hundred other seniors, I was at work making pizzas. This goes to say that I\u2019m really looking forward to my college graduation. But if you don\u2019t really care about the sentiments and stuff, you should just skip it. Just knowing that you complete college is gonna feel awesome.",

I felt this way since I knew I was just going to do more school, so I am not really \"done\" with school.\n\nI am about to graduate college (hopefully) and don't really want to go to graduation (especially since my department does not have a major specific graduation). If my graduation was just the science majors ( I am chemistry) I would go since I would know the profs and students. Personally, I would rather just go out to eat with my family or have like a big dinner at my house. Idk though, I will have to see what my parents want.",
