  "title:": "Roommate refuses to lock the dorm door",
  "text": "My roommate REFUSES to lock our dorm door, I\u2019m a band member and own multiple instruments, an expensive computer, monitor, iPad and more. The other day I opened my door to find a person I had never seen before standing in the middle of my room, I said \u201chey man!\u201d And the rando said \u201chey!\u201d And bolted past me, out the door and down the hallway to the elevators. I told my roommate about this and he just says \u201che probably just had the wrong room\u201d I have confronted my roommate 3 or 4 times and I told him he has to lock the door, today over snapchat this was his word for word message he sent \u201cDude I\u2019ve already been here a year and me and my buddies know everyone on this floor nothings getting stolen bud. You can lock it that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m not going to\u201d this got me absolutely fuming, I feel like I\u2019m about to explode and I feel the moment he enters the room I\u2019m going to go berserk. The RA has been gone for the past couple days including today so I have nobody to turn to. Any tips? On both calming me down and getting him to lock the door, I don\u2019t feel like having to pay what would be equal to another year of college if my instruments get stolen, not to mention the sentimental value of them from the generations before me that passed them down.\n\nEdit: is there anyway to get him kicked out of my room? If it helps, A few days I found his secret stash of Busch Light, and he vapes like crazy when I\u2019m not around, when I go into the room from a day full of classes, it reeks like burning sugar.\n\nEdit: I do have a description of the random who was in my room before and his shirt had a last name on the back I\u2019ll definitely bring that up with my RA\n\nEdit: I gotta get to sleep and it\u2019s nearly 1:00, I got a class at 9:00, I\u2019ll save the sleep deprivation for exams later in the year, thanks for the sound tips, and the funny things you guys are saying in the comments. you guys rock..... and roll. See y\u2019all in the morning.\n\nUpdate: I have set an appointment with the RD today at noon, it is currently 10:00. At first they said he wasn\u2019t available today, until I brought up that it was a security issue. They said it needs to get resolved immediately so they are making an exception. Wish me luck on making my case, I\u2019ll update you guys on what happens\n\nUpdate: my RD said that I need to file a police report and have the police talk to my roommate directly, also they are going to expedite the moving process and get him out of my room within a week, also spotted my RA at lunch and he said he is going to take care of it immediately.\n\nUpdate: Police said they are going to talk to the RD to set up a talk to make sure he locks the door, in the meantime while they get the move paper work finalized. I don\u2019t think he is going to be very happy about the police showing up at our door, but that\u2019s the price you pay when you don\u2019t have respect for others.\n\nGUYS, FINAL UPDATE: My roommate is moving out tomorrow, officially, 1 floor down. I am ecstatic thanks for all of your guys\u2019 help!",

      "text": "I can\u2019t believe you are not embarrassed to be posting about having an issue with vaping... is that how soft our younger generations have become? You are in college it\u2019s time you take that massive stick you\u2019ve had wedged up your arse since high school and live and let live. I seriously can\u2019t wrap my head around how someone vaping around you rattles you. All you gotta do is place a cheap camera in your room and activate it when you leave so if anything ever goes missing you simply reference to video of that day and file a complaint or whatever against the person seen stealing on your camera. \n\nI highly encourage you to try with all your little boy strength might and be a laid back easy going cool dude. Use the camera and avoid complaining to the RA and those above him. You\u2019ll isolate yourself as \u201cthat douche\u201d and spend the next 4 years trying to shake that reputation you made for yourself the first month of freshman year. Trust me when I say that even though many things are forgotten about over time, no one forgets who the snitch bitch is.",

I wanted anything I could for a leg up, I never snitched on him for vaping or drinking, I simply told the staff about him not locking the door, and they told me to go to the police.

Contact the head office anyone and let them know what is going on and that you must change rooms immediately. If they don't cooperate, seriously, seriously consider changing schools, they don't deserve your tuition. Anything that does get stolen I would take to legal resorts for lost of money. This is not cool, but agian, I must stress not to do anything irrational such as blowing up, keep it to yourself, you don't want him to use anything against you.",

When I told them to just, you know, lock the damn door they would always say, \"Oh my God man just relax random strangers aren't going to walk in through the door\" or \"Our neighborhood is safe relax\". The amount of times I'd wake up at 6am just to see the door unlocked drove me crazy. On a few occasion, our door would even be wide open. \n\nThis is just some next level laziness. How some people are unable to do something as basic as locking the door is beyond me. I'm so glad I'm out of that place.",

      "text": "it seems like you got this resolved, but I'll echo what other people have said, and that's that even at 'safer' schools shit still gets stolen. I go to a small (~2500 undergrads) historically women's college with small dorms (mine last year had about 65 students, so we knew everyone who lived in the building) and there was still shit stolen. someone went around to my floor last year trying to steal medications (only antipsychotics and super ibuprofen actually got stolen). I know someone in a different dorm that got electronics stolen from their room. Another person had her seizure meds stolen a couple years ago, so she always locks her door, but her closet was outside of her room last year (yay old ass houses, theres a lock for that too but who tf is gonna lock their closet) and someone targeted her and threw all of her stuff around her closet to send her a message. \n\nNow, I still don't usually lock my door. I just dont have anything in my dorm room that I think is worth stealing, and nothing of super sentimental value. but still, last year, when all of this shit was going down, my roommate and I still had an agreement that if we either of us felt uncomfortable leaving it unlocked, we would try our best to lock our door. It's a shared space and something like security isn't something that you can really compromise on. Your roommate clearly doesn't respect you or your ability to feel comfortable in your personal living space, and I'm glad your res life staff is helping you to address the situation. if they start to stall on your roommate moving out, I would request an immediate relocation. just logistically it's a lot easier and faster to move a willing party (you) than an unwilling one (your roommate).",

If you have car insurance, call your company up. If you don\u2019t, ask your parents to see if the insurance company they use offers it.  There\u2019s independent companies that offer it and it\u2019s pretty check. Just make sure that you get one with a low deductible. It will cover theft and damages.

I always locked the door whenever I left, especially because I experienced a burglary when I was young. The girls would text me while I was in class or at work saying that I locked them out and demanded that I get home ASAP to unlock the door. They refused to lock the door or take their apartment keys with them anywhere. Why, I\u2019ll never know. I talked to my RA about it. She offered to come to my apartment and talk to my roommates, but they went to their room and pretended not to be home every time the RA came by to discuss locking doors. The RA told me that because we were all legally adults, she couldn\u2019t force my roommates to talk to her, so I was SOL unless I switched rooms. \n\nKeep the lines of communication open with your RA, but also know that they may not be able to change your roommate\u2019s behavior or even speak to your roommate. Start a discussion about changing rooms now, as it can be a lengthy process. Good luck!",

My school is considered pretty safe, so it\u2019s very common for people to leave doors unlocked when they leave for the day or even when they go to sleep. One time, a girl woke up to a guy standing at the foot of her bed at 3 AM. He left when she told him to, and was arrested at the dorm\u2019s front entrance when he tried to leave. We\u2019ve also had strings of thefts (laptops, electronics, etc) when people take advantage of those who leave their doors unlocked. \n\nSit down with your roommate. Confronting someone over text/virtually does nothing. Talk to him very seriously about this matter, and why it\u2019s not all about him, it\u2019s about you too. You may want to also include the term: if anything of mine gets stolen because you left the door unlocked, you pay. Tell him you\u2019ll get an RA/administrator involved if he doesn\u2019t at least try to make an effort (breaking old habits is hard). Don\u2019t be a dick and rat him out for something completely unrelated (drinking/vaping). This is also not an issue for campus police. This is an interperson, roommate issue that can be resolved either between the two of you or possibly with an RA/reslife third party.",

Initially I was going to tell you to try to work it out but it sounds like you've already been making that effort and it's gotten nowhere, so next I would do is bring it to the RA since your roommate clearly doesn't respect your wishes (and likely doesn't respect you, either).",
