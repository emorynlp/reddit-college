  "text": "I\u2019m feeling really nervous about life after graduation. Next year will be my fifth and final year of college, and I\u2019m not quite sure what to think about that. I\u2019m excited, but it\u2019s also concerning. The job market is difficult and I don\u2019t feel ready to jump straight into graduate school. \n\nIt\u2019s also weird to think that most of us have been in school for 17-18 years straight. I\u2019ve never really had a year without school.",

      "text": "This is a bit of a different perspective here since I'm 38 and recently getting back into schooling, but I had that same moment that stopped me in my tracks at the end of high school. I didn't think anything about life after school until graduation night. I was driving home and thinking about what I should do the next day, and it suddenly dawns on me that this isn't just the weekend or summer vacation; this is the rest of my life now! In that moment it just all collapsed on me: Why didn't I plan ahead better? I should have been trying to get into college all this time. What am I going to do for money? Do I have to join the military now? How do I choose a place to live? ...holy crap, how do you even pay bills!?!?!? It's daunting, it's huge, and it's scary. The only jobs I'd had were your then typical teenage spending money jobs like pizza delivery and a video store. How do you even go about getting a real job!?\n\nI felt wildly unprepared for the real world. And back in 2001, the internet wasn't nearly the prolific beast that it is now, so I couldn't just Google \"how to boil a pot of water\". (Unrelated but awkward story; my first time cooking meat for myself, I cooked using a pot instead of a pan because I really didn't know any better.)\n\nSo what got me to where I am now? I had a lot of learning and feeling out the real world to do. I was a crappy employee for my first couple 'real' jobs because I didn't know a thing about self-discipline. I had to have a supervillain of a boss tear me down so that I knew that you couldn't get away with calling off all the time and screwing around on the job. That probably sounds awful, but I feel privileged for the experience. because it helped shape my work ethic. I had a lot of downs living in bad neighborhoods, having drug-addicted roommates, developing panic disorder, blowing about a decade on a dead-end career path, and wasting a few years on a marriage that meant nothing to me. There were quite a few ups like making a lot of money for someone that was barely educated and wildly inexperienced, getting jobs that were steady and secure. It was a lot of luck, but a lot of my saving grace was my parents. They were young and stupid once as well, so when I goofed up, they were there to catch me because they had experienced their own stupidities that needed help. My dad helped where he could, but my mom especially was this powerful force of a woman that could sense when I was in real trouble and knew the right thing to say.\n\nBut here's the real secret of it: I've got a steady career in local government, I've been back in school for a couple years, I'm married to the person that was the best possible fit for me, I have hobbies that I've had enviable successes with, and I'm generally pretty happy. But twenty years after high school, and I still feel like an impostor. I'm still just winging it in a lot of ways, and I don't feel that I've really hit adulthood yet.\n\nTL;DR: It's scary, and it will always be at least a little scary, but with some help, you'll find your way through the real world and settle in. It's not easy, it's not quick, it's not painless, but it will happen.",

It took me 6 six years (straight, no summer breaks due to summer classes and research) to finish undergrad and was also nervous as heck about life after college. I was premed at the time and with a lot of effort and patience, I was able to get in, but not until 2 years after I graduated. A lot of what happens after college depends on many factors as many peeps here know (area of study, established networks, history of internships, etc). Taking a break does provide a step away from school, and what you do with it does matter. Maybe you just don't want to do anything, that's fine, enjoy it. Maybe you seek other personal goals, cool! or take time to reflect on your journey so far, great! all those are great options. Best advice it to continue exploring what your passions are and use that introspection to guide you to new goals.",

I always thought about once I graduate college, no more exams no more studying and no more school. But after a while you start to miss it and things just don\u2019t seem right. You have to get used to working all day everyday for the rest of your life, you feel like you\u2019re just working and working and working to make it through. So much to the point where you may feel like you don\u2019t have any friends anymore. A lot of people may go on to move to a big new city to start their career but loneliness takes it\u2019s toll. You\u2019re so used to having your friends all right down the block from you or just right down the hall and it\u2019s not like that anymore. For most of our lives, we have always used school as a way to measure our progress and achievements and success. And that all is taken away once college is over and you just feel empty inside. It\u2019s a thing that is hard to get used to at first but you just have to focus on ways to really take care of yourself. What hit me was the fact that I felt like I was no where near to the point where I \u201cshould\u201d be. I\u2019m surrounded by family that graduated college, then got married to their college sweethearts, started a life together, had kids down the road and live happily ever after. Well that didnt apply to me. And I grew up with all these expectations that when I couldn\u2019t meet them, it put me into a depression. There\u2019s a lot that contributes to post college life and being aware of it sooner rather than right as it\u2019s happening may help you learn to cope better.",

This applies primarily to PhD programs, but some MA programs can be fully funded as well.

It was difficult at first for sure (but I\u2019m going to blame that on graduating during the panic covid shutdown semester). \n\nI lived at home for a few months, worked at Kroger for a bit while looking for a job, and then found a full time job in my field that I enjoy. I moved out and I now live with a friend. We\u2019re in a new town, meeting new people, and in general enjoying life! I\u2019m reconnecting with hobbies that I had to put to the side due to school and I\u2019m finding new things that I enjoy. \n\nNot having school has done wonders for my mental health too. I can\u2019t remember a time when I was this laid back and not constantly panicked or worried about something. Leaving school is so much more than getting a job and a career, it\u2019s also about finding new hobbies and new ways to enjoy life. \n\nDo your best to enjoy this last year of school, study hard, do your best, but take time to have fun and make memories.",

Salaried jobs have times they are working and your boss should not bother you by a certain hour. At my job the boss says you are done when you are done and tells people not to go out of their way to work when their full day is done unless they select overtime. Yours is just the issue I was talking about where someone would get bothered all day, which is the type of job I would personally avoid. Or you are a lawyer or freelance writer who works whenever you want, but you still basically pick your free time by how many clients or writings you take on at once.",

So after college when you are looking for a job, there\u2019s nothing else for me to worry about. Which means i have free time from ~7.30 am when i wake up, to ~11 pm when i go to sleep. \n\nAfter that, it depends on your job. My brother is a programmer working 9-5 from home, but some days he has time to read books or play the guitar, after work hours he always has the energy to hangout with his friends or do other things. Another friend has his own business working from 6 am to 6 pm so he doesn\u2019t have much free time besides weekends.",
