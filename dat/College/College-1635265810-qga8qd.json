I don\u2019t need a job and my parents don\u2019t want me to get one however i know i will run low on funds i have saved over the summer for the school year. \ni just want a little extra spending money maybe work 2-3 days a week? do college towns offer jobs that do stuff like that",

I work three shifts a week right now (21ish hours, sometimes more when they need me) and I think have 17-18 credit hours in school. \n\nBut also, I've been working while doing school for a while. In high school I had 30 hours of work during the school year and 40+ in the summer. I am used to this. It really depends on your goals, your ability, and your personality. \n\nI used work as an escape from home, and some part of me still does. Nowadays I spend most of my time in the engineering building or library on campus so I'm not at my dorm except for when sleeping or playing video games. \n\nAdditionally, I'm not in a college town but both jobs were on the outskirts of campus. So they aren't \"on campus\" jobs by definition, but pretty much. Both were/are food service, which I don't recommend but it's ok.",

Do it. Just don\u2019t work full-time and school full-time. That takes a lot out of you and you\u2019ll start to slack in one or the other, or both. Just find a job that\u2019ll let you work between 15-20 hours, and call it good. Work the days you don\u2019t have class, or the least amount of classes/workload cause then it\u2019s less worry and hassle.",
