  "text": "Upon looking at Vanderbilt\u2019s admission criteria, one of the things they look at is \u201crigor of secondary school.\u201d I don\u2019t fully understand this and need help. I am thinking about applying to a local High School, Arkansas School for Mathematics, Science, and the Arts. It is the best high school in Arkansas and is ranked top 30 in the nation. As it is a hard school, it will definitely lower my GPA from a 4.0 to somewhere around a 3.85, but will colleges such as Vanderbilt recognize the harder school and harder rigor and understand that\u2019s why my GPA is lower or should I stay at my current public High School that\u2019s ranked in the top 10 of Arkansas and maintain my 4.0",

      "text": "Honestly a college can't control what high school you go to. It's not really the school that matters, but more so what courses you take there. When they say \"rigor\" they mean taking AP classes, or doing Dual Enrollment. Stuff like that. They just want you to take advantage of what's offered at whatever high school you attend",

          "text": "This is sound advice, but the ASMSA is going to provide more opportunities that blossom describes. The ASMSA likely sends a higher % of students to university and likely has better SAT/ACT prep resources, as well. It\u2019s basically a college prep school.\n\nHere\u2019s something that is puzzling me: Why would your GPA go down? \n\nPersonally, I would contact Vanderbilt Admissions and ask them the same question.",

      "text": "I don't know any specifics about Vandy, but I think your situation is probably exactly what \"rigor of secondary school\" applies to - if you have a somewhat less competitive (but still good) GPA and you went to a selective school with a more rigorous curriculum, you'll still be a competitive applicant compared to someone with the same GPA with a less rigorous background.\n\nI think the rigor of your *coursework* is more important than where you actually go to school. Like, it's also fine to stay at your regular school and take a college prep curriculum (AP, etc.).",
