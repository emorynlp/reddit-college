  "title:": "Going back to college to get a second BA",
  "text": "Hi, \n\nSo long story short I am a 22 year old Male who graduated from a low tier college with a biology and chemistry B.S. (GPA 3.65) I was in medical school but took a semester off from the remainder of my first year. The reason why I did this is simply because I learned a little to late that I did not want to become a doctor. My skills, my traits, and my likes all point me towards going to a business college grinding my ass off and trying to get a job in that field, (Finance/Economics) I cant shake the feeling that I wasted my time, and my last 4 years studying something I did not want to study due to societal and cultural pressures. I am at a cross roads of do I go back to medical school next year, or do I try to go back to college to get a degree in finance. I don't know what I would/Should do or if I should get a masters, or a second bachelors. I need help and advice lol",

      "text": "MBAs are always looking for non-business/finance majors to apply. I'd try that route. Typically, MBAs *also* like people with real-world professional experience, even if it's just entry office work. Working in an office for a year or two would also tell you a lot about whether or not you would like that sort of work environment.",
