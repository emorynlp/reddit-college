  "text": "Doing this for calc 2 and intro to comp sci. I am expected to finish the entire syllabus in early to mid November, thus yielding me a full month to prepare for the final exam. I found a source bank and can use the materials there to complete self study. With a full month to prepare for the final exam, instead of just over a week for most peers, I can truly master the content and get an A range easily. \n\nI am doing this as I saw that my calc 2 prof gave bad grades to so many students last year. I have a different mind, so I will solve this instead of getting stuck with a bad grade. When others are struggling to get a B, I will cruise to an A.\n\nAre you doing this as well?\n\nI am aiming for that sweet spot of 3.5 GPA as it is ranked top 100 in the entire faculty, and each major has more than 100 places, so a 3.5 guarantees your first choice.",
