  "text": "I (18m) feel like I\u2019m lonely a lot and crave some intimacy in my life, but in college it seems like the hookup culture is everything. The idea of a hookup doesn\u2019t really intrigue me but I do still want to know how it feels to have an intimate connection. So because of this what course of action do I take? Do I force myself to shove my desire for love away, and admit defeat and understand I\u2019ll be lonely through college? Or is there a place to go or a way to approach someone, maybe a friend, maybe not with discussing what I want? Also am I alone in feeling like this? And would it be a good idea to disconnect from the barstool at my school where they post about hookups a lot?",

Don't try to fit what someone else wants, that's just a recipe for disaster. \n\nI met my husband in college at 18. I took him to the zoo on the first date and told him about how dolphins form rape gangs and sometimes drown female dolphins. The next date I told him I don't want kids and we had a long discussion about societal expectations and why he assumed everyone just has kids. \n\nWell, now we're married, he took me home after I got sterilized, and we love going bird watching together because I have a million facts and he has a million questions. Your person will love you for you and you will love your person for who they are. Just give it time and don't assume every relationship is \"it\" because it may take some time.",

My personal opinion is that you should hold out to share those experiences with someone with whom you share a deep intimate connection with, not just some random person at a party\u2026..having tasted both fruits, sharing something like that with someone you truly love and care about feels much better and seeds an even deeper connection than wasting your first experiences with someone you don\u2019t care about and who is essentially using you for some personal pleasure. If I have learned anything from my life experiences, it\u2019s that it\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about that other person and doing something to please them. I don\u2019t give a shit about what I feel, I want to make them have a good time and the other person should do the same so it creates a symbiotic relationship of mutual enjoyment and pleasure. Most likely a hookup will not do that for you. After ending a 2 year relationship with the love of my life who we both experienced everything together for the first time and then thinking that random hookups will make me happy after we split made me realize how important that connection is\u2026..there was no feeling, there was no love, and there was no passion. There was no point of doing it anymore and from that moment on I realized what type of person I am and it\u2019s not the hookup type. I also realized that there is nothing more In this world that made me happier than her, and I would do anything to have her be mine again, forever\u2026.. Sorry to go on this rant but I promise you, everything happens for a reason, yes it may suck that you have not gotten to experience intimate things with someone else yet but don\u2019t force it. Like I said before, the best things happen when you aren\u2019t expecting it. And I promise you, coming from a guy, the things you said are desirable traits, at least in my own opinion. It shows that you value yourself and show value to intimate activities. So hang in there, use my mistakes as a lesson of what not to do. Or completely ignore what I said and make your own choice, whatever you choose, Just make certain that it\u2019s the right one for you and no one else. Don\u2019t let the \u201cpressure of college\u201d persuade you to change your values, take hold and don\u2019t let go. Good things are on the horizon, there is someone out there for you who feels the same and will be everything you could ever want and more, and you will thank yourself for waiting on a relationship to explore the beauty of intimacy.",

In the meantime, love yourself, love your neighbor, go have fun, experience new things, meet new people, focus on the present and most importantly you.

And actually surprisingly it seems like now in my late twenties, it is more prevalent if people aren't married. Like if people already have careers and live independently just want companionship and sex and don't want to the work of a relationship. \n\nI've been in a relationship for a long time and if I were to end up single again I think that would be me.\n\nAnyway I'm trying to say that I think there are a lot more girls who are interested in having a relationship at your age than you think.",

      "text": "Hookup culture, honestly, is some \u201cvocal minority\u201d type shit. Almost everyone is looking for their person, and a lot of people do hook ups just kinda because they\u2019re fun, spontaneous, and they can, all fine and dandy with consenting adults. Don\u2019t look at it in a \u201cI can\u2019t find dates because of this\u201d way because the two are unrelated. \n\nHonestly? It takes time for you to find the right person. You\u2019re not gonna have meaningful connections with a majority of the people you see everyday, and that\u2019s okay. Love is very fleeting, when you don\u2019t have it, you really want it, and when you have it, some people take it for granted. You learn how much a relationship really entails. The care and attention you have to put into your relationship and person, having to be a solid and reliable person. \n\nI\u2019m not suggesting that you have a problem with this, but get comfortable with the idea that you can potentially be alone. You\u2019re still in college, so you have a lot of growing to do as a person, and in your professional career. Maybe join a new club and talk to more people? Really try to get yourself out there and make connections with people. If one person doesn\u2019t like you, oh well, they\u2019re nobody to you and you\u2019re nobody to them. You have to be comfortable with yourself for other people to be comfortable around you. Being a reliable person draws people towards you. I\u2019m not the most attractive person, but I\u2019ve been in a few relationships at this point, enough to know that looks are really low on the relationship-worthiness scale. Obviously, be clean and well kept, but you don\u2019t have to be Brad Pitt to get a date. \n\nAnd I mean this with no offense, but it kinda sounds like you\u2019re starved of personal interaction. Try to spend time with people who make you feel valuable. Hug your friends, physical touch, not even in an intimate way, goes a long way towards making you feel better. Get involved with things that genuinely matter to you. Find out who your best self really is, because they\u2019ll be necessary in a relationship.",

I was in the same position as you as a freshman and I have been lonely throughout college and gave in to the hookup culture a few times (surprise, I was right, not my thing). I\u2019m a 5th year now and the idea of a random hookup repulses me but the idea of dating kinda does too lmao, but that\u2019s just the people at my school. \n\nIt seems like your options are to indulge in hookup culture or just wait for someone interesting to come along. If you don\u2019t want something to just be a hookup (if it\u2019s someone you\u2019ve been talking to or something) let them know. They may not like it but it probably saves you both a headache in the future. In the meantime, as others say, work on yourself. Work on your career development and education. Join clubs and make friends and lean into those connections, and usually the more intimate connections will follow. If you really want to get going now you could start perusing Tinder and Bumble for dates rather than hookups because those people do exist, even if they\u2019re rare. There\u2019s nothing wrong with how you feel, though. I just suggest being patient for now. You just started college and it takes time for things to get going for most people.",

I basically have determined that I missed out on having fun during my college years because I was dedicated to a cheating whore.  There was a girl in my dorm next door that was so attractive in so so many ways.  She literally bought me a bottle of lotion and a birthday card for my birthday...like I knew she wanted me(in my dreams lol) but I didn't want to ruin anything with my current girlfriend...dedication - It's not fun.  It appears to me that when you give someone your all, they don't like it.  They want space but if you can't trust them then how can you sit around while they are out running the streets...every guy was a threat.  \n\nI'm not controlling at all and the relationship ended with me bawling my eyes out and having to move out of her apartment.  As I'm moving out over Christmas break I see the present packages she has exchanged with her new man.  I lived in some illusion that she was actually in love with me.  This was not the case.  \n\nNow of course hooking up is not the greatest choice.  For a guy it's a good time but I understand that women really want loyal relationships, and most guys are assholes these days.",

However there is also a small percentage that I believe would have preferred to only have one sexual partner, but ended up seeing sex as something less tied to love and affection. \nFor example, somebody who's first sexual experience was assault or rape, likely has their entire view of sex warped for the rest of their lives from what it may have otherwise been. Likewise, someone who's first experience of sex was with multiple partners in hookup culture, may likely view sex in the same capacity for the rest of their life, as something carnal for ego and fun experiences.",
