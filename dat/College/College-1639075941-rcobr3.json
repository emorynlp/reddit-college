  "title:": "Is it typical for finals to not have any sort of review?",
  "text": "For one class I have a final for today, I\u2019ve been trying my best to study but I have no idea if I\u2019m doing it right. All I know about the final is that it\u2019s over everything (no shit) and that the format is the same as past tests.\n\nThe issue is I\u2019m not allowed to look at my past test just know my grade so I don\u2019t know what I got wrong or why. Most of my homework assignments have yet to even be graded as well. The test review we had for the last test were useless since they didn\u2019t follow test format and most questions weren\u2019t even over what the test was about!\n\nHow would you guys study for this in my situation? All I have is a notebook full of lecture notes that I\u2019ve been pouring over.\nThe subject is mechanics too if that helps.",

It is annoying that the professor hasn't graded homework though, so you don't have much to go off of. Definitely annoying given the lack of feedback, but otherwise not abnormal. Best of luck!",
