  "text": "Last week I wrote a paper on the ideologies of Karl Marx and Mary Wollstonecraft and felt very good about it. However, after I submitted it I realize that I cited quotes from Wollstonecraft\u2019s book called The Vindication of the Rights of Woman incorrectly. While I got all my quotes from the book, it was not the edition that was assigned to our class because I was not able to pay for it (it was quite expensive) so I was able to get a copy online for a much lower price. The difference is that it was not an edited version, which the one assigned to our class was, and due to the Chicago style citation format we had to cite both the author and editor. I cited both, but the issue is that the edition I got my quotes from did not have this editor, which was just a blatant mistake on my part. \n\nI am also concerned because one of my Karl Marx quotes was a bit long.\n\nAm I overthinking this? Will they check to see if every citation is perfectly on point? It\u2019s a giant class. I\u2019m just very worried about this",
