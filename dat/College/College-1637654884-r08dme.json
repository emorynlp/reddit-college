  "text": "I don't know why it seems like it's ten times harder for me to do things compared to others. I feel like I'm just being lazy but it genuinely takes so much energy out of me to do the simplest things.\n\nI can't even do my homework without having a mental breakdown halfway through from feeling incompetent.\n\nI just am so angry and upset at myself right now and it's 2am on my 19th birthday and I've been doing the same assignment for 7 hours and I'm still not done. I was doing pretty good for a while but I'm so exhausted and I feel like I can't do it but I'm already doing so badly in the class that I need an A on this assignment in order to pass.\n\nI don't have the brain capacity to finish but I know I have to. \n\nI'm literally sitting here sobbing and I don't know how to focus. Everyone in my house is already asleep and I don't know what to do.\n\nAlso I know it probably sounds like I'm just being dramatic but I'm really all over the place right now and I don't know how to fix it.",

Personally, it can take me 4 hours just to write a whole discussion post.\n\nAs I see it, it doesn\u2019t matter how you get from A to B so long as you put in your best effort to get there. Just keep your head up and keep pushing forward. All the hard work will be worth it in the end.",
