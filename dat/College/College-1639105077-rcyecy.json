  "text": "I am currently a junior and struggling in a business Statistics class. I am also a honor roll student and have all As and Bs. I have only received one C in my three years of college and that was my freshmen year. But, currently I have a 72.5% in my business stats class. The only grades we have left is our last excel assignment and the final, which is 20% of our overall grade. The only reason I am struggling is because of my teacher. Funny enough she was the teacher that gave me my only C freshmen year! I know  not the only one struggling as over the last 3 exams we have had, the average score was a 50ish%. \n\nIf I do end up failing this class, how badly will it affect me?",
