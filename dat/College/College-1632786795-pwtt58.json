  "text": "Tomorrow, a group of students, including me, from our Major will represent the department in a college event. The event is targeted towards freshmen and we decided to bake some brownies to welcome them. \n\nThe idea is to leave some of them to the Faculty office for the Professors. But there is one Professor (students love him) that due to the pandemic stays usually in class to avoid contact. \n\nWould it be weird to leave some brownies in the classroom for him to find them once he enters?",
