      "text": "You transferred from CC to UCLA and now want to transfer to Davis? Besides being miserable, is there a reason? All this transferring is just going to make graduation harder if you lose credits. Lots of transfers (and major changes) are a good way to rack up student debt and you still have to string together enough credits to get a degree",
