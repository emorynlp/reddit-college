  "title:": "Should I Go to My Lectures?",
  "text": "As the title suggests, is it worth going to lectures in college? This is referring 2021, not decades ago when class content was exclusive to \"being there live\". I have read the arguments of many retired professors and millennials pushing their opinions about how important attendance is, but I honestly feel that their stances boil down to: \"This is the way it has always been, I had to go through it, it makes sense that you should to.\" But with the technological accessibility that was discovered through last year's quarantine, it's no longer \"the way it has always been.\"\n\nAll three of my courses upload recorded lectures from \\*within the lecture halls\\* an hour or so after the actual lecture happens. It's analogous to an archived stream from Twitch; nothing is left out between being there or watching it after (other than potentially interacting with the streamer/professor).\n\nTo reiterate, I am not skipping classes because I don't like college or because I am lazy. I find myself incredibly unmotivated to take notes during a live lecture as I feel rushed and slow.  Ever since the first week I attended live (after which I stayed in my dorm), I have been watching these lectures as if I were in class, but setting the video to x1.75 speed and taking notes on every bit of information from the slides and the professor.\n\nSide note: These classes have +300 students in massive lecture halls; there is no real \"connection\" to be made with the professors during lectures. I strive to make these connections, but I do so during their office hours.\n\nI realize I may have answered my own question, \"recorded lectures work better for me; it depends on each person,\" but I wanted to hear what you guys had to say, those attending live lectures and those not.",

      "text": "It depends a lot on the professor and the school.\n\nI go to a small school. My absences are very noticeable. While I learn well online, I try my best to attend classes, either remotely or in-person.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve had the odd class that I had to take and absolutely was unable to go to, for various reasons (so far, two, out of my three years of collage), and in my other classes, my attendance isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s there.\n\nWith the ones I didn\u2019t attend, I did not bug the teacher for any help whatsoever. I taught myself the course, did the work, showed up for tests and completed assignments ahead of time.\n\nOne professor didn\u2019t care; I did well.\n\nThe other, currently, is threatening to report me to the chair. I am currently 23% above class average on both assignments and the first midterm, however, so I have not heard anything since his threat- I think he decided not to, because I was doing so well, the chair would do nothing. That being said, I better do *damn* well in that class because I am risking being barred from the final exam (as per school policy).\n\nIt is worth noting for these two classes above, there was no alternative online \u201cdo it yourself\u201d option.\n\nIt\u2019s a risk you ultimately have to choose for yourself to take or not take\u2026 but don\u2019t be rude about it. If you\u2019re not going to go, don\u2019t bother the professor with any questions because chances are, he will lose all respect for you. If you need help, *go*.",

      "text": "This depends a lot on the university and class imo. How big is the class? If it's a giant 400-person lecture, it's easier to skip than if it's a 25-person class. For small classes, even if attendance isn't officially required, if you never go, the prof will probably notice and you might not get as much benefit of the doubt if you're on the borderline between grades, need to request an extension, etc. Basically showing up gives a better impression and can be useful if you need them to have a positive opinion of you for some reason (or maybe want to ask to do research with them). But if it's a 400-person lecture hall, nobody will notice or care, unless they take attendance or use things like in-class quizzes to measure participation (which it sounds like yours doesn't).",

              "text": "That makes sense to me. If it's a huge class, they're not requiring attendance, and they provide all needed materials online, it's possible the prof is actually totally fine with you not showing up in person. Just make sure to keep up with the online lectures and not fall behind much. The big pitfall with watching recorded lectures is that, with in-person lectures you have to go to them at certain spaced periods, but with recorded lectures you could end up procrastinating. I know people who try to watch 1/2 of a semester of lectures the day before the midterm, which is not recommended!!\n\nThings are especially weird now, where we're sorta-kinda still in a pandemic but not to the same extent as last year. Some profs want everyone to be back in person and to return as much as possible to 2019 norms. But some profs actually don't feel fully comfortable teaching really large in-person classes, and are only doing it because their administration told them they have to, so they have no choice in the matter. In that case, they might actually prefer if you *don't* go to class! But they wouldn't be allowed to tell you that directly without contradicting official university policy.",

We have numbers for this.\n\nInvariably, the people with 50\u2019s have missed the most classes , dont attend class and dont do the assignments.  Invariably the people with the best grades and the best understanding come to class and participate in that class.\n\nLectures are not for making \u201cconnections\u201d they are for getting the stuff explained to you, doing problems step by step etc.\n\nmany students say that somethign works for them, nay, INSIST that something works for them, but it is not in fact working for them.  So you should take with a grain of salt how much recorded lectures \u201cwork\u201d for people. \n\nI have logs of people passive watching the pre-recorded lectures like 5 times.  They think this \u201cworks\u201d for them, but it is not. They are not doing well in the class and they don\u2019t know the material and it is a massive time sink.\n\nYou are also learning other skills that are invaluable if you practice doing stuff like taking notes in live lectures.  Like how to prep for this to maximize the bang for your buck, how to think about the stuff and mange to keep track of it at the same time.  And how to go back after the lecture and fix and complete your notes.",

First: A recorded lecture to a lecture hall of 250 people given by a prof who doesnt care in a topic you know: Sure skip, who cares.\n\nSecond: A course like ALL of mine are. Discussion based. Resources are available online, but lectures are given during the class time slot with the information of the class. There are practical components. It is smaller than 50 people and the prof should know who you are. Attendance is in the grade. You have even the slightest struggle in the class. If any one of these things (or especially multiple) apply; GO TO CLASS. GO ITS IMPORTANT THEY ARENT LYING TO YOU FOR NO REASON.",
