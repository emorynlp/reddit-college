  "text": "Hello,\nI\u2019m a Junior who has been dreading their college years. Though I really want a college degree, I\u2019m finding the more \u2018prestigious\u2019 I choice over my first choice to be less fulfilling to me. I haven\u2019t been able to make any long term friends or connections at my college, and feel a general disconnect with my college. I feel like it\u2019s too late for me to transfer, but I don\u2019t want to force myself to finish a journey I haven\u2019t enjoyed at all. Yes I know I\u2019m lucky for getting into the school I did and I am already half way done, but I feel stuck in this on going cycle of being unhappy with my situation and being unable to diverge from my current path as I am afraid of regret if my choices in the future.\n\n~Thanks for reading~",

      "text": "Junior here too in a similar position! There are some people/clubs that I absolutely adore at my college but overall no super deep friendships and the school itself is just not a good fit for me. I completely understand that feeling of disconnect.\n\nI feel like especially after the pandemic, I'm at a point in my education where I just want to relax and get my degree without having to deal with some of the bullshit that happens at my college and the stress of continuously trying to adapt to an environment that is not meant for me.\n\nI'm also considering transferring and having doubts because of being a junior as well. My plan is to apply to a few schools that I can see myself at and then making a final decision as to whether or not to transfer based on finances + credit evaluations.",

              "text": "I'm thinking I'll apply for Spring 22, but the issue with that is having such a short amount of time to make my decision. But I think Spring will be better for me credit-wise, and then I'll have had an entire semester to acclimate to a new new school before the start of my senior year. Also feel free to DM me if you wanna talk/vent more about this and talk about the transfer process because I don't have anyone irl who understands this kind of situation!!",

If you\u2019re really that miserable at school then just sucking it up and staying isn\u2019t actually going to help you anymore than it will hurt you. You need to try to do what is going to make you happy, short term and long term, and if that is transferring schools then that is what you should do",
