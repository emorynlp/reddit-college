  "text": " I have been really questioning whether I have chosen the right degree. I'm currently in my last year of of a psychology degree and don't know if I'll be able to get a job once I graduate since there isn't many job options with a bachelors in psychology (in Australia). My plan is to work full time for a few years and then do a masters in counselling since I plan on becoming a therapist. However, recently I was considering doing nursing as well, since I heard you could become a mental health nurse. I like the idea of learning about the human body, first aid and health which is more practical than psychology which is more theory based. I just feel lost and confused with whether I'm doing the right thing or not?",
