  "text": "Hi,\n\nThis major interests me a lot but I don't think that I'm physically or really mentally built to become a standard police officer? I have bad vision and anxiety. I'm not sure if I should major in this because of this since mostly the jobs you could get are police-based and I would like help deciding on if I should pursue it as my major?",
