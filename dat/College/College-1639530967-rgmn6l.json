  "text": "Howdy y\u2019all,\n\nIt\u2019s getting to be that time where I finally have to declare a major and I\u2019ve been stuck between these three. \n\nFinance was my original choice and seems to be a consistently solid pick, but I don\u2019t see many things that I\u2019d want to do with it. \n\nMarketing tends to have mixed reviews and is generally regarded as a more useless degree, but I did enjoy my marketing class. \n\nMost people that are against marketing say it is better to go into analytics/BCIS instead as you can be more proficient and understanding of it, but I didn\u2019t get a whole lot of excitement out of my data science class (it was pretty much just homework without any substance so that may have something to do with it).\n\nOut of these three, which would you pick and why? Obviously we all want to make money at a good job right out of school and eventually make even more money, but I\u2019d like to enjoy my life as well. I do have a pretty lucrative job at a large Texas bank at the moment and any degree will help me move up, but options are always nice. \n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "I\u2019d do finance. It seems to resonate more with you. I think there\u2019s a lot of power in getting a well grounded understanding of a discipline that is solid and then maybe later, if need/desire be, coming back to get a tech degree or something. If you want to. Idk ur plans.\n\nA lot of people before I went to school for computer science told me the opposite. That it\u2019s easier to do something like cs first and then go back and do business. While this \u201cmight\u201d be true in some cases, one benefit of doing the opposite imo, is that later on if you did come back and do tech, you\u2019ll have a well-formed understanding of where to apply the skills. Not only that, you\u2019ll have a good understanding of what those skills after they\u2019re applied, gets you and what to do next. That part of application is the missing hole in a cs degree and I\u2019d guess that\u2019d be the same issue with a business analytics degree. Tool degrees are great, but they\u2019re even better if you already have an idea of where you might apply the tools and where they will fit into the frame. Otherwise, it\u2019s just you and a bunch of tools, you\u2019ll kind of know because you spent a limited amount of time learning them, detached from a greater purpose / goal. \n\nSo I say go finance. Pick up tech skills in your spare time. Plenty of resources available to do so. It\u2019s hard but just know it\u2019s hard for everyone. Cs / BCIS / CE majors all gotta teach themselves at some point, the languages / tools are too massive to condense fully into any class. Any class that claims that by the end of it you\u2019ll know a language end to end is bullshit.",
