  "text": "Hi guys, I'm currently a sophomore in college studying environmental science. the reason I chose this major was because I absolutely loved the AP enviro science class I took in high school, and I'm passionate about sustainability and climate change science. But, so far I'm not loving the curriculum at my school and am feeling uninspired by the job outlook that most people in this major gravitate towards after graduation (environmental consulting, park ranger, etc.) I LOVE being in the outdoors but being a park ranger isn't really my vibe, and consulting honestly just sounds boring to me. I'm passionate about outdoor sports and I think it'd be so cool to be a guide or something (although I'm not a good climber/skiier/etc. I just do them for fun recreationally, but not sure I'd ever get to a \"guide-worthy level.\") Anyways I feel like my dream job would be somewhere outdoors staying active but I also love being around/helping people and animals - I've done some work at a wildlife rehab clinic and also with adaptive sports teams - they were both really rewarding and kept me engaged. And on top of it all I am an artist for fun and love graphic design and wonder if I should do a 180 and switch my major to some design-type thing.\n\nI also read somewhere that it's important to separate your hobbies from your work and that's where I get stuck. Do I keep art and graphic design as a hobby and work in the outdoor/enviro science field? Or should I try to pursue work in graphic design and keep my love for the outdoors/environment as a hobby? I know lots of people end up working in fields totally different from what their college majors were, but I want to at least enjoy the next 2.5 years of college I have left, and I'm jealous of my friends who know exactly what they want to do and are so passionate about all their classes. I go back and forth with what I want to do and there's a lot of ideas in my head (recreational therapist, wildlife rehab technician, environmental scientist who does hands-on research and field work, graphic designer, ski",
