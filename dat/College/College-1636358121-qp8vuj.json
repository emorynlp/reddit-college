  "title:": "My parents are kinda loaded but also don\u2019t want to help that much with college. Is there any way I can still get financial aid or something despite their high income?",
  "text": "Together, they make like 400k and probably more. Since they aren\u2019t really helping me much with college, is there anything I can do so that their income isn\u2019t considered for my financial aid? I\u2019m already planning on going to community college first and then transferring to university, but college is still expensive. \n\nAnd if you guys are wondering why they won\u2019t help, it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want me \u201chaving everything handed to me\u201d. Which I guess is what I\u2019m kinda asking for but still. Also, they aren\u2019t exactly the most frugal. Like tons of travel, 12k on bar, 20k on wedding ring upgrade, just tons of spending. I only recently got my dad into investing which I wish they had been doing way sooner and maybe I would have a college fund. Kinda unnecessary information but I just felt like ranting for a bit.",

My parents make way less than that and have 6 kids and still they make \u201ctoo much\u201d. It\u2019s just about figuring out how to get other people to give you the money as choosing priorities.

I was in a similar boat while applying to colleges, and ended up getting a merit-based full ride (application did not ask a single question about income) with a healthy stipend to attend my state school after getting zero need-based aid at every other school I was admitted to.\n\nAlso, be grateful for what your parents *have* provided you. Many are still a lot less fortunate and their spending on things for them (travel, wedding ring, etc) is frankly not your concern: while it sucks, the funds aren't yours to direct. Focus on creating a successful future for yourself instead.",

It\u2019s also just kinda frustrating seeing them spend so much on things they don\u2019t need when just a portion of that would help me so much. I haven\u2019t said anything about that to them since, like you said, it\u2019s not my place. But thanks for the suggestion about merit based scholarships",

A friend of mine from high school has a family income of effectively $50k a year (small family restaurant), and their EFC was something like $60k/yr.",

The reason you won\u2019t get aid is cause they make a lot , normal kids who don\u2019t get stuff handed to them get aid because of that . So the fact that they\u2019re doing that is kinda throwing you down more than kids who don\u2019t get stuff handed to them . But it\u2019s not impossible, I got a grant through community college for 2 free years and a little extra cash . I also hope they listen to you about investing , it sounds like you have more financial sense then them , you\u2019ll definitely be smarter about the money you\u2019ll make for yourself in the future . Keep it up \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc look for scholarships and grants and try not to take out a loan cause that\u2019s the worst thing to possibly do",
