  "title:": "After a super prestigious internship in the summer, my grades plummeted this fall. Help?",
  "text": "TLDR at bottom.\n\nWhat title says, got a really fancy internship in my field (CS) which I did really well in and got an offer to come back. Technically they would allow us to drop out and go work with them, but of course I want to finish my degree. Admittedly, being the person in my dept to get the nicest internship also has gotten into my head.\n\nI've never been the best at theoretical stuff or at being a good student, but I've always gotten by with Cs or Bs which I'm ok with since I'm actually talented at what the field I want to go on to requires. Other than that, I'm taking for the first time a full course load. I'm also in my last year.\n\nI am suddenly just unable to study or do work, the most I did for midterms was wake up 4 hours before each exam and kinda review. I unsurprisingly bombed almost every single one of my midterms, and the ones I didn't fail I maybe got 60s. I also sometimes I wake up and have no energy, kinda like a zombie. I can't fall asleep before 3-4 am and have been missing most of my classes.\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to break the cycle where I kinda just lay there and don't do any effort whatsoever for my classes - I wasn't like this the first years of my degree. I may be burnt out, but I don't really want to drop any classes.\n\n**TLDR: need help getting back to regular college rhythm since I'm currently probably burnt out and giving no effort whatsoever in classes.**",

Set aside 4-6 hours a day to do school work, go to class, etc. Set aside time to go on your phone, game, hang out, watch tv\u2026 Just make a routine and stick to it like your life depends on it. Trust me when I say this, as hard as it is, you will feel so so so good and clear and like it\u2019s relief.",
