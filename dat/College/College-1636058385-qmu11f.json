  "text": "Would it be alright if I asked my professor to look over my outline about a week before my essay is due? It's worth half of my grade and I'm not sure if I'd come off as irresponsible/bothersome. \n\nThanks.",

      "text": "You can certainly ask, it's a reasonable request, more so than asking the prof to read a rough draft. For various reasons, they may or may not do it. (I  would say yes to a request like this.) If you put it in terms of wanting to be sure you understand the assignment and whether you are on the right track, that should help. That's a lot of course grade for one essay!",

Knowing it was done in a day didn\u2019t change grading, but getting feedback definitely helped the final product.\n\nI would make sure the outline is well done so you don\u2019t waste his time but definitely worth it. A week is a lot of time and the outline is half the battle for me.",
