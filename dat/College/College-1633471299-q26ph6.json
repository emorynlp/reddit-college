  "text": "My roommate and I had a mutual friend (my last rommate) and now we're living together. Things started off really well in the beginning of the school year but now I get the feeling that I'm doing something wrong or that I've just made her mad somehow and now it seems like I'm just being ignored. We're both super busy so I'm trying to give her the benefit of the doubt but seeing as she doesn't even wave back when she walks in to the appartment and sees me. She doesn't acknowledge my cat as he runs to greet her at the door (she's also a cat person and loved my cat prior). \n\nI hadn't been the best at cleaning up my stuff; she's fairly minimalist so I try to keep all of my \"clutter\" items like candles and books in my room along with my school stuff, though I tend to hang out in the living space a lot because of the great lighting. I'd leave my backpack out by the couch or my notebooks on the dining room table. I tried my best to clean the kitchen after I use it. Now, I say tried my best because for the entirety of september, I fell into a depressive episode and had trouble functioning. I wouldn't shower for a week (i try to do it every other day) and doing simple things took hours. Now that I've worked out some new medications, I'm finally seeing some light in my life. I reached out to her to apologize about not being as clean as I know she prefers and explain what has been going on as I hardly saw her. She never answered.\n\nI just feel this pit in my chest like I'm an awful roommate but I just don't know how to be someone better. I don't even know if this is the right reddit for this but I just feel so lost about this and I want to write it somewhere and possibly get feedback.",

      "text": "First, don\u2019t beat yourself up about it because you definitely are trying to make amends. You might want to apologize again in person because some people think that leaving notes or sending messages is passive aggressive.\n\nSecond, you can try to do something nice for her such as buy her a treat or small stuffed animal and candy or something that she likes. But you *don\u2019t have to.* At the end of the day, whatever is bothering her is her personal problem and it may have nothing to do with you! Remember, closed mouths don\u2019t get fed. If she has a problem with you specifically, she needs to say something or it won\u2019t get fixed.",

Again, I don't think you did anything harmful to her, and maybe she's just going through a rough patch herself. \n\nPS- I'm glad you're seeing some light again :)",
