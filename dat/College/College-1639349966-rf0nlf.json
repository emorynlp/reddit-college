  "text": "Hey guys I just turned 20 in October and am at 56 units. I'm currently in a community college. I did not know that one had to apply for a transfer to another university a year prior. What I am going to do is finish my last 4 units then apply for hopefully admission into Fall into Cal State Fullerton. My question is that am I going to be left behind and waste a year of my life while I wait for admission? I feel like I have just wasted a year of my life by knowing that I will have to wait most likely over a year in a half just to get in.",
