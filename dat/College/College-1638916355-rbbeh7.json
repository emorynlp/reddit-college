  "text": "Hey! Quick Question. I have a final assignment due for one of my class, as it is finals week, I have many other assignments and test to study for. I did the \"What-If\" Grade calculator on Canvas, and my grade will drop from a 91% to a 85% if I don't do the assignment. I'm considering just not doing it to save time and mental energy for other works. Do you think this may be smart? I'm okay with an 85% but I just wanted advice. Thank you in advance redditors.",
