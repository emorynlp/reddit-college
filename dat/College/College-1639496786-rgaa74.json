But it went much smoother than I thought it would, and even better, this entire thing is over. Thanks for the support, I am going back to my room to sleep for the next 3 days.",

My recent math course was an example. I'm not good at math at all.  I checked my final grade last night after avoiding it all day. Turns out I got through and did really well ended with a B.",
