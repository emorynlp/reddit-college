  "text": "I really like dressing up and putting together outfits but the thing is sometimes they can get a little too extra. I just started college(19,girl) and Im not sure if its considered inappropriate to dress too extra in college. I like wearing heels ( sometimes high ones) and Black and white combinations,  animal print and bold glasses. I also like to wear dresses or skirts over pants. I dont know if in college maybe that will come off as unproffessional or too immature? What should i do?",
