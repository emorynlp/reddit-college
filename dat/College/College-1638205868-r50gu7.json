  "title:": "Fashion help. Is too extra bad in college?",
  "text": "I really like dressing up and putting together outfits but the thing is sometimes they can get a little too extra. I just started college(19,girl) and Im not sure if its considered inappropriate to dress too extra in college. I like wearing heels ( sometimes high ones) and Black and white combinations,  animal print and bold glasses. I also like to wear dresses or skirts over pants. I dont know if in college maybe that will come off as unproffessional or too immature? What should i do?",

      "text": "College is no different than the rest of society.  Some people will like what you're wearing, some people will hate it, and most won't care one way or the other.\n\nOne college caveat: don't wear anything outlandish to a lab-based class.  To labs, I'd wear basic clothes like jeans and a regular shirt or blouse.  You don't want to wear anything that could get caught in laboratory machinery or instruments or that could absorb chemicals or other laboratory fluids.  Same goes for shoes - to a lab class just wear basic athletic shoes or flats or something that you can easily move around in.  You don't want to have to worry about tripping in high heels or having the heels get caught on something, etc.\n\nOtherwise, wear whatever you want.",
