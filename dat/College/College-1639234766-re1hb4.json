I was always good at school to the point that I wouldnt have to try, so now it's a bit hard to push myself and I am NOT good at online school. I literally failed every class :/.

      "text": "You can totally recover. \n\nSee what your school\u2019s policy is for retaking classes. Sometimes you can retake it once and it is like you never failed the first time. \n\nIt can be rough for kids that are used to not studying and doing everything last minute (I was that kid!). See if you school has any suggestions for study skills classes or information. \n\nYou can do this! Everyone screws up occasionally.",
