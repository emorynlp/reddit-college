One of them has a National Ranking of 2 whereas the others are quite down below. As well as the University has a good International Ranking and Accreditation as well.\n\nSo my question is that attending a University with high rankings is better or it doesn't make any difference?",

For instance, there\u2019s not much difference between two high-ranked national universities, but a great deal of difference between a high-ranked national university and any regional one.\n\nMind you, this won\u2019t necessarily equate to a better education, (as there are fair, good, and amazing professors at community colleges, small universities, and research institutions), but there are advantages for networking and job hunting. \n\nOne other thing: Regardless of reputation, there are only a few schools worth going into debt (for an undergraduate degree).",
