  "text": "I\u2019m in my first ever quarter of college about a little more than halfway through and I\u2019m failing every class cause online is impossible for me to manage with ADHD, and anxiety fueled by procrastination. I\u2019m less than 40% on every class and I don\u2019t even turn things in anymore cause I can\u2019t bring myself to do anything. How screwed am I for this quarter and the future?",

      "text": "You came here. That's a start. I know a guy who had the same problem at a top design school. He told his parents, went to student affairs, pulled out of school and got a job. No pressure. Just a year off while he just lived and laid low. Six months later he's like a new guy. He's getting ready to head back to school next year (when it's in-person) and everyone is willing to write his situation off due to Covid.\n\nThese are extremely difficult times. You're not alone. You just need to take action and get away until school is back in actual session.",

      "text": "Sounds like you aren\u2019t motivated. Do you have diagnosed ADHD? If so, maybe talk with your psychiatrist about your medication maybe you need a change. If you do not actually have ADHD you could just have a problem with keeping yourself on task and motivated. \n\nOnline is great for some, and not others. I find online to be better for me than in person. I however can stay on schedule. Some students need more structure and that\u2019s okay, in person class gives you that structure if needed. \n\nWhat I do is at the beginning of every semester I write down everything that\u2019s due for all of my classes in a planner. This keeps me organized and I don\u2019t have to look at a syllabus ever again after the first day. I plan days to do specific class work and I practice discipline to do so. Online classes is great if you can stay organized, on task, and motivated. If not, you have the problems you are currently having. \n\nGet a planner and use it if you haven\u2019t already. If possible maybe try in person next semester to see if that helps. You aren\u2019t screwed, hopefully you have academic forgiveness for a few classes. Don\u2019t discourage yourself, if at first you don\u2019t succeed try and try again.",

      "text": "If you're failing with less than a 40% in each class and you're over halfway done I'm not sure if you can even save that, it will look really bad on your overall GPA + your school will put you on Academic Probation but you can still graduate if you get more serious next semester.\n\nSet time out in the day everyday when you'll do course work for an hour or two, turn off your phone data, use a different browser than the one you use for netflix/youtube/hulu, and just focus on classwork. That way it won't come all crashing down on you the day before its due, school is really manageable if you keep chunking away pieces little by little instead of waiting the last second.",

Procrastinating online classes is so easy so make it difficult by designating times for different courses and if there isn't an assignment study during that time.",
