  "text": "In college, I assisted a student in cheating but did not know that they would copy off of me but did show it to them. The other student stepped forward taking full responsibility but obviously had to them off our discussion; I understand that what I did was wrong but it really was just a dumb thing. Are punishments just as bad for the person assisting in cheating as they are for the person who cheated?",

      "text": " Can you explain the situation in detail? What kind of assignment was this (a regular discussion board, an exam, a test..)? Did they say you let them cheat off you or did the other student just say they cheated of you? \n\nNot knowing any details\u2026.If I were you, I would deny any acknowledgment of any wrong doing. Just stick with the story of you helping that person, not thinking they\u2019d cheat off you if asked. Punishments are just as bad for all involved if they find you helped the cheater. This Depends mostly on the assignment though.",

      "text": "Really depends on the professor/department and how much effort they want to put forth. I've seen situations where they want to know what everyone did and assign punishment based on how much each person contributed to the infraction, and others where they just blanket punish everyone even slightly involved.  Sounds like you didn't have the intent to cheat and the other student may have taken answers from you. Faculty may not find you at fault in this case or just let you off with a stern warning.",
