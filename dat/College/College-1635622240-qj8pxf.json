  "title:": "Maybe a taboo question, but what if I have a crush on my TA?",
  "text": "I'll preface this by saying we're the same age; I'm an older undergrad and he's a grad student who happens to be TA-ing my class. We're both in our late 20s and born only a few months apart actually, so it's not AS weird as it could be.\n\nBut yeah... In any case, I have a huge crush on my TA. This class isn't even for my major, but it's always the highlight of my day. I go to office hours all the time and ask for help even with things I know. I've got it bad, y'all. He's just really friggin' nice; total Hufflepuff of a human, and it's clear he really wants all his students to succeed.\n\nMy question, I guess, is what would happen if I said something to him after I was no longer enrolled in his class? I've dated grad students at the university before and it's never been an issue, but they've also never been my TAs. So, the waters get a little murky there. I mean, he could be totally uninterested anyway, but would it be a major issue if I tried to shoot my shot maybe 6 months from now?",

Given how small academic fields are, word would get around unless the couple was exceptionally discreet.\n\nAll of this should be kept in mind regardless of what you eventually do.",
