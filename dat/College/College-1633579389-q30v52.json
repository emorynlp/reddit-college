My professor said it accepts docx, so I tried converting my google doc to the docx. When I submitted it, the doc preview said \u201cthis file contains html and cannot be used.\u201d What does this mean?? I really don\u2019t want to pay for word and I know there\u2019s a way to resubmit it for it to work. I have unlimited attempts btw.",
