  "text": "I look like I have it all together; 4.0, a high paying job, friends, saved enough in hs for college yk all that stuff. Reality says different. I constantly just sit in my dorm and procrastinate thinking about the future of my life and how I don't like my major but its to late to change. I lost my girlfriend as we went to different states for college. Now you can get expelled if you get caught at a party and intramurals and activities are canceled because of covid. All the classes are online and I spend 22 hours of the day in my dorm. In hs I was super social and had a great time at parties, athletics, clubs. Now college just sucks ass and I have no clue if I should keep doing this or drop out and use that money I saved for college to get into real estate. Please help ik a lot of other people are in this situation!",

I was admitted to University for Life Sciences (Mainly Biology), but I'm a second year now and half of my classes are year 1 because I'm switching into Physical Sciences (Physics, Math, Chemistry). I realized, thankfully early, that I didn't want to get a Bio degree, but it's definitely never too late to change. It feels sucky to go back to square one, but I'm enjoying this program a lot more than the other one :)",

              "text": "You can always go to a community college and spend a couple grand for the same gen ed and pre requisites you\u2019re talking about having to spend 60k on. Plus if you\u2019re junior standing all gen ed would be done so you\u2019d only need to do some pre requisites. Go to a community college for that and maybe test out a couple of hands on medical field courses that community colleges typically have and see if you would truly enjoy it. I switched my major multiple times. Most people do which is why I think going to community college is better so you don\u2019t waste a bunch of time and money on shit you don\u2019t end up wanting to do. I\u2019m 25 now and just about to graduate since I also took time off to travel and work. Eventually I realized what I truly want to do and I\u2019m loving my major and can\u2019t wait to get into my career.",

I worked in an elementary school at the time too and then changed my major to education to be an elementary school teacher. Then realized I didn\u2019t want to spend all that money on a degree and credential for as little pay as it was and very little increase without more and more education. I stopped going to school for a while after that and moved across the country and traveled a lot. I decided to try and work in the field of psychology thinking maybe I would get my degree in that but with the goal not being the same as when I first wanted to major it in. Working in the field made me realize that nope it wasn\u2019t for me even though I loved learning about it. Then I went back to working in schools and debated going for teaching again but could never bring myself to go back for that. Then one day I came across urban planning and I looked into that for a while and then a couple months into the pandemic I decided that\u2019s what I was going to do and I never looked back. I\u2019m really close to finishing now and the more I learn about it the more excited I am to start my career. I\u2019m also getting a cert in geographic info systems. It meets everything I could want in a career honestly.",

There's also no real harm in taking one semester off to put your thoughts together and consider what you want to do. If you want to continue school, you'll be able to pick up. If you want to go into real estate instead, you can do that too.",
