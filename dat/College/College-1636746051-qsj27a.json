Not letting that stop me\n\nMy goal is to either do a software engineering job, I\u2019m applying for internships\n\nBut I also have an opportunity with 3D design. I\u2019m a huge hobbyist of blender and unity 3D. I\u2019ve acquired the skills over the years. So if the software thing doesn\u2019t work out because I\u2019m too dumb, I could go for a lower paying 3D design, animation, or game art job",
