  "text": "I\u2019m currently a sophomore and at my school we declare majors sophomore spring. I am thinking of double majoring in economics and computer science and I maybe minoring in Chinese because it\u2019s only 5 courses. I\u2019ve planned out the requirements for my next 2.5 years and it fits but I\u2019ll have a very tight schedule. My question is should I drop chinese? It\u2019s very time consuming and could possibly be overkill? But on the other hand, I know that a foreign language would be very helpful in some fields like finance, business, etc.\n\nThanks!",
