  "text": "2 months in, my fall semester has been miserable. I\u2019m a commuter (big regret) and that has really limited my social life. I try to stay on campus for longer but my classes only end at 6pm so I have no choice but to leave before it becomes too late. I\u2019m sure students living in dorms have it easier, not to mention the whole social scene thing. I barely made any friends and I was thinking of perhaps dorming during spring term. I\u2019m just worried whether students in residential halls since fall will still be open to meeting new people since they probably have formed their social circles during the fall.",

      "text": "I live in dorms and have no friends. Partially because I am kind of introverted and the building I live in has no action. I can come back to my dorm at 6pm and my whole floor is empty and nobody has their doors open (because you can\u2019t really have doors open or unlocked in my dorm), and nobody in the lounge.  \n\nThere are people I know who live off campus who have way more friends than i do, but they like play basketball and are overall just more extroverted. \n\nLiving in the dorm has not helped me make any friends and my roommate is also very anti social. \n\nIf you apply for spring housing, join a community floor or even wait till next fall. Just because you\u2019re in a dorm doesn\u2019t mean making friends is easier.",
