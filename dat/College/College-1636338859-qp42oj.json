  "text": "This is actually the second time that I have had my bike stolen in 2 weeks, the first time I had forgotten to lock it and this time they literally just took off the front wheel, which I had locked, and took off with the rest. What really upsets me is that there were two bikes near mine, one only had the wheels locked to the frame, as in it could have just been picked up and carried off, and the other had no locking whatsoever, yet they literally took mine apart in order to steal it. Based on this think I might be being targeted. I really don't know what to do. I know this isn't that large of an issue but It has just ruined my week before it even began.",
