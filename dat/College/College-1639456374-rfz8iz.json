  "text": "So because of covid I haven't had many friends during online school and all. I've had one in person class during the semester (and I'm in my second year) and only ever met one person who I ate out with after classes. I recently had a group project with someone and we ended up vibing rlly well. We've had long texts and spoke on call but I mostly ever rlly initiate the convo, and since I don't want to be weird, I stopped texting as much and we haven't rlly talked since. Thing is, I kind of want to ask her to hang out irl, we've talked about meeting in person when the semester begins again but would it be weird to ask her to hang out this week or something? I don't even know how to approach the question tbh",
