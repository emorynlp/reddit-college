  "text": "Hi everyone, I am currently in my first semester of college as a computer science student. I was considering taking on a second major for nursing. I understand it would be difficult, my current course load isn\u2019t too bad currently and my only difficult class is my computer science class. I will provide more information if anyone needs it. Thank you for the help in advance.",

See if it\u2019s possible to take all the necessary classes. It will be difficult since there probably isn\u2019t any overlap other than gen eds",

      "text": "Id er on the side of no bc those are super intense majors, esp when you get to your upper division. This is esp if you work or want a super lively social life, as you will essentially be dedicating all your time towards your majors.  Also, what do you plan to do with a double major? CS and Nursing are very different career paths.\n\nAs somone who is double majoring (both less intense than yours) and am switching to just one major with a minor, I personally still want to be able to work (bc i have to) and want as much time I have left towards socializing/networking.\n\nAt the end of the day, it lies at what you want out of your college experience. If you double major, you'll essentially be spending all your time studying. If you don't double major, you lose a major, but have more time for other stuff (work, side projects, social life, etc.).",

If you want to be a nurse, I would suggest learning how to code on your own time and not getting a CS degree. If you want to go into the field of computer science and do something like software engineering, then get the CS degree and land a job. If you want to pursue nursing later in life, you can always pursue that degree while working a good, stable job.",
