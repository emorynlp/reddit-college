  "text": "Sooo I am an economics and business major with a minor in violin performance and I was taking music theory and I got my first C. I\u2019m a second year student and this was my first semester actually on campus. The rest of my grades were A\u2019s and I have gotten two b\u2019s before in previous semesters but I really want to go to grad school for business or econ and get a good scholarship because I can\u2019t afford it on my own. I already am in debt for my undergrad. Is this still possible? I feel so discouraged.",
