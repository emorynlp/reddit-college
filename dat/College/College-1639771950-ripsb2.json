  "title:": "Original thoughts by undergraduates - should they never be included in an article?",
  "text": "A friend of mine is writing their first paper as part of an assignment. They're studying English translation and the research has to do with that.\n\nThey haven't had much guidance from their tutor, so they feel uncertain about how to go writing the paper in terms of quotes and paraphrasing.\n\nThey asked some questions such as:\n\n> Am I supposed to never include my own original thoughts in the paper?\n\nNot to get too philosophical by saying it's probably unlikely we've had thoughts no one has ever thought of first, but according to my understanding, an undergraduate student should stick to paraphrasing in their own words and only sometimes directly quoting pieces of text, while \"original thoughts\" could be left for sections such as the methodology/results/discussion/conclusion, and perhaps a little bit in the introduction, depending on the type of the article.\n\nIs this a fair assessment?\n\n> What is the point of me paraphrasing rather than sticking to directly quoting other articles while making sure to reference them properly? After all, I could never say things better than these experienced authors did.\n\nI think that is not the right mentality to have. I think the point is to learn how to write a paper and to put in the effort and show that actual research has been done, rather than copy/pasting portions of text. Why is this done? I don't know, but I do know this is how it's been done for centuries.\n\n>I'm not sure how to paraphrase and reference a collection of ideas into an amalgamation in a single paragraph in my own words, rather than paraphrasing each idea separately\n\nI think this can be done just fine - I've seen references written as something like [2-6] for example, following a piece of text that has taken something from references 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, for example. I'm not sure how easily this can be done in APA/MLA styles, though.",

      "text": ">Is this a fair assessment?\n\nI would agree with you; it is unlikely an undergraduate until later in their undergraduate degree will have a single truly original idea. However, the most interesting papers are ones where a student pushes the boundaries of their own knowledge, perhaps not advancing the field as a whole, but going beyond simple paraphrasing/quoting of other things. It can be too easy to assume one will never have an original idea, resulting in students who only regurgitate memorized information, but papers allow a student construct their own argument. No, they won't be creating wholly new ideas, but their way of organizing the information and making the argument can be their own, even if the conclusions are not.\n\n>Why is this done?\n\nIt's done so that each student can make their own argument. The original authors worded it in such a way to support their own argument, yet it is unlikely a student is purely echoing the original author's argument (if they are it will be a very boring paper). Therefore, re-wording through paraphrasing offers flexibility which overusing quotes does not have.",
