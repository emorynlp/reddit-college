  "title:": "I absolutely despise college, but it\u2019s required for my current career field and what I want to do in the future.",
  "text": "I\u2019ve been in college for five years now. I was supposed to graduate last Spring, but I\u2019ve taken so much time off (not consecutively) that it\u2019s put me behind. The reason I\u2019ve taken time off is because I find it very difficult to stay motivated and push myself through. I know it sounds bad because college isn\u2019t something everyone gets to do even if they want to, I\u2019m just not passionate about it.\n\nI know I am smart enough to do it. I love to learn, but I don\u2019t like learning in such a structured environment if that makes sense? I can\u2019t sit in a lecture hall and just listen and watch a professor. I need to be actually doing something to learn, and I don\u2019t believe college focuses on that style of learning (possibly because most people are auditory and visual learners?).\n\nPeople have told me to try trade schools, but I love the field I\u2019m in (law), and I don\u2019t want to do anything else. But my field requires a degree. I love working. I\u2019ve worked my way up and actually make a decent salary with benefits, and I think that\u2019s why I\u2019ve started to kind of think I don\u2019t need it. But I can\u2019t move up if I don\u2019t eventually graduate, or even decide to get a Master\u2019s or go to law school.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m lazy; I work hard and I\u2019m great at what I do. I wouldn\u2019t be where I am if I didn\u2019t. I just don\u2019t understand exactly why I truly struggle so much with the idea of college and getting it over with. I want to give up so badly, but I\u2019ll disappoint a lot of people. Has anyone else been in the same position?",

      "text": "If you know what you want grind for it. Look at the end game where you want to be in a few years. Life isn't going to be a walk in the park. You are going to take courses you find serve no purpose to your career. Sometimes you can't rely on professors. You might have teach yourself (online resources, tutors) to get that A/B if they don't fit your teaching style. You have to go into something you are passionate about not what others want you to be like your parents. Do some shadowing or volunteering in your career field and see what its like if you aren't sure.",

And if someone is paying thousands of dollars for school, why should they have to teach themselves? That defeats the purpose.",

      "text": "You talk about having worked your way up in your field; how many hours per week are you working? If you have a FT job with benefits and are slogging through school as well, kudos to you but no wonder you are mentally struggling with this. A person only has so much bandwidth. Full time school is a full-time job. Doing work and school together is really, really tough.\n\nWhat kind of support system do you have in place, to help you manage all the day to day stuff so that you can eat healthy foods, live in a clean and tidy place, and get enough sleep and exercise, while also having some down time where your brain can just relax?\n\nOnly you can provide the motivation you need. Right now your brain is telling you \"maybe you don't really need this, because look what you've achieved without it\". If you are committed to this, you need to silence that dead-end voice and replace it with a voice that says something more like, \"I am going to get this degree. Who I am and what I want in life is based on having this degree. I am going to stick with it, because that is the only way to keep all my future doors open.\"\n\nNow, I'm saying that based on what you have voiced here. I personally believe there are many pathways to a successful life, and a university degree isn't a requirement. Maybe you could schedule a (paid) session with a career coach. That person can help you identify what the things are in your job that you really like, and think about how to build a career that has more of that in it. Maybe there is a sideways path you hadn't considered that could be very successful for you that doesn't require a degree. Maybe it isn't as big a deal as you are thinking to slam shut those future doors in front of you, because your best path might take you in a different direction.",
