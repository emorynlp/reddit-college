  "text": "It\u2019s Christmas break now, but this happened at college too.\n\nI wake up, look around, and think to myself- \u201cwhere- wait? Oh! I\u2019m not home/at college anymore\u201d. Since I\u2019m away on break, I expect to wake up and be in my dorm, I get so confused every morning.\n\nAt college, I would wake up in my dorm sometimes and be in a delusion because I wasn\u2019t in my house.\n\nShit crazy",
