I forgot to close out the site when I opened my comp freshman year for World history and there was several people sitting behind me who I\u2019m sure saw\u2026and I\u2019m the super nerdy, shy girl in the class, so it\u2019s more embarrassing. Fortunately I hadn\u2019t gone into my BDSM phase yet, otherwise it would have been an even bigger shock to people. It fucking happens dude. \n\nEven better though - when you need IT to fix your computer. I feel like there is only so much you can hide from those guys.",

One year I had my dorm set up so that my computer monitor faced the front door; the door was always locked though so I didn't think it was an issue.  One day I was whacking it at super speed since I had 10 minutes before class when I heard the sound of the door being unlocked.  I quickly shoved my dick back into my pants and greeted my roommate and he said \"Hey man, these are the friends from out of town that... I was... telling you.... about.\"  I was wondering why he was saying it so awkwardly when I looked back at my computer and saw that there were still two anime demon girls riding a tied-up guy.  I was so busy putting my dick away that I completely forgot to close out of the window.  I looked back and there are four people I didn't know standing there awkwardly.  I immediately closed the laptop and announced \"I am late for class!\"  which was mostly true.  \n\nWhen I got to class and sat down the professor says \"all right everybody, take out your books...\" and I remembered my book was a pdf.  On the same laptop.  That still had the image open.  I was seated in the front row.  I managed to awkwardly position the screen so nobody could see what was happening during the split second it took for me to type cmd+w, but it was still pretty terrifying.\n\nMy roommate and his friends never mentioned what they saw and the friends actually turned out to be really cool.",

God, it\u2019s like a bunch of stiff personality, picky-ass particular motherfuckers who have never touched a muff realized that sitting inside while you jerk off and play video games all day is lame, so you went to the other extreme and because you went outside to say hi to a female, you think you understand the key to something and the key is abstaining from masturbation and pornography. So fucking stupid, bro.\n\nWhat actually matters is taking positive time to get your hygiene and style up and then taking more positive time to approach women and develop your social circle. Whether you touch your sink or not should have very little effect on this. If masturbation was affecting your motivation, you were probably doing it too much or just didn\u2019t drag your ass out of the house and stomp down your negative self impressions and fears with enough force. Just nut up, realize your going to die someday, then do the work to get laid. At the end of the day, it\u2019s just a numbers game and no-gap doesn\u2019t have sick to do with it:",
