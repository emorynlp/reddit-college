  "text": "This was my first semester taking online courses and generally with in person education I would thank my instructors for their time and wish them well. Should I send emails to my instructors after grades are released thanking them? I had an especially wonderful composition professor and I want to let him know how much I appreciated his feedback on my writing as it has pushed me to feel more confident in my abilities entering back into a learning environment.",
