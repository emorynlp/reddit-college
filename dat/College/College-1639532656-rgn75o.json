  "text": "In our country, college admission exam is treated as the big event. Little did I know that college would be full of studying and not \u300c\u7531\u4f60\u73a9\u56db\u5e74\u300d(play for 4 years) as they say.\n\nI'm in a physics degree and I'm already sick of all these studying and styressing for exams and work.
