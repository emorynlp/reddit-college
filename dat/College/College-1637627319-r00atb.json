  "text": "Hi all, I inquired about this matter to each school's admission office but they are taking a bit too long to reply, so I was hoping if I could get some insight from people here.\n\nI graduated high school in Canada last year in June and currently in South Korea. I am holding a temporary permanent residency visa card, and planning to visit the U.S. in January to get my regular green card.\n\nAs a university in Florida consider me an international student, I'm wondering if that standard applies to every other schools. \n\nOn Coalition, it says \"some schools may consider you an international student\". Does that mean some schools can consider me a domestic student?\n\nI understand that I cannot say that I'm a permanent resident right now, but once I get my green card, can I change my status? Or is it still impossible because I attended high school in Canada, not in the U.S.?",
