  "text": "I am just going to say my SAT score was a lot higher than what I expected.                                                   I just got lucky very lucky. So I made up my mind to go higher ranked university. I should not have done it. I just can't do it. No matter how hard I try, I'm literally just keeping on. And I messed everything up now. I just don't see me graduating in the university anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Is anyone has information about it? There really aren't many information about this reversed way.\n\nIm okay with just information even if it doesnt answer my questions. Ones I read were like from 2016.\n\n**Classes I took in 4yr university, will these be completely useless if I go to 2 yr? Or would it just depends on colleges?**\n\nI was in Mechanical engineering major and planning to go 2yr for similar engineering program.\n\nI finished all english history math science courses and 2or3 major classes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just wish maybe one day, I can comeback and finish the 4 yr, if time and money allows me to.",
