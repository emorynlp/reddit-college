  "title:": "I\u2019m 23 and I have no idea what to do with my life. Just finished a Bachelor in Computer Engineering i need to persue a Ms but really don't know wich. I'm stucked and starting to feel really bad and depressed.",
  "text": " \n\nI studied computer engineering during my bachelor's degree because it was my passion, but during my studies I saw that I was more inclined towards electronics / automation than software.\n\nIt should be emphasized that in Italy a master's degree is almost compulsory and above all I want to continue studying.\n\nThe problem is, I don't really know what to do. every two weeks I change my mind, I switch from wanting to do a master's degree in automation, but after a week it all seems boring, I studied for two months for automation exams and sometimes I was convinced and sometimes it seems to me that it leads me to a job that I do not like.\n\nOther times I would like to continue with computer engineering but then I'm not convinced.\n\nThe problem is that this has been going on for months, and deadlines come super fast and I don't really know what to do.",

      "text": "Buy yourself a cheap PLC, I.e. Siemens logo,  or beg/ borrow from university,  and simply have a play with it. \nLight some LEDs, add buttons etc... see if engages you. \n\nOur for electronics,  get some hobby packs from amazon,  and again,  have a play for a few days,  see how you feel about it. \n\nI don't know the culture in Italy,  but in the UK a bachelor degree would be enough to get an entry level position.\nCould you find a part time job doing some electronic/ electronics assembly? you would be around the industry,  and would give you the chance to meet and talk to other engineers who had been on the same path as you. \n\nDoes the university have any open days?  Again it would give you the chance to meet and talk to engineers and the lecturers who teach these subjects.\n\nEdit: there's also several /r's which are all friendly,  never be afraid to ask. \nAlso,  my day job involves both electronics and automation (more electronics) and I'm happy to help.",

              "text": "What aspect of PLC work do you not enjoy? There is a very big difference between what and how you learn at university, and how you will apply skills when working. \nI hated firmware engineering when I left university, now I love it, I put it down to the method of teaching I received at university, which I did not enjoy.",

                      "text": "There\u2019s always companies looking for people who can design HMIs, the people I have met who do that are software engineer educated normally. \n\nTake a look at EXOR systems, the company who design them are based in Italy, and it\u2019s always worth asking for free stuff to help education.\nThat\u2019s would satisfy the higher level language end, however they do need to have a controller to take care of any IO, so some PLC effort is needed, but most control can be put onto the hmi if desired.",
