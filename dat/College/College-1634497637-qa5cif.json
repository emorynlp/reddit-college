  "text": "Hello everyone, I'm a citizen who lived most of her life out of the country. I even graduated from high school out of the States. I came back to USA when I turned 18y. Back then in 2010 i submit my paper work and my gpa was 3.4\n\nSince I had to start from cero financially, I finded very difficult to study and be able to sustain myself with a part time job. I've changed several jobs during the years. Then when I was doing better financially I wanted to get into college so I applied to financial aid, but since I earn more than a minimum salary. I didn't get enough  help. I've been struggling to get into college ever since then, to the point that I let 12y passed. Now I'm  unemployed and I would like to give it a try once again. I have a very good credit score and I'm  willing to do anything to get a medical career.\n\nI'm not sure how to start again, I'm not getting any younger lol.\nBut if I'm getting  into a huge debt, at least I'll  prefer to get into an excellent university.\n\nThanks a lot  in advance  for taking your time in reading  my post.",
