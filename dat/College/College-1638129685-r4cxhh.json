  "text": "I\u2019m 23 and starting college this January. My college has some clubs and sports and I would like to join some. They have a bowling team, I used to be on a bowling league and I\u2019m very good at it so I want to join that and mabey a club or 2. I\u2019m Childless, I do work a minimum wage job. I live with my mom so I\u2019m not stressed about finances. I was at a community college on and off over the years since getting out of high school, it didn\u2019t work out. I always wanted to transfer from lack of clubs and such. I\u2019ve also had some severe health issues over the years that threw me out of college also. Any other non traditional college students join clubs or sports on campuses and have issues with age or acceptance get in the way or make it awkward for them",

      "text": "I transferred from CC to Uni when I was about 23. I did join a sorority for my 2 years there, but I have a baby face, so I look younger than I am. It was definitely weird to be around 18 year olds, but I mainly hung out with the juniors/seniors who were mostly 20/21 so it wasn't that bad. \n\nHowever, I learned that my age didn't really matter. It may be different if I was 33 and not 23, but joining clubs is easy to do, and most people just ask what grade you are, not your age. I hope this helps! good luck",
