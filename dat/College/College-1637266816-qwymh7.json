      "text": "The best way I've found to stay organized is in app called Habitica where you entire your to-do list, habits you want to track, and schedule and it makes it into a game with health points and skill levels and you can even fight monsters with friends. It made me stay on top of things more by giving my brain that little dopamine boost of scoring points and advancing in a game. If you decide to join and want to fight monsters together let me know!",
