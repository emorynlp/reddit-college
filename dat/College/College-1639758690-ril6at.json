  "text": "Last night I had a final exam through Proctorio. I decided to take after my 4 year old went to bed but he unexpectedly decided to get up and ask for help to go pee. I ended up talking and getting up because he was about to pee his pants and the bathroom light was off (he\u2019s terrified of dark). When I came back for the test, I was nervous because I realized I would be getting flagged and I started crying and could barely finish my exam. Pretty sure I will fail. I spent hours studying (up until 3am) and yea\u2026 let\u2019s just say I\u2019m not okay today. Stressed out all week with finals, work, and now this\u2026",

      "text": "Don\u2019t panic. Proctorio does not automatically assign a failing grade. It only flags \u201csuspicious activity\u201d for the instructor to review. If the sound was also being recorded, the instructor will hear the reason you needed to get up. Most instructors are really understanding that this is a possibility when students have to take a test at home.",

This wasn\u2019t entirely my fault, the professor didn\u2019t publish the exam module on time so the whole class started a few hours after it was supposed to end. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine. If you need to, explain your situation in office hours.",
