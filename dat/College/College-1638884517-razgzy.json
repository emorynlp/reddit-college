  "text": "Does anyone else hate going home for break? It drives me insane. I can\u2019t stand not having a set routine every day like I did when I was attending class. I might sound crazy but I actually really enjoyed getting up and going places. Now I feel like all I do is sit at home on my phone and wait to go to sleep. At least I had actual stuff to do during the day during fall semester. I also hate going home because I\u2019m closeted and my family is extremely homophobic, and they\u2019re also just racist so it\u2019s hard to enjoy time with them when they just spout off Fox News rhetoric. Am I alone? If not, any suggestions on how to combat this feeling of wanting to rip my hair out?",

      "text": "I used to have a really hard time with Christmas break due to loneliness and untreated depression/anxiety. It was pretty rough. One thing that helped was taking on some kind of winter project. One year I learned CSS by making a personal website, another year I spent the whole break applying for jobs. I think one time I was living in a house where there was a garage that none of the other roommates used, so I cleaned it out and made a nice workshop space for myself. Another year I just went to the gym a lot and hit some PRs. I don't really do this anymore since the anxiety is being treated effectively and I'm not lonely anymore (happily married), but I kind of miss having two weeks to myself to accomplish something cool.",
