  "text": "I want to go out tonight (nothing bad just with a friend ) and my mom doesn\u2019t like me going out at night even though I\u2019m fucking 20\n\nI called her this afternoon so that why she wouldn\u2019t call me tonight. \nThe convo \nMom: okay I\u2019ll call you again tonight before I sleep\n\nMe: actually I\u2019m gonna be studying so can I\u2019ll call you tomorrow morning \n\nMom: it\u2019s just to say hi to do \n\n(I get irritated) me: okay bye\n\n\nThen right now I wanted to call her again it\u2019s been like an hour after her call. I asked her about my nieces birthday as an excuse to randomly call her. She told me the details and still said she\u2019ll call me again tonight before she sleeps \n\nLike bruh why must you call me before you sleep.  If I called you twice today that should hint for you to leave me alone for today\n\nNow I have to wait till she about to sleep and prob have my friend wait. \n\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll use the old headache excuse \n\nBut it\u2019s just so irritating like I\u2019m in college I don\u2019t have to talk to you everyday \n\nBut if I use the headache excuse idk if she\u2019ll get suspicious",

My philosophy since moving out has always been if you don\u2019t pay for the phone I\u2019m not obligated to answer your call if I don\u2019t want to and I don\u2019t own you an explanation as to why I didn\u2019t answer. The do not disturb feature is amazing, even more amazing when it\u2019s set to respond for you.",

Don\u2019t and then just text her immediately that you are busy (you can mention with what, but don\u2019t say you\u2019re going out or anything that worries her, just say homework or whatever). \n\nI don\u2019t even say \u201cI\u2019m not taking calls because\u2026.\u201d If I know what the calls for, I\u2019ll just text her what she wants to know like \u201cMy appointment is Friday, I\u2019m doing work right now.\u201d \n\nDoes she have the track my iPhone app? Check your phone. Flip that off. Still make sure someone knows where you\u2019re going if you go out to party. Send it to a roommate or someone you trust. I send my locations to my best friends and vise versa.",

      "text": "Or just be honest with her? It kinda sounds like your mom is having difficulty with accepting the fact you're growing up and no longer need her as much as you once did. Talking to you right before going to sleep provides the comfort of knowing you're safe, the same way as seeing you at \"bed time\" did. Lying to your mom is only going to reinforce the belief that you aren't able to take care of yourself (cause \"only kids lie\") and will probably only result in argument, rather than the positive change you're wanting. \n\nI'd recommend just letting her know what's going on, explain that you have plans and probably won't be available to answer the phone every time she wants you to (and that's okay), but you'll definitely talk to her again. The next time this  type of situation comes up and you proactively call her and she says she'll call you again before she goes to sleep, just ask her why and take the conversation from there. \n\nJust try to remember that people tend to do things with positive motivations, try to figure out what that motivation is for her, and then provide reassurance that satisfies that motivation. It's a big change for both of you and it'll require compassion and understanding from both sides.",

Maybe it\u2019s time just talk to her once let her know you\u2019re OK and then don\u2019t answer her calls for the rest your day make it very clear when you talk to her that you\u2019re going to be busy today and then continue to do so every time she calls it\u2019s OK to talk to her once today and that\u2019s it just make it very clear that this needs to stop I understand that you\u2019re trying to be really nice to your mom she\u2019s your mom you love her Clearly but you\u2019re an adult colleges like your first step towards adulthood it\u2019s a transition. But you need to establish boundaries because you\u2019re forging your own life and your own path separate from your parents. So just be very clear how do you know that you love her but she can\u2019t keep calling you multiple times a day you have no problem talking to her every couple days or once a week or so but the daily or multiple times a day phone calls need to stop because it\u2019s not healthy for either of you in addition to the fact it\u2019s a little excessive there aren\u2019t that many developments in a three hour period in either of your lives beside may be making coffee or eating toast for breakfast. Sorry I couldn\u2019t be more helpful with this dude",
