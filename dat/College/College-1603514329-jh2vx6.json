  "text": "I've spent basically all my life with my academics being a priority, so I feel like I don't know what I would do if I'm not in school. I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing right now. Should I go to grad school? Should I be looking for jobs? Marriage? Buying a house? Fuck, dude I don't even know what I want to eat for breakfast tomorrow and now I'm just expected to make big decisions and  exist in society? Fucking COVID only makes things more terrifying and uncertain. I only have six months left and I feel so scared and lost. Please tell me I'm not the only one who feels this way.\n\n\nEdit: Wow this post gained a lot more traction than I was expecting. Thank you for all your kind words and advice getting this off my chest was quite cathartic, and it's nice to know that I'm not alone out here. Also thank you for my first award kind strangers!!",

      "text": "I think college can be a limiting experience for this very reason. People who are in their last year/about to graduate need to to be exposed to the real world. However, it\u2019s now your time to take the plunge! \n\nThe first year out of college will feel rough and weird. You feel a lot of sentimentality towards college and socially relate with a lot of students. The second year out is similar but it starts to considerably fade. Third year out? At this point, you probably relate more to people in their late 20s/early 30s than, say, 19 and 20 year old kids. It\u2019ll be better sooner than you think, too. By the time you\u2019re 24( certainly 25), adulthood doesn\u2019t progress on a linear scale. Everyone treats you like an adult and life events happen whenever you want them to happen. \n\nDon\u2019t go to grad school unless you are gifted in an academic discipline. Career experience will always best out degree credentials. \n\nCollege is just a bridge to this stage of life. It\u2019s not a template for how you should live your twenties.",

I know I want to move out of my god forsaken town, but I ain't really sure how to go about that. I just know for sure that marriage isn't a big focus for me. I don't care if I get married or not, but I definitely want to move and get a job in my hopefully ideal field. I'm not really sure what it will feel like to not have school and only have work. I've never experienced it. I think I just gotta jump in with both feet and go for it. I'll figure it out along the way and I'll do some things that'll make me go \"nope don't like that\" so I'll change those and stick with the things that make me feel good. \n\nSorry this is a but rambly",

You graduate college, go to medical school, and then they match you into a residency program and by the time you\u2019re fully certified, most people know where they\u2019re going to work. They basically walk you through the entire education and training process until you\u2019re 30 or older and finally fully licensed. I don\u2019t know what I would do if I was thrown into the streets at 22 and left to figure it out on my own.

If your school has one, talk to someone in career resources they should have a ton of resources to help you figure out what your next steps would be, whether it be job, grad school, or even a post grad co-op.",

I know for myself and a lot of other young professionals, the transition from college to the work force was challenging for the first couple of years after graduation. Put this in your head now, you are unlikely going to find a job you \u2018love\u2019 but you should aim to find a position you can tolerate or one that stresses you out the least. This is what everyone should be striving for, because in the end these workplaces see you as a replaceable commodity. There is no \u2018love\u2019 or \u2018loyalty\u2019 with any company, they\u2019ll drop you in a heart beat if it suits them, so think of your own interests first throughout your career. \n\nThere is a lot of bullshit in the workplace like office politics, nepotism and backbiting but honesty the only thing you should be doing is what\u2019s being asked of you by your manager, completing the task and letting it go as soon as you close your laptop and go home. \n\nLast thing I want to emphasize is learn how to SAVE your money. I can\u2019t stress this enough. As we\u2019ve learned this year, someone can eat a bat that spreads a virus and forces companies to lay off millions of people. Always Have at least 6 months worth of living expenses saved in case this scenario happens again.",

By being smart I mean being able to solve all of the problems that come up. And I think that is what people should strive for. Ask questions like: why am I afraid of this? Should I be afraid of this? What exactly is THIS.\n\nOk, I forgot my point.. Just be more aggresive. You are not being thrown out into a scary world, the world just can't control the beast that you are any longer and you are going to take it for a ride.",

Let\u2019s be generous and say your degrees let you and your spouse make double the median wage at $60K/each, this also happens to be roughly the average salary for workers with bachelors degrees. Household income before taxes puts you at about $120,000. After tax that is about $88,000. It\u2019s generally recommend you spend 30% of your income on housing, $2,200/month. Average home in CA is $605,000. Assuming your credit score is 800+ and you have $60,000 to make as a down payment you\u2019re looking at around $2,300/month for the mortgage, plus an additional $1,200/month for taxes and fees related to home ownership. Brining your total to $3,500/month. That\u2019s 47%. Include an additional $800 for food; $550 for healthcare; $550 for transportation; $800 in miscellaneous expenses. Now you\u2019re at $6,200 84%. Recommended percentage of income for savings and retirement is 20%, so by reducing that to 16% you could afford a home as long as you don\u2019t have a lot of discretionary spending. Obviously these numbers will fluctuate drastically and you could spend way more or less monthly on the various items listed. But also consider median home prices vary a lot. LA and SD are around $650K; San Jose is $1.2M; Santa Cruz is $877K; so unfortunately, realistically, no most of us won\u2019t be able to live in the cities our colleges are in.",

Graduate school is also a fine choice, but bear in mind that you can complete graduate school classes part-time while doing a full-time job, which can help you out money-wise if that will be an issue. I would put buying a house aside if you do not have a stable job yet and I would also not consider those as post-graduation plans if you do not have a great security net behind them. Your college may have a career center to aid you in creating a plan as well.",
