  "text": "From 8am to 12am, I am working on readings and assignments, with breaks to fulfill my basic needs for food and exercise. Four years in and I still have not been able to strike a balance and feel like a person again. Life feels so fulfilling and meaningful outside of college, to the point where a 40hr/week 9-5 job feels like the most freeing and life-affirming experience in the world. Have any of you felt this way and what changes did you have to make to get there? I find myself getting depressed and wishing away what's supposed to be a really enjoyable time.",

I'm studying medicine and almost every week was an 80 hour week for me. \"During semester\" or \"close to exams\" are not distinguishable to me, as I struggled to just keep up with the work you're constantly getting in.  Our lecture times range from 10 to 15 hours per week, on top of that we have 4-h-labs and 2-h-seminars as well as protocols and sometimes essays to write. It didn't even depend on wanting to score high or not, to just pass the exam you had to at least have seen all the material and that alone was time-shredding to say the least. Of course, this is somewhat expected of med schools and law schools, but I'm just trying to give some perspective that there are curriculums where you can be as smart and efficient as you like, they'll still demand every waking hour from you because of the large amounts. Then of course, it's your choice to chose such a degree in the first place.",

I think your problems may lie somewhere outside of school. \n\nBest of luck to you in your studies. I sincerely hope you manage to find a balance. Never be afraid to reach out to your professors for help, I cannot tell you how many times they have given me extra time due to a work overload. They are there to help you! \n\nAgain, best wishes to you!",

I do the same thing and I expect it, I even enjoy it to a point until I get too burnt out for the semester. Whatever credit hours a course is I assume that means spending double that or more studying outside of class to actually feel like I know the content. I also repeat videos in the background a lot to help with that repetition. That being said I do understand that I'm one of the more I don't want to say smarter but one of the ones whose in the group with the better grades although never as good as I would like.

I work 7-3:30 M-F and any time that is not in that schedule is *ME* time. I get home from work and I am DONE working. I can relax, I can play games, I can watch a movie, I can play with my dog, I can work on house projects, I can have a glass of whiskey, and hell, I can look at Reddit for 5 hours straight without worrying about a single homework assignment or test to study for. \n\nScrew college. It was not fun. I\u2019m having more fun now than I ever did in college. I don\u2019t have the constantly looming threat of due dates over me any more. I don\u2019t wake up realizing I forgot to print or submit something anymore. I don\u2019t have to constantly update an overflowing calendar anymore. I wake up and go to work and then I am done. Work life stays at work. \n\nTo summarize, yes I have absolutely felt like a college machine that does nothing but eat, do homework, and deprive myself of sleep. Stop letting people tell you what is the best part of your life. If you work over the summers and you love working that 40 hour week, don\u2019t let anyone tell you different. You love to do what you love to do, and nobody is taking that away from you",

There is a point where studying too much is counter productive and when I hear stories of people studying this much I think it is much moreso people being inefficient than school being that hard or time consuming.There is no world where everyone else in your major or majors are studying this much. Being efficient with time is a more important life skill to learn than whatever it is you're studying that much for every day. I've known many stem majors, med school students, and stem PhD students who have a study/work life balance that is healthy for the most part. It is possible no matter what your field is. The only way your studying is efficient for that long is if you have like a triple major worth of courses happening at the same time.",

Im high school I probably study(including homework) for about 40 a week outside school. I deprived myself of a teenage life because growing up I had major learning disabilities and I was really bad at school. Teachers told my parents that I wouldn\u2019t be able to graduate. I wanted to prove them wrong and now I\u2019ve worked my way in high school to be eligible for Top 30 colleges at least. However I hoped this would end after high school because I could hopefully have some kind of a social life in college but looks like that\u2019s not going to happen. Looks like college will be even worse than high school.",

          "text": "Fam you don't have to go to a traditional 4 year school just to prove people wrong, if you think you're going to be completely miserable and overworked then don't do it there are a ton of other options out there, trade schools or learn a craft or get really good at an instrument, it doesn't really matter. Take a year off after highschool and try to figure out what you want to do and who you are and what's important to you, not to the people you're wanting to prove wrong. You can always just take a couple classes at a time through community college to get your gen eds done too in a longer time span and then transfer those over to a university to finish out a major pretty much just taking classes that you are actually interested in. That being said if college is really something you want to do than go for it, there are learning disability services in college that might be a lot better than what you've got in highschool. There was a guy in one of my classes that really only had to do tests/quizzes because of it and it really helped him out. The other side of it is college is set up wayyyyyyy better than highschool, you don't go to every class everyday and just add on outside stuff as you want and that outside stuff is usually way more chill, most clubs meet like once a week for an hour or two and pretty much let you decide how much time you actually want to put into it, if you even want to join any at all. Start off just doing a 12 credit semester (without working if you can afford it) to get you to full time and see how it goes and adjust from there. At 12 credits you'll probably have maybe one class or sometimes two a day with a possible day or two completely off in addition to the weekend. OPs college experience is nothing like what the vast majority of people end up doing. Even if you go to an ivy league, keep in mind once you graduate your grades don't really have a huge impact on what jobs you can get, sometimes internships need a high gpa depending on what it is, but besides that the stuff you know and just the fact that you graduated matter wayyyy more than the fact you graduated with a 4.0. But seriously do some introspection and try to figure out why you really want to go. If it's just to prove people wrong and to get a 4.0 you're going to have a bad time, I've watched people do this and that first bad grade they get devastates them. It will happen and its really ok if you have to retake a class because you fails it, it's not the end of the world, or your college career. If it's because you want to get into field where you can get to research a specific kind of fern that lives in one mountain in Chile, or become a historian and get to nerd out about ancient Tibeten artifacts all day, or whatever you want to do, you're going to have a much much much better time in college. This is coming from somebody who has crazy ADHD, barely scraped through highschool (no idea how I graduated) but was super involved in band and photo stuff so I would be at school for 8-9 hours most days, then would go home and then go to work for another 6-7 hours with just enough time to eat before trying to sleep to wake up at 6 and do it all again, easily getting 70 hour weeks most of the time. Now in college Ive switched majors like 3 times going from material engineering to design and then now to filmmaking and I'm loving it. I have sooo much more free time than I ever did in highschool even when I was starting off in stem and I'll still probably graduate in only like 5 years despite everything, which again is completely ok take as long as you need to. Sorry for the long winded rant take all this with a grain of salt I'm just an idiot who's Ritalin is wearing off sitting at my computer procrastinating German homework I had all day to do. Basically just give yourself a break, smoke a bowl and try to figure out what you want the next few years of your life to look like\n\nTldr: college isn't for everybody and don't go for the wrong reasons, but if you do go then make the most of it which includes making friends and living life\n\nEdit: looked at your post history, CS is an awesome field if you like puzzles, programming is all puzzles combined with the abstract concept of math like the cool parts of calculus also combined with getting good at copying and pasting. Also most CS majors I know are not the traditionally best students and struggled hard with highschool",

I am also a learning assistant which is a class and I take hours to fix and write my own schedules for the class I lead, with things like research and other leadership positions required to graduate, these can eat up a lot of your time",

The causes of it seem to be:\n\n* Not pacing work properly (i.e. a mix between always trying to finish things as soon as they are assigned + procrastination as well)\n* Not taking breaks while working or studying\n* Poor sleep --> making it take longer to complete tasks and focus\n* Putting in more effort than required even if we KNOW the difference in the result will be negligible (e.g. if I already have enough buffer in my grade to take a few hits, don't grind too hard!)\n* Not knowing when to give up on an extremely difficult, thought-intensive assignment (either come back to it later after doing other work that's less stressful, or accept the loss)\n\nI also agree that 9-5 jobs allow me to feel like a human for obvious reasons. Even when there is work to do after working hours, it's never even close to the amount and difficulty that comes from college work, and it's probably in your area of expertise.\n\nWant some actionable advice right now? Get an app like Toggl which will help you track how much time you're spending on tasks every day. It's pretty eye-opening.\n\nSee if you can correct some of the pitfalls I listed. I'm still far from feeling free, but I'm seeing gradual improvement each semester.",

My point is that seek help from a counselor for time management and see if you need help with any academics or anything. You need to have a life man. Not saying you need to change a major or anything but you might see if you\u2019re struggling with something and that way you can have time to relax and do things you love \n\nI switched my major my sophomore year and graduated in 3 years total.

Most schools will have a psychologist on hand who can talk to you more about what you're experiencing and see if it's a symptom of something, or at least recommend you to someone who can help if they feel like it isn't.",

              "text": "So as a freshman, you usually have a lot of weed out courses that will have quite a bit of work. You'll find that as you go on you get less work but the problems require a lot more thought to get done. For example, your calculus class is a weed out, and probably has a few dozen problems per set. Later on in junior year for instance, you might only have 4 problems that will take you a whole week to do. Just as a heads up.\n\n\nHere's my schedule, Mondays are light only a chaos theory class and an observational astronomy class which total about 2 hours total. Because class load is light this day, I do the majority of my research and homework this day. I try to get 2-4 hours of legitimate work in. So during that time I put my phone away, don't use snapchat, insta, reddit, Spotify. I don't listen to music cause it breaks the flow if you focus on a song or have to change occasionally. Just sit down and work. Start small, challenge yourself to 15 minutes no work no distractions at all. If that's too easy great! Increase it. I try to work in 90 minute blocks of 70 minutes of focus like this, 20 minutes of break where I can get water, snack, bathroom, check my phone etc. If I still have work to do, I repeat the block.\n\n\nThe key is, even if you are done with work, always be working if you have time left in your block. Read ahead in your book, begin the next assignment. For instance, my observable astronomy has a problem set due in 3 weeks. I started already and work on the parts I know how to do. You'll thank yourself for working ahead.\n\n\nYou're in an interesting spot. Freshman year is tough cause you have to adjust. I didn't think the classes were difficult, I thought everything else was. Having to feed yourself, even if it's from a dining hall. Laundry. You don't have many friends yet. You don't understand the college system and how professors typically work in college. I was overwhelmed, so I totally get it. You Wil ladjust trust me, and it took me time.\n\n\nDid that help at all?",

I also commuted to and from school so on campus activities meant 30 or so minutes to and from if I wanted to go or I stayed on campus. \n\nI found that when you have a free moment meditation and just deep breathing can really help.",

Maybe like once per semester for like 2-3 days if I get unlucky but long term it seemed very manageable.\n\nCould you perhaps ease off on some hard classes? You sound like the high achieving type, I assume you\u2019re striving for 4.0 Perhaps you could \u201cnegotiate a deal\u201d with yourself: sacrifice .2 off of your GPA for some free time. How much is that really GPA worth if it ruins every waking day of your life for several years?\n\nOr maybe you need to work on studying more effectively? Unless you\u2019re PHD student, To be studying that long every day for an undergrad degree sounds like lots of \u201cdead brain time\u201d where you take 3 hours to do a realistically 30 minute task. Improving sleep and only studying in the morning when I\u2019m most alert is huge with this in my experience.",

It doesn't seem like much but the difference between like a 3.7 and a 4.0 (not precise science here, but you get my point) is an enormous amount of study time. I relate to OP a lot, I think my GPA could have been a good bit lower and saved me a ton of stress without affecting my life much at all. Best of luck though! Just be smart about your situation in terms of your particular industry/field and what type of GPA you actually need. Maybe you are interested in grad school, which places a lot of weight on a strong GPA, painting in broad strokes. On the flip side, maybe you're in a niche field where you can just pass and have plenty of jobs opportunities. Hard work for hard works sake isn't helping anyone, least of all you.",

That's a pretty normal feeling among students I think. Personally, and I don't mean to encourage any unhealthy lifestyles, but I actually enjoy this. I find it fulfilling to spend so much of my time learning and expanding my knowledge for myself. It feels like in the work world, I'm creating for someone else or some soulless business, and academics feels like it's ultimately something that is only beneficial to me, and for that reason I do enjoy the constant studying and late nights.

It's tough to say with breaks and moving around but I'm there like 9am-7pm. Usually I go over but that's the plan. I leave around 5 on fridays. Take off Saturdays unless theres an exam. And a light sunday. I know you can never be prepared enough and I understand how stressful it is. But try and look at it like a 9-5 job. You have lectures so if you reeeally need to dont count this as work time but count traveling to and from locations as work time. Small talk is fine too just like at work and its healthy. I like to spend time at the gym before a long homework grind and eat well. It can be pretty horrible I know but that's why campus life is a thing. Hopefully you can surround your school work with so much life you dont lose your mind. That's my strat but I admit I'm still working on execution",

We all have our own fucking struggles in life and in school, and yes, I know that STEM majors are very busy as well, but that doesn't mean they need to spend 24/7 on their classes. There are SO MANY resources that schools provide to help with scheduling and making life easier, specifically so the students can succeed. And just because I personally like music more than STEM, doesn't mean it's not a real major and real career path. I LITERALLY have no other passions in life, at least not as strong as music, so maybe don't be a bitch to someone you don't know. Music is the only thing that makes me happy in life and people need to learn to respect that. None of us have it easy in this life, and it never will be unless you learn to respect people, especially ones you don't know. I was just trying to help OP by saying that the workload is more than necessary like a lot of people were also saying, and that there should be a way to fix it. Try being nice next time.",
