  "text": "I\u2019m currently in my fifth year of college, and should be graduating in the spring. This past summer I attempted 3 courses in which I completely neglected out of choice. This semester, I tried for the first two weeks and have also neglected my classes. I never wanted to go to college, but my parents forced me. As someone who just turned 18 at the time, I felt like I couldn\u2019t say no. I am completely disinterested in school I have literally no desire to continue. Although my parents forced me to go to college, I\u2019m the one who has paid all years. I\u2019m aware I\u2019m close to finishing and it\u2019s a huge waste of money but I just don\u2019t want to do it anymore. I am just going back and forth and don\u2019t really know what to do - also my brother dropped out and I would be first gen graduate which is why I\u2019m nervous. Any advice would be great and please be honest :/",

I promise you, you\u2019re not alone in feeling that way. Put in the minimum amount of effort to pass and graduate, and then once you\u2019ve done that you may never use the degree, but more likely than not it will be helpful at least to some extent. Good luck. Best wishes.",

If you were first or second year I\u2019d suggest am honest convo with your parents about your goals in life, etc.  But you\u2019re closer to the end than to the beginning, so just do the minimum to pass what you have to pass and gtfo.  Then you can proceed to do whatever you would have done instead of college, but with a degree in hand, which can only help you.\\*\n\n\\*Unless your degree has a negative ROI, meaning that what you spend on it (plus interest on student loan debt) is more than the lifetime earnings increase you get compared to not having it.  It\u2018s mostly arts and humanities majors who have to worry about this, unfortunately.",
