  "title:": "Struggling with Early Decisions",
  "text": "Hi, this might be more of an immature question, but I really want to hear some thoughts on more experienced people.\n\nSo I'm a high school senior from California with pretty good academics and extracurricular activities that makes me competitive to many colleges. I want to major in marketing (or in those areas) and thought of applying to ED at NYU. I talked to many of my teachers, counselors, parents, college students about my probability of going in, and I believe it is almost guaranteed. Even without the ED, they see great chances of me being accepted.\n\nHowever, there are 3 components that hold me back from applying ED.\n\n1. The city-campus style doesn't appeal to me very well.\n2. I am in a relationship and I want to preserve this relationship and I don't think long-distance is going to help\n3. Just in general I prefer the atmosphere of California better than New York\n\nSo there are many factors that interfere with my decisions. I haven't told my parents' reason #2 because I already know their reactions. They are very supportive, and they understand reasons #1,3 and they feel it is the best for me to sacrifice some preferences and pursue great education at NYU.\n\nIn California, I am aiming for UC Berkely or UCLA, because UCB provides a great business program (HAAS) and UCLA has been showing great growth. Compared to my chances at NYU, I am aware my chances will be much lower, with increasing applicants each year and the absence of leverage from applying as ED.\n\nIf I apply to ED, I will be bound to NYU and eliminate my chances of going into any UCs. I would rather go to UCLA or UCB than NYU. Of course, it is not 100% guaranteed, but I want some insight into this situation. If I don't apply to ED, I will still apply to NYU as RD and apply to other UCs and other colleges. Which gives me more space to address my reasons #1\\~3.\n\nI'm just very uncertain if I am willing to risk my chances of admissions for the 3 reasons I listed above. Many people might think high school relationships don't last, and I am aware of how little it may be in my life. Of course, asking such life-determining choices to a fray of strangers on the internet might not be the greatest idea, but I want to hear from people that were in similar positions as I am right now.",

      "text": "All those schools sound nice, but maybe you want to consider how much $ each school is going to give you too unless money is not an issue. I mean you are going to be paying tuition for what seems like a medical degree for a bachelors degree. Keep in mind if you didn\u2019t apply for a specific program, you aren\u2019t going into NYU for Stern/business for example. You will be accepted as a general major and have to reapply. Don\u2019t apply to a school because they have a good program. Apply for the specific program beforehand.",

      "text": "First of all, your relationship is not going to survive college and you shouldn\u2019t want it to. This is a time to embrace new experiences. Nobody stays with their high school sweetheart all throughout college and the longer you drag it out, the more you\u2019ll regret it looking back.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like the NYU campus then I wouldn\u2019t apply ED. Get into the best school you can, that feels right for you.",
