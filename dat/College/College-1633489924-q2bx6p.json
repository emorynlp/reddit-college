  "text": "I have had two classes in college where I just could not get the material even though I put a ton of effort into said material. One was basic chemistry (7 hour days studying, plus my then job and 5 hours of sleep a night). The other was welding (we only got 6-10 hours to weld each week). If you aren\u2019t grasping the material are their techniques you have used to great success??? My welding class is very hands on and I\u2019m almost finished with school but am having a hard time learning the welding techniques.",
