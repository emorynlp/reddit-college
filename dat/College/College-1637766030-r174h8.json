  "text": "I'm freaking out because I do not feel prepared enough for the exam that I'm writing tomorrow as I only started studying today since I had to study for another exam before today. I have gone through everything but I doubt that I will remember everything that I need to remember for tomorrow. I did take some photos of stuff that can help me score marks tomorrow on my phone so that I can check the photos when I'm like using the bathroom or walking home or something just to revise them... Does anyone have some tips or anything?",

I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do wonderful since you seem very on top of things, but even if you don\u2019t it isn\u2019t the end of the world. Your value is never going to be based on any number so don\u2019t let it get to you. Just try your best and the universe will do the rest for you.",
