  "text": "Hey! \nI\u2019ll try to keep this simple: I need advice on the best, fastest, cheapest way to finish my bachelors degree. any help is welcomed and appreciated. \non mobile so formatting :P \n\nI messed up my first 3 years of school but ended up getting an associates of arts in business at a community college. \n\nI work as a Paraprofessional (teacher aide) in a Texas school district, it\u2019s my second year. \n\nthey pay us pennies (teacher salary isn\u2019t much better but as a single woman living modestly with no kids? I could do a lot with that salary) and it\u2019s my first year living on my own and i\u2019ve realized that I need to make more than 17k to survive AND enjoy it. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind teaching as a career even tho my AA is in Business. I just want to finish a 4 year degree to open up remote options or maybe continue teaching (early childhood)\n\nmy main goal is just to finish my BA with as little debt as possible. \n\nbut there\u2019s so many ways to go about it: finish my BA in Business and get a certificate to teach, restart some of my credits and switch to a teaching degree? \n\nI\u2019m just really lost and I don\u2019t have the money to spend on school and I really don\u2019t wanna take out loans. Besides the normal advice (scholarships, FASFA which I will be applying for) what do yall think is the fastest, cheapest way to finish up those classes, either in business or education? \n\nI hope this wasn\u2019t confusing and I\u2019m available to add more info, i just don\u2019t wanna be house poor and living paycheck to paycheck on this teacher side salary, getting a raise of not even $50 a check every year. \n\nThank you!",

      "text": "Community college or online school sounds like a good bet. You can take a couple classes at a time while still being a para. \n\nAlso do some research on districts near you, if you want to continue teaching. There\u2019s a district in minneapolis that will pay off teachers debt if they work there for five years. Might be something similar in your area.",
