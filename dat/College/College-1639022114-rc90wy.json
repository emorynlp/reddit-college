  "text": " I just got my final grade that I was not expecting because multiple TAs told me I had an A-. The actual grade was a B+ just because according to him the \"online grades the TAs are looking at are faulty\". This feels like a slap to my face because I believed I worked hard in his class to get an A-.  Are there any basis to appeal this grade, or should I just take this as a lesson and not trust my TAs?",

The only thing that matters is documented assessment, meaning your graded assignments and the rubric provided on the syllabus. If the online grades that you can access add up to an A-, but you got a B+ then there is reason to appeal, otherwise there is not.",
