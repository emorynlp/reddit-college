  "text": "I'm moving into my first unfurnished apartment in a little under two months. I've never bought my own bed before, and I'm overwhelmed by all the options out there. Also, I've heard that people usually spend $1000+ on a mattress alone, which seems outrageous for a college student :(\n\nSo, where did you guys go to get a bed frame and/or mattress? I know that people sometimes buy furniture from Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, etc., but I'm wary of doing that for a bed. \n\nI'm open to pretty much any recommendations, but I'd prefer something that's relatively easy to assemble. Also, my budget is flexible, but it'd be amazing to get an entire bed for under $500.",

I don\u2019t recommend a mattress off Facebook Marketplace for the risk of bedbugs",
