  "text": "My second semester last spring fucked me really bad. Had a depressive episode and a long period of self-isolation. My grades were the lowest they\u2019d been since I was in second grade. I didn\u2019t want to bring it up with anyone there because the staff were extremely unhelpful\u2014at one point, I had a prof that blatantly told me that \u201ccollege might not be the right fit for me\u201d in my first semester.\n\nI\u2019m fucking scared to try that again. I don\u2019t want to go back to how things were. I slept an average of 5-6 hours a night and was barely able to focus enough to make the grades I did. I felt like even 4 classes was too much for me to handle.\n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do at this point.",
