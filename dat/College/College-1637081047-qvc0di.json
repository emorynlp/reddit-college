  "title:": "Suggestions for exchange university",
  "text": "I\u2019m a business major in Sweden, and in one month I need to make a choice on where to go for exchange (6 months). I have good grades and extra credits, so whatever country and university I choose I\u2019m somewhat confident I can get a spot there. Nevertheless I still need to make 3 choices in order of most wanted. \n\nReason I\u2019m asking is that I have no clue where to go. I have never been outside of Sweden for more than a couple of weeks at a time, so this is big for me. I\u2019m mostly thinking either the United States or East Asia to really get away for a while, although I\u2019m open for everything. I want it to be a nice balance between a fun experience, while also being a decent university that\u2019ll look good on my resume. \n\nThe university I\u2019m studying at in Sweden (JU) is not an \u201celite\u201d school, so don\u2019t expect any top tier partnership schools. \n\nHere\u2019s the list (ignore the first few sentences in Swedish):\n\n[Partner Universities](https://ju.se/student/gamla-exchangesidor-sv/partneruniversitet/partneruniversitet-for-jibs.html)\n\nThe universities I\u2019m slightly leaning towards after a very brief research are:\n\nUS:\n\nMontana state university - mostly due to the outdoors activities such as backpacking and hiking that I like. \n\nUniversity of Oklahoma - The campus seems very nice, also seems like a decent school.\n\nEast Asia:\n\nYonsei University (South Korea) - one of SK best universities.\n\nKorea University (South Korea) - same as above.\n\nCity university of Hong Kong - Seems like a very good university. \n\nAny suggestions are highly appreciated.",
