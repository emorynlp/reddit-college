      "text": "I\u2019m an IT student, ex CS student. CS is HARD. I got an A in every programming/CS class but the math will destroy you unless you\u2019re great at math. A CS major will be like 1 class away from a minor in mathematics. If you hate math or suck at math, go CIS/IT/MIS/IS instead. You can still be a developer or work in security with these as well",
