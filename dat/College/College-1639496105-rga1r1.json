  "text": "So im currently taking 4 classes 3 credits each. I am failing one of the classes and the final is due today, but even if i get 100 on the final, i will still fail the class. If the number grade is irrelevant in the end because of the F, then i dont want to waste my time writing the final. \n\nMy question is- when calculating the gpa, do colleges use the actual number grade, or do they just use the letter grades? \n\nIs getting a 60 and failing any better than getting a 40 and failing for my gpa? or does it not matter because eiter way it is an F?",

      "text": "Does your percent grade go on your transcript? If so, a higher grade looks better. If not, then only letter grade matters. GPA is calculated on a scale where an F is already 0 GPA points (a D is 1 GPA point). You can\u2019t have a negative GPA - an F is an F. So as long as your numeric grade won\u2019t go on your transcript, and you\u2019re sure you\u2019re going to get an F regardless, you should skip the final.",
