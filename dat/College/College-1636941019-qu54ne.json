  "text": "Pretty normal dude here, decent looks, and a confident attitude. Got called creepy WTF?\n\nBeen trying to get with my neighbor for so long now. She recently started hanging out with me 1 on 1 to smoke with me. I\u2019m not a heavy smoker but since it\u2019s her I make an exception. I have my own weed. Most of the time she uses hers sometimes we use mine. We generally talk about random shit and nothing else much. There were a few times when I slipped up (I don\u2019t smoke much) and said some dumb shit when I was high exposing my interest in her in a not so smooth way. Needless to say, I never said or did anything too concerning. Last night out of nowhere we get deep into conversation and I ask for her opinion on me. She said good things but then said \u201ca little creepy.\u201d I got irritated and said fuck that and left. I\u2019m so blown cuz I kinda liked her and I have never ever been called creepy before. Not sure what this means and if I should just move on. Even my roomates are stumped.",

Only difference was she always comes over after going out (meaning she\u2019s usually wearing almost nothing) and one night I think I kinda stared at her too much cuz I was high and didn\u2019t know how to interact and I know that was definitely creepy. However, I really don\u2019t think it should ruin all the interactions I\u2019ve had with her. Makes no sense",

You took it too personally and that\u2019s honestly very unattractive, if anything it\u2019s a warning sign. I find it strange when guys take things personally. \n\nI think what you were looking for was for her to say she finds you attractive and would like to hang out with you more but it didn\u2019t happen and you got upset with the comment she made in which was her saying she\u2019s not really into you without directly saying it. \n\nMove on?",

In the future, if you want a romantic and sexual relationship with someone, you have to think about how you two get along and what kind of energy y'all have together. Don't just start making sexual moves on everyone. Don't just make sexual moves because you're alone with a girl. Don't just make sexual moves because you're horny and you can see a lot of her body. Make sexual moves because you love the girl, because she loves you, because you trust each other, because she indicates that sex a possibility for the two of you, and because she's given you permission. Save sex for romantic relationships. Sex is way better when it's with someone you have a strong relationship with.",
