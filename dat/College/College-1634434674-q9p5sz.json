  "text": "Hello Reddit, \n\nI came from an abusive household. I struggled with college and grades for nine years. I spent 5 years in community College and then transfered. \n\nI do not have my graduate degree, but I do have a decent associate degree. Once I realized my living condition, I dropped out. I took a year to heal and recover from everything. I feel so much better now. I have the hope and courage to go back. \n\nProblem: My GPA is too low to graduate from my university.I believed it is under a 1.5 \n\nI have taken so many classes and failed them. Would it be better for me to try again at another school?\u00a0 Retake all of them at the old school? \nOr, Go to a trade school? \nI worry with all the classes I failed then it would take another four years to graduate with a high enough GPA. \n\nIf that is the case, then would it be better to transfer to a new school and have a fresh start?\n\nI don't want to live forever making shit pay. \n\nI am intelligent. I am active within the class. I want to become a college librarian.",
