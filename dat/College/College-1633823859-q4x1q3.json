  "title:": "First time on an campus since March 2020, and I already feel overwhelmed",
  "text": "I was transferred to a four year uni after three and a half years in community college (one in lockdown) and I feel overwhelmed to the point of having a breakdown.  I'm taking four classes plus volunteering in the student radio station, my work-study job, volunteering as a photographer for the school newspaper (which I haven't submitted a single photo nor gone to a single photoshoot), and participating in my major's main student organization (which I haven't attended a single meeting despite paying an $85 membership fee). \n\nI feel disorganized and even physically sick from all this and I just want to quit. I also ran out of my SSR meds and in transition to a new mental health clinic so I'm not sure if I can handle this weekend. My heart is heavy and pounding and my mind feels cloudy.",

      "text": "Going off of clownsocks_, I believe you should also lighten your load. Keep your work-study job, but quit the volunteering stuff if you can. There's no point in keeping the volunteer work if it's just going to stress you out. You already have some experience from the volunteer work, keep that experience but for your own sake drop the volunteer work if possible.",
