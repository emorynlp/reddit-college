      "text": "If there's no way to bring the F up to a D, then you have two options.\n\n1. Take the final just to see what is on it. This might help you understand what will be on next semester's final for this class when you inevitably retake it. This option is more viable for online exams.\n\n2. Don't bother to take the final and focus your energy on other finals for classes that you can pass.\n\nWhat you do is entirely up to you as neither option will affect your final chem grade. Do what you feel is best and more advantageous for you to do.",
