  "text": "I just had a week-long fall break. My parents dropped me off yesterday. I have friends and rehearsals filling my time, but I am really missing home. It is the same type of weepy feeling I got when my parents dropped me off as a freshman last year. (But it was worse because I wasn't allowed to see them for three straight months last year because of COVID).  \n\nI'm a sophomore. I feel like this feeling should have passed already. But it hasn't. It's not even like I had a fantastic time on break- it was kinda lackluster. I just miss it like crazy. I'm only an hour and a half away. Still, I can't go back until Thanksgiving because of my schedule. I don't know. Does anyone else feel like this?",

      "text": "I feel you. I\u2019m a freshmen and only a 2-ish hour drive from home, so it\u2019s tempting for me to drive home whenever I feel like it. I went home for the last two weekends (one was for a specific event and the other was my fall break, though mine was only a four day weekend) and I was still tempted to go home this weekend. The longest I\u2019ve gone without driving home was three weeks, and I\u2019ve gotten multiple comments that I visit home a lot. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019ve been having trouble making any friends here and I\u2019m pretty lonely most of the time. I think I would be less tempted to drive home if I didn\u2019t feel like I spent most of my weekends sitting around my dorm doing nothing anyways. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of funny because I remember thinking all the time over the summer and my senior year that I couldn\u2019t wait to move to college and be independent, and now that I actually have I just want to go home all the time. Part of me feels like I should be trying not to visit to much so I can get used to be independent, but also, there\u2019s not really any harm in wanting to be close to your family.\n\nI know I didn\u2019t really offer any helpful advice or anything, and I\u2019m a freshman so it\u2019s kind of different, but I hope it\u2019s at least a little helpful to know you aren\u2019t the only one feeling homesick.",
