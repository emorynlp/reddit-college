  "text": "So here\u2019s my situation:  I\u2019ve been in college on and off since 2015, and currently have 89 credits towards a physics degree.  I\u2019ve come to absolutely despise physics and simply cannot finish a physics degree.  I\u2019ve decided to switch to cybersecurity.  I cannot handle traditional school and need to find an online program where I can go at my own pace.  I work more than 40 hours a week with a constantly changing schedule so it\u2019s very important that I can do schooling just a little bit at a time and when it fits my schedule.  I\u2019ve been looking into different colleges with online cybersecurity programs, but I\u2019m not sure how to tell if a school would be a good fit.  Do you have any suggestions for schools or tips on how to narrow my search effectively?",
