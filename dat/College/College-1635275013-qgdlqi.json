  "text": "Q: Has anyone had issues with their aid changing or ANYTHING else when going to school for a longer time? I\u2019m taking classes outside my major and there\u2019s no minor offered for it. (I\u2019m not worried about graduating on time at all, only the cost)\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground:  I haven\u2019t gotten to take many courses in my engineering major because I need to pass calc first (I took it once before but now I\u2019m on track). Next semester I could get into the nitty gritty but I want to continue the music theory class and piano class that I\u2019ve been filling credits with for aid. I\u2019ll still be doing physics and speech(req.) but then I\u2019d take theory II and piano II as well.\n\nI declared a mechanical design concentration this semester for the school. Starting in 2018, I took 3 semesters undeclared and then left school for 3 semesters. Thankfully my aid was great. I\u2019ve done the intro CAD and etech classes but other than that I\u2019m filling space until I can continue. My advisors have sucked and student loan debt in general is too damn high so I\u2019m trying to continue avoiding it.",

      "text": "Personally, I would dive in head first into your engr classes. All of them have to be done in order to move ahead at some point, and when you are at a pinch point layer you may need to take other classes, which is when I'd turn back to music classes as fillers. I took my last semester with only 2 classes and did a personal project for the other time. You could have an amazing senior project with extra time. So no, don't take music now, get on with it.",
