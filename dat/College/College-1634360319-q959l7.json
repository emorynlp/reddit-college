  "text": "Hi everyone! I just submitted an essay 25 minutes late and was wondering if anybody had experience with nice professors who didn\u2019t penalise them (trying to get my hopes up TT) I emailed the prof and took full responsibility (attributing it to my procrastination, subsequent internet error, and then fixing an error on my essay itself- perhaps i shouldn\u2019t have done this \ud83d\ude2d) anyways i took full accountability and I\u2019ve never been late to their class/ submitted a late assignment. What are my odds of getting full credit? Syllabus says a reduction of a third of a grade each day the assignment is late :(.",

For example, even a minute late counts for a deduction. but maybe ur prof is accepting??",

As long as it\u2019s in before the end of the day (or before the next lecture, if it\u2019s later that day) they probably won\u2019t care. Unless they do. Some close submission at the exact second it\u2019s due.",
