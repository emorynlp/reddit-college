      "text": "Can you take a semester off?  If your mental health issues are that bad they need to take priority. It will only make things worse if you go back to school before you're ready.  I'm speaking from experience.  My issues caused me to eventually flunk out and I just returned about a year ago after being away from school for 10 years (I had to get reinstated due to my low grades when I attended previously). When you look at my transcript you can see where I was having issues because it shows in my grades.  When I was doing okay I had all A and B's, when my mental health was bad I was extremely lucky if I got a D. Doing poorly in school just added to my stress and issues. Get in with your doctor as soon as you can to discuss whatever is going on and see what treatment options you have.  Best of luck.",

Plus i dont want to tell my parents why. Ibe hidden this from them for so long and idk how to even go about telling them im falling apart.",

Honestly taking a semester off to take care of your health is more important than not \"falling behind.\" Also, I'm sure your parents would prefer to know that something is going on and what it is.  If they're good parents they probably already suspect something is up and will be happy to find out what it is and help you with it.",
