  "text": "I was blessed to find a GA job right before the semester began. Because of that, I decided to move on campus into an apartment since I live an hour away (my classes are online).  I moved in last week, but never spent the night since I still had some things at home.  Late in the week, I recieved an email from one of the housing directors summoning to attend a hearing for a drug violation.  I was surprised as I don't do drugs and I was only in the room for a total of probably 120 minutes over a two-day period.  Long story short, I was cleared. The basketball coach was cc'ed in the email and my roomates happen to be on the team so it could have been something with them.. My mom keeps trying to get me to change rooms. They have one available.  It's a private dorm. I'm 26, so I have reservations. I stayed in one all four years in undergrad. I still have been given approval to leave though of I want to.  Is moving out a smart thing to do in this situation?",

      "text": "If you've only lived there a week and your roommates are already causing issues for you, run for the hills! Having bad roommates can be the difference between a calm year and a chaos year. I'd move if I were you. Not sure what the difference is with the private dorm. Do you get to live alone? That would be my choice, over roommates.",
