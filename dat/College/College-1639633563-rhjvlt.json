  "text": "I\u2019m really bummed honestly. If I were just depending on grants and scholarships I wouldn\u2019t be bothered by having to start over but I\u2019m paying out of pocket so it\u2019s like $1000 down the drain. It was a math class, I\u2019m a Comm major so will never use math again just needed it for general ed. I only have myself to blame, I took on a full time job plus part time interning while being a FT student and I just didn\u2019t have time to nail this class and I\u2019ve never been good at math. I was already at a low D and took the final exam today and I feel  sure it\u2019s gonna pull me to an F. Any words of wisdom? I just wanna feel better tbh lol. I\u2019m usually a really good student (like I JUST got accepted into the honors program and will probably be kicked out because this is gonna wreck my gpa). I don\u2019t know what happened",

I don't know the standards and expectations of your university, but Auburn University let me graduate with the low grade.\n\nI recommend you speak with your course advisor before you retake the course.  When you pay for your courses, you are also paying for guidance from your course counselor. They may let you graduate with the low grade if you excel in your Comm courses. \n\nI hope my guidance was helpful. Let me know if you need anything else, and if you speak to your advisor, tell me how it goes. Best of luck to you!",
