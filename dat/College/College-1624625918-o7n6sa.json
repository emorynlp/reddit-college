Fellow anthropology majors, what are you doing with your degrees?",

She\u2019d of needed a history degree or a go back and get masters/licensure program. \n\nShe was not qualified for museum work. Museums wanted a masters for her. Her dream was working at the Smithsonian and being a curator. She couldn\u2019t even find work at small museums without a masters. \n\nWhy am I saying this? Because there is a HIGH chance you\u2019ll need a masters. \n\nBut for full disclosure, I am not saying it\u2019s impossible to find work. Or you can\u2019t find work. I\u2019m  merely saying anticipate either a graduate education or a double major in undergrad to make yourself more competitive in the job market.",

Try to experience as much as you can, whether it\u2019s:\n* research (I thought this was just a STEM thing\u2013nope)\n* executive board in an organization (closer to your intended career is better but it could literally just be on the marketing team of Photography Club or a cultural organization)\n* a part time job (again, one that\u2019s more relevant to your field is better but even a fast food position has opportunities for leadership\u2013e.g. student supervisor at University-owned Starbucks or restaurant)\n* study abroad\n* teaching assistant (great opportunity to develop relationships with your professor for a future letter of recommendation or reference\u2013soooo much easier to ask for one from someone who actually knows and that you\u2019re comfortable with versus never having spoken to them)\n* university internships (e.g. libraries/archives, art galleries, if you\u2019re trying to get into the museum route)\n* a hobby that produces more tangible results (e.g. you formed an online magazine, writing blog posts)\n* volunteering\n\nIf you plan on trying to find an entry level job right after undergrad as opposed to higher education, you\u2019ll learn that lots of job listings often \u201crequire\u201d 1-2 years of experience. You should always apply for a job, even if you think you aren\u2019t qualified. However, you should know that 1-2 years of experience can come from internships, research, part time job, volunteering, and even certain hobbies. I wasn\u2019t very active in college which means I am having to gain experience during post-grad in order to hopefully find a job... And lots of those opportunities are no longer available to me (e.g. research)... Definitely take advantage of college when you\u2019re still there.",

      "text": "Well I think another comment hit the nail on the head. You should go to school with a career path in mind. It\u2019s a shame education has to be this way but it unfortunately is.\n\nHowever, there are several options. You can go be a teacher. You can pursue further education and teach the subject in college yourself. Officer in the military. There are several graduate degrees you can transfer to because the prerequisite require a 4 year in any major. Business, social work, attorney, doctor, pharmacist are all options plus more. Some\nmay require additional prerequisites and my advice would be to take those classes as your electives if you still can. There\u2019s also jobs that will hire you simply because you have a degree.\n\nYour degree isn\u2019t a dead end if you do something about it. If you just settle on your 4 year alone though, it will be tough to make good use out of it.",
