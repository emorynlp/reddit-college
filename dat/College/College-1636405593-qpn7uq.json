  "text": "I'm a first year who's finding it harder and harder to wake up in the morning. It might be a seasonal thing (moved from CA to the east coast), or that I'm running out of stamina, i dont really know. I got sick last week and didn't leave the room for a few days, and now I feel even more unmotivated and I'm starting to get worried. \n\nStudents who've struggled with sleep, how did you fix it? Was there a specific plan/ strategy you used? How did you get over seasonal depression?",

      "text": "I sleep at around 12 to 1 am. I can't really sleep before that because my body just won't fall asleep. I just set my alarm's ringtone to a siren and set it in full volume. Wakes me up every morning with a bit of an adrenaline rush for mostly 2 reasons: \n(1)I would \"panik\"/be more alert when I hear a siren(which i think is a normal response to the sound) \n\n(2)I live with my family so the thought of my alarm making them think there really is an emergency is the main thing that wakes me up everytime I hear the alarm begin.\n\nI said (2) as the main thing that wakes me up because I've been using this as an alarm for 2 years now and my body somehow got used and knows its an alarm if the siren is accompanied by a vibration in my bed.\n\nSorry if there's a mistake in my grammar, i'm still learning english",

      "text": "With melatonin and if I know I have to fix my sleep schedule start reading before you sleep. I started doing this and it helped but I recently started using my phone again before sleeping and it\u2019s fucks witt my sleep schedule.\n\nI not a big reader but it something that is starting to grow on me. I used to read like 5 pages and just sit there then out of boredom ( no phone ) but now I enjoy reading a few chapters before realizing I need to knock out. Find books that interest you. I need to get back into as well",
