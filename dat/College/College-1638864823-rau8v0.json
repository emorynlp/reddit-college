  "text": "One of the paths I am considering the most is to do community college to get an associates and generals in order to transfer to a university to also get a bachelors. This would mean I technically have 2 degrees, what degree combos would be a good Idea, what would be versatile and useful? \nP.S. Im not even sure if this is something you can just do so If this isnt allowed please let me know.",

      "text": "You\u2019re not really going to have 2 different degrees. Because if you want your BS in say, business, you\u2019re going to need to do all do they pre-reqs to transfer for the BS program. That means doing a lot of lower-division business classes\u2026 which means you\u2019ll probably end up with a AS in business. So you won\u2019t have 2 degrees really, they\u2019ll be the same.\n\nYou can\u2019t really just do like a AA in history and transfer without any of your pre-reqs done for a BS in business. It doesn\u2019t work that way. The only way you can get a second, different AS is for something that shares similar requirements. For instance, it\u2019s common for engineering majors at community college to leave CC with an AS in mathematics because you need to do all of the courses for engineering BS pre-reqs anyways, so they\u2019ll have an AS Math and a BS Electrical Engineering or something, but this isn\u2019t most people. It depends on your program.\n\nThat said, what do you want for a bachelor\u2019s?",

          "text": "Yes this is what I meant, 2 different things similar, both useful on their own but build on eachother together. Im not 100% decided on my bachelors, probably engineering or biochem and then med school. I dont want the bachelors to be something that I could work with if it was just an associates. I plan to do an associates that can stand on its own and benefit a bachelors that needs bachelor level. This is because life is unpredictable and if for some reason Im not able to go to a university for a bachelors, I still have an associates that can take me far.",

              "text": "If you\u2019re shooting for engineering, do a math associate degree, it can help for technical roles. Engineering associate is obvious as well. If you\u2019re biochem, it doesn\u2019t matter. An associate in any of the sciences does like nothing for you.\n\nMost associate degrees don\u2019t really do anything for you. If you actually want employable associate degrees, they would be engineering associate degrees(qualifies you for technician roles), nursing, medical technician(like x-ray tech, ultrasound, etc.), and honestly that\u2019s about it. An associate degree doesn\u2019t mean much unless it\u2019s for something that\u2019s actually applicable and useful. I have 5 associate degrees lol.",

So you do two years at a community college, you\u2019ll graduate with an Associates, and then you can transfer to a four year university to get your bachelors. They have it set up so that everything from your community college years will transfer and count towards your bachelors. I\u2019m graduating in May with an A.S. in Plant and Soil Sciences and then I plan to transfer to TTU to obtain my Bachelors in Agronomy. I\u2019ve basically done all my gen. ed classes and a few agriculture related courses so when I transfer I\u2019ll really only be doing upper division courses which is kinda nice. \nSo if you\u2019re not from Tennessee, maybe you could look at the structure of the Tenn Transfer Pathway and try to do something similar so that your Associates and Bachelors coincide.",
