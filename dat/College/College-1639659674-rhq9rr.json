I was hoping I could just go to sleep early yesterday and wake up better today, but I\u2019m feeling even worse this morning. I\u2019ve got a fever and chills, and I\u2019m moving so slowly. Even just getting out of bed was hard.\n\nI can let the professor know, but it\u2019s not like I can just exempt myself from the final three assignments. I\u2019m probably going to end having to do them anyway and hope I don\u2019t feel any worse. Ughh.",
