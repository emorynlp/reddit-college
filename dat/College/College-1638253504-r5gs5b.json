  "text": "I was going to take a test for one of my classes but my grandfather suddenly passed away (not to mention I was there when he did) and I have been an emotional wreck since. I would rather not take this exam because I have finals coming up, not to mention I have a lot on my plate that I need to sort through. Would it be overstepping my bounds by asking not to take the test?",

My brother passed away one semester, I couldn\u2019t function for a few weeks, and a few professors were kind enough to give me extensions.\n\nI hope everything goes well for you and I\u2019m sorry for your loss.",

      "text": "So sorry to hear about this. I\u2019d suggest going to the Dean of Students for documentation/advocacy. That can be helpful when getting extensions. You\u2019re more than likely going to still have to take it (most of the time, you can\u2019t just skip a test), but you might be given an extension with appropriate documentation.\n\nGood luck!",
