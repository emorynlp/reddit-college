You won't need the laptop while you're inside the classroom but it's immensely helpful outside the classroom as most professors have some online components to their class and you don't want to have to walk to a computer every time you need one.

My backpack is full of useful stuff as I often don't go home for 12-18 hrs. \n\nI have a calculator, deodorant, pens/pencils, a book, phone charger, 5hr energy, fingernail clippers, headphones, mouthwash, and portable charger. Along with all my class notebooks. Laptop occasionally.\n\nFor JUST class, probably only notebook and pencil, possibly a folder, book, and laptop if the class has a requirement.",
