  "text": "I\u2019m at a point in my life where I have absolutely no clue what I\u2019m going to do with it :). As y\u2019all probably know, it\u2019s time to start registering for next semester but I don\u2019t even know what my major I want to commit to. As of now I\u2019m majoring in Accountancy, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what I want to do with my life (and honestly I think I kinda suck at it lmao). Im going to school on financial aid and don\u2019t want to waste it on classes that might not even follow through on. Then again, if I were to take a semester off I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do in that time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\n\n\u2014 Sincerely, a fellow stressed out undergrad\n\nTL;DR - Should I take a semester off since I don\u2019t know what the heck to do with my life? If yes, what should I do in that time?",
