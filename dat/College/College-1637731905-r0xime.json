  "text": "Little background:\nI was a Biology major for 2 1/2 years of my college career. I initially wanted to do something with environmental science. I was employed as a work study student in a microbiology lab and ended up really enjoying it. I now have 4 years of lab experience using an autoclave/intense sterilization of things. My biology career came to a halt whenever I couldn\u2019t make it past chemistry. I have a learning deficiency with math and turns out chemistry is 99.9% math. So I ended up losing my Hope scholarship due to my GPA which was devastating. This is where I changed paths entirely and went to Social Work. Instead of doing lab work, I decided I would try to work for an adoption agency, as I was adopted myself. I worked my ass off, got my Hope scholarship back, still graduated in 4 years. This is my first full year being a graduate, and I haven\u2019t fully tried to look for a job with my degree. I got a job as a server since I graduated in a pandemic, and I\u2019ve been there ever since. I\u2019m coming up on the next chapter in my life and I\u2019m looking for jobs with my degrees. I have discovered that an Associates in Science can typically pay more than a Bachelors in Social Work. Does anyone have a similar circumstance? What did you do? I\u2019d love to work in a lab again but I don\u2019t want to feel like I wasted my bachelors degree.",

      "text": "To be honest, I don't really believe in the \"x degree can make me more money\" train of thought. I mean obviously there are careers that make more money than others, but that doesn't mean that you need a certain degree to get there. Reframe your thought process and figure out how to get to where you want to be financially with the degrees that you have or will have. If you want to be a social worker or work in a lab, fulfill the requirements and get the degrees if necessary. Don't just think of the money you can potentially make because it's not guaranteed.",
