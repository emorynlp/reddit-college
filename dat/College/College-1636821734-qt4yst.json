At our school a business plan was a literal requirement for their major. I think that\u2019s true of a lot of business programs. \n\nHaving now worked in the field for a few years, I\u2019ll say that being able to write out a business plan, will go a long way. Sure you may only work on a piece of the puzzle, but knowing the big picture can be very helpful (this is more true in smaller companies like mine).",
