  "text": "I am dealing with depression for a long time and it is at peak recently, along with suicidal thoughts. That affected my school performance, and my submissions are late because of that.\n\nThis prof of mine is now asking for medical certificate or proof for this health issue of mine, but I wasn't able to diagnose yet.  We're not that rich and my parents doesn't know about it. Should i just give up?",

      "text": "They should not be asking for it. They should be telling you that the disability office needs to give you accommodations.\n\nSet up a meeting with the office that handles disability accommodations. You may be able to get whatever you need by explaining it in a meeting and showing anything supporting it like prescriptions, past counseling appointments, rapid grade declines, etc.\n\nThat office will keep your record on file and tell the professor what accommodations you are entitled to.\n\nWhat country are you residing in? Just so I can make sure the above information is accurate. This is a US centric subreddit so the above is how universities handle it here.",
