      "text": "Professor here! Please do not ask. The time to show that you deserve a grade bump has long passed. I've gotten no fewer than 30 emails from students within the last week, and this semester is the worst for grade grubbing. If you truly did your best, attended office hours, and put in the effort, one more email is not going to tip the scales.\n\nTL;DR: Yes it does hurt to ask. The decision of whether you deserve a grade bump has already been made based on your performance and class policies.",

      "text": "I'm not a professor, but here is the advice I would recommend\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- make sure that all of the points you missed were valid, if there is any area where you could get some back, ask (example, you got -6 points for a question, but it really should be -5)\n\n\\- make sure all questions are valid, if there are multiple answers or you can find something that would support the fact that the correct answer may not be truly correct, ask (find ANYTHING that could create doubt in the answers)\n\n\\- ask. although it is VERY (am i mean VERY) unlikely, it is still *more* likely than NOT asking\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProfessors that don't round or adjust at all I find to a little odd. This assumes they made no mistakes, that every point you lost is the fault of you alone. This is very unlikely, there are many opportunities for professors to screw up, from poorly worded questions to inconsistent grading to blatantly wrong answers - all of which could be what tips someone off (or onto) a grade.\n\nProfessors are people too, which means they do make mistakes. Unfortunately, it also means they may be unwilling to fix those mistakes. It depends on how good your professor is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, all of this is in the terms of tenths of percentages. Going up a whole percent is probably unlikely.",
