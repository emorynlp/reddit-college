My online lecture starts at 8 and I can't even pick myself before that, funny part is everytime my 5:30 alarm goes on I keep on snoozing for 5min more and it keeps on going like that. By the time I'm completely awake, I see my phone has captured atleast 4-5 snapshots (it happens when I press volume down + power button simultaneously for gripping phone)",

It can be anything to look forward to in the morning really whether it's a routine, an event happening later, food, etc.",

Could be worth experimenting with that.\n\n\nOtherwise, agree with suggestions where you have to put in more effort to shut off the alarm. Having to stand up to get it is good. There are some apps where you have to answer questions or do math problems to make it shut off, so maybe the effort of doing that over and over would make it less tempting to lay in bed.",
