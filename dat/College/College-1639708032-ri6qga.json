  "text": "I\u2019m 31, on January 10th, I will be attending Arkansas Tech University. \nI\u2019m attending for B.S. in Wellness/Fitness and my goal is to use their exchange program for Kinesiology or some other strength and conditioning degree with a variety of coaches. \n\nMy first plan was Professional Chemistry but when I looked at the requirements I just realized if I was 21 I would do it it in a heart beat. I\u2019m also not well at math so it was going to take a year of extra work almost. \n\nWe have a 2 semester exchange & international exchange program. My overall career goals are strength and conditioning for Martial Arts/Body Competitions. \n\n2021 State Champions & they have some good coaches. I know I will have to train under football coaches ugh I hate that. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m looking forward to the program. I\u2019ve tried 3 times to get my NASM CPT and I train pretty actively so I just want to go all the way official instead of just some certifications. My college is also part of the NCSA-CSCS program. If I\u2019m lucky I will be done in 6 years! \n\nIf any of you have any advice going forward I\u2019d love to hear you out! \n\nTLDR; never too late to go back to school!",

      "text": "congratulations! what an incredible achievement. i just completed my first semester as an eighteen year old but i think it\u2019s important to utilize all resources available to you as a student to get the most out of your education. but don\u2019t feel like you have to do it all. take classes that are genuinely interesting to you and that excite you. don\u2019t be afraid to change your major if it ends up not being as you imagined. and find your support group either that is off or on campus. i\u2019m not sure if this is at all relevant to you as a student but i found this advice to be most helpful to me :) best of luck!",
