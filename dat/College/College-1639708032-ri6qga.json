  "text": "I\u2019m 31, on January 10th, I will be attending Arkansas Tech University. \nI\u2019m attending for B.S. in Wellness/Fitness and my goal is to use their exchange program for Kinesiology or some other strength and conditioning degree with a variety of coaches. \n\nMy first plan was Professional Chemistry but when I looked at the requirements I just realized if I was 21 I would do it it in a heart beat. I\u2019m also not well at math so it was going to take a year of extra work almost. \n\nWe have a 2 semester exchange & international exchange program. My overall career goals are strength and conditioning for Martial Arts/Body Competitions. \n\n2021 State Champions & they have some good coaches. I know I will have to train under football coaches ugh I hate that. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m looking forward to the program. I\u2019ve tried 3 times to get my NASM CPT and I train pretty actively so I just want to go all the way official instead of just some certifications. My college is also part of the NCSA-CSCS program. If I\u2019m lucky I will be done in 6 years! \n\nIf any of you have any advice going forward I\u2019d love to hear you out! \n\nTLDR; never too late to go back to school!",
