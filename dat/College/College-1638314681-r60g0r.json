  "text": "Hi all! I don\u2019t know if this is the right place to post but I\u2019m getting a little desperate. I attend Bellevue College and normally every winter quarter they offer the second Arabic course. This is the first winter they\u2019ve opted not to, and I need to take second and third level Arabic to graduate in spring. I intend to transfer to the University of Washington where, for my degree path, I will need three quarters of a language. I\u2019m pursuing a competitive major so I can\u2019t afford to transfer without the language credit. I can\u2019t find any other community colleges that offer Arabic, and it\u2019s too late in the game to take classes at a bigger state school. Does anyone know any accredited online colleges or something I can do to take second and third level Arabic to graduate? I\u2019ve been looking but I can\u2019t find anyone who offers it. Admissions for my program are only in fall, so if I don\u2019t graduate on time I\u2019m delayed over a year and I have worked way too hard to be delayed that long.",
