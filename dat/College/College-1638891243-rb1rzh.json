  "title:": "Will My Professor Have To Curve The Final Grade?",
  "text": "I\u2019m in OChem 2. I\u2019m sitting at a low B right now, average 70\u2019s on tests. I have to get a 68 on the cumulative final to maintain my B, and the last few chapters are very hard for me so I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019ll go. \nThis professor is not a great teacher, our tests are mostly short answer with really hard extra credit questions. A different professor\u2019s extra credit is 13 points for memorizing 13 names, and she told her students that\u2026 so obviously that\u2019s really easy. Rumor has it my professor, who\u2019s only been here this one semester, is already fired. \nMy question is, is it possible the department will make her curve the final letter grade? The average in her class is a D, and I\u2019ve heard most departments want that to be a C.",
