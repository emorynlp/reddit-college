  "title:": "Sending an end-of-semester thank you email to a professor I\u2019ve never really talked to?",
  "text": "\nHi! Do you guys think it would be weird to send a thank you email to a professor I haven\u2019t talked with before? I have really severe social anxiety (which I receive some accommodations for) so I\u2019ve had a really hard time connecting with professors and talking in class, but I found out recently that I had the top grade in my 50-person class, along with the highest score by a pretty big margin on the midterm and on the final. The class and professor have a reputation for killing GPAs, but I found myself really obsessed with the subject material and even inspired to start looking into grad programs. I\u2019ve had awful imposter syndrome ever since I transferred from my community college into a large university, so it really is a big deal to me. Any pointers here? I truly do just want to express how thankful I am , though I\u2019d love to establish some connection with the professor as well. I\u2019m also worried that I blew it by never going to office hours or speaking up in class, and now it\u2019s just going to look like I\u2019m sucking up to them.\n\n\nSorry if this is dumb!! College seems to have so many unwritten rules that I just don\u2019t understand!",
