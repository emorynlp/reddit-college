  "text": "It\u2019s insanely cruel that students who work on campus, typically for minimum wage, would be forced to take out loans to live on that very same campus. \n\nFor example, I was paid about $13/hr at my previous campus job. Due to campus policies, I wasn\u2019t allowed to work for more than 20 hours/wk and often worked much less due to how much competition there was from other student workers. But let\u2019s say ideally I worked for 20 hours that week on campus. This would give me $1,040/mo. Most financial experts would agree you shouldn\u2019t be spending more than 30% of monthly income on rent. That means my monthly fee for housing should be no more than $312. \n\nHowever, that was not the reality. The reality was that I was paying $1000/mo with my installment plan. Colleges need to do better. Half of my friends are either living in their cars or sleeping on my couch in my overpriced dorm. We all work on campus, but have to take extra work just to get by.\n\nUniversities need to do better. They can\u2019t expect their students to succeed, especially the ones that work for them, if they\u2019re struggling to find a roof to sleep under. Either pay us MORE or LOWER the cost of housing. Housing is a human right and these institutions can do plenty to support their students effectively.",

          "text": ">No one is forcing you to work on campus.\n\nHello, work/study? I sort of agree with you, but even living and working off-campus is completely unsustainable. Housing prices are way too high and minimum wage is way too low. We need to at least double minimum wage and pass legislation to stop the rising housing prices if your suggestion is to be helpful in the least",

              "text": "None of that stuff will happen. There's absolutely no reason that any legislator would ever go for that. You're telling me that you want to give unskilled people more money AND reduce how much money people can make from real estate? People making money from real estate are paying more taxes than a minimum wage worker. That is more valuable to the government. \n\nPeople who work minimum wage are an integral part of society, as much as the PHD people. Without people working shitty minimum wage jobs, there would be a lot of stuff that wouldn't get done in this country. Paying them more isn't the answer. If you want more money, become more skilled or work harder.\n\nHere's how tax breaks for large companies work. The government often will give incentives and huge tax breaks for large companies moving into a certain locality. Typically, state government will provide these breaks because they know that the return on investment *particularly* from the taxes paid by workers will still net a profit. Bringing Amazon warehouses into a state on FREE land and no taxes for years still nets the state government a profit because of the employees that business hires. \n\nThere are tons of businesses looking to move into states with low income requirements. They literally contact state government asking what the enforced minimum wage is if they'd move into the state. Some walk away when the baseline is 15 an hour. The government can't just turn all of these down, because they are money makers for taxes. If state governments start asking for a higher minimum wage, there just won't be any job creation in that state. It's a fine line that's not as easy as just paying people more. \n\nLegislation can't stop rising housing prices. The country works on a free market. Any dumb dick can put up a 2 bedroom 1 bath for $1 million and nobody can do anything about it. If housing goes up and people keep paying it, it will continue to go up. It can only go up so far before nobody can pay for it.",

      "text": "Housing around universities is always pricey. (supply/demand+ generous loans)\n\nI would think about getting an off campus apartment, commuting to classes, and working an outside part time job. It'd solve a lot of your problems and only add one that's manageable, a commute. Better hours & probably better rents. Or just get an off campus job, youd have to look into the rents and market.\n\nHousing and employment on campus are going to be competitive, especially if you lower rents and raise wages for student workers. Housing markets are very responsive to those things because it takes such a long time to build and open up new housing, there'd be a big uptick in demand and it'd be the same exact supply of houses for awhile.",

      "text": "Oh boy. \n\nColleges will never do this nor should they. It is not a right to be able to attend college. It's a product that is available and you pay it to go there. \n\nColleges aren't responsible to raise minimum wage or make housing more affordable, nor should they. They are there to make money. Reducing the cost of housing would result in them losing money. Paying students more, to do non-skilled work, will cost them more money for no reason. \n\nI understand that it's expensive and so much so that it's unaffordable to a lot of people. The people living on your couch and out of their cars have made a poor financial choice to go to college if that's how they have to do it. It's nobody else's fault that they chose to go broke to sleep in their car. Why should to college pay for that? I'm sure financial experts won't suggest taking out LOADS in loans just to attend college. \n\nDon't get confused about colleges. They aren't High Schools or public services. They are companies built to provide a profit. They don't owe their customers anything. You signed up for the high priced dorm rooms. Next thing you know, Bentley cars will be offering $0 down and 0% financing for 36 months EVERYONE IS PREAPPROVED!!!!!! It doesn't work for car manufacturers and it won't work for education providers. \n\nMost of these financial posts generally don't hold water. Doubling minimum wage so people can afford campus housing is a ridiculous notion that the company providing the service should be responsible for making sure the people can afford their service. Somebody else posted that you're not forced to work and live on campus. There's no argument against this whatsoever. He's right. If they don't pay enough on campus, go work elsewhere. If campus housing is too expensive, move off campus. There will always be somebody telling you \"it's still not enough\" and complain about how the world is. From my own personal experience over many years, it's 100% possible to get a job without an education and afford housing. Granted, don't live in a brand new sparkly dorm that's 3 seconds from campus. Find a 1 bedroom or studio apartment and pay half campus prices. Find a $15 an hour job driving a fork lift or working in a factory. \n\nI feel like it's very easy to get confused as a young adult how this is all supposed to work. Going into college and spending more money than you've ever earned in your entire life is confusing. Just seeing thousands of dollars rack up when you've never even held a grand in cash is nerve racking. \n\nI just think you're asking for the wrong thing from the wrong people. This country is a wonderful place to live. You can be as prosperous as you please. If you want things, there is a very simple formula to getting them. The college won't reduce their prices simply because they've got the demand for it and people will continue to pay it knowing it's a great return on investment. \n\nThe solution to your problem will be what YOU can do for you. Asking a giant business that's funded federally to reduce things so it's easier on your bank account is a stretch. If you want more affordable housing and better pay, move off campus and get a better job. You're not forced to be in that dorm or job, so don't waste time working it if it's not meeting your needs. Keep this up until you become old and you'll end up making a lot of money. Everyone who has ever worked an industry will all agree that leaving a job for another is the best way to make more money. Your situation is no different.",

If you raise the colleges minimum wage, your fees for \"student services\" or \"facilities and maintenance\" will go up. Also, how the heck are you paying $1,000 per month?

Once I was married, we had a 2 bedroom apartment to ourselves for $820, and this is at least a MCOL city that has been on every \"fastest growing home prices\" list for the last 2-5 years.",
