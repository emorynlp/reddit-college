  "title:": "University Housing Needs to be Affordable to Student Workers",
  "text": "It\u2019s insanely cruel that students who work on campus, typically for minimum wage, would be forced to take out loans to live on that very same campus. \n\nFor example, I was paid about $13/hr at my previous campus job. Due to campus policies, I wasn\u2019t allowed to work for more than 20 hours/wk and often worked much less due to how much competition there was from other student workers. But let\u2019s say ideally I worked for 20 hours that week on campus. This would give me $1,040/mo. Most financial experts would agree you shouldn\u2019t be spending more than 30% of monthly income on rent. That means my monthly fee for housing should be no more than $312. \n\nHowever, that was not the reality. The reality was that I was paying $1000/mo with my installment plan. Colleges need to do better. Half of my friends are either living in their cars or sleeping on my couch in my overpriced dorm. We all work on campus, but have to take extra work just to get by.\n\nUniversities need to do better. They can\u2019t expect their students to succeed, especially the ones that work for them, if they\u2019re struggling to find a roof to sleep under. Either pay us MORE or LOWER the cost of housing. Housing is a human right and these institutions can do plenty to support their students effectively.",

Housing prices are way too high and minimum wage is way too low. We need to at least double minimum wage and pass legislation to stop the rising housing prices if your suggestion is to be helpful in the least",

              "text": "None of that stuff will happen. There's absolutely no reason that any legislator would ever go for that. You're telling me that you want to give unskilled people more money AND reduce how much money people can make from real estate? People making money from real estate are paying more taxes than a minimum wage worker. That is more valuable to the government. \n\nPeople who work minimum wage are an integral part of society, as much as the PHD people. Without people working shitty minimum wage jobs, there would be a lot of stuff that wouldn't get done in this country. Paying them more isn't the answer. If you want more money, become more skilled or work harder.\n\nHere's how tax breaks for large companies work. The government often will give incentives and huge tax breaks for large companies moving into a certain locality. Typically, state government will provide these breaks because they know that the return on investment *particularly* from the taxes paid by workers will still net a profit. Bringing Amazon warehouses into a state on FREE land and no taxes for years still nets the state government a profit because of the employees that business hires. \n\nThere are tons of businesses looking to move into states with low income requirements. They literally contact state government asking what the enforced minimum wage is if they'd move into the state. Some walk away when the baseline is 15 an hour. The government can't just turn all of these down, because they are money makers for taxes. If state governments start asking for a higher minimum wage, there just won't be any job creation in that state. It's a fine line that's not as easy as just paying people more. \n\nLegislation can't stop rising housing prices. The country works on a free market. Any dumb dick can put up a 2 bedroom 1 bath for $1 million and nobody can do anything about it. If housing goes up and people keep paying it, it will continue to go up. It can only go up so far before nobody can pay for it.",

That\u2019s why you have to be trained in minimum wage jobs. \n\nDo you know how to make a caramel Frappuccino? Can you do it in under 5 minutes while a customer yells at you? My friend does this for minimum wage on our campus Starbucks. \n\nDo you know how to perform maintenance on an entire building\u2019s wifi?  My friend does this for minimum wage for the dorms. \n\nDo you know how to upkeep an arboretum? Can you identify when when dozens of species of flowers should be in bloom? Do you know how to reset the temperature of a greenhouse? My friend does this for minimum wage on our campus. \n\nCan you input data from Canvas into a deaf-blind reading program? Can you help students with physical and mental disabilities navigate a computer or test scantron? This is what I do for minimum wage on our campus.\n\nWe are skilled. We are underpaid. We do work extra jobs outside of campus, but some of us cannot because we can\u2019t afford cars and the public transportation in our city is unreliable (at best). If you feel that minimum wage workers are so integral to society, it follows we should pay them as such. You can\u2019t pay lip service to our \u201cbrave essential workers\u201d then badmouth their skills and pay them next to nothing.",

Minimum wage workers ARE integral but paying them more isn't what we need to do. You can't just pay the low end and expect nothing to change, that's ridiculous. \n\nAs much as it hurts a lot of people's feelings and stuff, we need unskilled people doing minimum wage work. Nobody is making them do it, and it's a decent opportunity to build skills.\n\nAll of your friends should search for better jobs. If it was all about money, they'd go find somewhere that would pay more. Those jobs might be easy and comfortable. That's probably why they pay so low.",

But a quick Google search defined skilled labor as someone who is highly trained or educated with skills that are mentally or physically complex. I would argue that unfortunately, not many student jobs on a college campus are very skilled, because if they required long training periods, the school would hire someone from the outside because they can't afford to train people every 4 months on something that takes 6 months to learn.\n\nSo do you have skills, yes. Are they highly technical or complex, requiring extended periods of training or formal education, no. My current location is going to have a massive wave of retirement in the next 2-5 years and everyone is in a panic because that is really not enough time to replace a new generation of engineers and machine operators. We don't have enough electricians or mechanics to do maintenance, and to get someone through an apprenticeship means they're basically dependent for several years.\n\nEach of the positions you mentioned has the potential to become a fully skilled profession, as a franchise owner, an it b professional, or an educator/education administrator. But a few months on the job does not make you a skilled laborer, nor does several years on an easily replaceable task.",

In a lot of areas that would bring it close to what many majors make after graduation. College enrollment would drop, more people would be entering the unskilled labor workforce, and businesses would operate with less employees.\n\n>pass legislation to stop the rising housing prices\n\nWhat would this legislation look like? How would it keep rentals available after everyone stopped investing/building because the returns were sub-par? Is not being able to find housing preferable to being able to reliably find housing that is priced for it's market? Property sales prices would not be affected, so if those continue to increase then there will be a lot fewer people renting them out at the mandated bargain basement prices because that rental income would no longer provide a margin over the mortgage and property taxes.",

(supply/demand+ generous loans)\n\nI would think about getting an off campus apartment, commuting to classes, and working an outside part time job. It'd solve a lot of your problems and only add one that's manageable, a commute. Better hours & probably better rents. Or just get an off campus job, youd have to look into the rents and market.\n\nHousing and employment on campus are going to be competitive, especially if you lower rents and raise wages for student workers. Housing markets are very responsive to those things because it takes such a long time to build and open up new housing, there'd be a big uptick in demand and it'd be the same exact supply of houses for awhile.",

      "text": "Oh boy. \n\nColleges will never do this nor should they. It is not a right to be able to attend college. It's a product that is available and you pay it to go there. \n\nColleges aren't responsible to raise minimum wage or make housing more affordable, nor should they. They are there to make money. Reducing the cost of housing would result in them losing money. Paying students more, to do non-skilled work, will cost them more money for no reason. \n\nI understand that it's expensive and so much so that it's unaffordable to a lot of people. The people living on your couch and out of their cars have made a poor financial choice to go to college if that's how they have to do it. It's nobody else's fault that they chose to go broke to sleep in their car. Why should to college pay for that? I'm sure financial experts won't suggest taking out LOADS in loans just to attend college. \n\nDon't get confused about colleges. They aren't High Schools or public services. They are companies built to provide a profit. They don't owe their customers anything. You signed up for the high priced dorm rooms. Next thing you know, Bentley cars will be offering $0 down and 0% financing for 36 months EVERYONE IS PREAPPROVED!!!!!! It doesn't work for car manufacturers and it won't work for education providers. \n\nMost of these financial posts generally don't hold water. Doubling minimum wage so people can afford campus housing is a ridiculous notion that the company providing the service should be responsible for making sure the people can afford their service. Somebody else posted that you're not forced to work and live on campus. There's no argument against this whatsoever. He's right. If they don't pay enough on campus, go work elsewhere. If campus housing is too expensive, move off campus. There will always be somebody telling you \"it's still not enough\" and complain about how the world is. From my own personal experience over many years, it's 100% possible to get a job without an education and afford housing. Granted, don't live in a brand new sparkly dorm that's 3 seconds from campus. Find a 1 bedroom or studio apartment and pay half campus prices. Find a $15 an hour job driving a fork lift or working in a factory. \n\nI feel like it's very easy to get confused as a young adult how this is all supposed to work. Going into college and spending more money than you've ever earned in your entire life is confusing. Just seeing thousands of dollars rack up when you've never even held a grand in cash is nerve racking. \n\nI just think you're asking for the wrong thing from the wrong people. This country is a wonderful place to live. You can be as prosperous as you please. If you want things, there is a very simple formula to getting them. The college won't reduce their prices simply because they've got the demand for it and people will continue to pay it knowing it's a great return on investment. \n\nThe solution to your problem will be what YOU can do for you. Asking a giant business that's funded federally to reduce things so it's easier on your bank account is a stretch. If you want more affordable housing and better pay, move off campus and get a better job. You're not forced to be in that dorm or job, so don't waste time working it if it's not meeting your needs. Keep this up until you become old and you'll end up making a lot of money. Everyone who has ever worked an industry will all agree that leaving a job for another is the best way to make more money. Your situation is no different.",

They are constantly renovating and building new things. College professors get paid really well because.... they worked really hard to get where they are. Other administration within the college gets paid really well too. There's professional landscaping kept up at all times with sidewalks always being clear. Hell, my campus doesn't have any sidewalks that are uneven in the slightest.\n\nThis wonderful country also has ways to borrow money to still go through college. They aren't keeping people from doing that. I suppose you'll turn around it say it's somebody else's fault that students are in debt too eh? We aren't victims of college. Nobody is making you go at all. If it's too expensive, work and save up. I don't know how you're doing it, but it's how I'm doing it. \n\nI don't understand why people think college should be cheaper or free. That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. They NEED to make money to keep it as wonderful as it is.\n\nHow many jobs have you had? How long have you worked a job?\n\nI decided to creep your post history and one of the last posts was about where \"poor queers\" should live and said that LA, NY and San Francisco are out of the question because 800-900 is too much there.

I\u2019m extremely lucky because they respect my class schedule because they know me. This is not the case for the majority of students. Working off campus can be next to impossible because companies not associated with the school will accommodate your schedule. \n\nI disagree with your belief that because colleges are for-profit, they shouldn\u2019t be doing everything in their ability to help students. Especially those of us who come from backgrounds with poverty. Institutions of education shouldn\u2019t be for-profit in the first place. Students are not products, they are people. And people have a right to housing, even when they are in college.\n\nI also disagree that homelessness is also always an individual failure. Homelessness is endemic and not everyone living on the streets simply made a few bad decisions. Many people are victims of systemic issues. My city in particular has been going through a housing crisis, even before the pandemic. \n\nMy friend sleeping on my couch, in particular, lost his job at a bar when it closed down during lockdowns. He got a campus job, but it wasn\u2019t enough when his landlord raised the rent on him at the end of his lease after our state cancelled the freeze on rents. Being so close to finals in his graduating semester, he couldn\u2019t afford to just drop out and try again another time. The emergency housing units on my campus are full. There are empty units in the dorms. But the university shouldn\u2019t help a student WORKING on campus live there because he can\u2019t afford it while units sit empty? He is a victim of systemic issues affecting houselessness and he\u2019s not alone. \n\nMy step-father works as an maintenance man for an apartment building and he and my mother live in a unit they offered for free. This is a thing that exists outside of academia, so why exactly can an institution bringing in millions of dollars every day not provide housing for the students that not only pay them tuition, but also work for them? That is not ethical. That is not right.",

You are also working half-time anyway so it isn't necessarily reasonable to expect you will be making 3x what rent is.\n\n>Students still have bills to pay outside of housing as well, such as tuition, fees, car notes, cell phone plans, etc. Housing is not my only bill.\n\nI didn't say it was your only bill. But student bills look a bit different. Sometimes food is paid by parents or financial aid. You probably aren't contributing anything to a retirement account. Most students don't have a car loan. Generally speaking a lot of students can do 50% income towards rent without issue. I'll give in and admit that this usually requires a parent to guarantee the lease though.\n\n>I never said that half the student population is homeless. I said half of my friends are. But this is not an uncommon problem and I understand if anecdotal evidence isn\u2019t enough for you. Here are some articles: 1 / 2 / 3\n\nI don't like to use anecdotal evidence but I do agree with you that student homelessness is a problem. The NCHE estimates that [13% of students](https://nche.ed.gov/higher-education/) at a four-year might lack housing security. But most of these students would qualify for university, state, or federal programs that directly or indirectly help with housing security.\n\n>I never advocated for free housing. I advocated for housing that is proportionate to what the university is willing to pay its student employees, which isn\u2019t much. I offered two solutions, neither of which are free housing, to pay us more or reduce the price of student housing.\n\nHow about a third option? You are implying this is about the general student population but it isn't. For housing insecurity we are talking about the bottom 10-15% of the student population by income. Providing more solid financial welfare to these specific students would reduce student housing insecurity a lot more than giving every student a rent reduction. There would be a lot of financial waste (in terms of impact) because students who are financially secure would also be getting the rent reductions. You have more to spread around if you target the aid to the severe cases.",

                      "text": ">Take a look at the listings for housing in a big city like New York or Los Angeles (I live in cities like those).\n\nIt's up to the student to decide where to live though. Someone who is not financially secure should not be moving to study in those cities to begin with unless they are getting a superb financial aid package. There is no reason any of these students should consider paying NY/SF rent prices or anything remotely comparable to that.\n\n>I like your solution. Even if they only reduced the rent for student workers, I\u2019d be happy with that. They do it for RAs already so I feel like it\u2019s not too big of an ask for my university where the president makes hundreds of thousands of dollars for a holiday bonus.\n\nThanks. And yes being an RA is another point. They could prioritize low-income students for that too.\n\nDivided between each student, whatever your president makes probably wouldn't cover much. Admin salary has come up on this subreddit before. The ability to raise funding is part of the justification to why they would be paid that much. They may be getting a $300k bonus but it may be due to being able to bring in a much larger amount to fund university programs. It's a net benefit and not something that the university is losing budget money on. Canning a good president with connections would probably cost the university much more than the $300k they would save. That being said, our president always donated his bonus back to the university.",

      "text": "Well my only gripe is that I feel that you believe things should be a particular way based upon your expectations and now that reality doesn't align with said expectations, it would be more convenient if life bent around you, rather than you adapt. I say this because I joined the military in order to attend school and avoid this situation you're in. I could have done a myriad of other things to achieve the same result (work in the fire department, police, McDonald's, real estate. Etc.). Point being, as someone previously mentioned, you feel as though you should have an all expenses paid ride through life (which admittedly would be nice) but that isn't how things are. Fundamentally you're left with the choice of whether or not you're going to adapt or be in the same position tomorrow. Truth is, congress isn't going to come save you tomorrow, nor are these institutions. You're going to have to get a nice firm grip on the boot straps and do what you know you should do (i.e. be reasonable and live within your means). You don't HAVE to live in those dorms, you don't HAVE to be a full-time student, etc. I'd argue going to school slower and having a more sustainable income is a larger priority. Outside of emotional comforts nobody here can help you. It's ultimately up to you to make the adjustments from the push-back that life is giving you right now and these moments build character.",

In addition, schools are charging more because the government guarantees that they will be paid. They need to stop doing that if school will ever stop increasing in price.\n\nI study at a cheaper school because I realized I don't make enough money to afford a pricy one. I can't even afford to live on-campus. It's cheaper for me to live on campus so that's what I'm doing. You or me don't deserve on-campus just because I want it. \n\nIf OP was complaining that nowhere in the US was affordable, that would be different.
