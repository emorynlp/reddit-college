  "text": "I have been trying to make a 4-year college plan for a while but I find that counting the credits and while I keep changing things around and multiple other reasons gets annoying and tedious.

For me they had course flowcharts with all the courses I had to take and they were laid out in order. My advisor also had a program that allowed them to drag those courses around so you could see your plan laid out.",
