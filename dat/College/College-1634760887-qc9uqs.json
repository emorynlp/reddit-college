  "text": "I came into college with credits of a semester from dual-credit, and ap. I am a Fashion Design Major and picked up a business minor. Im currently a sophomore so there\u2019s no pressure at the moment but I would like to see other people\u2019s input. My program already has us do 160 hours of professional practice and I would do it during the summer of my junior year. Is there any other postives of doing the full 4 years?",

      "text": "Do you like your college experience? I think if you are quite literally going to run out of classes to take after the fall semester senior year there is no point really in spending the money to take pointless classes unless you\u2019re really rich and can do that super easily. I am in a similar situation and I enjoy my college experience so far so I think I am going to do my one year masters after I graduate in 3 years so I can still be with my friends, but if for some reason if something happens and I hate everything and everybody I can just leave lol. I prob would do it, lots of ppl graduate a semester early. The only thing would be if you have to take extra summer or winter classes then I prob wouldn\u2019t and would take them that spring semester, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the situation for yoh",
