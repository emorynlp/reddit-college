  "text": "I am currently in my sophomore year as a Computer science major, and I want to switch to accounting. I was just wondering how switching mid semester usually works in colleges. How would it affect my current classes? Would I need to drop the classes I am taking right now or finish them? I have also contacted my advisor but they take a while to respond. Thank you.",
