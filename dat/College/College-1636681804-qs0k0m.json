  "text": "I'm a college freshman, so I've been here for almost 3 months and I still don't have any real friends.\n\nI'll start off by saying I went to the same school from kindergarten until I graduated high school, so I never really had to try to make friends since it was super easy as a kindergartener and I'd known most people since then. I also was super homesick when I first came to college (whenever I talked it felt like there was a knot in my throat and I sounded like I was about to cry), so I wasn't really in the mood to make friends with people that I would like and get along with on my floor. After a few days, I made some friends with some kids on my floor and we met some other kids from our building, and they're still pretty much the only friends I have, but I don't really feel like I'd call them true friends.\n\nThey're nice and I will talk to them, but I am just so much different than most of them. Most of them don't go out on the weekends and spend all week doing homework and spend the weekends just sitting in our dorm building and watching movies and stuff. I also don't really feel comfortable around any of them besides maybe 2 kids. Most of them are either kind of weird or super innocent, so I can't really joke around with them like I could with my friends at home. It's sort of hard to explain, but with most of them it feels like we're still at that stage where you just met someone and are still trying to be super polite. We've yet to reach the point of what I consider real friendship where you feel comfortable teasing each other and just messing around in general.\n\nAnyway, it feels super lonely basically having no one to actually talk to. We'll talk, but it's always about stuff like classes and feels so formal and polite. Even though it technically is social, it doesn't feel much different then just sitting in my room all day talking to no one. Everyone seems to enjoy college (at least the social aspect of it), but I'm not happy here at all. I know that I won't be happy without meeting new friends that I really am friends with like mine from home, but I don't know how to do that. I go to a pretty big state school, and I'm in a few clubs, but I never hang out with kids from those clubs that I've met. I also haven't really met anyone from my classes. We haven't done any group projects in any of my classes, so it's not common to start talking to people in class.\n\nAll of this has been making me feel sort of depressed. I rarely enjoy anything here now. I guess the only time I'm really having fun is on the weekend going out, which can be fun, but basically from Sunday through Thursday I am miserable. And going out on the weekends and drinking is fun in its own rite, but it's not the same as having friends that I have fun with and actually enjoy being around.\n\nIf anyone has any advice, I'd really appreciate it.",

      "text": "Hi There! Sorry to hear you are having such a hard time, but it is only your first semester and there is still PLENTY of time to find your way.\r  \n\r  \nPersonally, college was the best 4 years of my life so far! I loved it so much so that I am now 25 and working as a Residence Director at a college in Massachusetts! Here is some advice I can give to you that helped make my experience so great:\r  \n\r  \n\\- The best parts of the college experience come outside of the classroom. Yes you are there to get an education, but there is so much more to college than that. The #1 piece of advice I would give you is to JOIN SOCIAL CLUBS AND ORGANIZATIONS! Personally, I was a tour guide, Student Government Member (for 4 years), Orientation Leader, Resident Advisor (My favorite), I played in Intramural Sports, and did a wide variety of other things. And all of these things are what made my experience SO GREAT! In each of the clubs/organizations I joined, I made friends in every single area who all had some impact on me to help me grow and become a better person. I met a wide variety of people (some of whom I absolutely did not like, but most I did) and meeting these people and establishing friendships was what helped my experience be so great. It was amazing having different friends in all different areas that I could connect with and hang out with at different times, it was great. Becoming an RA (aside from getting free room and board) instantly exposes you to a whole group of people and you become a part of a new community - and this is exciting! Half of my friends that I still talk with, even 3 years after college, were all RAs with me and they are amazing individuals whom I never would have met if I did not become an RA. Joining clubs and Organizations is one of the best things you can do to meet new people and expand your idea of what college can be. \n\nGood luck to you - sending positive vibes your way!",

      "text": "So it sounds like you have a ton of acquaintances not friends. The way I like to envision friendships is a sky rise building. Most people are on the street. Your acquaintances are in the lobby of your building. Your friends back home are the only ones with penthouse access to your inner sanctum. You sound like an extrovert- and I believe most extroverts probably have most floors between lobby and top floor filled. \n\nPerhaps since your best friends were made from Kindergarten on - in your early years. You never picked up the social skills required to obtain new ones because you've never been challenged.\n\nYou're going to have to dig deep and start to engender some ideas and opportunities to meet people and nurture leveling up your comfort with each other to fulfill your social needs.\n\nIt isn't easy sometimes but you will be the thing that changes and makes it happen. But, I know you are discouraged, take heart and realize this is also an opportunity to know more about yourself.",

      "text": "As an extrovert with close to 0 social anxiety I\u2019ve always known that the most important thing to do when I\u2019m in a new environment is to make connections, but when I have felt isolated there was one thing I did and never regret.  I used that time to hyper focus on a passion. If you don\u2019t have one, try watching TV shows or reading and see if something sticks out that you\u2019d like to try. At the start you\u2019ll probably spend a lot of time alone, focusing on improving. But eventually, you\u2019ll find a community whether online or in person who you share your interest. At first you\u2019ll mostly only have that one hobby in common, but soon you\u2019ll find people you truly connect to. This is definitely a longer term type of thing, but so are friendships. Things that are made to last often aren\u2019t immediate, and it\u2019s the same for this. If you\u2019re looking for communities that I was talking about before: it could be something as obscure as the Duolingo voice chats, or maybe a sports team. Maybe it\u2019s something like your university\u2019s radio station. If you\u2019re into gaming, it could be that. Maybe when you\u2019re watching a TV show you\u2019ll find a fandom you\u2019re obsessed with? Best of luck!",
