  "text": "I'm desperately wanting to move out of my town but I'm nearly 2 years into my bachelor's. When I look at the transfer guide and requirements for the university I want to go to, it says that a good chunk of my courses won't count towards the degree or even transfer at all, and for whatever reason, the ones that do, count for fewer credits, and that uni requires more credits to graduate. So I'd go from essentially 40% complete to 25%, which is really disappointing.\n\nI thought maybe I could do an associate's degree instead and just go from there starting at year 3 but apparently this school doesn't allow you to do that.\n\nI've tried contacting both schools about this but neither will tell me anything, I'm guessing because they can't say they'll accept credits until it's been assessed.\n\nObviously it will vary depending on schools and everything but what's your experience with transferring? In general, do you tend to just get fucked over when transferring no matter what? Or will schools generally take into account things like this?",
