  "text": "I'm just going to start this by giving some info about me. Feel free to skip this paragraph as its only purpose is to give context. I am a freshman in college. I am majoring in physics and I am doing well in all of my classes. Of course I'm feeling really stressed and anxious, but that's to be expected in college, right?\n\nMy issue is that I am entirely unhappy, and I cannot see myself realistically being happy no mattere what choices I make. Currently the only reason I am going to college is because it feels like I should. College just seems like the next step in life, and my family seems to agree with that idea, so here I am. The reasons I chose physics as my major are because I know I could pass these classes if I wanted and because I wanted to be seen as smart and respectable.\n\nI have no real motivation to keep going down this path that I chose. I keep looking for other majors I may be interested in, but I cannot find anything that I enjoy, and dropping out of college seems impossible to me. I wouldn't have a clue as to what I would do with myself even if I did drop out.\n\nI feel like I am adrift with no destination. I'm unable to see any path that would lead to me being happy or even remotely satsfied with my life, so i just keep heading in a randome direction. I'm adding work, stress, and pain to my life for reasons I don't know. Does anyone else feel this way? Is there any advice you have that might help me?",
