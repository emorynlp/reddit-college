  "text": "So basically my roommate got a girl pregnant. He has been dating her for a couple of weeks, and yesterday, i walked in on them making out. I have seen this before, but the fact that there was a positive pregnancy test on his desk really changed the situation. No one else knows yet, and they are planning on leaving this semester and starting a new life. Im happy for them and all, but now im loosing a roommate. Its a pretty bitter sweet moment, as he was actually decent ( and the fact that they didnt have seggs in our room made it even better). Now i may get a shitty roommate who will do drugs and smoke week and party and bring a new girl in every day.",
