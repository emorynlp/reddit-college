  "text": "Hate college, 24 in a mo, been here since HS grad, switched majors, 3.0gpa, in my last year. \n\nHate paying for it, hate wasting time on hw that I literally just chegg, and hate taking exams that people in my majors profession tell me serve no purpose. \n\nWtf man. I\u2019m tired. I want to just work for a few years (I\u2019m a server making \u2248$1k a week) and save up some capital to turn passive. \n\nWhat\u2019s my other option? Graduate with a degree and get an entry level sales job? Nice, more sales, been there done that. If I\u2019m going to sell anything it will be for something personal business related. \n\nSeriously contemplating dropping out for the first time. I can say I\u2019ve always disliked school but always knew it \u201chad to be done\u201d, but rn I see no purpose or value. Student #blahblahblah has dropped out of the systematic race and chose to attempt life without our paper. \n\nAnyone been here? Are you here now? \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude42",

      "text": "I have not been where you are, but I highly recommend pushing through the last year. You have made it to your last year, give yourself some credit for that! In my opinion you are too close not to finish! \n\nI understand you feel like you might be wasting your time, but so many jobs and opportunities now require a college degree at a minimum. Don\u2019t do yourself a disservice by not completing it now that you only have a year left. I believe in you and I bet your future self with thank you for persevering. \n\nWho knows what the future might hold, but you will close doors you never knew could have been opened if you do not finish. Don\u2019t let people who chegged homework the same way you did have an upper hand in life just because they have a degree\n\nBest of luck to you!",

Hell, my university paired marketing and logistics in the same department because they have a lot of similarities. One of the 4 P's of Marketing is Place, after all.\n\nYou don't have to be forced into sales if you don't want to. I recommend you finish your degree and look at your career options with a little more optimism.",
