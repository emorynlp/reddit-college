  "text": "Just wanted to know if others have done this. I am a week ahead in all my classes and about to do more in those classes but I have one class I have a D in and an assignment due tomorrow for it but am still just going ahead in the classes I like to do. Maybe the grade makes me less motivated? I don't know.",

I hate word count but also its in APA format and they want all these extra details like an abstract. and if the formatting is even a little bit off they mark me down lol.
