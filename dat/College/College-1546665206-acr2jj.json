  "text": "I am a Computer Science major. I met with some of my classmates from high school recently and found it incredible how I've completely lost my \"flow\" with them. In high school, we had very similar personalities and were able to joke around with each other easily. However, this time it didn't feel like I was the same person. I thought high school Me was going to magically come back out again, but this time I acted just like college Me - Socially awkward, no sense of humor, difficulty paying attention to what was happening, constantly thinking about schoolwork, etc. It's like college has killed the old me and replaced it with an automaton who only exists to study for exams, work through assignments, etc. \n\nI miss the old me. I feel like college has ruined who I am by isolating me from other people for so long. I thought the reason I was so serious all the time was because college is just a serious place and as soon as I was out I would be normal again. It's starting to piss me off because I don't want to just be a robot for the rest of my life. I feel like I'm no longer a real person. I don't know how to recover the old version of me or if it's even possible. Is there anything I can do to have a personality again?",

My best advice is to look for people within your major that have similar personalities to you",

It has helped me rediscover what I find to be funny and be able to relate to other people, even if they aren\u2019t there with you. It also gives me talking points when I\u2019m with other people. A good podcast can make for excellent background noise while studying if you can tolerate stuff like that without getting distracted.\n\nBest of luck to you!

I\u2019m very lucky to have a few good friends from high school still but I live with one (same college), one I\u2019ve known since I was 7 and we work at the long distance thing, and the others go to different but local schools. I\u2019m still very close with these people but our relationships have definitely changed over time. That being said it sounds like you are struggling with college. Not necessarily the grade aspect but certainly from a stress management and social perspective. Try not to beat yourself up college is hard. I graduated cum ladue in high school came to college to find I had no friends, recently divorced parents, a major I hated and was doing badly in, too many credits (19 &18 yr 1) and failed a course.  College can be bumpy, but hang on to it and pick yourself up. I believe in you! College isn\u2019t easy for me and I don\u2019t think it ever will be, but I\u2019m back on my feet and it\u2019s manageable. The things I found the most helpful were:\n1. Getting a therapist \n2. I suck at making friends so going on trips with our outdoor resource center where I would be forced to be with strangers for extended periods\n3. On a similar note I went to Australia with ISV (international student volunteers) and studied abroad in Italy with a group of students from the art department at my school (I\u2019m a marketing and arts management major with art and art history minors)\n4.Scheduling my own classes (this sounds dumb but my uni tries to tell us what to take when and schedules for you freshman year... this royally fucked me over)\n5. Again since I suck at making friends taking courses like SCUBA that are fun and not a ton of extra work can be a way to raise GPA and meet people with similar interests\n",

      "text": "First of all, I know you\u2019ve already gotten a lot of support from the sub already, but I have some things to say because I\u2019m in the same boat (or at least was this time last year.)\n\nLife is tough out there for us CS majors, and the significant change in lifestyle from HS can have a lot of people feeling like you do. I\u2019ll share a bit about my own experiences too; hopefully, they\u2019ll help you out a bit.\n\nMy parents are both incredibly talented and successful in software, and I kinda grew up in the culture of being extremely analytical and calculating, but to me that was more messing around than anything else (things like trying to hack League of Legends so I could DDoS people in game - shitty, I know, but entertaining to do when you have nothing better to do.) It never really manifested to me as doing work until college, and once it did, I felt really out of touch with my HS friends - they were all too concerned with smoking weed and playing video games like we did in HS, and my life was different. Eventually, I started hanging out with them less and less, and now I see them at the library maybe once a month (doesn\u2019t have to be that way for you, necessarily, but it was for me.)\n\nWhat I eventually did was make new friends in CS who valued being successful in classes and all, just like I did, and that made me feel a lot more like I had a personality because I was surrounded by people doing the same thing. Eventually, I (tentatively) found my place in it and developed a clearer definition of what I want to do with my life.\n\nTo talk about you now, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re losing yourself so much as it sounds like you\u2019re changing - that\u2019s OK, and in fact is encouraged. Life only gets harder and harder for people who are trying to maintain the same version of themselves throughout their lives, because the problems that they deal with and the things that they\u2019ll need to be happy are always changing - especially in CS, a field that changes every 10 minutes on a slow day.\n\nSome others mentioned finding a new group of friends, and while that\u2019d work too, I also think there\u2019s something to be said for striking out alone (if you\u2019re the kinda person who that\u2019d be useful for.) \n\nI\u2019m all about  people moving through their phases in life; sometimes, when people are struggling to define themselves in a rapidly changing lifestyle, they\u2019re going to feel alone and as if they have no personality (I sure did.) The trick is to not be afraid of becoming someone new. Case in point, your personality isn\u2019t lost - just changing.\n\nHope that helps!",

      "text": "It could be that your personality is changing, and you can't connect them as much as you used to. Another user talked about it earlier and that was pretty good. Joining another organization might help too (like someone else mentioned).\n\nBut I've definitely been where you are in terms that I feel college has drained my personality out of me. One thing I learned this semester is when it's okay to prioritize my mental health over school. I'm a biochem major who used to be pre-med, so I was studying a fuckton to the point where I barely saw anyone, even my roommate, unless I studied with them. Its so, so draining. One night I was like \"fuck it, I'm going out instead of writing this paper and I'll do it in the morning.\" I did pretty shitty on that paper, but because I was able to spend time relaxing the night before I was more focused on other work that I got a good grade on. You claim to not have time (as I often do too), but sometimes you need to be like \"fuck it, I know I don't have time but I need to take a break. I'm taking the L on this assignment because I need me time.\" \n\nI'm not sure what your grades are (no need to share), but irl it probably won't matter past you getting your first job. Most employers won't give too much of a shit about it. My dad works for a computer company as a manager (and has done so for 25+ years), and he once told me a story of someone who had a D or two in his classes, but was an A/B student otherwise. My dad still hired him despite others not wanting to hire him because my dad saw that although he didn't get the best grades in a few classes, he had the attitude of success. That dude turned out to be an amazing addition to the team and is now a manager also. The point is, one or two or even three bad grades won't kill you. \n\nYou also have mentioned feeling that guilt of doing something non-school related...I understand that wayyyy too well. I'm the exact same way! Its a hard feeling to de-program yourself from feeling that way. I don't have too much advice for this cause I'm still struggling with this guilt, but my \"fuck it\" attitude helps a bit. \n\nYou seem to not be in a great spot with your mental health. Like I said earlier, you need to say \"fuck it\" and go to counseling. Mental health is still health! If you ignore some symptoms of a cold, it might not affect your schoolwork now and so you don't take time out of your day to see a doctor. But when it turns out that its the flu and you need to be rushed to the hospital, you will lose more time for schoolwork than if you just said \"fuck it\" and went to the doctors earlier on. Same way with mental health! At the very least, start a journal. That has helped me in ways that I don't think a therapist ever could. You don't need to do it every day, but if you ever get anxious or stressed just say \"fuck it\", take a break for a few minutes to write down your feelings, and then get back to work. \n\nAre you even happy with your major? Something you're doing for the rest of your life absolutely shouldn't make you feel this miserable. You're so damn young, you have time to rediscover another pathway. \n\nAlso, I seem to have noticed that you go to A&M. May I suggest the safe ride program there as an activity to do? I am currently involved in the one at my college and its fucking great. I met a dude who was a part of both the one at A&M and my college's, and he said they're pretty similar. Don't let the fact that its a sober ride program into fooling you that the people are all conservative, non-drinking students...the ONLY people I go out to bars with are the ones who I met through that organization! It occurs at night so you'll be sacrificing a night of partying or whatever, but I find it worth it. Plus, it gives you a fantastic thing to talk about on your resume to make you as a person (not your grades) seem more interesting. I have so many people ask me about the program and are always impressed. This type of program isn't for everyone though as it sometimes can be a bit intense with driving late at night.\n\nAaaannddd thats the end of my wall of text. It was really long, but thats because I related too much. Idk if it helped, but I hope you takeaway at least one thing useful from this. \n\nEdit: grammar ",

I even found that the more I destressed and unplugged from constant studying and work, that my grades did drop, but nothing so significant as to be worth losing my head over. So, @OP, go to counseling, learn to unplug a bit from that nasty gauntlet of classes before it chews you up any further, none of it is worth your mental health.",

You value different things now, and that's just part of who you're becoming, and your friends might have different goals and mindsets as well. It's normal and healthy if anything, but if you feel like you're incessantly oriented around school try to make some more leisure time to hang out with other friends or establish a new connection with your older friends from high school.

Does your school offer any intramural sports you could participate in? You don\u2019t have to be good and they can be a lot of fun. If you\u2019re really worried about this you could try talking to someone at the counseling center.

Most other students are struggling like you are. Most other students are devoting a ton of time to their studies. You aren't an idiot in the presence of a group of superior beings - you're a college student going to college with other college students. Some of your peers might excel in academics, or might've found their niche with their major, so that studying and putting in the time doesn't feel like a grind or like work, but for many it *is* a grind and it *is* a struggle and it *is* work.\n\n[Practice positive self-talk](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-use-positive-self-talk-for-stress-relief-3144816). You're obviously struggling with some mental health issues that a therapist can undoubtedly help with, but until you put aside the time for therapy, [positive self-talk](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hope-relationships/201605/the-power-positive-self-talk) can fill that gap.

Those \"frivolous\" things are not really frivolous things in my opinion.  I don't study CS because I only derive joy from programming.  \n\nI study CS because I felt I could have a career that will enable me to have greater financial freedom than my parents.  And I like programming.  But I love connecting with other humans, and I think most humans do in some basic way, but things like anxious thoughts or self destructive behavior warps what people think they like.\n\nAlso, how would you ever really know you are not as intelligent as most other students?  I don't think there has ever been a scale of rating intelligence that doesn't have huge flaws inherent in it.  It is your perception that everyone who is not you is smarter than you.  Your perception is yours and is up to you to analyze and shift.\n\n>plus it makes me feel incredibly guilty if I do take time away from schoolwork to do things that are recreational or generally just unimportant.\n\nWhy do you feel this guilt?  I feel this guilt if I am actually neglecting my studies but once my work is done, i feel no guilt for enjoying life.  If you can decide where this guilt comes from you have the ability to change your thought patterns and temper this guilt.  Counseling is not frivolous, it is like working out in the gym.  By staying in touch with how outside events change your perception you will be a stronger person in the future.  Would you like to live your entire life feeling that anything not work is frivolous?  It is up to you, those negative thoughts you have are just that, thoughts.  \n\n>I would love to spend time doing frivolous things like going to sports games or joining clubs, or attending counseling, but even if I could do it I don't think I would be able to convince myself to.\n\nSomewhere in that above quote is a little bit of a lie.  You say you would already love to join a club.  You also say that you don't think you would be able to convince yourself to.  To me it sounds like you have already convinced yourself \"I would love to spend time doing frivolous things\", but then your self-doubt limits your actualization.\n\nAs for practical advice, make a schedule there is no way you should need to dedicate all waking hours to school work, it is unsustainable.  \n\nWe only get one body, and one mind; at least as far as we know today.  Take care of them.  ",
