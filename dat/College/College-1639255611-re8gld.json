  "title:": "Should I explain to my professor the situation with my teammates? What should I tell her?",
  "text": "Basically I am part of a team with an assigned project to do data analysis. We each essentially needed to do the same steps but with different software (trying to anonymize this) and do data analysis for our parts. So, everyone has done their part, but, throughout the project, both of my teammates have been hard to reach, and the couple of meetings we've had, I've had to do a lot of the heavy lifting of organizing everything / figuring the work out. One person (A) had to go to a country where there is shit internet and has gone days being radio silent and the other (B) keeps being late to any meeting time we agree to or not showing up , it's been a mess. B and I stayed up till 4:30 putting our work together to present our rough draft. We got told we needed to fix some things. That was Wednesday.\n\n(A) profusely thanked us for not kicking them off the team like I suggested we might have to due to their silence, but went radio silent again. A also said when she broke her first silence right before presentation day that she kept forgetting to check Discord, even though she know that was the only communication channel with us she'd have access to but went silent for a second time right after thanking us after the presentation. B , even though B did help me put all of our work together, is still hard to get a hold of. He'll speak up, apologize, then not meet me at 2PM like we agreed to, it's 3:42 PM and the project is due Monday.\n\nI could ask to just, do my own work and submit it , would that be fair? Should I wait and see if B responds today or tomorrow? Should I email my professor? She's understanding, I jsut don't want to look unprofessional. What should I ask for? Awareness of the situation? To be able to submit alone?\n\nthere is a final report and I did a bunch of work on that. B acknowledged I did a lot of work on this and the project, but is still kinda AWOL right now. This whole situation has been stressing me the fuck out because I just want to pass this class. I don't need to do superr well on this to do so but uhhh, having my work recognized with passing the class would be nice since I had to fight through burn out to get my work done, hence my stress.\n\nSuggestions are appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;",
