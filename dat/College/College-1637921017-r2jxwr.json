  "text": "Hello there r/college. I moved recently down south to another state which is a an extremely big state in September. I went to college as freshman in August and September before being sent away because of issues with a loud speaker and behavioral issues. I also had sleep problems and was taking a lot of naps during the day which caused me to miss class and I got in trouble for that. Now that I\u2019m in another state and in an apartment I feel like I took the environment for granted and now I have a job at lifetime fitness down south of the state I was in. Now I am enrolled in online community college with my parents helping me with some of the work as of now for me as of now. One of them is in a different state and I wanna do much more of the work now because they are basically doing it all for me and that doesn\u2019t sit right with me. My laptop also broke down in college and I need another one. I asked my parents to send it as well but I\u2019m not sure what type I want. I\u2019m 19 and I should be doing that work. I also got my lifetime job in October so I have had it for a bit over a month. I\u2019m making a lot more money than my previous job but it can get pretty lonely at my job and I wanna go back to the college experience. I also my miss my roommate a lot and I feel like I let him down. He had a lot planned for me. I need lots of help and advice. Thank you\n\nSincerely,\n\nBroad-Classic5509",
