  "text": " Is it appropriate to gift my math professor chalk?\n\n I go to UCLA as a math major. My professor is a male, I am female. His chalk is at the end of its life and he wont discard it, its disrupting class. I think I speak for everyone else in my class when I say that I am sick of watching him wave around his clearly ancient, white chode piece of chalk. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if he has been using the same piece for 20 years. It's broken, leaves terrible trails when he writes with it, and sounds like nails on a chalkboard because of the sharp edges. I have around 20 boxes of Hagoromo full-touch white chalk that I stocked up on before they went bankrupt back in 2014. This chalk is widely accepted as the best chalk you can get, and famous mathematicians have been known to use this chalk in the past.\n\nCould this be perceived as an attempt to get my grade raised?\n\n Could I get in trouble for gifting him this?",

      "text": "OMG as fellow Hagoromo-loving math faculty, that would be PERFECT. \n\nFYI your university may have a specific policy about professors accepting gifts worth over a certain dollar amount, or that a gift up to X dollars is fine but the prof has to record it with the department/college. However, honestly no one is checking unless there\u2019s some sort of wider issue; it\u2019s a cover-your-ass policy on the university\u2019s part in the event someone gets sued. No one is going to get in trouble over a box of chalk and it\u2019s a lovely, absolutely appropriate gesture, especially since it\u2019s literally classroom supplies that benefit everyone in the course. (At my university any gift over $5 must be reported. Every semester somebody brings me a thank-you coffee gift card or chocolate or yes, chalk, that\u2019s worth more than $5. Do I report that? No, and neither do any of my colleagues, because the paperwork is ridiculously disproportionate and HR doesn\u2019t actually care anyway unless they\u2019re actively looking for a reason to fire you. If a student tries to hand you an envelope of cash, then yeah that\u2019s a different gig.)\n\nI also don\u2019t think it would be perceived as grade-grubbing in any way! You noticed his chalk is on its last legs, you have a stockpile of chalk laying around, you brought him a box. It\u2019s a nice thing to do that doesn\u2019t have any kind of quid-pro-quo implications attached to it.",
