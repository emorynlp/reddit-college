  "text": "The country I am in has decided to shut down university for the rest of the semester due to Covid, regardless of how good things get, because our country keeps on going up and down in terms of cases. Our government is handling this like a pack of morons and making promises they can't keep, but anyway ..\n\nI am so fucking sick and tired of this. I usually LOVE studying and learning, but staying at home with my relatives I find it SO hard to concentrate, I don't feel like I am performing at my best and it agitates me. I wanna scream, or maybe cry?  I don't even want to be near people because I tend to snap or feel annoyed by them (I have anxiety), and I don't want to be like that. \n\nSo, how are you, as students, handling it? Any tips?",

Also, what's so \"idiotic\" about the argument that vaccinated people shouldn't have to wear masks?  That argument is completely valid.",

                  "text": "This argument doesn't really hold. The more people get delta, the better immune they'll be to the virus. Look at Spain and Israel. They have little COVID cases at the moment in spite of few restrictions. That's because they've built up immunity by catching COVID. There's a very low chance that a vaccine immune varient will arise. I mean, a lot of developing countries aren't even properly vaccinated yet so no amount of restrictions in developed countries will be able to reduce the risk of variants happening anyway. Just get those countries vaccinated and the job is done. There could be one that's even more transmissible, but people's immune systems would be getting stronger and stronger so it wouldn't be much of an issue. There's a greater chance of a new virus happening than a worse variant honestly and more restrictions wouldn't be able to deal with that. The vaccine greatly reduces hospitalisation and death rates already so it's not like the virus is lethal for you. Just maybe a month (or more if you're really unlucky) of suffering in order to actually get rid of COVID for once. In fact, being previously infected by COVID gives you substantially higher immunity (6 times as much when unvaccinated and even more if the infected person is vaccinated) than a person who's vaccinated, but hasn't been infected. \n\nAnd you can always stay at home if you don't want to. Just allow people like me who are willing to take a very small risk of getting badly infected by COVID do whatever the hell they want. I'm not prepared to lower my quality of life when others can literally just stay at home like a hermit if they want to.",
