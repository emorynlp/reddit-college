              "text": "Well if his Office hours are at the start of the week, why don\u2019t you just start the homework and try to finish it for the start of the week? That way you can ask any questions you have in person and be done with the homework. This is also a good way to show engagement in the class. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how much TA expectations can differ as my TAs normally standardize how they grade, but if you have a group and genuinely understand how to solve each problem and get the right answers, whatever the TA expectation is just packaging, not the bulk of the work.",

Many students wait until the last minute to do work, so there will be a lot of questions that come in late Wednesday nights. \n\nIf you are on that boat, abandon ship and start doing the homework earlier. The earlier the better. You should almost be done with the homework before the office hours so your last minute questions can be answered. If that absolutely isn\u2019t possible, consider finishing by Tuesday night, so you aren\u2019t emailing at the same time as everyone else.",
