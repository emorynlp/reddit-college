      "text": "I\u2019m a tenured full professor.  I usually use attendance as a barometer for if I round up a grade.  If a student has attended every class and earns a 77, I would usually round to a B.  On the other hand, if a student earns a 79.5 and has missed multiple classes it would remain a C.  My rationale is that a student that comes to class everyday has put forth effort through the semester and should be rewarded.  I always tell my students this at the beginning of the semester.  So in short, every prof has their own way of doing things.",
