  "text": "So im going to college in the spring as a transfer. I think i have 24 credit hours (really bad i know), the school requires students under 30 credit hours to live on campus/in a dorm. My problem is i really really don\u2019t want to live in a dorm. I was so looking forward to having my own kitchen/laundry room/restroom/ etc. When i moved out but my mom keeps asking if ive gotten a dorm yet.. i havent. I don\u2019t want to put the effort into getting a dorm that i dont even want to be in. I was thinking about getting the dorm, then waiting till they went home and then getting my own apartment but after thinking about it, thats a really dumb idea.. so im stuck. My cousin had her own apartment her freshman year, and nobody even blinked. So should I fight my parents to let me put a deposit for a cheap apartment or should i get the dorm to apease them and then just get my own place?? Cause otherwise id have to get a storage unit too because like i said, i have a lot of decor and stuff i was looking forward to putting in my own place, but it honestly just seems like a hassle to me. I\u2019m stuck.",
