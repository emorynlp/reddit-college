  "text": "Ik everyone\u2019s different , and sometimes it depends on the college, so don\u2019t tell me any of this in the comments. \n\nWhich one of these in your opinion do you believe to be more writing based / harder. I\u2019m choosing an elective for spring but really don\u2019t want it getting in my way of doing other important things. \n\nPhycology 1, \nHist-WW1 \nMacro/microeconomics\nUSA-colonial to reconstruction \nEcon- contemporary economic Issues \nHist- Modern western civilization\n\nBtw all of these are 3 credits . \n\nAnything helps",

      "text": "As a rule of thumb, history classes will be more likely to assign more reading and writing, since reading and writing are the bread and butter of humanities. I wouldn't say that makes them *harder,* but if you hate reading and writing, you're not gonna love history, especially in upper division classes.\n\n\nI'd consider econ more difficult just because you're more likely to encounter math and you may need to memorize more concepts, depending on how the course is taught.",

              "text": "It def does depend on the prof. I had history profs in my undergrad who were more exam heavy and some who were more lecture heavy, but it was def more normal for me to see writing assignments in classes for my major (history) than I did for classes I took outside of humanities, especially the more specialized the classes got.\n\n\nThat's understandable about the essays. One thing that may give you a better idea on that is emailing the listed prof and being like \"I'm considering this class, do you have a syllabus I could glance at?\" Some won't, but some may have one either prepped early or from teaching the class another year. Idk if you wanna deal with all that haha, but it can help sometimes.",
