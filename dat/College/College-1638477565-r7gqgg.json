  "text": "And a follow up:  Do professors expect me to disclose extremely personal information to them in these situations?  Why aren't official accommodations enough to \"prove\" that I'm telling the truth?\n\nI just looked at the professors sub and seeing them laugh at students using mental health as an \"excuse\" at the end of the semester was worrying for me.  I have accommodations through my university for attendance/deadlines.  This semester, I used them less than I have in the past, and it has only been the last week or so that things have started piling up to an unmanageable point.\n\nI'm a good student and I'm passionate about my major.  I feel guilty every single time I can't get myself to go to class or I can't finish an assignment on time.  When I ask for an extension, I mention that I'm struggling mentally because I'm not sure how else to make sure they know I'm not a lazy kid who doesn't care.  Do they think that I've been making it up the whole time?\n\nProfessors always say \"you need to communicate with us if you want us to help you\" but I don't think I should have to tell a person I barely know \"Hi, my medication isn't working and I can't get an appointment to try to fix it until after finals.  Also I haven't showered in three days and today I barely had the energy to eat so I unfortunately wasn't able to complete my assignment.\"",

      "text": "> just looked at the professors sub and seeing them laugh at students   \nusing mental health as an \"excuse\" at the end of the semester was   \nworrying for me.  \n\nYou have accommodations - that's entirely different.  No one (save for a couple of posters that I've seen) has any issue with students with officially acknowledged mental health concerns.  What they've been complaining about are the *self-diagnosed* cases of students who've announced that they've got mental health issues without any official documentation, yet they expect full accommodations.  That's not how it works.\n\nYou don't *have* to tell any of your instructors your specific issues.  If you have the official documentation, then the Student Disabilities Office is the only agency that needs to know, and they will inform the professor of what needs to be done (not what is affecting you).  A professor can ask (which is outrageous, tbh), but you're not obligated to divulge, nor should you feel intimidated or pressured to do so.\n\nFor the record, when a student tells me that they've got issues, I take them at their word until they demonstrate that my faith in them is misplaced.  That said, legally, I still cannot alter a class's requirements for a student claiming any sort of health issue without the official documentation from the Student Disabilities Office.",

But to answer your question, no, it's never bothered me that accommodations are used, whether once or a thousand times.  \n\nIf there's an issue for me, it's the student who waits until three minutes before an exam to declare that they have a test accommodation.  In that case, the student would have to test in a quiet area in another part of the campus, and such a late notice would make it impossible for me to get a test to the site (or for the site to prep for the student).  Usually, the Student Disability Office briefs students so that this is avoided, but it's happened and it makes for a lot more work for everyone (especially the student) involved.\n\nBut again, if you've got an official accommodation, then use it and don't worry about what anyone else might think.",

It's pretty obvious that a student with depression/ADHD/etc may put off an assignment until the last day thinking they'll be able to get it done in time.  And like I mentioned, those conditions or the way we are made to feel for having them might lead us to avoid asking because of guilt or embarrassment.  All I'm thinking about while I'm sending that email is that I messed up again and it isn't a fun feeling.",

We have obligations outside of your class just like you have obligations outside of being our professor.  If you think it's unreasonable to expect someone to be up all hours of the night working, why would you continue to give 11:59 deadlines when you know most students are going to submit it close to that time?\n\nAnd one top of that, why do professors always complain about people submitting close to a deadline?  It's literally the time you provided.  If you don't want people to be emailing you in the middle of the night, don't make things due in the middle of the night.  We don't make the syllabus, you do.",
