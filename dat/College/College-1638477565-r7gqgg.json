  "text": "And a follow up:  Do professors expect me to disclose extremely personal information to them in these situations?  Why aren't official accommodations enough to \"prove\" that I'm telling the truth?\n\nI just looked at the professors sub and seeing them laugh at students using mental health as an \"excuse\" at the end of the semester was worrying for me.  I have accommodations through my university for attendance/deadlines.  This semester, I used them less than I have in the past, and it has only been the last week or so that things have started piling up to an unmanageable point.\n\nI'm a good student and I'm passionate about my major.  I feel guilty every single time I can't get myself to go to class or I can't finish an assignment on time.  When I ask for an extension, I mention that I'm struggling mentally because I'm not sure how else to make sure they know I'm not a lazy kid who doesn't care.  Do they think that I've been making it up the whole time?\n\nProfessors always say \"you need to communicate with us if you want us to help you\" but I don't think I should have to tell a person I barely know \"Hi, my medication isn't working and I can't get an appointment to try to fix it until after finals.  Also I haven't showered in three days and today I barely had the energy to eat so I unfortunately wasn't able to complete my assignment.\"",

No one (save for a couple of posters that I've seen) has any issue with students with officially acknowledged mental health concerns.  What they've been complaining about are the *self-diagnosed* cases of students who've announced that they've got mental health issues without any official documentation, yet they expect full accommodations.  That's not how it works.\n\nYou don't *have* to tell any of your instructors your specific issues.  If you have the official documentation, then the Student Disabilities Office is the only agency that needs to know, and they will inform the professor of what needs to be done (not what is affecting you).  A professor can ask (which is outrageous, tbh), but you're not obligated to divulge, nor should you feel intimidated or pressured to do so.\n\nFor the record, when a student tells me that they've got issues, I take them at their word until they demonstrate that my faith in them is misplaced.  That said, legally, I still cannot alter a class's requirements for a student claiming any sort of health issue without the official documentation from the Student Disabilities Office.",
