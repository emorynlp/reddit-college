  "text": "Would it be weird or unwelcomed to email my professor about my anxiety? I'm taking medication for it but it's still a work in progress. My first class with them was last week and they cold called on nearly half the class (it's a foreign language course). Maybe it'd even prompt them even more to call on me to \"get me out of my shell\"?",

      "text": "I think unfortunately that really depends on what kind of person your professor is. They may be an asshole about it, or they may be super understanding. From what I know, cold calling is super common in foreign language classes and it may be required for your participation. But honestly, you don\u2019t have much to lose, I doubt they\u2019d call on you more just to be mean. Go ahead and email!",
