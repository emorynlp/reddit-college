It\u2019s more akin to statistics than calculus(though you do need to take calculus in a large majority of cases). In statistics, the math is fairly simple(for the first few courses at least), but the hard part is knowing what to do with the numbers and why you\u2019re doing those things. \n\nAt my college at least, you\u2019ll need calculus for a lot of the junior/senior level accounting classes as well as economics.",
