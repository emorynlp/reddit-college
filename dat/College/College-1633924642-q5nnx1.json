  "text": "Me and my roommate matched on a roommate finder and she was great through text and I thought it would be good. It has been absolutely horrible. She is the most inconsiderate person I have ever met in my entire life and I don\u2019t even know what to do at this point. Whenever I try to talk to her she pulls the covers over her head and faces the wall and ignores me. I also matched with her on our bed times and when we wake up. I tend to go to bed around 11-12 and wake up around 9-10 and she said she did too. That was a lie. She stays up till 3 am watching loud TV shows or FaceTiming people and talking loudly. She also sleeps literally all day, and I\u2019m a considerate person so I try not to be loud but it\u2019s really getting to me cause I feel like I\u2019m walking on eggshells in the place I shouldn\u2019t have to. She microwaves pork, which she knows I don\u2019t eat and I can\u2019t stand and asked her not to. I cant have friends in my room because it\u2019s so awkward because she never introduces herself and rolls over in bed. She also leaves her old food and trash sitting out after she said she was near and tidy. I have already gone to the RA and talked about it but nothing has helped. I would request a room change but I am in the nicest dorm on campus and I got us into it because I\u2019m in the honors college (she isn\u2019t) and honors college gets first pick. I don\u2019t want to lose my room and dorm but I\u2019m at the end of my rope. Any advice would be seriously helpful I don\u2019t know what I can do anymore.",

      "text": "Some messy people purposefully make themselves seem like a neat person so they can find someone who will feel forced to clean up after them. There should be someone above your RA that handles difficult roommate conflicts. See if you can get in contact with your Residence Life office on campus to get things situated. People move out all the time for many reasons. They may even have another room in the same building open. You just need to find out.",
