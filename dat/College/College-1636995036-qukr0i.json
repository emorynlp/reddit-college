There\u2019s nothing wrong with you, but maybe you need to come up with some strategies that will set you up for success? Unfortunately, a lot of assignments and keeping up is just down to self discipline. It can be difficult when you feel behind. Just start making a list of things to do and checking off the small ones first.",

How you can use those interests to help people? What are your career goals? How can your classes help you achieve those goals? Do you want to get a degree and get a job and be proud of yourself, or does giving up sound better to you? Think about the negative consequences of giving up. Think about the positive consequences of working hard. Imagine what you can accomplish. Get excited about it.",

It\u2019s totally normal and you shouldn\u2019t get alarmed much.\nUsually, when I find myself slacking, I just pause everything and think about my life.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on ?\u201d, \u201cwhy am I not productive ?\u201d, \u201cis there something bothering me, preventing me from focusing and studying ?\u201d \u201cAm I too busy with something ?\u201d,  \u201chave I accumulated loopholes ?\u201c, is that something I can manage or should I get rid of it ?\u201d\n\nAll those are questions I ask myself to identify the real problem. Once I\u2019ve pinpointed it, I try to find an adaptive solution and usually, it works fine and I\u2019m able to catch up to the speed of the semester.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, just take things step by step and it\u2019ll all go well",
