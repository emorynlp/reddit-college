  "title:": "(19M) Welding program and study aboard?",
  "text": "I've been on a gap year for a bit ever since i graduated hs this year. I think i finally want to experience college but done in the right way.\n\nThere is a junior college near me and they offer a plethora of programs. Here's what i want and don't want. I don't want to take any pre reqs. What i DO want is to take the welding program there. It describes how much you could be making. Between 19-30 an hour. Which sounds pretty good.\n\nBUT i also want to do study abroad. And it seems i need a certain amount of credits to be eligible. Either way, my goal is to learn a skill and hopfully make not good but GREAT money. And to travel. AND i want to avoid DEBT.\n\nIs my plan a good one??",

Ask the admissions people at the community college.",
