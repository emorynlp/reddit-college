As long as you fulfill all the other requirements, you can make it as short as you want. \n\nIf they say to aim for 3,000 words, it\u2019s a little less clear. Sometimes that means that they specifically want it to be within a couple hundred words of 3,000. Sometimes that means that in order to fulfill all the requirements the paper will need to be around 3,000 words, but you can make it as short as you want as long as you fulfill those requirements.",
