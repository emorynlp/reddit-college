I felt like that school wasn\u2019t for me and that I was an outsider. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because all the staff and leaders put on this face, or that the only time you could have conversation was during meaningless icebreakers, but I just felt lost. I felt like I chose the wrong school. It was that \u201cvibe\u201d but I\u2019m not sure if I should trust it. \n\nIs that just how orientation is? I want to believe that it is just kind of a facade and that real life college will actually be great, but that feeling is really sticking on to me.",

The school has resources and if they are not what you need find one that is covered by health insurance.

      "text": "College/university is quite a transition from highschool and unless the other new students you met during the day came with many of their highschool friends to keep them company I would suspect they were feeling similar to yourself.\n\nHere's a few tips I wish I had known when I started 3 years ago:\n\n1. Your tutors/teachers are people not so different from yourself so if you enjoy their classes treat them as if it were you standing at the front of the room and don't be afraid to ask for advice as they were once in your position.\n2. People are shy and this shyness can lead to very quiet tutorials that are uncomfortable for everyone. Therefore, don't be afraid to speak up in class and ask questions even if it's scary at first as it will get the ball rolling and allow others to overcome the same fear.\n3. Attend all of your tutorials/classes and lectures! I don't care if it's easier to watch the recorded lectures in your own time because chances are that the time wont come. Attending tutorials is a great way to meet a variety of different people and find the ones you click with and they will keep you on track with your studies.\n4. Join a club or society you're interested in. This can help you meet people with common interests and find out what people like yourself do for fun.\n5. READ!! One of the best pieces of advice I have ever received was to read non-fiction books that interest me. Reading can really help with your writing and it also allows you to develop and critically reflect on yourself the world around you.\n6. Finally, I know it may be boring buuut... read the textbook. Although it may seem tempting to rely on the lectures for the course content there is only so much a powerpoint can educate. The earlier you push yourself to read the textbook, the easier assignments become and the faster you will be able to read.\n7. Finally, finally... read the referencing guide and practice correct referencing from your first assignment. It only gets easier and will save you from losing a lot of marks in the long term.\n\nFor the record, I'm only 20 and I still have much to learn but I  guarantee that this will make university/college a rewarding experience for you. I wish I had similar tips when I was new as it's been a bumpy road figuring it out for myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoodluck!!!",

After that, a group of upperclassmen shuffled into the room and awkwardly sang a song for like 5 minutes while doing a coereagraphed dance. I still shudder and cringe. After what seemed like and eternity of that, they separated us into small groups relative to our majors. I was the only music theory major, so I kept getting pointed out during the ice breakers and I was kind of at the center of every joke because I was alone. On small group icebreakers I had to awkwardly join another group that had nothing to do with my major. The icying on the cake was when class scheduling started. One by one everyone got called into an office to setup their classes. I was the very last person, and the reason why was because my counselor didn't show up to orientation. So everyone except for me scheduled their classes at orientation, and I had to end up paying a $200 late sign up fee and had to scramble to get everything situated. Got told there was no double bass instructor, and had the schools double bass instructor (who had worked there for 15 years) call me and ask why I wasn't set up for solo practice. I ended up dropping out after my first semester because the entire experience was much of the same and I didn't want to continue paying all my money to such a goat fuck of a school.",

The first one was at some private school and had \"teambuilding exercises\" and icebreakers for 8-9 hours straight, I couldn't stand it and it really left a sour taste in my mouth until my classes started, then it was a completely different experience as I enjoyed going and being on campus. My most recent one was for a giant university and while the orientation program itself wasn't bad, the facade that the leaders and faculty put on was horrible but its mostly just to make the school seem wholesome to parents and isn't geared much toward the students but that's just my thought on it. I start again this Fall and I'm excited to see how it goes but outside of the orientation, I love the atmosphere of the campus and everything it has to offer.\n\nDon't fret, because orientation isn't representative of the actual experience. Everything is going to be just fine and if you decide you don't like the school, explore other options. I understand what you're feeling though.",

You're in a new environment with new people, places, sounds, smells, etc. You likely don't really know anyone, and you've left a place you were previously comfortable in. Don't worry, it'll pass. It takes the human mind time to adjust to a new environment and become comfortable.

There are a bunch of people in charge who have no idea what a good time looks like. Many of them are parents with kids 7 years younger than you, and they seem to think what their 11 year old finds fun is a good idea for you. Sound like what you experienced today? They do all this to make the main purpose (unsuccessfully) more palatable:\n\n2. Get what you need out of it. Walk around with your group and get acquainted with where you will be spending the next few years of your life. Ask questions when you can if you have them (and you should). Ask how long it takes to get from your first class to your second class on the other side of campus. Ask about what you need to know about parking your first few weeks (it will be terrible). Get familiar with how the rooms feel. Are they cold? Bring a hoodie your first day. Are they burning up? Still bring a hoodie, they may crank the AC. Ask the hours at the gym. If they don't mention a campus app, ask about it. \n\n3. Everyone was there today for #2. You are as likely to make awesome friends during orientation as you are in the line at a  Starbucks you visited once. It's possible, but unlikely. People are too focused on #2 and being forced to do #1. Time for interactions will come soon.",

I was in this *exact* scenario last year and I can absolutely relate to how you feel. When I was at orientation all I could think of was how much better orientation and the people would have been at the other school. A year on and I can honestly say that I LOVE where I am. Ultimately I never spoke to the people I met at orientation again and that's okay and perfectly normal! Instead, I met the real friends that made my first year so great by joining tons of extracurriculars and forming study groups with people in my classes that I felt I could get along with. If this doesn't work, there is ZERO SHAME IN TRANSFERRING!!\n\nEither way, orientation is no way an indicator of how college will go, but if you make it to the end of this semester and feel the same way, consider transferring.",

I felt the same way and was relieved to get to campus in the fall and find out that actual college life was nothing *at all* like orientation.",

I know for me the feeling of being an outsider went away gradually and I think you just need more time than orientation to really get to know people and get used to the school. Once everything new starts to settle I think you might feel less alone/ like an outsider",

Happened to me in basic training, then it happened again in AIT, then it happened again when I came home, again for community college, again for the new apartment I moved into. I expect it'll happen again after I transfer to a 4-year. My advice: go distract yourself, go meet people, find something to do.

I told my parents that I didn\u2019t think it was the university for me and they supported my choice and instead I went to a community college instead. I still stand by my choice today because I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to force myself to go to a university I hated because it would\u2019ve ruined my entire college experience. Another reason I almost forced myself to go was because of the stigma (at least where I live) about going to a community college instead of a 4 year, but that shouldn\u2019t be a deciding factor for where you go to school.

My advice would be to start some routines; the brain craves predictable patterns, and having a routine will make you feel better.
