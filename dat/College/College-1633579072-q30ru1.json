  "text": "I\u2019m a post bac student, meaning I graduated, but I\u2019m taking classes with undergraduate students to fulfill course requirements for med/nursing school. I didn\u2019t know beforehand, but physics has a reputation for being extremely difficult at this university. I\u2019m seriously struggling with this course. I received our first test back and I basically failed it. But I\u2019m not the only one who did poorly as our professor had to curve the grades. \nThis one professor teaches all sections and does like 10 minutes of lecturing every two or three classes. He makes us do group activities like 95% of the time. He never answers his emails (at least the ones I send) and he only holds office hours for two hours a week. There are TAs, and I have attended so many of their office hours, but it doesn\u2019t help that much. \nOur next test is already in less than two weeks, and I\u2019m so scared since people said his last class\u2019 average for the second test was 50%. I continued school so I could boost my grades, but this class is ruining it all. At this rate, I\u2019m going to fail the course. I don\u2019t know what to do. Would speaking to him even help? I feel like it\u2019d just be complaining to him.",

              "text": "Different videos often teach in different ways. Yes, a lot of them will provide the same info but if you keep up the search there are videos that explain it in different ways. \n\nSomething else you can do is look at people solving problems. Once again, videos are good for this, but so are things like stack exchange and the such. It just takes some time to refine your search to get what you need.",

I\u2019ve already tried watching videos and reading the textbook. Having a great professor really makes a difference and the fact that he basically doesn\u2019t even care since he has tenure now is just so shitty.",

Just find the corresponding course on their \u201cMIT OpenCourseWare\u201d website and you have access to some of the best professors in the world. \n\nI recommend not demonizing your professor in your mind as it will simply make your experience worse. Your problem shouldn\u2019t be with the professor, it should be with the barrier you have regarding physics. Think about what is causing this barrier and try to dismantle it. You know how you learn better than anyone, so don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions like \u201cprofessor, can you explain how to do this problem using this method\u201d during office hours or at the end of classes.",
