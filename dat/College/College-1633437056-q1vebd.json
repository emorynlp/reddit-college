  "text": "Hey all, anybody here applied at NAIT for PCP Jan 2022 intake? Just interested on estimate of applicants. And how many people awaiting MMI results.\nGetting really anxious. I got 2-3 more weeks of waiting until they release it. If not already delayed due to Alberta's covid situation. Hoping to get a response from all recent and previous applicants!",
