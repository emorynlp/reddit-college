      "text": "I always try to envision myself in the future, such as during winter break. When doing this, I also envision myself looking back on my past self in order for me to recollect and reminisce on the hardships, stresses, long nights, and early mornings that I went through to get to that point such as winter break in this example. \n\nI tell myself that I will work hard now in order to truly enjoy it later. Imagining myself being happy and free of stress makes me motivated to earn it by studying hard now. It\u2019s difficult, but just remember that the reward you will earn from working hard will make it all worth it.",
