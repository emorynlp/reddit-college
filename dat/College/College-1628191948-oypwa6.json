Sexual harassment, creepy remarks, and hostility frankly have no place. \n\nDoes anyone ese share this opinion?\n\nEDIT: oh no, I've peeved the pedos",

Me, being an idiot and not knowing a lot of people at my college, took him up on the offer and asked him some questions about my school.\n\nHe pretty quickly got really creepy, and I blocked him. My brother has a friend who went to the same school as me and was in his grade, and I asked her about him. She told me to avoid him, as he had a rep for being a major creep on campus. She reported him to community standards, and I had to talk to the community standards dean about the incident.\n\nI asked around if anybody else got weird messages from him, and it turns out almost every girl I spoke to did. \n\nI only realized post-graduation how absolutely fucked up this was. He was a weird, *weird* dude. That year, whenever he saw me on campus, he would stare at me intently. When I was with a group of friends, he would slowly move towards my group. It made me super uncomfortable. Thank God he graduated that year.",

I think it\u2019s cool that you get to hang out with people of different ages and different places but to engage in \u201csexual behaviors\u201d around girls/boys much younger than them it\u2019s a problem. Seniors/Juniors have so much to offer than other freshman and it\u2019s true. They have the apartments, the cars, they know the city, go to the most \u201cluxurious\u201d or \u201cpopular\u201d parties and know everyone around. They\u2019ve been learning all of that since they were new. I don\u2019t think this might be a problem at all but maybe that\u2019s why some girls and boys feel like they need to hangout with the older people, they give so much but what are they asking of you in return? \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve met a lot of seniors at my college and they\u2019ve been one of the nicest people around me, they didn\u2019t ask me for anything and whenever I or my friends need advice on a class or something they help us. I\u2019m saying that some of them don\u2019t have the best intentions, and that\u2019s where the problem starts. Things like the signs with the weird and creepy titles that OP talked about are completely out of place. Yeah, we know frats are the stereotypical crazy party people and that idea comes from TV and movies that portrays them in this way. I\u2019m not in a frat or a full time party guy but I have frat friends that told me, \u201cyeah\u201d, this behavior is pretty common.\n\nMy best advice would be to honestly just make sure you\u2019re hanging out with right people, watching out for red flags and taking care of yourself and your friends. It\u2019s sad that everyone has to live on alert if something happens but honestly nowadays what\u2019s not likely to happen? It\u2019s a weird world \n\nStay safe everyone.",

Life isn't black & white, people don't magically mature overnight when they hit a certain age, and if a person isn't developed enough to be thrust into college life with older peers then they just shouldn't go to college yet.  I'm pretty sure most of the people commenting on this thread are like 14 years old or are just trying to demonstrate their superior morality. If you *truly* think that an 18 year old shouldn't have a relationship with an upperclassman then maybe talk to your state representative and try to get the age of consent changed. Until then stfu",

Grooming is definitely an entirely different issue that isn\u2019t acceptable. Some 18 year olds are mature for their age. When I was 18/ 19 I was in college full time, working full time in my desired field, volunteered with organizations that were important to me, and was in a long term relationship. Most of my friends were 20-25 years old and I\u2019d say that being in a relationship with someone my friend\u2019s age wouldn\u2019t have been too unreasonable (if I wasn\u2019t in said relationship). That being said, some of my friends at 18/19 still lived with their parents, asked for permission to go out, and would dog sit for money. Everybody is different, and to tell an adult what they can or can\u2019t handle, or what is good or bad for them, is ridiculous. I\u2019m sure some people have these opinions due to poor sitruations that either them or their friends have been in, but it\u2019s just not the same for everybody.",

The girls love that the older guy has an apartment for them to hang out in, and a place for her to shower and sleep that\u2019s not the dorm, and he can buy her alcohol. She also hopes that if they stay together he will be making good money in 1 or 2 years and can support her in her later college years. The older guy sees a girl who is spending a long amount of time away from home for the first time and takes advantage of that. Technically she is 18 so no one can say anything, but even having one year away from home under your belt makes a huge difference when it comes to your decision making skills. As a woman who graduated I would advise other women to at least complete one semester before getting involved with an older guy.",
