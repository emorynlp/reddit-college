  "text": "I'm a second year majoring in CIS, but I've been focused on GE's. I was searching up careers I can get with this degree and the results I get are vague. And since I'm taking on GE's this semester, next semester I'll be going through the upper division technical classes (I know CIS programs can vary from different colleges, and mine is more technical). \n\nI want to know for those who are deep into their years majoring in CIS, how is it? Are the classes fun and/or interesting? What do you plan on doing after?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this!!!",
