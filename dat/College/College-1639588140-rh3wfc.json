I\u2019d say it seems like a roadblock for you at the moment.\n\nI\u2019d take some time to first evaluate why you failed chemistry twice. Doing some reflection may help you see what you did wrong and what needs to be done to do better the next time around.\n\nOnce you do that, I\u2019d suggest you figure out what you want to do. I think taking at a CC may be easier as long as you get a good professor for it. I\u2019m not sure how much more chemistry you\u2019ll have to take, but I would also spend some time thinking about whether you\u2019ll be able to complete the other chemistry courses after you pass this one.\n\nSorry that I don\u2019t have a direct answer for it, but I hope this was helpful in some way. Let me know if you want to ask me anything else.",

If you're some variety of pre-med two Fs in Gen Chem are not going to be great but strength in later science classes can help offset that. If there's another major or career path you're really interested in, that's a good reason to change majors. If you're still interested in you're current major and you can identify and fix the issues that led to your struggles so far, then go ahead and try again (A cc or other teaching focused school isn't a bad option if you would benefit from taking it in a smaller class.)",
