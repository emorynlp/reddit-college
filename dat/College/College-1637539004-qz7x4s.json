If you\u2019ve transferred schools before, how did it go? What was the process like?\nOne of my biggest fears is losing my new friends I\u2019ve made at my current school and not knowing anyone at a new school. How did you deal with that?",

      "text": "Hi! I'm someone who transferred from a UC school to a community college for my sophomore year. I wasn't struggling in university, but I was naive as a high schooler when I committed to a school that was 8-9 hours away from my family. I didn't take into account how expensive it would be to be so far away from my family especially in a beach town. \n\nI wanted to transfer from a university to another university initially, but I was rejected when I didn't complete all the GE classes I needed. My university promoted taking GEs as cushions for taking harder classes so at the time I didn't have a lot of GEs anyways. So I decided to transfer my credits from uni to a local CC. The process was fairly easy, but the hardest part was letting go of a school that I did a lot of work to get into. I wish I could talk about losing friends from my university, but I studied during the pandemic so we didn't really have a chance to bond anyways. If you have any questions or if you want insight, feel free to send a DM!",

      "text": "I transferred universities and it was not easy but I transferred as a senior. I went to a CC for 2 years, then a university on the west coast for 1 year. Now I go to a local university in the Midwest. \n\nI wish I hadn\u2019t of had to make the decision to switch universities but I had too. COVID made me change my priorities from my own dreams and aspirations to wanting to be close to my family. Ultimately since I transferred so late in the game, I ended up being put a semester behind so I\u2019ll graduate in Dec \u201822. \nSo far, I\u2019ve made some connections at my new school but friends aren\u2019t my priority. I also didn\u2019t really have friends at my first university because of COVID so, I can\u2019t offer much advice there but I would say that people are, in general, nice. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to transfer, I would do it now. Waiting too long will likely result in you having to repeat classes.",
