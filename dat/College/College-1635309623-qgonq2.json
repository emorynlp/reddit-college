  "text": "A little context, my whole life I have had adhd and it is very clear now. I recently went to a psychiatrist, and would need to go to a second session to have my confirmed diagnosis which I have scheduled. I go to university in Houston, tx. I also would like to go to medical school. I am currently on academic probation, got my financial aid suspended but I successfully appealed, I just needed to sign an agreement I would get a good semester gpa and not withdraw from any classes, and some other things. I am currently taking a bio 1 class, chem 1 class, a computer programming class and a biotechnology class. (I am retaking bio 1 and chem 1) Being honest I love these classes and I am very interested in the material, only thing is I can not do it. I always started strong, but like always I fall of to the point where I attend none of the classes, do none of the work. It is extremely bad. The only reason I had no consequences first time I failed was because I was able to change my grades to show as unsatisfactory due to covid, and in grade school I was always able to advance to the next grade. I have 2 tests this week, we\u2019d and thurs for bio and chem. It has been the same exact thing like the first time I took these classes. I did no work the week before, and on Sunday is when I decided I needed to study. I would have 3 days to study. I sat down, opened the summary notes of the chapter for chem and skimmed the first 3 pages. I had a breakdown realizing I was going to fail and it would be the same exact thing, get suspended in the spring, as well as my financial aid would get suspended. After a while, I decided the best thing to do is to drop my classes to show as W\u2019s. Then I decided to try to instead get accommodations. It would be great if I do get accommodations, since I think I will soon start medication. If I do decide to go the route of dropping my classes, is the financial aid office the only place I can talk to, or is there any other place I could try? Is it likely they will understand or be \u201cNot my problem \u201c and suspend my financial aid. Lastly, I know medical school does not like W\u2019s. I currently have 2, dropping these 4 will put me at my max. Is it likely they will understand or be \u201cNot my problem?\u201d Thank you",
