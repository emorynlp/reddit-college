  "text": "I applied to this college months ago and paid for the non refundable fee confirmation (not the tuition, it\u2019s just you confirming you\u2019re enrolling there) anyhoo, months has passed I realized I don\u2019t want the course I got to and they don\u2019t do change of majors (which sucks) and my mother is a single parent so i wanted to help her by getting that money back even if it is non refundable. I know It\u2019s our fault we confirmed it but it sucks that I don\u2019t go to college now and finding a school that has the major I really wanted.  \n\nIm thinking of trying and publicly shame them on media into giving our money back (it\u2019s a lot of money trust me) so Anyone who can give me good reasons to get it back please please? I don\u2019t wanna disappoint my mom for not going to college and not having enough money \ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "You're not going to succesfully shame them or convince them to give you the money back. In paying the enrollment fee and then withdrawing, you took a spot that could have gone to another applicant. You knew it was non-refundable when you paid it. It's good that you want to help your mom, but this is a dead end. You're going to have to take the loss.",

      "text": "Now, I don't know what version of English you speak, but \"it is non refundable\" typically means that you can not get a refund on the deposit. And besides, penalizing you for not attending after you confirmed you would attend it literally the entire point of having a non-refundable deposit in the first place. If you try to complain about it, you will be laughed out of the room.",
