  "text": "We have exams at the moment on blackboard. They\u2019re not proctored or anything, all you do is download the exam question, write your answers on a Word Document, and then submit them like you would a normal assignment. Can lecturers/markers/whoever get your IP address or something similar, and see exactly where you were when you took the test? I wasn\u2019t at my house and it\u2019ll probably look like I\u2019m cheating if it does show up. Does it show exact location/suburb/city or just general region of an area?",
