  "text": "Im on thanksgiving break right now but im so worried about the last two weeks of my semester after this. Next week I will be out of class for my adoption and I  found out Ill be missing a big exam and i might have to do my final group project in another class all alone if im not there that day. Im trying to contact my professors to get a make up day for the exam and see what can be done for the project. They are not getting back to me and if they dont tommorrow idk what to do. On top of this the next week is finals week. Im crumbling right now and dont want to fail beacause of somthing I didnt have control over plus i hate having to be assertive in contacting them as I feel like im being annoying. I wish my adoption could be pushed back as it would make all this stress so much easier but instead i have to bend over backwards and make everything work out when nothing lines up. Idk what to and im so scared.",
