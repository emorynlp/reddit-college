  "text": "For the lecture I failed the first exam and realistically, if I made atleast a 90 on the other 3 exams and the final, I\u2019ll have a 83. Labs are worth 25% of our grade and I\u2019ve literally only made one B in all the assignments we\u2019ve done, everything else was like low F\u2019s. Pretty sure I fucked up w my lab practical. \n\nI have to get a B+ in this class to get into the program I want. I can either hope for the best or withdraw now and retake it next semester w experience. What should I do?",
