  "text": "School started last week for me and majority of classes are in person. I had a couple of core friends throughout quarantine, we got closer together and I was excited to be back in person and see them. After this week, it feels like I\u2019m back to being the periphery friend again. My invites to hang out and texts go ignored and I find out they hung out with other people. It doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m definitely not the most extroverted or talkative person, but I can hold my own in conversations.",

      "text": "OMG same!! Felt like I was trying my best to make friends during covid but when I come back to class and I see them, I know their names it's just now I'm invisible to them. It fkn sucks and then they hang out with other people that I also know. Like, it's fine to have multiple friends, of course, no big deal but like... not even a reply? Damn :( \n\nNot tryna vent (maybe just a lil bit), but my point is that this is so common now and I feel like covid made it worse. You're not alone here. I, too, am feeling the same and my campus is just so huge that I just blend in the crowd with all these other people who are in their cliques and I'm just the bystander. For me, I feel like I've been getting better, somewhat, at making conversation. I've been forcing myself to talk to people more in the hopes that I make more friends, but I've pretty much just jumped in the same boat as you now lol.\n\nIf it makes any difference at all, feel free to dm me, I'll be your friend :) No pressure at all tho, don't feel like you don't have to.",
