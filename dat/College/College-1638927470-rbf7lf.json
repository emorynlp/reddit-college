  "text": "I'm currently working through my schedule for the second semester and want to add a class but it's a level 300 course, am I an idiot for even considering it? \n\nFor added context I came into college with a lot of credits (by the end of this semester I'll be 1/3 of the way done), meaning I have almost all my 100s done. Before I added this class my schedule had 17 credits but this would bring it up to 20. It's also a class with a professor I have currently, who doesn't give out homework, just gives us exams and I'm told this is also how he runs his upper-level courses. One of my TAs told me she doesn't think I'll have a hard time but everyone else I've brought it up to has looked at me like I'm crazy. Am I crazy? \n\nSome of my friends are also taking this course but there aren't enough people right now to have it, so they've also been encouraging me to take it so it can actually happen. It's a course on literature from Japan if that helps at all. \n\nThank you!",

      "text": "Is it a subject you will like? Do you have the prerequisites?\n\nI took a 300 level anthropology class as a freshman and loved it. But, I was a science major and it was a science-based class. Ironically, there was a guest speaker one time and everyone went out for drinks afterwards. I was the only one who couldn\u2019t go because I was still under 21!\n\nThere might be a fairly long paper to write or long essay test questions. If you can handle it, then go for it. You are in college to learn everything you can. Don\u2019t hold back.",

          "text": "Yeah, the prereq was just a writing 101 class. The current class I'm taking by the same professor follows a similar structure of reading and then discussions which I really enjoyed.  \n\nHe actually gave us an exam this past week that was exactly like his upper-division classes' exams and I didn't really struggle.\n\nThank you so much though, it feels like so many people tell me I need to only take base-level classes but I don't really have any :'\\^( and I'm used to taking higher-level classes.",
