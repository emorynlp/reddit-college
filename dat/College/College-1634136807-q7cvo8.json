      "text": "I'm assuming you're talking about economics.  I have a finance, economics, and political science undergrad.  This was back in the early 1990s when there was no 'double major', so these are legit separate 4-year degrees.  I went on to become a bank executive and then entered academia.  \n\nFrom my experience in the corporate finance world, I would have dropped finance or any other business degree and just took economics.  I probably would add a math minor since there is so much calculus.  Banking taught me the finance I needed to know.  The economics degree is the golden ticket to the chocolate factory.  Also, economics will teach you how to critical think at a level you can't even imagine now.   But it's also hard.  \n\nToday, when I interview new college grades with my clients, the econ students are just on an entirely different level.",
