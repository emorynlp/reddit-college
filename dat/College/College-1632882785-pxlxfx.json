  "text": "I've been staring at my calendar for hours and can't work it out because between my job (the biggest chunk) and my commute I just don't have enough hours for even the minimum recommended amount of study time.\n\nAs per my advisor, for my course load I should be scheduling something like 37-65 hours of study per week, plus office hours (tough program) and the most time I can make is 22 hours per week, no office hours, or I'd have to finagle office hours in as possible.\n\nThat is with meal prepping done all at once, time scheduled in for cleaning at a minimum, less sleep than I would like, and no social time or extracurricular activities although I was set to join two competitive club sports and one club. \n\nI haven't made any friends yet and without the 'recharge time' I'm having a hard time understanding how this schedule will be sustainable. How do you make enough time for studying?",

This might mean that you could take a couple of extra semesters to finish, but would be much more beneficial in the long run.\n\nYou\u2019ve done the math - the way things are right now is not sustainable.",

              "text": "That\u2019s almost certainly not the full story - plenty of students attend less than full time. Those expectations are built around students who do not work and can put in the full 3-4 hours per credit per week of outside study time. Ask about attending part time and if that will have any impact on financial aid, if you receive it.",
