  "text": "I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019ve had a rough go at college so far. I\u2019m halfway through my sophomore year and I\u2019ve failed 3 different classes so far. My parents aren\u2019t helping me at all with tuition and my grants didn\u2019t go through and I don\u2019t have the money to pay for school. Needless to say, there\u2019s a lot of bad stuff going on. \n\nI started first semester in a bio major and quickly realized I was not suited for the major and almost immediately began failing all my classes. I believe I passed 2 of them, dropped 2 others, and failed 2 more. Second semester I luckily didn\u2019t fail anything, but this semester, I\u2019m failing one class only. I was placed on academic probation after the first semester, but Idk what\u2019s going to happen now if I fail this class.\n\nIf they kick me out for failing, does that ruin my chances of anything in the future?",

There are plenty of ways to be successful with and without college, everyone's path is different, and if college isn't a good part of your journey it certainly does not determine whether you fail or succeed in life.  I hope that helps :)",

      "text": "No. We don't all follow the same path. I think we (the western world) have been conditioned to think that uni is the only path and it has to be done right out of high school. That's really not the case at all. You can take breaks, you can go back to school later in life, and you can find success in things you're passionate about without finishing (or going at all). \n\nI know it might feel like a horrible weight right now but you will find a way through. And if that means taking a pause and reconsidering your education goals while you make money to survive and/or save, that is completely okay.",

Finding a job would be difficult but you can work on the subjects you're good at and find a way to make a living out of it if you want. Failing doesn't mean it's ur end. There are many ways for you to do what you like.",
