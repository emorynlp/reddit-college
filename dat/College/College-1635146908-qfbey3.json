  "text": "Do people just put their phones under their pillows and wake up through the vibration, because what if both students in the dorm have different wake-up times. Or does one roommate just wake up and go back to sleep cause it's not a big deal tbh. Lemme know about your experience.",

      "text": "I had a smart watch that woke me up by vibrating on my wrist. Before that, I used my phone and kept the volume low and made sure I woke up on my first alarm. I had a roommate with an earlier class than me that liked to snooze his alarm a couple of times before waking up. That\u2019s very rude, and I don\u2019t recommend it.\n\nIt\u2019s worth having a discussion at the beginning of the year, but the expectation in college and in shared spaces like that is that you guys have different schedules. Just be as respectful as possible.",

      "text": "I'd say it depends on the time difference of the alarms. I usually have my phone purely on vibration so I wake up to it and not my roommate because my alarm is usually set two hours earlier than hers. However, because hers is later, the sound is on because it doesn't bother anyone. Now, with more roommates it might be a problem, but the key is just to be considerate. \n\nMy first-year roommate had a really loud and obnoxious alarm set at 6:00 everyday that she'd forget to turn off even if she was on vacation. I have pretty bad insomnia so the earliest I fell asleep would be 1:00, so that was a living hell. \n\nMy advice is if you have your sound on, just ask your roommates if they mind, and if they do, work out some agreement.",

I did have one particular roommate that had a very loud and annoying alarm that she let play for about 15 minutes one time. But we had a conversation about it the night before so I knew to expect it. It's all about communicating with your roommates.",
