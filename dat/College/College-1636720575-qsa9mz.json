  "text": "Hi! Does anybody have professors like this where they literally do not care about homework, classwork assignments, etc? Like, they just never assign it at all? \n\nI feel like because of this, I\u2019m not doing too hot on my exams and projects, unfortunately. I study really hard. \n\nI feel like if I was given an opportunity to do class work, homework, etc and have some feedback onto it and get grades, I might do well on my projects because I know what to fix, I won\u2019t really stress out about my grades as much because I have multiple assignments to be graded, etc. \n\nI\u2019m just dreading the final terms.",

      "text": "Majority of the classes I took to get my degree were either 100% exams or 100%essay based. I think it\u2019s just a part of making that transition from high school. Those homework assignments and daily activists were there to hold your hand during high school. It\u2019s purpose was to show you what was needed to achieve and understanding of a subject. When you go to college, it\u2019s expected that you do these things on your own. I know, it\u2019s really tough the first two years when you\u2019re learning to be an independent adult and responsible student. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to make or break students. It\u2019s gonna take some discipline to develop a plan that gets you all the preparation you need for these exams. If that\u2019s studying every day, then so be it.",

      "text": "This is pretty common, but your professor probably has office hours for this purpose. If you're working on projects and just want feedback, drop by their office hours and ask! Same thing for HW assignments -- if you're solving problems while studying and see a discrepancy between your thought process and the solution manual, drop by office hours and ask.\n\nIt takes a lot of time to grade in large classes, but there are usually other ways to get feedback on your learning. You just have to reach out.",
