The goal of group project is to have a best result, gathering ideas and works from ALL members in that group. You in this situation may be a responsible one, a passionate one who tries hard to have a good result. But others may do not have a same goal like you, so they took it for granted, or finish it just for having. This or whatever is frustating. Just see, by knowing those people, you will realize more about doing group project. I think I could give some of MY questions when I have to do a group project: \n- Is there a group leader?/ Do we divide works equally and suitably for each one? \n- How about deadline? If a problem happens, can we redo it again? Can we SUPPORT that person with the problem? \n- If there is a frustration, what can we do? Can we talk in private and solve the problem? Is there any misunderstanding here? \nHave a nice day!! Do not bother about that stuff much. Just relax and take time for yourself. You have worked hard!! \nSorry if any of my ideas go wrong",

You either do the work or you don't, I refuse to do it for them.
