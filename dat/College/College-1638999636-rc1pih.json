  "text": "Hey everyone.\n\nI've been slacking for half of my High School career, and suddenly stopped caring about my future. For some reason, it never occurred to me that every second that passed by, it was more that I am unable to reverse. last week it suddenly clicked that my future is right in front of me and that I can take control of it. I do want to say that I have been Home Schooled and that my parents had a divorce that negatively affected me. I want to make sure that all of my cards are on the table for you guys to see. I was really depressed for those years, and unfortunately, I slacked and stopped studying. Now because of it, I've fallen behind.\n\nI am in Junior year right now, and since I am homeschooled, I don't need to rely on the traditional amount of time it takes to complete the curriculum. I feel like that may be an advantage? I had really good grades my Freshman year, all A's, however, that summer is when everything took event.\n\nWhat can I do to turn myself around and look good enough for a nice college? Let me know if any more information is needed, as I'm trying to be really transparent. I don't want to let things fly away like this, so please, any advice would be very helpful. I would love to go to a high-quality school, but if that boat has sailed, so be it.\n\nThank you all. I look forward to your advice!",

That meant that I got automatic acceptance into any Cal State plus automatic admission to my major (that was impacted, meaning too many students not enough spots available). Not to mention community college is 10x cheaper than going straight into university!",
