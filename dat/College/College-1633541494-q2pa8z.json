  "title:": "Is my University of Phoenix degree worthless?",
  "text": "I'm getting my degree in English at the University of Phoenix. After I receive my bachelor's, I plan on working for a master's degree in Library Science.\n\nHowever, recently I've heard that the University of Phoenix is pretty much a scam, and nobody takes it seriously. I'm now worried that I've spent thousands of dollars on nothing, and they won't even consider me for a master's program. Is all this true? And if so, is there anyway I can fix this without going into another severe bout of debt?",

This will help you determine whether UoP alums actually made their degree work for them or not. \n\nThere\u2019s also other factors that could help you get into grad school. It\u2019s not all about the name of the undergrad institution that you attended. For example:\n\nGREs, LORs, SOPs, and relevant experiences, \n\ncan help you get in to grad programs. \n\n\nNote: Some grad programs only care if you have completed a bachelors degree. They don\u2019t care where. \n\nWork with what you have. I\u2019m sure your degree at UoP will open opportunities for you compared to not having a degree at all. \n\nTry not to stress. You\u2019ve already began your studies at UoP. If you\u2019re almost done; just finish strong. If you\u2019re only a freshmen and want to transfer to another school, then look into how\u2026that\u2019s if you really want out of UoP. \n\n\nBest of luck!",

My local library has a whole catalog of online books and have a dedicated computer section with modern day computers and video games. \n\nPlus it's one of the few jobs I really have an interest in and can see myself doing without being totally miserable.",

I HIGHLY encourage you to do that before commiting to grad school. Especially if you have to take on loans for grad school. Many people go straight through the MLIS without any experience and then they enter an oversaturated job market and have trouble finding a job.  I don't think the place of your undergrad matters so much. Just make sure the MLIS program is ALA accredited.  I also encourage you to scroll through r/librarians to see previous posts.  The salary you posted is probably the median salary and nowhere near the starting salary. I've been a librarian for 8 years and I'm still a long way from that salary.",

That is the median salary. The starting salary is closer to $40,000.
