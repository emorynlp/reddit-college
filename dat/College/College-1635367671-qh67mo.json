      "text": "So far its been this old guy, he bragged about being 80 and being a professor. We had a class of like 5 18-25yo and the rest were easily 50 (15) it was like a high school level politics class. He absolutely loved nancy P and idk was like a fan boy I didn\u2019t really care its a stupid 7 am. But what irked me is he would repeat the same lecture word for word like 4 times in a row and i and the younger people would be like we went over this and he would ignore us for the 50 something who didn\u2019t take notes so\u2026 it was  2 weeks going over trumps impeachment the same information \u2026 he did not let electronics in class so it was boring to say the least\n\nI havnt had a mean professor yet\n\nHad another professor reject homework if it wasn\u2019t labeled correctly lastname_firstname_assignment_week#\n\nSome sink or swim classes but meh the worst was the guy repeating himself it wasn\u2019t like similar it was like word for word and watch the same clips and everything it was 2 times a week class too",
