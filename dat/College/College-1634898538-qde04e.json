  "text": "i\u2019m currently pursuing a medical imaging degree and it\u2019s a 4-years-programme. i\u2019m already halfway through this, in my third year currently, but i can never get used to the hectic academic schedule. I have suffered constant burnouts throughout the last 3 years, not because i have lost interest in what i\u2019m studying but mostly due to the overwhelming amount of workload. My programme runs in trimester, meaning i only get a 2 weeks break in between every trimester. To add on, as i\u2019m doing a clinical degree, i have to be attached to different hospitals every trimester as well. I\u2019m facing so much stress and it gets so bad, i guilt-trip myself every time i accidentally fall asleep while studying. I do a minimum study of at least 8 hours a day with some rest here and there but time is never enough for me. There\u2019s just so many anatomy and diseases to study, adding on to the usage of different medical modalities raging from x-ray to mri, ct, ultrasound etc and so much more. I\u2019m also doing my thesis concurrently this year and i\u2019m so stressed out to the point i feel sick sometimes. i just dk how to explain but i\u2019m so overwhelmed. Any advice is appreciated\u2026.",
