  "text": "In the majority of my classes, people don\u2019t contribute to the professor\u2019s questions. They don\u2019t have anything to offer, didn\u2019t read, are shy, idek - but it is so awkward. I always raise my hand, but then I feel guilty for always answering the questions, like I seem like a know-it-all. I wait for others to raise their hand first, to give them a chance and not be annoying, but it always comes down to me having to be the one to contribute.  \n\nNo one makes a move or says anything, just crickets. It ends up seeming really unbalanced because I\u2019m the only one talking, but I\u2019d like it if others had something to say, too. Does anyone else experience this? Is this a common thing?",

Because cities became more reliably democratic, and rural/suburb areas became more republican.

Some professors will reward students who are constantly interacting in class. I personally feel when you participate heavily, you learn more or improve yourself on many different levels. I improved my test taking ability by involving myself more verbally in discussions. I also gained more confidence and I felt my mind was more stimulated. Thus improved my grades! I averaged A's in majority of my courses, very few B's if that. When I barely interacted, my grades failed and my test taking ability went to the abyss.\n\nThis likely didn't make a difference at all, but I chose to not use a laptop or electronic devices my first two years of college. Everything was hand written notes, obviously took longer. But I trained myself to know which notes were important and which ones were just filler. I noticed a lot of people on their laptops will type out the entire statement concerning notes. Instead of just putting down the important items or things you may forget.",

My 20s were full of extreme poverty, unemployment, food banks, lay-offs, ugh it was a rough one. So at 28 I decided to go back to college. I\u2019m 31 now and will graduate this May at age 32 with my bachelors from a big university. I sacrificed a lot to go back to school, including my full time job. At school I want to get as much out of it as possible, I am paying for it after all, in many ways. I used to feel awkward about being that \u201cold person\u201d in class who was always answering questions, but I got over it. From what other posters are saying, as long as you\u2019re giving other students a chance, people are probably grateful you\u2019re speaking up so they don\u2019t have to. Sure some people are shy, some people genuinely don\u2019t know the answer, and some people are just checked out/hungover, doing the bare minimum, who are at college to party/appease their parents, so don\u2019t feel bad about wanting to get the most of your education. Last year I took a film class with only about 13 students and omg, like 5 of those kids were SO MUCH SMARTER than I will ever be. The class had great conversation, so hopefully you fall into some classes like this as you continue your college career.",

As a result, I don't even ask my college professors much and even when I do, I come off as an idiot who's wasting their precious, precious time. Even when the professors try their best to engage with me, like asking me questions and whatnot, instead of answering, I just freeze and don't even think about the answer to their question. Rather the only thing I care about is how much murmur is going on in the back about me, who's secretly laughing at me, etc. and I just stand there like an idiot until the professor looks at me with his disappointed eyes and tells me to sit down. The only reason I'm telling you my sob story is because, due to me having not asked questions for a long time, I have lost my ability to think critically and clearly about any concept and I regret losing it.

      "text": "This is an interesting thread, in part because so many people seem to be directly saying \"I'm not going to speak in class, ever\" and even arguing that it has no value. That is completely contrary to active learning research and the pedagogical models that dominate at many US schools, including mine. There is not a single course in my department that has less than 20% of the semester grade based on participation, and literally every course uses discussion as a major component.  Lecturing is a terribly inefficient way to convey information and using class time for information delivery is about the lowest-value way to use the period-- if there is no reading available to cover the material the instructor would be much better off recording a video lecture for students to watch on their own time. The class period should be used for active learning and higher-order thinking, which can/does include discussion.\n\nWhat's clear from the posts here is that the great majority of posters are students at large schools and/or schools that don't really invest in teaching. In classes of 500 it's hard to have a good discussion (but I've seen it done). In classes of 15-20 it's entirely appropriate to expect everyone to participate regularly, and indeed to create an environment when even reluctant students will be willing to take the risk of speaking up-- in part because speaking before groups is a basic skill that college graduates are expected to have, and there aren't many careers where you can just work quietly by yourself somewhere. I wonder what all these \"I won't speak in class ever\"  imagine doing for a career, and how much learning they miss out on by refusing to participate fully in their courses.  But then, I can see if you're sitting in a room with 500 other people listening to a pure lecture there isn't much point...hopefully there will be other classes that are more engaging.",

And I do find that when I answer questions it does help me to remember. I have found that when I'm placed in a group before the lecture starts and we can talk about course material, it makes it easier to participate later. If I know others are on the same page as me, with knowledge or lack of knowledge, it makes it easier to participate because I know everyone is on the same page. Even just talking to a few people before class can help. That way when I'm in class and I'm answering questions I know I may not be the only one struggling or I know there are others who know the answers to the questions I'm answering.",

She was literally talking to a girl while the professor was lecturing. Some people come to college and aren't even trying. Really hope this girl fails the class. Today she was doing a worksheet for another class & Monday she was sleeping in class. I mean fucking come on... we are 3 weeks in & you're already acting like this? But yeah, clearly no fucks given. I on the other hand know I will get an A or worst case get a B. I answer the questions, I read the book, & take my professors lectures as wisdom. This is an awesome professor too. Not dry.\n\nI would get self conscious about always taking the lead with asking things or participating by answering questions the professors asked, but now I don't care. If you participate, you have a better chance of finding interest, & getting a better grade. \n\nNow, it might just take a couple weeks for classes to start talking. Some classes I've had went from 0 to 100% within 5 weeks of being stuck with each other. In the beginning you just aren't comfortable around the people or don't know the dynamic yet. After a month, you'll have a stronger feel for the class. \n\nAlso, college students are tired from work, studying, or family. So a lot of them don't have the energy to participate in class. \n\nIf you are a freshman, you are likely taking general ed classes. Those suck cause most the people are only there because they have to. Classes like that are very forced & the majority tune the entire thing out. General ed classes are the ones I sometimes had to tune out because #1 I cared least about the grade when I had 3 major specific classes that I needed high grades in or #2 I wanted to drop it so fucking bad because I hated the material, but I knew I needed it. \n\nIt will get better & go ahead & participate however much you want. You're in college to learn & however you do that best is how you should do it. Don't worry about over talking unless the professor has their own class guidelines or says something. \n\nAlso, when you ask a question that nobody else wanted to ask, the entire class gets it answered. You probably weren't the only one wondering the thing. Someone might have been shy or whatever. So ask good questions & classmates will appreciate the clarifications the professor makes.",

      "text": "I have several reasons why I almost never answer lecturers:\n- I go really red all the time for no reason and it embarrasses me so much! Even when I'm wearing makeup and know that no one would actually be able to see the redness, the feeling of my face turning into flames is enough to stop me from speaking.\n- I'm slow! A lot of the time when questions are asked, I'll think of the answer a minute or two later. I just simply cannot think of answers on the stop.\n- I don't learn much AT All during the lectures. I learn through practice questions and studying at home. So if a lecture is repeated (and I've done work at home in-between) then I'll be able to answer the question just fine.\n- Most times in lectures, I'm processing a lot of information because I'm paying full attention to the lecturer. I'm also taking as many notes as possible. Usually you'll see me deep in thought and/or scribbling notes and feel like I simply don't have time to reply to questions being asked.\n- Sometimes I'm bored shitless in class or think the lecturer sucks so I won't interact in any way. I just want to get the class over with!\n\nDon't be afraid to look like a \"know - it - all\". Engaging with the lecturer is one of the most effecient ways of learning things. And remember, the only thing that truly matters is your grade at the end of each semester. I guarantee your lecturers absolutely love you for interacting and will think you're going to get high marks in their class. You're completely on the right track, don't stop answering those questions! The other students are probably relieved you're answering them so they don't have to haha",

There really aren't that many jobs where you will never have to speak in front of others. I hear people say this all the time, but I honestly wonder what they think they will do for a living after college, given that the people *hiring* college graduates are often looking for team leaders, people who can present their work to others, etc. Wouldn't it make sense to work on your aversion in college, when the stakes are low, rather than risking poor performance in the workplace later?",

Other times I just tell someone next to me the right answer. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s only week 2 at my school, so people are still getting their bearings, professors are starting to get a feel for the class, and homework is actually starting to pop up.

People do not consider your answering every question in a negative light in college. they might even be writing down everything you are saying because the book alone has been difficult for the students to read and comprehend and your interpretation of the teaching, along with the professor correcting the things you say is very helpful to learning and taking notes in this college environment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSure there are some slackers there, you should be careful not to do anything to help those types out (like giving them answers) because the college system is supposed to push those types out. Some slackers will do no work on group projects and in those cases it is important you let the professor know, the professor will likely have your group start a process to demand the student comply with an equal workload and when they do not comply then you can get them removed from the project. This is another big difference with high school vs college",

It just doesn\u2019t seem worth the effort to give a one-word or one sentence answers. Eventually she just had the class raise hands or nod their head which was also usually unhelpful. \n\nIf a teacher asks something that is going to engage students or prompt discussion, then I\u2019ve seen people speak up in larger lectures.

Just tell us what x means from the start and why. It feels like a waste of time. Plus if I answer and I say something wrong, i run into the potential of my brain misremembering what it actually is because i verbally spoke the wrong answer.

If no one ever raises their hand, or it's always the same person, I feel like that's a problem I should fix, to better draw out the reluctant students. A lot of students are just slower to warm up for various reasons, but will start participating over time. \n\nOk, that said. As the one student who keeps answering questions, that's fine if you see it as an opportunity for you to participate, interaction, and have a more valuable classroom experience. However, if you see it as \"having\" to contribute because no one else will, then it's probably best if you start raising your hand *less* frequently. When there is one student who always answers, that will cause the other students to pull back and become even more reluctant to answer. It's a vicious cycle. Let that awkward gap be there, either the other students will gradually step up and/or the instructor will vary their technique to be more suitable.",

Or I want students to grapple with answering the question, see that there are many different possibilities, and that the right answer is \"it's complicated and it depends\".",

There are certain times where perception can be important but I'm already assuming OP isn't a terrible person so those situations are probably going to be moot. Is it important for your coworkers, colleagues, and bosses to like you? Probably, but if you're going out of your way to make them like you, then you're probably not in the right field or work environment.",

For classes that have looser grading structures (not entirely defined by a few tests) this will help you at the end of the semester.\n\nAlso, if you're one of the students that gets the 89.5%, this may well be the difference between a B and an A, when paired with a friendly email.",

Once the professor knows that, they can go over it again or word the question differently. \n\nDon't just answer questions because you feel like you have some obligation to do so. You opting to stay quiet and let them stew in awkward silence can also help them.",
