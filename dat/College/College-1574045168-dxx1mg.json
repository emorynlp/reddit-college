The student association would keep the old midterms because it was university policy that profs had to made old midterms available, so the student association stockpiled them and they were accessible to anyone. There were several professors who just recycled questions for every midterm, so eventually department found out and shut it down. Nobody got in trouble because it technically didn't break any rules, but they weren't  allowed to be stockpiled and distributed anymore. So it just went underground and now you have to know someone who knows someone to get access, and in my opinion, it's way more unfair than before.

If they always give you the same questions it's not your fault.\n\n Technically it's not cheating however, some profs get really weird about it, so it's better to not tell them.

      "text": "Personally, I do not consider this to be cheating for a number of reasons. First, this is no different than seeing or being given past exams from a professor to use as a study guide. When I was in grad school, our department had department standardized exams. They would provide us the last few years worth of exams as a way to review. We didn't know what questions would be pulled from those past exams (if any). We also didn't know if all of that material would be covered on the exam. So the idea was to get a feel for format, topics, and how to answer all questions. In your situation, you do not know the exact questions to be drawn from. You also do now know if she will change them. Just because she has not changed anything doesn't mean she can't or will not. \n\nSecond, unless she specifically cited in her syllabus that those questions can be found on those websites and not to use them, it would be hard to argue that you can't research potential questions for review. You mentioned they are publicly available so it is not like you are buying/selling the exams or sharing it with other students from your course. Unless your school policy states you can't use or see past exams (which was different than my department), that wouldn't count as cheating. \n\nNow that I have said all that, I will add this important note. I do not consider you using any of those questions from the websites as cheating or being problematic so long as you have actually made an effort in the course and study. In other words, there is a big difference in reading questions just to memorize them for the exam vs. reading those questions to actually know the material. In the former, you may not be technically cheating...but you are cheating yourself out of knowing the material. That could come back to haunt you down the line. In the latter, if you use it to learn/understand the material, practice, understand why the answers are what/why they are...that sounds like being well prepared. I wouldn't be surprised if your professor knew the website is public and uses it as a way to have students prepare.",
