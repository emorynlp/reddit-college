So you\u2019ll be ready to deal with this stuff in class and actually do things with the material instead of us standing up at the front of the room just reading the book to you. Because we think you\u2019re bright people who are capable of reading that much. Because there\u2019s a lot about the world to learn and 50 pages a week is a bare minimum needed to be a competently well educated adult.",

      "text": "That is just over 7 pages per day, 10 per day if you take off on weekends. You are most likely only in the classroom for 3 hours per week for that course.  Because of that, outside work is critical.  You need to adjust to the college style of academics, which is very different than in high school.\n\nEdited to add: This is an edit made 2 hours after posting my reply above.  I just looked at your other posts made over the past 24 hours.  Please go to your campus health center or call your physician immediately (not later).  Self-harm, depression, and anger issues need to be dealt with quickly.  Put school behind you for now, and concentrate on getting healthy.  In the future, hopefully you will be able to return to college.",

Reading is a key way to grow your mind and improve your writing and communication skills in the process (yes, reading a lot makes us better writers). Reading is also fundamental to a good education. If all you ever do is go to class and never dive deeper into things outside of class, then you\u2019re shortchanging yourself.\n\nYou should expect 2-3 hours outside of class for every hour in class. So, on the lower end, if this is a 3-hour course, then you could expect at least 6 hours. Dividing 50 by that, you would have over an hour to read every ten pages. Unless you read very slowly, that\u2019s a reasonable timeframe.",
