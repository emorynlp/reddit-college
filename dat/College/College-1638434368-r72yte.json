  "text": "In the middle of work my school sent out an email that one of the faculty had died. She was my career counselor. I started crying, so my boss said yes to letting me leave early. Turns out she was also a member of his staff council. I only had like four or five meetings with her, but she helped me tremendously. She brought me confidence for jobs and pursuing a career in my major. She always said I started off as a meek, uncertain girl then became assertive and determined. The counselor was one of the main people who boosted my confidence. The last thing she did for me was fix my resume before I posted to Indeed. In her last email she stated how proud she was that I came this far.\n\nI wasn't even close to her and yet I feel grief. I'm stressed about missed work before finals. This is the second time something hits hard before I need to grind. Before graduation, to boot. This past spring I lost one of my dogs right before major assignments were due.\n\nI didn't know where else to air this out or why. Can't really be productive if I'm sad.",
