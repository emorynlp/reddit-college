  "text": "This is probably a really dumb question. So I have class today and I really don\u2019t feel well mentally. My anxiety is genuinely through the roof and I feel like I just need a mental health night. However, I\u2019m left with this guilt/feeling of missing out. Idk what to do. Should I just skip this one night?",

You not going to class today is similar to taking a night off of class because you have a cold and don\u2019t feel good. Mental illness is still illness. If you have any friends in class you can ask them or check the syllabus or maybe catch your professor at the end of your next class and ask what you missed last class. At times it is good to push through it but as someone with anxiety problems as well, sometimes I just need a day to breathe. Being overwhelmed and just sitting in class and not absorbing anything isn\u2019t going to help anyone",

          "text": "That's what I used to remind myself about missing class. Whether it was a mental illness or me having a fever, I would always feel so guilty about missing class and feel like such a bad student. I would remind myself that the fact I'm even feeling guilty about missing class is what separates me from people who just don't give a shit if they go to class or not. Hope OP keeps that in mind because they shouldn't have more anxiety when missing class due to their already built up anxiety. Just gotta focus on themselves and actually use the time off for them.",

Talk to your classmates, gets notes, review the syllabi for what topics were covered, do the readings.. and then come talk to me during office hours if you still have questions about the material. I'm so much happier to help if the student puts in the work ahead of time.",

You don\u2019t go to school or work if you have the flu because A: your condition is contagious, and B: your performance is extremely hindered because your brain is focused on surviving, not working or learning. It\u2019s the exact same thing with depression and anxiety. Don\u2019t go if you don\u2019t feel well enough to go.",

I think this makes sense as not going might cause you to be unable to actually relax in the moment and get the rest you need. Which means you would miss class and not feel nourished. \n\nBy going to class, you nourished yourself academically so hopefully you have more comfort from that. What plans do you have to care for yourself this evening? I also think mental health days can be productive but it helps to have a solid idea of what you will do when you take them. : )",

For me it\u2019s the need to be on campus now. \nEven before the pandemic, a majority of my college education was virtual, and I loved it. It gave me so much flexibility and I managed to take on work while being a full time student. Fast forward to now when my university has mandatory in-person classes and I\u2019m no longer able to properly manage the same amount of work because of the added stress of commute times and it sucks. \nSo to kinda give myself a pause I didn\u2019t attend class after communicating with my professors and had a set plan to stay on track with the class for those couple of days. I get the same amount of homework, just do a bit more reading and self paced teaching to make sure I get the material. \n\nThe biggest thing is communicating with your professor to make sure you\u2019re both on the same page.",
