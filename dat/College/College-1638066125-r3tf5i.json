  "text": "Basically, my grades this semester were really bad. Its my first ever college semester, as I am a freshman, and I was really struggling mentally. My mom is now saying that, if my grades this semester were bad, she will not let me return to school in the spring. I don\u2019t know what to do. I so desperately want to go back. I plan to talk to her about my grades soon but I have no idea how to go about telling her any of this. Any ideas at all would help.",

      "text": "Your mom is your parent. Ultimately, if she doesn\u2019t want you to do something, there\u2019s not much you can do as a kid to change her mind. You know how parents are. That said, you\u2019re an adult now, and if she refuses to let you go back, you\u2019re in charge of your own life and you can branch out on your own volition to continue college. Maybe you\u2019ll have to drop out of your uni, get a job, and do classes part time at a CC, but you are ultimately in charge of your own future now. Maybe you can make this apparent to her and the least she can do is try to support her kid who\u2019s trying to do better.",
