  "text": "I know it\u2019s kind of a subjective question cause I\u2019m assuming it all depends on which class someone feels most comfortable with, but is still nice to hear what others recommend especially if anyone prefaces it with a reason that isn\u2019t just because they\u2019re comfortable with that subject. Thank you in advanced to anyone who shares any comment! Anything is appreciated.",

      "text": "NOT math. Compressing that much information into a format where proper scaffolded learning and distributed practice are basically impossible is not a good idea, especially if the class is a pre-requisite for something else. \n\nDitto for a foreign language class, probably - something on the literature or cultural studies side of the department might be fine if you\u2019re already fairly advanced in your studies, but the standard-sequence \u201clearn to speak/read/write X\u201d classes have the same trouble as math in a shortened format. \n\nIdeally, I\u2019d say something that is interesting and fulfills maybe an elective or gen ed requirement but is far enough outside your major that if you don\u2019t truly learn all the details it won\u2019t affect other classes? For instance, if you\u2019re a STEM major who also needs a couple of humanities general education credits, doing a music appreciation course during minimester might be a good option.",
