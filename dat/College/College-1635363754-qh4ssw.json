  "text": "So this past summer I took a psychology class and got a C- . I am a freshman and even though I took a bunch of credits last year it brought my gpa to a 2.3. I asked my advisor if I should retake it and she said it would be the average of both times and she said that she recommends that I move on and just take other classes to build my gpa. What should i do? I have no clue on what to do so anyone\u2019s input would help me make a decision.",
