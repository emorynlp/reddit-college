  "text": "nervous because two of my classes for next semester was changed to online. I am better self study paced and one class is four hours so I feel like I will be wasting time sitting in class for four hours when I could read and obtain that information in thirty minutes and finish my assignments. I am at risk and not ready to be exposed to that. It\u2019s giving me anxiety. My grandma just died of covid and it breaks my heart. The class is at night and I am afraid of driving at night. I feel like my day could be more productive online\n\nI have social anxiety too but I feel like I\u2019m person class is not safe. There were two incidents of a suspect with gun at the central campus.",
