  "text": "Hi everyone. I was having a lot of trouble securing the documents I need to apply for financial aid for *this academic year*.\n\nI told my financial services office back in the summer asking them for some final deadline, and they emailed me saying that I can complete the FAFSA till June 2022.\n\nAnd that I would be considered for all aid I am eligible for *regardless of the date of completion*. \n\nThey never gave me a deadline. I assumed I could take the time I needed. But yesterday they emailed me saying they have withdrawn me from the financial aid application for this year. And I so worried and stressed. What do you think? I cannot afford to pay. I might drop out",
