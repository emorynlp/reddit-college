  "title:": "Proffesor *refusing* to fix my grade- what do I do here?",
  "text": "One if the requirements of my major are 2 classes that are made up of a total of 4 sections. One class/2 sections this semester, the next class/2 sections next semester. We are graded like this \n\nFinal exam section 1 (20%)\n\nFinal exam section 2 (20%)\n\nQuizzes/projects section 1 (30%)\n\nQuizzes/projects section 2 (30%)\n\nI fished section one a while ago and all the grades are in...here the issue- the proffesor has no idea how to use blackboard. The only grade she out in as actual grades were two quizzes we took, I got a B on one and a B- on another, so blackboard says I have a B-. However, we also did 4 projects all of which I got a 100% on and one I got extra credit. Instead of grading them she only marked them as completed and they aren't being calculated into our grade. Because of this my grade is much lower than it should be- if I have a B, B- and four As thag are all equally weighted I should not have a B- in the class. I have tried to explain to her mtiple times thag my grades were not put in correctly for my final grade to be calculated accurately but he response every time is \"oppsie!, I don't know how to use blackboard sorry!\"\n\nAnd ok, finem thag response was okay at the end of October. But I've emailed her twice and talked to her in oursom and she REFUSES to learn how to enter the grade correctly. Just apologizes and continues to do literally nothing. But this isn't an \"oppsie sorry\" to me when I need a 3.2 to stay at this school and keep my scholarship. Thers a week of classes left before finals and I'm starting to panic. Obviously me telling her this needs to be fixed has not worked so...what do I do at this point? Is there someone I should talk to?\n\nEdit: all of my proffesors are *required* to calculate the grades in blackboard- it gets sent straight to our student portal and that is our final grade. There is no \"private system\" she is using. She is a new prof, has never taught college, and just keeps saying she doesn't know how to enter grades but refuses to figure it out when she is **required** to do so.",

This takes place after the final grade for the class has been posted. At my college, the process was outlined in the bulletin and it was specific to each department but the general process was as follows: (1) contact the instructor (2) if that doesn\u2019t resolve the issue, contact the department chair with all your evidence. The department chair will make a decision (3) if you wish to appeal the decision made by the department chair, you can appeal to one of the Deans",

Putting people on the defensive is not going to make them want to do anything. I suspect it would put your grade to the back of the line to be addressed.\n\nNot saying it's fair, but learning to address these kinds of issues is a one of the skills you learn is college that actually will help you in the work-world.\n\nBeat of luck.",

My proffesor *doesn't understand this* despite me trying to explain multiple times that she hasn't calculated my grade correctly (when manually calculated it is much much higher). She believes she has correctly entered my grade into blackboard and that it is a B-, so when she reports my grade she will report it as a B- when that's much lower than what it's actually supposed to be. TLDR she *thinks* she has figured out how to use blackboard but doesn't and I guess just thinks it doesn't matter? Doesn't take me or other students seriously when we say out grade is wrong",

The professor can weigh individual assignments and everything differently so if they use a non traditional weighing method they will not be accurate. You still have several assignments and a final grade to be put in the system, some of which you say are getting out in by a different professor. I would go to the other professor in person if you are this adamant about having answers now, they might be able to look it over and see if everything looks right. Most schools also have a way to challenge grades after the semester ends too.",

That's literally what I'm asking here. \n\nSection 2 is significantly more difficult that section 1, meaning if she xoesnt fix my grade I'll probably end up with a C or C+ in this class when that's not the grade I'm supposed to have. If I get below a 3.2 I lose my scholarship and I'm kicked out of my major and that's *not* a chance I'm taking. I'm not just going to wait around hoping for the best. \n\nAll im asking for here is some advice...maybe 2 or 3 comments have been helpful and everyone else is just so desperate to be correct.
