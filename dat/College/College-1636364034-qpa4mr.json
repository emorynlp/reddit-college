  "text": "Well, time consumes anyone, but this semester has made me go crazy because I can't seem to get anything done in time. I am a CC student in Computer Science, but my life is probably somewhat different than most students in the US. I was born in the Texas border with Mexico, and I have been living in Mexico my whole life. Opportunities in the US are just so much better so I decided to go to college and work in the US while living in Mexico (because it's hard to just move with no money). I'm enrolled in 4 classes, work a part time job at Whataburger and I also have some financial goals that I want to accomplish, I started investing into my Roth IRA, got a credit card, started trading stocks and I want to take part in a small business (repairing and selling phones via marketplace). I do very well in my math and programming class (A+ and A), but I've been making the sacrifice in my other two classes which are English Composition and Learning Framework. I am doing poorly in both of them, my learning framework teacher puts a lot of homework and my English class is not hard but I am not creative enough to write good essays. I know that if I spend more time on them I can severely improve, but that's the problem, I don't have time left. I spend hours crossing the country everyday I go to college and to work, lines are insane and now border restrictions are getting lifted so they will get worse. I am willing to take the challenge because I really believe in the American Dream, here in Mexico things are hard and the US has giving me a chance to succeed in life. But I have been demotivated because if I don't do well in all my classes my mom will probably think I'm lazy. It's just too hard to keep the pace with work, college, crossing times and investments for my finances. What would you recommend? Should I take less classes? Should I leave my job? Should I stop researching investments? Or just stay in Mexico? ADHD and me being a perfectionist don't help getting things done either. I just want to be financially stable and work in IT. If I can I want to help the world in some way, but God damn it time is chasing me and is way too fast.\n\nSorry for the long text, 3 am in the morning and had to get it out.",
