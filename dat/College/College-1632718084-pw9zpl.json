  "text": "I have access to a MacBook Air, an IPad 5, and some Samsung Bluetooth earbuds and I was wondering if I could get help on what I could use to film my presentation for my Education class. My professor has only one real viable option that he demonstrated for us in class but it requires a process that would take a few days to set up properly and the sooner I can get this done the better. Thank you all!",
