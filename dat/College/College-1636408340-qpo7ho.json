  "text": "Growing up my family always told me that college would be the best time of my life and it would be super fun and I\u2019d meet tons of people left and right. Well now I\u2019m a sophomore in college and it just isn\u2019t anything like how my family described it. I feel like all I ever do is school work, and still don\u2019t even do well in my classes. I was super isolated in the dorms because of covid and now I have roommates that I never see, so I\u2019m still super isolated. I\u2019ve only made one real friend the entire year and a half I\u2019ve been here and I can\u2019t really meet people in my classes because they\u2019re still mostly online. I can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019m doing something wrong because I\u2019m not having the college experience that people always describe. It\u2019s not fun, it\u2019s just stressful and lonely and I can\u2019t wait for it to be over. Does anyone else feel this way?",

I think college is overhyped, and there is no \"one way\" to experience it. Just do what makes you happy, even if it doesn't look like your family described it.",

      "text": "it's not fair to wonder if you're doing something wrong when it seems covid is the main cause of your isolation. No one feels like they can do just whatever right now. that's how it is on this planet at this moment in time. Of course some are just ignoring covid and doing whatever they want. I don't think that's a good idea, though.\n\nAnyway the pandemic is no doubt taking a bite out of how millions of students' college experience should be right now. And that sucks, I know. but you can't blame yourself for that!",
