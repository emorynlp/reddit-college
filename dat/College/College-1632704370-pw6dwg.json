  "text": "Hey all, I\u2019m a freshman in college in a pretty upper tier fraternity at a large state school. I\u2019ve been going to lots of parties, but still haven\u2019t hooked up with  anyone yet. Yesterday my fraternity threw a massive party, and I was rly drunk the whole time. Apparently, according to my friend and a few older people in the frat, there were a lot of girls around me all the time who seemed to be interested, but I didn\u2019t give them attention and kinda swerved all of them. This was all unintentional and obviously not my goal. My question is how should I be approaching these girls and talking to them? People are clearly interested, but idk what to say. What kind of questions should I be asking? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",

My grades haven\u2019t suffered at least yet because I\u2019d say I\u2019m a pretty naturally intelligent person (I mean that in the least cocky was possible) but if it wasn\u2019t for that I\u2019d be fucked rn.",
