      "text": "I'm not personally familiar with the European University system, but my wife's family had several exchange students and from what they told her, college in Europe is much more restricted. The way she explained it was that even before high school was over, people knew who was on the college track and who wasn't. And I don't mean from a who does and doesn't want to go, or even from a university admissions standpoint. She made it sound like by mid high school, only a limited group is even allowed to consider university. In the US, we allow basically anyone to go (there's always that college with low admission standards), but therefore, more people have to pay for their degrees because there's only so much money to go around.\n\nIf what I've been told is totally wrong, let me know, but from what I've heard, European University system is much more restrictive.",

              "text": ">Maybe she meant the way high school is organised, but People Who go to the more profession oriantated  education can still go, and i have seen it succeed\n\nThat's what she meant. America and European countries have different approaches to the college system, but that difference is more of how school is set up. Like you said, in Europe, I heard, students go to different kind of high school, while in the US, it's one unified system where all students take the same basic subjects whatnot. You said, you've seen people from technical schools succeeding in university, I believe it, but it'll be harder because things you learn in those more profession oriented education will be different from those you learn in college prep schools. 21-22 years old person who learn more about yielding and whatnot would be able to attend the college like you said, but it'll take a lot more effort to catch up with people who did the college-prep school - and it can be discouraging.\n\nOne system is not better nor worse, it's just different. European system seems to keep the size of college education population small so that they can tax-fund it, but in america, everyone seems encouraged to attend the college. Which one is better or not? I can't say. This trend is not unique to America, but you can find it in Korea, Japan,  and Canada, and those countries have pretty expensive tuition, while not as extraordinary as American's. And that very high percentage of college-educated demographic is what enabled korea and japan to develop fast, to the level of \"western countries\". Both systems have pros and cons, which one is better?",

As long as this continues to be the case, people will pay for school. It's basic economics. That being said, if it's ever going to change, it's probably now. College is more expensive than it has ever been and if the labor shortage pushes wages for non-college educated workers high enough (which I doubt will happen because the people who have incentive to keep it from happening have a lot of political power), then I could imagine a significant dip in college attendance occurring.\n\nUntil then, though, it still makes sense to go despite the prices.",

The knowledge you gain in school might not make you money immediately, but knowledge helps to cope with living life, and adds depth to things. School isn\u2019t just an investment in the sense of finances alone\u2014it\u2019s an investment in yourself as a person too. Perhaps it\u2019s an expensive form of self-discovery, but once you know what you like to do it\u2019s that much easier to pinpoint work that would create a satisfying lifestyle; and you\u2019ll have a degree along with all the benefits of being a good student too.\n\nLet\u2019s say you get a \u201cuseless\u201d degree in Egyptian History. Sure, it might be hard to find work directly related to Egyptian History. In fact, you probably already know that getting into the degree program itself\u2014friends and family will tell you because they question the chances of your success. But just because it\u2019s unclear how that degree will relate to work doesn\u2019t make the degree non-applicable to society.

But you\u2019re not following anyone\u2019s path, because you\u2019re trailblazing a new way of applying the history of ancient Egypt to the needs of the society you live in today.\n\nThat is, you learned how to follow your intuition, trust it, and trust in yourself to figure things out with a degree that doesn\u2019t offer a clear path to the future. Maybe you won\u2019t make a whole lot outta the gate from school, but so what? (Unless you\u2019re stressing about paying back those huge loans\u2026 then you don\u2019t really have that comfort). You\u2019ll have over 60 years to figure something else out (or pay those debts!), and in those years what matters most is that you have learned how to handle yourself in the face of choices and changing job markets while maintaining a satisfying lifestyle.\n\nSmooth seas never made a good sailor.",

      "text": "Hi, Texan here!\n\nIt's really complicated. Universities give out financial aid based on financial need. I get a lot of financial aid because my mom is poor af. For me, there was also this program called the Texas Tomorrow Fund. I'm not too sure what the specifics of this program are but my parents signed all of their children up for it. I was always told growing up, \"your college tuition is paid for if you go to public university.\" It was a really great program and who ever was the piece of shit that cancelled it should go to hell. \n\nSo, the price per semester may be $10,000 but many students don't actually pay that out of pocket/with loans due to financial aid and scholarships. They pay actually pay like, $2,000 or $8,000 or even just $500 a semester out of pocket depending on financial aid and scholarships. If you're me, that's practically zero dollars. \n\nI'm supposed to study abroad in Freiburg next semester. Wir sollten reden!",

And then still pay another 5% solidarity surcharge. \n\nSo your people are giving almost HALF of their income to the state. \n\nThis probably seems awesome to you as a college student, but your turn on the treadmill of lifetime taxation is coming. \n\nThere is no \u201cfree\u201d college in Germany. \n\nHopefully this helps you to get it.",

I worked for about 8 years full time before going back to college (no fees at all, absolutely free) and the highest tax percentage I've had to pay has been around 20 %. I've also had health issues so I've gotten my free/extremely inexpensive health care covered with the taxes. I just wanted to express that personally I prefer the taxation rather than going into debt. \n\nHope you don't view this reply as rude or anything, just wanted to share my experience in a country with \"free\" college and other government funded services that essentially run due to taxation. I don't mind the tax, at all.",
