  "text": "I go to a party school. I don\u2019t know anyone who dosent drink or party. The people who I know that don\u2019t are all transferring out or thinking of it. People are so shallow here. I feel unattractive and lonely as hell cuz everyone here parties or cares about partying. The classes here are subpar. I haven\u2019t found genuine connections. I\u2019m over this place. I feel like crying all the time. I wanna go home but it\u2019s so damn expensive and my family is low income. I feel trapped with no outlet. I want to transfer out and go to a cc. For reference, I\u2019m a freshman. I keep waiting for it to get \u201cbetter\u201d but it keeps getting worse. I\u2019m just so sick of this place and it\u2019s admin. Everything is a scam here. It\u2019s not even worth the money for the education it\u2019s providing. Everyone who came here picked it because it\u2019s a party school. For those of you who went to a 4 year and decided to transfer out after a semester, how did u feel after transferring ?",

Put forth your best effort for the remainder of the semester. \n\nIn the meantime, it\u2019s probably time to register for classes at the cc.\n\nOne caveat about a \u201cW\u201d: They don\u2019t look good because they can be interpreted as you having quit, but an \u201cF\u201d is worse (especially when planning to transfer). Hopefully, this won\u2019t be an issue for you, if course!",

You\u2019ll find people you can appreciate who share your values. You just have to use intramurals, clubs, jobs, and maybe classes to find those people.",

The school is just trying to milk people of their money",

Apparently our limites social scene suffered and died during COVID. I'm sure some of that can be attributed to polarizing political views. Half have gotten the vaccine, half haven't. The ones who have are worried about catching COVID from those who haven't. Those who haven't aren't going to risk exposing themselves and getting blasted as selfish.\n\nPeople are really cautious here.",
