  "text": "Hi! Long story short, I moved out of my parents house recently with one part-time job under my belt, but now I'm getting another part-time job for more income since I need it. My first job is really great since I'm kinda my own boss and I get to make my own schedule, hence why I'm okay with getting a second job on top of that (it's in retail). I'm just a bit worried on how this will affect my grades.\n\nI honestly have no idea how to stay on top of school and studying, so I just finished my 5th week of my last year of my degree and I'm so behind on my 5 courses, and obviously working 40 hours a week isn't going to help that situation. I have all my due dates written down and organized, so I don't miss them, but I never learned how to study course material over time vs. at the last minute. If it helps, I'm a business major, so my courses are a lot of understanding concepts and applying them to case studies, as well as some math/excel/analytics courses.",

      "text": "Full time school and full time work is essentially an 80 hour work week. You'll probably have to prioritize classes like one class you'll focus on an A, another you'll settle for B, and another as long as you pass you're good, etc. A lot can depend on your job too. If you're able to do school work on the job that can help you out. A lot also depends on the professor as well and how they structure and what their grading is like. People will talk about time management and that can help, like writing tasks for the day, but planning out every hour and every day can lead to stress and burn out when you have a day where you just need to chill out.",

I don't think it would be feasible to apply that rule to my life, but if I cut it down to, let's say, 1.5 hours of prep for every hour of class time, I would have to spend 37.5hrs of my week doing school work (classes + prep) every week. \n\nIf I sleep 7 hours a day, plus work 40hrs at work, plus 37.5hrs of school, I'd have approx. 6 hours a day to do everything else in my life (home chores, cooking and eating, travel time, relax, hang with friends, hobbies, etc.) which may be feasible? \n\nAll in all, in order to achieve this I'd need to be decently productive with my days, which is the one problem I'm having atm, so we'll see how well this goes:/",

I am also a business major with 2 part time jobs. :) \n\nYou are going to have to be very intentional with your free time. \n\nI layout my week on an excel sheet where each cell is a 30 minute increment. So wake up at 8, class from 9 to 10, etc. Do that for every day of the week. Now you can see where you have gaps. I have a weird gap in my schedule where I have an hour in between classes, so I make myself go to the library and study even when I'm really tired. Find gaps or places in your schedule you have a little more free time. \n\nAlso, make sure your study habits are as time effective as possible. Prioritize which classes are most difficult. Make sure you are acknowledging the point values of every assignment so that if you do need to miss one (not ideal but shit happens), you know which one is more important. \n\nRereading is the least effective way to study (this is proven by science). One of my jobs is essentially teaching my peers good study habits at my college, so if you want more study tips please let me know!\n\nIt is definitely a tough grind, but it is possible! In relation to the rest of your life this will be a short season, it will also just be pretty stressful and that's okay! Give yourself grace to not get 100s in every class bc it is not always possible on a tight schedule.",

              "text": "So rereading activates confirmation bias within our brains. In a studying context, this means that we read something and our brain autofills and is like yeah, duh lol this is easy money. \n\nWhat is going to combat this is called retrieval practice/self testing. This is intentionally setting your brain up to actively recall information without relying on your notes/chapter notes, etc. \n\nOne common example of this is flashcards. However, flashcards aren't always practical for college. The best method for most students is making their own study guide with their own written questions. \n\nCreating your own questions allows you to process the information in a new way (which helps with understanding) AND then can be used for retrieval practice. 2 for 1 deal :) \n\nSo once you have all of your own questions written out, put away all of your notes and answer as many of them as you can with as much detail as you can. Then compare with your notes to see where you have gaps in knowledge. \n\nThen, work hard to make sure you understand the material you don't know. I like to apply my classes to my real life. For example, right now I'm in a class where I'm learning about assembly lines. So, if I'm drinking coffee in the morning, I try and think about what type of assembly line would be best for making a coffee cup and why. Then I write it down and compare with my notes. \n\nFor more math based classes, it is all about practice problems and making sure you know where you're pulling numbers and formulas from. Also, make sure you can recognize when to use different formulas. \n\nI hope that's helpful. :) I tried to condense it as much as possible, but I am happy to elaborate more if anyone wants me to!",
