  "text": "Hey I\u2019m new to this sub so sorry if this has been asked a lot before. I\u2019m an English major but I have the hardest time writing essays. It seems with every essay I shut down even more and what used to take me a couple hours to write now takes all day. I just get completely overwhelmed when I have to start writing. With the end of the semester coming up I have a few papers due. Any tips for helping me get through? Thanks everyone!",

After, I expand on those topics and whichever topic I expand the most upon, I write about. Hopefully you aren\u2019t too limited on what to write about in class \ud83d\ude16",
