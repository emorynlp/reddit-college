  "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm a communications undergrad working on my thesis for senior year. I proposed redefining productivity in the context of the pandemic (comparing productivity before and during the pandemic, studying work hours, etc.). My supervisor suggested approaching this philosophically. He also mentioned being able to pull this off without even conducting interviews nor surveys. \n\nI'm aware these studies do exist, but I'm hoping maybe you could help me further understand?  Feel free to message me too in case you need more information about my thesis topic. Thank you so much!",
