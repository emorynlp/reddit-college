      "text": "I just graduated from my community college and will be transferring to a university in the fall to get my bachelors. For me, it was just overwhelming and scary, but also exciting. Like, I have been at my CC for 3 years and I was in the Student Government Association for 2 of them. I became the student government president and I've worked really closely with the staff at my school. I know a lot of people and a lot of people know who I am. \n\nIt's scary and sad that I will be leaving them all behind. I'll be starting fresh with no familiar faces or happy greetings from people who recognize me. I'm also excited though, because it means new opportunities and new people to meet.\n\nI admit that I cried at my graduation when they handed me my degree. It was partially from happiness, because I finally achieved what I have been working so hard for, but it was mostly sadness. Sadness that it was over. Now I have the summer to relax and it just feels weird. It's suddenly just over and I'm done. It's a weird and conflicting feeling.",

I had the exact same feeling of \"what now\" 30 years ago because at the time all you needed was a Bachelor's to get a job - but there was no direction or help offered at the school for finding that job. Graduation is supposed to be closure so feeling empty is understandable - that part of your life is gone. It's also understandable to be depressed and even overwhelmed. I graduated during the recession of '91 and it sucked. I wanted to go straight to grad school but didn't have money so I just stayed with my \"college job\" to wait for better job prospects. Hopefully, the rosy picture the media paints of the job market is true and you can get your career going and feel less empty. Good luck!",
