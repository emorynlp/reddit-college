  "text": "I'm in my junior year, supposed to graduate a semester early next year. My major is bio and I want to go to grad school for biomed research. With that I need a pretty good GPA but the problem is I'm stuck at a 2.9. In high school I graduated near the top half of my class, went to an \"easy\" university, and here I am struggling to even keep a B- in my classes. My future seems unreachable with my GPA and even when I study so much I can't seem to get any higher grades. Sometimes I just want to drop out. Any advice?",

      "text": "Maybe don\u2019t graduate a semester early, enroll part-time, and only focus on a few classes at a time.\n\nDon\u2019t give up now, you\u2019re almost finished. Not every engineer you\u2019ll meet will have had a high GPA, and 2.9 isn\u2019t nearly as bad as you think. Besides, a few years after you\u2019ve had experience in the field, grades no longer matter aside from the qualification you have.\n\nYou\u2019ll feel a damn lot better once you get that degree knowing you\u2019ve pushed through rather than dropping out now. A \u201clow\u201d GPA isn\u2019t a measure of your abilities or skill set. Things that actually matter in the industry.",
