  "text": "As the title says, im absolutely fucked and there\u2019s no way I can bring them back. I\u2019ve never failed a class before, and now I\u2019ll have to go home and tell my parents I failed two. They\u2019re going to be so disappointed in me, more than I am in myself. At this point it feels like im in a hell that I just can\u2019t get out of.",

      "text": "I'm failing three this semester, many others fail at least once. Do you have to stay another semester or what are the negative consequences of this? If you take a step back & plan what needs to happen, it may help to feel better to have a step-by-step of what needs to be done. I don't know your major, but in mine, GPA doesn't matter much. And no one looks at it after your first job.",

I\u2019m sure if you talk to your academic advisor you can figure something out. When you tell your parents make sure you inform them of what you\u2019ll do to make up the classes/credits if that something you choose to do.  Look into your universities policies. In my school you can withdraw and it\u2019ll show a W instead of a letter grade or you can make it into a U, unsatisfactory.",
