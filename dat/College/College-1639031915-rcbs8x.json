  "text": "Hello I\u2019m 20 years old and going to a community college to transfer with an AA in Business Administration.Ever since I was 15 I\u2019ve worked, and continued to do so in college. Though in the last 2 years I have worked 1:30 - 10 at my job and been full time school as well. I feel like a failure because I have a 2.6 gpa and am currently failing stats after re-taking it. I feel so over worked, my job demands so much but so does school. It\u2019s gotten to to the point that I just don\u2019t even wanna be alive anymore and I mean that with every once in my mind. There\u2019s some days I just wish I\u2019d get in a reck. Ik all of this is my fault and nobody else is to blame so maybe this is just me telling everyone how I feel. I am 2 class\u2019s away from attaining my AA but the CSU I\u2019m transferring to has an impacted business program that only accepts 2.9 and above. I don\u2019t wanna give up and I truly think I will not but it\u2019s just so draining. If I end up failing stats again I could be rejected from my major.",

      "text": "Jeez, you're killing yourself from working and doing school full-time. You gotta take a break. You sound so depressed and defeated. It can be quite draining and you can feel so disappointed when it's taking longer than you thought and things aren't going the way you hoped/planned, but it's not worth killing yourself. Why don't you just do one class, Stats, for a semester..? That way you'll get to work and pass the class you need that's giving you a difficult time. Get a tutor even. Colleges usually provide some free tutoring. You might want to consider doing school part-time while working full-time. It's not really worth killing yourself just to finish a little sooner imho. Best of luck to you!",
