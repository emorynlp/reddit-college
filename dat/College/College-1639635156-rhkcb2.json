      "text": "Lol I mean, I've got a 20-25 page paper due on Friday that I haven't even started yet, and I wrote two other 25 page papers since the 12th. It's definitely doable. \n\nHere's my advice: \n1. Outline. Seriously, a good outline cuts down on the amount of work and keeps your paper flowing nicely so you have fewer revisions. Start by outlining three main points that you want to talk about, put the weakest one in the middle. Don't write your intro until the very end.\n2. Google scholar is your bff. Start with looking up one thing, find a good source for that and check out their references. Google scholar also has an auto citation generator (hit the quotation mark symbol below the source). And my personal fave? Then check out the \"cited by\" and \"related articles\" - before you know it you'll have a ton of good sources. \n3. Organize those sources into your main points, try to have a couple of sources for each paragraph. Talk about what the source says using your own words. \n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "My advice to you is to do stuff in chunks leading up to your deadline. On Thursday you might want to research and take notes on your topic, Friday start your first draft, Saturday (with fresh eyes) go over your work and make revisions throughout your paper, and Sunday is where you'll make final tweaks ensuring that all meets your requirements, and submitting your work. Something like that. \n\nAs someone who is in their final year of college, I suggest that you do not save these types of assignments near the deadline moving forward. I know it's challenging and we have all done it at some point, especially if procrastination is your vice (Source: I used to be a bad procrastinator in both elementary and high school).",
