  "title:": "To Double Major or to not Double Major",
  "text": "Hey guys! I am currently in community College and I plan on transferring in fall of 2022. I really don't know what I want to do but I know I have two majors in mind; art and history. But I honestly have no idea which to choose, so I was considering double majoring once I get into uni. My reasoning for that is so I can get a taste of both majors to see what is best suited, as I am equally passionate for both. I love the history majors schools have to offer as well their programs, classes, and study abroad options (very important to me). Whereas with art is much harder to find research about programs that aren't from dedicated art schools. The big plus about going into art is that I might be able to get connections and land a job I want. I was also considering getting my bachelors in art and then if I don't like it get my masters in history alongside and perhaps a PhD. I still can do both on the side. I can always work on my own art while in history, and still immerse myself in research while in art. Any thoughts would be appreciated!",

It might have something to do with my course load (4 classes) and my mental mindset. I'm trying again next semester and taking a digital illustration course.",
