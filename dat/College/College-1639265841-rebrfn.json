  "title:": "What are you doing over winter break?",
  "text": "My winter break is December 23rd - January 18th, so I have quite a while. I'll probably just be with my family until Christmas, and usually we travel to see extended family from the 26th to New years. But from the 1st to the 17th im going to have nothing to do. \n\nDuring my senior year of HS I drifted apart from most my friends. My parents were beyond strict with COVID so I never saw them, and now they all go to the same university so I know I would feel out of place hanging out with them. I do have one hometown friend I'm still close with but she's in highschool and her 2nd semester statts on January 4th.\n\nI don't really want to just sit around the house every day doing nothing so I'm looking for some ideas here. What are you guys doing?",
