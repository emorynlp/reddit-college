  "text": "Today is the last day to drop classes and I am not doing well in my physics class. I have a 60% and I don\u2019t know what would be better for my situation. If I stay in the class and get an F, I\u2019ll retake the class and it\u2019ll replace my grade but the F will still be on my transcript. Or if I drop it and get a W and retake it but the W will still be there. For background I want to be in the medical field so whatever I decide will affect my opportunities. Pls help",

              "text": "Agree! \n\nAlso note that one F will drastically bring your GPA down so like others here, definitely go for the W. Just make sure that you try not to get too many Ws on your transcript. Also, next time you take physics try to get a high grade (preferably A, but B+ will do as well) so it can be seen that you redeemed yourself and had a major improvement. \n\nBest of luck \ud83d\ude04",
