  "text": "Most of my friends are not in my classes, so I was glad to meet a friend who's in class with me (I figure it's great to get to know more people and have someone I can sit with). \n\nI met this one friend (who I'll call K). K and I have gotten along pretty well (aren't super close or anything but sometimes grab lunch after class and sit together). \n\nLately I've noticed (and I've missed this all along) that K will text me \"sup\" or \"hi\" only to then ask if I've done the chemistry homework, only to then sometimes ask if I want to work together. K seems pretty smart so I think part of it was maybe wanting to work together just to hang out more... and that still could be the case. I'm often not always free to work though. \n\nRecently K approached me and asked if I could send them my chem paper. Our entire class has been really confused about paper. I don't even think I did the paper correctly, nor am I finished. I am partially embarrassed to send them my work but also I don't think that it's fair. Obviously K isn't going to copy it (that would be obvious) but they probably plan on using it for reference. \n\nI did the wrong thing and just said: \"ok, I'm not quite finished though\". I'm hoping they forget and don't text me later today, but I'm 92% sure they will. So, how can I get off the hook of sending them my paper? Lastly, is this something that friends should do? This kinda disappoints me.",

      "text": "> So, how can I get off the hook of sending them my paper?\n\nNext time they text just say \"sorry, still not finished.\" Or even \"oops, I  realized I made a big mistake on the paper, have to start from scratch now!\"\n\nNot that hard to low-key dodge, to be honest. Lying to them is much better then letting them cheat off of you, which risks getting you both into serious trouble.\n\n> Lastly, is this something that friends should do? This kinda disappoints me.\n\nNo, they shouldn't do that, but it's not particularly uncommon. You have every right to be disappointed-- I'd be too.",
