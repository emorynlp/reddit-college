  "text": "I take a small amount of AP classes and dual enrollment each year since sophomore year of high school. I\u2019m now a high school senior. How much harder should I expect college to be? You can answer in terms of workload, concepts, time management, etc.",

      "text": "As stated already, it depends. College generally has a lot less busy-work designed to simply fill time, and what little busy-work exists decreased substantially as you go into higher level classes. I personally found college much easier than high school (and I went to a fairly selective university). Much depends on your major though and what college you go to. I knew CS majors who complained about busy-work, but in return they didn't have to write the 20+ page research papers (sometimes involving translating!) expected by the Classics majors, who tended to be graded 50/50 on the single paper and participation.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore in college and i currently have not taken any upper division classes yet. The only classes I\u2019ve STRUGGLED with are statistics and a science course I had to take. \n\nThis really depends on what your strong suits are and how motivated you can be. Personally I\u2019m still pretty much doing the same thing as highschool, just barely studying and breezing by and I still get my A\u2019s and B\u2019s. \n\nMake sure to use Rate my Professor and please please please make your own ratings as well so other students know what to expect",

      "text": "Honestly, it really depends on your major and what school you go to. Some programs are harder and more time consuming than others. For example, I would never have expected music education to be as hard of a degree path as it is. \n\nJust do some research into your intended major, and also consider what kind of extracurriculars you intend on getting involved in.  Some can meet multiple times a week for hours and can be big time commitments so just kind of figure that in as well. \n\nIt also depends on what decisions you make for your classes. You can take it as easy or difficult as you want, you also don\u2019t have to worry about finishing in 4 years for a bachelors degree, so if you feel overwhelmed you can cut back on credits each semester.",
