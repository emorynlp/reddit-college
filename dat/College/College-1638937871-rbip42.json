  "text": "Im currently doing a creative writing assignment for one of my literature classes and my professor asked for 3 pages, but my story ended up going slightly past the fourth page. Do you think a reasonable professor will take off points for going over? I trimmed down the story as much as I could.",

      "text": "Depends on the professor.  Most won't care if you're only a little over a page over so long as it's not too far over. I notice they tend to mark down when you really go over because then it takes them longer to read and grade the assignment.  Also, don't mess with fonts and margins as profs know that trick and will mark you down for it, most want the standard 12pt font either single or double spaced (they'll usually say which in either the rubric or the syllabus).",
