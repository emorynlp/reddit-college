  "title:": "Advice needed for Pre-Requisites (Bachelor's Degree in Psychiatric Nursing): Business Statistics OR Mathematics",
  "text": "Greetings fellow patrons. I've recently received my registration dates to apply for the Winter semester at my education institution and need some help choosing between Mathematics and Business Statistics. My proposed major would be a Bachelor's in Psychiatric Nursing. Which course would better relate to my major as I am given the choice between the two. I'd appreciate some feedback from those who have taken both courses and from those who are currently in the Health Sciences field that may or may not have benefitted from either or. Thanks in advance!",

Another good thing is that, if ever in the future, decide to become an RN, all I'd need to do is take a few courses which weren't a part of the RPN program which may take about a year to complete.",
