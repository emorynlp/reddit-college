  "title:": "Is 9 credit hours a respectable course load as a senior taking a seminar course and searching for a job?",
  "text": "Background: I am a senior who, to be quite honest, has struggled over the last few Covid-hampered semesters to manage a full (12 credit) courseload. (This semester at my college was the 1st fully in person since covid began.)\n\n I have been looking for a job for the past few months and have found it difficult to picture balancing a full course load with a part time job. As a result, I have chosen to lessen my course load to nine credits for Spring 2022, one 3-credit class of which is a seminar course that will involve writing a lengthy research paper. \n\nWith this information in mind, do you think my decision to lessen my course load is reasonable? Or would you suggest I still attempt a full course load?",
