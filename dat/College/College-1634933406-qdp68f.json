  "text": "I run a club at my university and for whatever reason, there are a few that hold some beef with me. I have a Whatsapp, and they and notice only them, question me repeatedly about stuff that's none of their business, and if you say anything, they go on a tangent and use any information against you. They try to not act toxic, but the intent behind the questions is just to purely annoy, I have gotten used to them, however now due to frustration, they question me in-person now. If you ignore them, they get super angry, and any information you give them is spread like a bee pollinating a flower. I am not the best at holding my tongue nor do anything that would get me in trouble that they could question me with, but the slightest \"bad\" thing I say is used as blackmail, and they give zero \\*\\*\\*\\* about telling everyone, it's super annoying. I know they want me to quit but I am not doing that.",

Also, its the group chat, although they hold beef with me, I can't just ghost them or else people would start to question, also it's just too weird suddenly talking when they previously talked, it would make me look a mean person. I don't care much, I already put forth several boundaries that they cant break through, however the questioning becomes very intense when in-person which is hard to \"run away\" from.",
