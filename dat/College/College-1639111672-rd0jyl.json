  "text": "Hello! I\u2019m (21f) still an undergraduate but I plan to graduate soon. I have plans for physical therapy school which will consist of summer, fall, and spring semesters for 3 consecutive years. It is very rigorous and it\u2019s pretty much Monday-Friday classes everyday from 7am to 5pm (depending on the school but you know what I mean). There are a couple of schools in my state that offer DPT (doctorate of physical therapy) programs but I only have my options narrowed down to the most affordable schools in my state ($12k ish a year). The other \u201cexpensive\u201d schools are roughly $60k a year so that times 3 years will be a little under $200k compared to under $40k for 3 years. \n\nSo the closest school that has a DPT program is actually the current school that I attend for my undergrad. I live with my parents and I commute there and it takes rough 50 minutes to get there (16 miles away). Covid has allowed me to have a nice break from commuting and I have not commuted to school since March 2020. I already had my mind set that I do NOT want to commute for graduate school. \n\nAt first I wanted to go to my current school for graduate school but it\u2019s in a very big city and crime has been more active recently. The biggest plus for that school would be that 1) I\u2019m already familiar with the school and 2) it\u2019s the second highest rated DPT school in my state. I most likely will be living with my bf but being a young female, I am scared of living in that area in general. There are 3 more affordable schools options within my state which are in smaller cities. I already checked the rent rates and all of the affordable schools including the one in the biggest city have pretty much the same rates for rent. \n\nI keep going back and forth about what I want. Some people are just telling me to just to try to get accepted into my current school for DPT school and commute again to save money but I\u2019m honestly so over commuting. It would definitely make sense to move if I went to a school 50-100 miles away from home but if I moved to be closer to my current school that\u2019s shaving 35 minutes (10 miles). Is that extra hour of commute time everyday (times 5) really worth it to move out? I know it\u2019s my own personal choice but I just wanted to see other people\u2019s opinion of my situation.",
