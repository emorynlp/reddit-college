  "text": "I finally had enough energy to actually study for my midterm. I hadn\u2019t gone over the lectures yet but I was able to get through them all today. I was so proud of myself. It took me 15 hours. I take the midterm, feeling confident that I did well. But no. I got a 46%. I spent 15 hours studying for a lousy 50 question MC test worth 30% of my grade only to fail it anyway? I am so sad and angry and upset with myself. If I fail this class because this fucking professor makes shitty MC tests filled exclusively with hard to remember terms, I\u2019m going to lose it. Fuck school.",
