  "title:": "Professor gave us 32 MINUTES for a cumulative business stats final",
  "text": "Before the final, I was at a 94% (A). Now, after taking the final, my best case scenerio is looking like a 78% (C+) or a C. The exam had 8 questions and was open note (on Zoom), but we only had 32 minutes. I could tell that most, if not all students needed a lot more time. I believe the time we were given was completely unfair. \n\nFor the previous tests he usually gave us 40 minutes but for only 4-5 questions and on only 3-4 chapters. \n\nIs there anything I can do about this? Should I speak to the dean or just take the L?",

      "text": "That doesn't seem right, usually, final exams are around 1-2 hours. I don't know if your college allows the professors to set the exam time. To my knowledge, the higher-ups in the college are supposed to decide the duration time of the exam. Maybe you can bring the issue up with your department chair or dean?",
