  "title:": "How to deal with verbal harassment from strangers?",
  "text": "I get verbally harassed (subtly) in certain parts of campus, where I frequently dine or paths to/from class. At first I thought it was in my head, but I noticed it doesn't happen everywhere. And they are lowering their masks to do so, or leaning closer to me as we cross paths to convey their hate. So I'm guessing these people are those that also frequent those areas.\n\nWhile some of them are people I just don't know (or remember) at all, others aren't entirely strangers. They are familiar faces I see on campus, and whom I've shot a glance at when they utter profanities at me. Profanities being: hoe, bitch . . . and other name-calling.\n\nMy temporary solution:\n\n* I've found different paths for getting to class, and switch it up randomly. This prevents me from crossing paths with them (with the exception of sometimes, the route near the dorm).\n* In the dining hall, I try to sit against a wall in a corner somewhere (due to decreased traffic, less likelihood of harassers having an excuse to walk through and lean in to say something). I've resorted to ignoring their existence completely. It is just stressful to eat in that dining hall, despite the amazing food, because of their continual harassment. Sometimes I walk out with an upset stomach or feel like crying. But the dining hall in question is one of my favorites (food-wise) so I don't want to avoid it altogether.\n\nReporting isn't an option because it's just (1) verbal harassment and (2) I don't know their names, who they are, and their motives for doing so. I'm also against talking to counseling on campus, because they wouldn't believe select individuals are targeting me, and instead, diagnose me with some mental illness.\n\nThe words don't hurt me, but it's just a stressful, hostile environment to be in. I've since adopted a IDGAF-attitude towards them, but it does make me look like a rude person. It simply protects myself emotionally, to think that they must have nothing better to do than be mean. It also makes me wonder: Who did I piss off? Did someone spread false rumors about me? What is their goal?\n\nAt this point, I'm just going to grit and bear through the last few quarters I have here.\n\nJust wondering if anyone else had gone through or going through something similar.",

      "text": "Yeah that sucks.\n\nSo to apply Ockham's Razor, the most likely reason they say stuff like that is because they're fratty assholes. You're gonna meet a lot of assholes in college, but you already know that. I've dealt with folks who just snicker or say something blatantly passive aggressive towards me a lot, if it only happens on the way to class the best solution is to simply invest in a pair of headphones or AirPods. Even if you can still hear them, it tells them that you don't hear them nor give a shit. At least, that's my strategy.",

      "text": "I never been to UCLA, but I think UCLA values what is socially acceptable, and possibly what is the gender norms/ gender roles. Just think, \nHome, sweet home,\nTrust is hard to gain but easy to lose,\nA friend in need is a friend indeed,\nA good friend is my nearest relation,\nYou make more speed with less haste,\nSpeech is silver, silence is golden,\nThere\u2019s no place like home,\nHome is where the heart is,\nBlood is thicker than water,\nWhen in Rome, do as the Romans do\n\nI bet you're in-state student and likely can't afford options (or can't get admitted to) schools like Harvard University, University of Cambridge, University of Pennsylvania, etc.\n\nMy recommendation is to find a \"hideout\" out of the campus, so this may require you moving out of the dorms. The problem with staying in the dorms, the problem with bullying is the lack of (you know, the teachers in your high school that protected you by giving detentions to your classmates if they hear any evidence of). Have you watched movies where the school protagonist hang out with janitors or something? Its a bit like that. If you're an out of state student this is challenging, since its likely none of your family members live nearby.",
