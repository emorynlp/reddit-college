  "title:": "Is it ethical/legal for a college to create a new required course 2 weeks before someone\u2019s final semester before graduation begins?",
  "text": "My college added an extra 1 credit course that will consist only of materials to take the college exit exam.  These materials used to be included in the coursework for the 3 credit Senior Seminar course, but the school has decided to split the two while keeping Senior Seminar at 3 credits and creating this new course for 1 credit. It\u2019s great that they separated the two since they don\u2019t really go together, but why not make Senior Seminar 2 credits then? I am affected negatively because I had the option to take a summer course for either 3, 4, 5, or 6 credits (for the same exact course, just different credit options) and I took 4 because that is the amount that I needed to reach 120 credits and graduate. Now I will be finishing with 121 which means that I spent an extra $400 on 1 extra credit I don\u2019t need. I\u2019ve spoken with the Assistant Dean and they basically told me good luck disputing this. Is this ethical/ legal? What are my options?\n\nThanks in advance.",

Such as these classes is required to be taken by all Fall 2019-20XX students for the new matriculation and graduation requirement. You should go to your counselor and request your transfer years matriculation agreement and it will list all the classes need to take in order to get said degree. That is the agreement the college struck with those year students and I would say its somewhat binding for them to abide by it. So If you came in at Fall 2014 and your agreement was different then you aren't subject to the new class to graduate.\n\nEdit 1: Spelling errors.",

The academic advisor basically bent over backwards for them, moved credits around, and opened up a special class to accommodate them. Everything ended up fine.

Colleges can absolutely change graduation requirements but as other people have said, they'll only implement them for incoming 1st year students, or maybe 2nd, or in so many years. It sounds like the college is trying to get more money from you before you leave. I've only heard of this happening with primarily online colleges such as National University. In fact, many National graduates report graduation requirements changing on them right before they graduate causing them to delay graduation and/or spend more money in order to graduate. It's extremely unethical and I honestly hope that school loses its accreditation status. Anyway, play along and graduate then look into their relevant stated policies. If I were you, I'd report them to the relevant governing agency just to check if this is something they allow. If it is, then obviously there's nothing you can do. Or report to the accreditation agency and ask whether or not this considered ethical. Again, if no one is concerned, then I would move on. Congrats on your degree!",

So when you graduate in 2019 you only need to meet those requirements even if they have evolved in the 2017-2018 catalog. \n\nJust my experience. I'm sure there are exceptions.",
