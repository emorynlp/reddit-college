  "text": "Hi! I am 32 years old, a disabled student. I cannot work, no income. My parents claim me as a dependent on their 2020 tax. So, for FAFSA 2022-23, do I need to provide my parent financial information?\n\nTheir income is ~22,600 for 2020 tax year, and they have ~4,200 in their bank, no other assets or investment. We are a family of 3 people, only me go to university. How much is my EFC supposed?\n\nMy Cost of Attendance is 27,520. How much financial aid will I receive?\n\nThank you.",

There should be some FASFA QnA's that have answers, so doing some further research might help!\n\nIm sorry if my reply is insufficient!\n\nEdit: also, the most the Pell Grant can gift a student (as of this year) is 6,495$. Make sure you apply to other scholarships and stuff!",
