  "text": "Im currently in an apartment but it\u2019s on campus and you get to pay student housing prices. I\u2019m 21 and a sophomore and they recently opened the apartment up for Freshman students. This is due to the overflow of students that attended this year.\n\nBoth my roommates are Freshmen and 19. They have two friends that moved here at the start of the semester but they don\u2019t even attend school. The 2 friends are currently working and living in there own apartment a town over. Every weekend and day off my roommates and there friends pregame at our place and then comeback at 3 in the morning. I don\u2019t mind if they drink but when they do they\u2019re too damn loud. They are pounding on the walls, screaming, playing the guitar hooked up to the amp at max volume, and slamming doors and kitchen cupboards.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m here to get an education not listen to underage kids drink. I\u2019m on the waitlist for a single room and I can\u2019t find any single bedroom apartments off campus that are affordable. I can finish this semester out but next semester I\u2019m on the fence.",
