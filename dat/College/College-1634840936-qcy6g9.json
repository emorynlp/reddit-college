  "text": "So it just occurred to me after a month of basically giving someone answers, that it's academic dishonesty. How should I go about cutting this stuff off? Luckily the class is virtual so I don't have to see the dude in person. Should I just suddenly cut him off of my Snapchat (how we have been communicating)? Should I tell him about this all? Anything is appreciated.",

      "text": "I wouldn't bother giving an explanation, just block. If you try to explain, they could easily start an argument or guilt trip you and make you feel bad for it. Don't feel guilty about leaving them hanging, because they shouldn't be relying on this exchange anyway. It will either do them good and force them to work it out themselves, or they'll continue with their ways and seek out some other person to use as a crutch through college.",
