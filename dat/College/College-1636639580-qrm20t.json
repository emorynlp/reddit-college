When I applied for my internship they were actually impressed that I didn't have a CRJ major and pointed out how good of an idea it was. It does make it harder to find internships but there's still plenty that take any major. If you're looking at law school my one professor tells students to get a philosophy or history/government degree. If you're looking at going into LE ask some recruiters what majors they suggest (in my experience its STEM, Accounting, Finance, and Foreign Languages). For law school email a few schools and see what they're looking for, or ask a few profs for their opinions.",
