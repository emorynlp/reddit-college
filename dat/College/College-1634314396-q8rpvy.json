  "title:": "I have an A in every class this semester, why do I still feel like my life is falling apart?",
  "text": "So, the first semester of college was rough, I screwed up and got depressed. I went on a journey of self-discovery and entirely reinvented myself. I now am very organized and orderly in my life. I sort my emails, I have a to-do list, and I have made straight A's since last semester. Why do I feel like I am slowly backsliding to that place again? I mean I feel like I shouldn't, my life is entirely unrecognizable (in a good way) from where it was a year ago. Still, I can't help but have this fear/anxiety of everything collapsing. I get this feeling most whenever I miss a question or get an unexpected email. It shouldn't affect anything, I am doing it all right by normal standards. I just feel this sense of dread every time I open my school's website or drive to campus. It feels like the beginning of an end. Does anyone else feel this way?",

      "text": "Yes I have felt this way for 4 years. It\u2019s a continuous cycle of feeling like you\u2019re falling back into bad habits, feeling like your doing great, feeling like you\u2019re falling into bad habits, etc. It\u2019s okay. I just try to make sure I take care of myself, try to think less about how I feel and just allow myself to feel, and remind myself that if my grades are good I shouldn\u2019t be worrying that much.",

My dread is from change though, I'm going to be transferring schools soon, which was always the plan, and I'm extremely anxious about it.\n\nYou'll get through this though, if you had the strength to pull yourself through the first time, you can get through this. Maybe try a conditioning of sorts? Like a thought condition or something, think of a specific memory or feeling when you get in that bad headspace.",

      "text": "I think you probably feel this way because you\u2019re afraid to lose what you have. Also, having all A\u2019s in college is no easy feat, so I imagine that you\u2019re working very hard on your studies. Giving 100% all the time is exhausting. I would stay on my toes about my work, but try not to let it make you too anxious. Just remember that you don\u2019t have to perform perfectly all the time.",

You said that you are organized and getting thing done. That's where you should be basing your value, the daily effort that you put forth. That's something you have control over. That's where the A's come from.",

      "text": "I understand this. I fear going to my first college (I dont really have to fortunately). Because it was such a horrible time for me. I think its a very rational fear of slumping back into that dark place. Maybe its also a dread of putting in all that work, thats a lot of work to do so coming back to it would seem overwhelming. \n\nIt sounds like you may need to stop fearing failure though. It sounds like you don't really fear failure as much as falling back into depression. The way I combated that was understanding how far I've come since then. You've done it once, you can do it again, probably even better. When you miss a question, tell yourself everything will be fine in the future, but also learn why you missed that question. \n\nI used to be like that, killing myself for those As and making sure I have money. (I was literally starving myself and not sleeping). After the military I learned to not fear failure, but learn from it, and trust the process. I welcome failure as its a great learning tool, costly, but great. After all, failure is only when you give up, not when you make a mistake.",

I feel like I know what I should be doing but my mental health and bad habits get the better of me. Haven't ever gotten straight As and I really want to do well. Damn near flunking out of college. I am doing somewhat better, but the habits never left. What are some of the thing you did to get there? I know you say that you're slipping but maybe the answer will be able to help us both, ya know?",
