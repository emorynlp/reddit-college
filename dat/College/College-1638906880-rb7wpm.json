  "text": "I'm writing a graphic novel and a character is attending a university. I have a part where she gets suspended from her college for one or two semesters. I've put suspension as her character arc so she can slowly start getting her life together.\n\nI've looked at the codes of conducts of several universities and penalties, but I would like some ideas of what exactly could lead to suspension for a period. Any ideas? Perhaps some experience in this area.",
