  "text": " I'm not sure about what to write in my personal statement and what the university expects to see in a personal statement. I'm not entirely sure what to include in a personal statement in the first place but I have a vague idea about what US and UK universities want to see in SOPs but I don't know which style would suit one for HK. \n\nWhat do I include in my SOP? Another spot of bother for me is that I can only submit one SOP but I am applying to two completely different courses (Molecular Biology and Data Science) but I don't have a clear preference for either one of the two. How do I write about both in my SOP?\n\nThanks for the help!",
