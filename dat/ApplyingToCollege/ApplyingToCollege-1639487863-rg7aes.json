  "text": "My school does not offer honors english junior year, they only offer AP Lang and college prep english (general English) Would it look bad for applying to t20s if I take general English junior year while taking honors english every other year? I don't really like English and I do not think I have what it takes to get an A in AP Lang. Also can anyone who has taken AP Lang give some insight into its difficulty?",

In our school, AP Lang is considered one of the hardest courses (because of the sheer amount of work); I thought it was alright and the exam wasn\u2019t as difficult as the class. Regardless, I learned a lot and would say to go for it if you have an A in English right now!",
