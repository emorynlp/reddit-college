      "text": "When I was accepted to NYU nearly 5 years ago, there was a thing called the \u201chousing change\u201d glitch. \n\nIf you went on the NYU housing portal as an applicant or non-student, you usually just saw an option to apply for summer housing (NYU opens their dorms to interns and young adults from other schools during the summer). But if you were accepted, the portal would change and give you an additional option to apply for school housing during the academic year (presuming bc you had been added to their students system). \n\nThis usually happened pretty last minute though - maybe the day before the official decisions went out. But ED applicants or anyone who felt rly strongly about NYU would be refreshing the shit out of the housing portal in the days leading up to decision day, searching for a sign. Not sure if this glitch still happening but it happened for me in 2017 and I got in. \n\nI think some other schools have similar portal glitches or signs like this but please don\u2019t stress yourself out over this type of stuff, I 100% understand the desperation but I was an actual maniac for refreshing that stupid website 10 times a day",

There wasn\u2019t anything wrong with this but they\u2019re familiar with the program and know that there\u2019s usually a full report, so they wanted to see it.)\n2/27- My counselor finished uploading midyear reports, by this point i already have friends from other schools that have gotten likely letters, i\u2019m stressed. also by this time i\u2019ve already gotten likelies to yale and stanford so i\u2019m like praying for the harvard one. \n2/28 ~3:30pm- that same AO calls me (?? i\u2019m still not sure if this actually happened, i was in a club meeting, didn\u2019t notice a call) and then he calls my mom. She doesn\u2019t answer cause she doesn\u2019t recognize the number, he leaves a voicemail telling her to tell me to call ASAP.\nI call, he congratulates me and tells me they will be sending me a formal likely letter soon, but he wanted to be the one to tell me i was in.\n2/28 6:19pm- harvard portal update, i get my likely woohoo.\nAll this is back in 2020.",

      "text": "It kind of depends on the school. Some schools will straight up tell you, whereas others will kind of get around officially telling you but will call or send a \u201clikely letter\u201d telling you they were impressed with your application and that you are a likely candidate for admission. That means you got in and they really really liked you.\n\nI\u2019d like to mention that I absolutely obsessed over the college application process (btw I have an ungodly amount of knowledge about elite college admissions from my research so if you have questions I\u2019m trying to start a little side gig of advising so hmu) and I read lots of stories of people getting likely letters and it felt like I had no chance of getting into a good school. I even had a friend who got letters from both Columbia and Duke. It can be disheartening not to receive one of those. However, I can assure you that you still have a very real chance of being admitted even if you don\u2019t know before everyone else. I didn\u2019t get a single likely letter but I was admitted into every school to which I applied (including Columbia, Vanderbilt, Georgetown, and Emory). For the record, I don\u2019t have any connections to those schools and my family isn\u2019t rich.\n\nIt\u2019s possible for you to get into the college of your dreams with hard work and luck. Never give up and never lose hope! You are an amazing and meaningful person no matter where you go to college (or even if you don\u2019t go at all)!",
