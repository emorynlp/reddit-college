  "text": "I already submitted my UC transfer apps a week ago. I had put that I planned to take ochem, bio, and physics for this semester. However, due to time conflictions with bio, I can't really take physics. Will my application be rescinded if that's the case? If I also take ochem 1 before transferring, will it hurt me later since I'm not finishing Ochem before transferring. I'm not sure if the ochem curricular at a community college will be the same as the UC curricular.",
