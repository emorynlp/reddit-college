  "text": "Hello to all!\n\nI know this topic has been asked before, but could only find old threads, so I\u2019m not sure the information in them still applies, especially after the pandemic.\n\nI\u2019m an international student who\u2019s looking for an engineering major with plenty of flexibility to dabble with other (humanities) things. For this reason, I\u2019m very interested in LACs with 3-2 programs. The problem is that I need full aid and information seems to be both vague and scarce on how that works for 3-2 students in their second school.  \nDoes anyone know if it\u2019s possible to get full aid in a program like that? I know the most popular schools for it are Columbia, Caltech, Dartmouth, and Wash U.\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "Caltech explicitly says there\u2019s no financial aid available for the 3-2 international students, Columbia says it\u2019s VERY limited (probably means they would consider someone with an efc of 65k out of 88k, but not like 10k out of 88k; however, idk for sure, you should contact them). Don\u2019t know about WashU and Dartmouth. Typically, you shouldn\u2019t consider transferring colleges if you need financial aid. You can double-major at many schools without having to transfer out",

      "text": "that's definitely something that i would email your regional admissions officer about as they would be able to get more information for u, but usually financial aid should match what you have at the other college.\n\ndo note though that a lot of 3-2 programs at colleges are somewhat dormant and may have incredibly insane standards to get into so you should do a lot of research before deciding",
