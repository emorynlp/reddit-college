  "text": "Basically, I had an upward trend through high school but I only ED'd one place and didn't EA anywhere because I assumed that my senior grades would also go upward, however, I'm literally getting all Bs due to me being lazy with homework and shit. I have a 1540 SAT and good AP exam scores but got rejected from my ED. I have multiple national awards in competitions and a pretty damn good activities list, although not extraordinary. I think my essays were pretty unique and creative as well. Should I even aim for t30s anymore?",
