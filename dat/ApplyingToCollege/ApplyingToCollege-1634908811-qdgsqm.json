  "title:": "International Application Question: Should I retake the TOEFL with a 108 composite?",
  "text": "Score distribution:\n\n26 Reading, 26 Listening, 26 Writing, 30 Speaking\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing is that I gave the test without any prior prep (bad decision, I know), and I think I can do way better if I give it one more time, possibly a 120 if I tried to understand the pattern of the practice tests. Plus, the scores of 29-30 only demonstrate C2 level proficiency, the 26s depict C1 level proficiency. \n\nMy counsellor told me that the score is great and I need not retake the test, but I'm conflicted, for some context I'm applying to some of the ivies and T20s, it will be competitive. But TOEFL tests cost a lot and it is a considerable financial investment for my family. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould I retake the TOEFLs?",
