  "text": "With decisions coming out soon I just wanted to make this post to come up with ideas for ways to deal with the not so good decisions that we may get. Feel free to comment any suggestions! \n\n1) Take a self care day. Skip a day of school if you can and do all of your favorite things. \n\n2) Order your favorite foods and have a little feast. \n\n3) Remind yourself that just because you didn't get accepted doesn't mean that you are not good enough, sometimes things just aren't meant to be. You will end up at a great school. \n\n4) Go on a long drive and scream along to your favorite songs. \n\n5) Watch your favorite comedy movie/tv show. \n\n6) Watch a \"try not to laugh\" compilation video on YouTube.",

Helicopter parents need to get off reddit and learn to love your child unconditionally.",
