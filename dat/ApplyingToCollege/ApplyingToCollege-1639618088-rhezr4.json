  "text": "i wrote my draft for the princeton diverse perspectives supp essay. this is the prompt: \"At Princeton, we value diverse perspectives and the ability to have respectful dialogue about difficult issues. Share a time when you had a conversation with a person or a group of people about a difficult topic. What insight did you gain, and how would you incorporate that knowledge into your thinking in the future?\"\n\ni wrote about a conversation i had with my cousin about abortion. i was on the prochoice side and she was on the prolife side. do u guys think it might be a bit controversial/risky to submit this? i'm scared cuz there's a chance that the AO who reads my essay is prolife, so they might reject me LOL.\n\ni can also write about a conversation i had with my bro's friend about systemic racism. he said systemic racism didn't exist and i was on the opposite side. should i write about this instead? or might it be even more riskier?",
