      "text": "I will literally die this time. I am on a gap year: re-applying. I already have started facing problem remembering things (memory problem) due to the inhumane amount of work I have put in since last few years. I literally worked 22hrs/day when I had COVID too. People with similar profile as mine have already got into Stanford(they didn't asked for aid). Not joking here.\n\nI left JEE where I could have got under 500 AIR atleast the way I was doing, but I left it for Stanford, Princeton etc. Everyone around me was shocked that why I left Fiitjee, when it was almost certain that I am gonna ace JEE advance and get into IIT Bombay. I went underground for 2 years. So many stories formed around and many other things happened.\n\nOk! it's big story. Don't have energy to right more.",
