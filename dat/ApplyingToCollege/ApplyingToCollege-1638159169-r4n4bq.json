Not to mention being at the top of my class, working a job, being a leader at my school and much more. Sometimes you gotta take a step back from the results and look at what the process was. Every one of us did amazing things and will continue to do amazing things.",

Came in as an international student to a high school in the US that happened to have a very rigid social hierarchy, so little language barrier in fact, but lots of cultural barriers. I've missed plenty of opportunities because of this, but I tried my very best to get good grades, do well on standardized tests. Well before college apps started I told myself even if I only got admitted by the shittiest college, it shows that somewhere, someone is actually appreciating the work I put in. So far I only heard back from one school, PSU, which is my safety school and I got accepted. Hopefully, things will work my way and I can get a satisfying result from the college apps process. Hopefully, the stress, the tears, and the hours will be worth it. But I guess ultimately just have a healthy expectation and believe that no matter where you go you can fight for a better future for yourself.",
