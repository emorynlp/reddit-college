  "text": "I applied ED to a school about a week ago and it\u2019s asking for a transcript for a summer program that doesn\u2019t give transcripts. I emailed my rep about this but he hasn\u2019t responded in five days. I\u2019m getting anxious since the deadline is coming up. Is it ok to just go over his head and email the admissions office about this?",
