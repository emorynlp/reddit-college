  "title:": "Is it possible to transfer to an Ivy League with a full ride?",
  "text": "Not sure if this type of post is allowed, but I'll just see...\n\nI'm a high school senior planning for college. I already know what schools I can be accepted to, and I'm not too happy about them. I've been thinking about transferring to an Ivy League or obviously the other top tier schools like Stanford/MIT/Duke, definitely after my sophomore year. I know these schools don't offer actual full ride scholarships, but surely there is a way to get my college tuition/dorming covered if I meet the requirements for it? Before you tell me, I already know how difficult it will be to transfer to a top 10 school. I will literally do anything and everything to transfer to one. I just need to know if there's any sort of program or scholarships available for it to happen.",

Robertson (full ride to Duke / UNC) for sure doesn\u2019t accept transfers. \n\nMaybe you\u2019ll get lucky with an outside scholarship, but don\u2019t count on the schools to give you a full ride unless you meet admission requirements and are low income.",

You\u2019d have to apply to both; I\u2019m not sure how many full rides are out there for transfers, but there\u2019s probably a few. It goes without saying those are exceptionally difficult to get- sometimes even more so than getting into an Ivy. Unless Duke offers a full ride specifically for transfers.",
