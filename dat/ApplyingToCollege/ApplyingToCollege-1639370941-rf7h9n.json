My friends and I were really there for each other during this whole process, so I would personally tell them about my rejections, but if you are hesitant about it then you shouldn't feel obligated to do so. Not saying you aren't close with your friends, but your closest friends can sometimes be toxic during this process, which you shouldn't be feeding into.",
