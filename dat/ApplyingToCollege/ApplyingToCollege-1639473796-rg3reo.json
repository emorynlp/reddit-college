  "title:": "This yr admission is worse?",
  "text": "Im seeing so many posts on this sub abt how so many overqualified ppl got rejected from cornell ed. Is this yr worse than last yr? It just feels like this yr is the worst, or has it been like this always? Like watching past yrs of college acceptance vids, so many ppl with lower stats and ec\u2019s than the ppl who got rejected today got admitted. Past yrs, ppl\u2019s ec\u2019s werent like stellar compared to this yr applicants- they are good, but not great but still got in by just being well-rounded. I feel like this yr tho, it\u2019s gonna be much more diff seeing how highly spiked ppl are getting rejected.",
