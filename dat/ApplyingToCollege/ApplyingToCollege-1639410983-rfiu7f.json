  "text": "Hey everyone! I applied ED to RISD and got deferred, and unfortunately I can\u2019t find a lot of info on if I have any real chance of getting in during RD.\n\nI can submit an updated transcript and a few more pieces to my portfolio before the RD deadline, which I plan to do. The letter says a very small number of applicants get deferred, but also that they can\u2019t predict how many deferred applicants will be admitted during RD.\n\nI\u2019ve been looking online but I can\u2019t find any info on whether or not it\u2019s worth it to keep hoping that I\u2019ll get in, so if anyone has any experience or advice for this situation I\u2019d greatly appreciate it!",

I also have no experience with what this process is supposed to be like though so im not sure :,)",
