  "title:": "Do Americans See Stanford In League of HYP?",
  "text": "HI, I'm an international from Singapore but have lived in the UK for the better part of my life. I've been somewhat surprised to see all the praise Stanford gets in this subreddit. Outside of the US, Stanford doesn't have nearly the same cachet as Yale/Princeton, and certainly has much less of a cachet than Harvard. I was wondering whether people in the US actually see Stanford in this level, and it is only outside of the US that doesn't know that Stanford is that good? Even for technology, we usually saw MIT as the undisputed best. Stanford seemed to be more like UChicago, UPenn (non-Wharton), etc. Below HYP, MIT, and Columbia. \n\nOr is it just because many people in this subreddit are in California? I know that Stanford is populated mostly by Californians, like Berkeley, is that why this subreddit talks about Stanford so much?",

Worse is that they report this statistic to US News and other -- along with stating that undergraduate enrollment is only the students in CC+SEAS. Worst of all: lots of state schools have students like those in SGS but don't excerpt them from undergraduate stats by putting them in their own college.\n\nIf you think this definitional gerrymandering is irrelevant, then other schools should take a subset of their undergraduate colleges and trumpet those combined acceptance rates -- and only report that to ranking services. Columbia is a great school, but the SGS numbers game is just shameful.",

I'd say that's also misleading. If SGS or Barnard were small, it would be one thing -- but they are not.\n\nApples to apples should be the standard. Compare admissions rates for all undergraduates or compare same-subject school admissions rates (e.g. SEAS vs other engineering schools). CC, SGS, and Barnard are all arts and sciences colleges so excluding SGS is arbitrary and dishonest. Quoting figures for only some of the undergraduates perpetuates this probl;em.\n\nHonestly, this is the one thing Columbia does that I just find sad -- and it doesn't need to be so. They could market SGS to appeal to people turned away by the elitism and trumpet how Hamilton was another non-traditional student. For years, NYU has beaten CU at marketing itself as reflective of NYC; Columbia could really turn that around and push how they reflect the cosmopolitan nature of NYC and its excellence. Instead, they hide SGS away and report figures excluding it. It's like people who are embarrassed by their partner: it's not a good look.",
