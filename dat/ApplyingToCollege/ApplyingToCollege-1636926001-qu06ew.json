  "text": "My school just informed me that for some clerical reason, they were not able to add the courses I took this summer to my transcript. Now, all my transcripts have already been sent but without the courses I took. If I get my counselors to add these courses to my transcript, can I resend them to colleges with the correct course listing?",
