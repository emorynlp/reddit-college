  "text": "Hi so I applied to Umiami ED I last week and there\u2019s a part saying that a ED agreement from counselor needs to be submitted. I saw a ED form which I could print and give my counselor to sign but on the common app, it says that she haven\u2019t started \u2018ED agreement\u2019. Am I suppose to print the form and send it to her or she could get her own ED form and send it in herself? \n\nI hope I\u2019m not confusing anyone \ud83e\udd72",
