  "title:": "Mistake when emailing admissions counselor",
  "text": "This is gonna sound really dumb, and it is, but I am applying to the University of Michigan and I accidentally emailed an admissions counselor asking if they considered mid-year report grades and I explicitly said that I was asking because I got a C in ap calculus and I was concerned. Turns out I don't have to send the grade to the school, but the admissions counselor will see what I said regardless. Is this anything to worry about? I feel very dumb rn.",
