  "text": "Hey guys, I\u2019m a senior and at the beginning of the year I accidentally signed up to take 4 APs even though my school only allows 3 (unless you get special permission for a language AP). I forgot to withdraw before the 1 week add/drop period and now I have a W on my transcript for AP physics (my school won\u2019t change it), if I explain this do you think it will majorly affect my college applications?",
