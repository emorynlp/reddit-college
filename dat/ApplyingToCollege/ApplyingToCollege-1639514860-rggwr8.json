  "text": "I am homeschooled so I don\u2019t have any other scores, which is why I really don\u2019t want to go test op. But this was my only chance for the ACT. \nI think I can score a 1 with my ECs (you can check my other other posts if interested), but I\u2019m afraid that my ACT scores will automatically disqualify me. \n\nI got a 31 in math, 32 in science, 35 in English, and 33 in reading.",
