  "title:": "Should I accept a supplemental LOR from someone I wasn't going to ask before she offered?",
  "text": "So for context, I did a paid internship over the summer (and continuing to the present) that I reference a decent amount in my application. I considered asking for a supplemental LOR from the leader of the nonprofit I worked at, but most of my work was independent and I didn't have much contact so I figured she didn't know me well enough to write a good rec. We've probably talked about 8 times virtually. She emailed me today about a project and casually mentioned she'd be willing to write a recommendation for college. I wasn't going to ask initially because she doesn't know me well, but now I'm considering it. My reasoning is that she wouldn't go out of her way to offer and then write a poor letter. For context, I already have one supplemental LOR from someone I do know well. What do you guys think?",

      "text": "In my opinion, you should accept it. If she has offered it on her own, she probably knows you better than you think (can write about your work ethic, etc.) and would really put in the effort to make the LOR really good. Plus, the fact that you referenced your internship in your application makes the LOR complement your application.",

      "text": "This maybe just my perspective.   \nBut the way the common app is designed allows you to accept more LORs than required.   \nAnd it'd probably be better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it  \n\n\nEspecially so since in this case, she offered to write you one!",
