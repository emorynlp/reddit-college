  "text": "Cornell Engineering gives you 3 essay prompts out of which you need to respond to 2. I'm applying ED so I'm not sure if writing the Why Cornell Essay is a good idea since I'm already stating it's my first choice. I could ramble on about why I love the college but I'm sure lots of other kids will do the same. Do you reccomend going for it or not?",
