  "text": "I'm currently a junior in Highschool and have been looking at colleges in DC as options. Obviously, Georgetown is definitely one of my top choices but I think its a reach for me so something more realistic that I could get in are AU and GWU. I've looked at stats, scores, and rankings and the colleges are almost identical in every category, acceptance rate and all.\n\nThe main difference I've seen so far is that AU has a campus, where GWU is like a city block. I think I would probably prefer the campus setting but I'm not visiting until like Thanksgiving so I suppose we will wait till then to see which area I like before then.  \n\n\nBefore I do that tho, does anyone have any tips/info about the two that I might now know and which one you personally would recommend?",

      "text": "I have friends who went to both schools and from what I can gather they're fairly similar--at both, a lot of students are interested in gov't/policy/law and that's obviously a part of the draw to schools in DC. I think there's more STEM students at GW though (but still dominated by poli sci types). Both are good schools. The people I've known at AU have been a little quirkier, and GW students have been a little more preppy, but that's only a very small sample. \n\nI've been on both campuses and it definitely is a personal preference as far as the type of campus. GW is obviously closer to the Mall and tourist stuff (but the metro in DC makes it easy to get almost anywhere), compared to the area around AU where there's more residential homes. It's good you're going to visit the campuses and see what you might prefer.",

              "text": "Ah, ok. Here's a brief compilation of stuff I was able to find in my saved/post history, but the TL:DR of it is: You'll probably get into both and you should just go wherever is cheaper\n\nAs a GW student, I obviously prefer GW. In terms of objective metrics, we're ranked higher by USNews (not that it really matters) and *ForeignPolicy* specifically for IA (not that there's any meaningful difference between 8th and 9th), and we're also much more centrally located in DC (that comes with the positives of more to do and easier access to internships, and the negatives of $$$)\n\n In terms of subjective things, I much prefer GW's campus over AUs, I think that our dining plan blows their out of the water, and that Foggy is just generally a better part of DC to live in with more going on and better year-round access to internships\n\nAssorted links you should check out:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/gwu/comments/i0bssj/gw\\_proscons\\_if\\_we\\_were\\_having\\_a\\_normal\\_school\\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gwu/comments/i0bssj/gw_proscons_if_we_were_having_a_normal_school_year/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/gwu/comments/fm3e5y/freshman\\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gwu/comments/fm3e5y/freshman_help/) \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/gwu/comments/funahy/sis\\_or\\_elliot/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gwu/comments/funahy/sis_or_elliot/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/gwu/comments/g3oxwh/comment/fnss0b3/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/gwu/comments/g3oxwh/comment/fnss0b3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/gwu/comments/ga32kh/socialparty\\_scene\\_at\\_gwu/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gwu/comments/ga32kh/socialparty_scene_at_gwu/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/gwu/comments/h05kww/gwu\\_internship\\_questions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gwu/comments/h05kww/gwu_internship_questions/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/gwu/comments/hrfova/polisci\\_majors\\_when\\_do\\_students\\_typically\\_start/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gwu/comments/hrfova/polisci_majors_when_do_students_typically_start/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g95bmz/gwu\\_or\\_au\\_for\\_international\\_relations/forugwf/?context=999](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g95bmz/gwu_or_au_for_international_relations/forugwf/?context=999)",
