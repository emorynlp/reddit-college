  "text": "As someone who has no actual ECs is it better to fill that section with stuff like tutoring, babysitting, swimming (even tho I'm not even on a team or have competed ever), or just leave it blank?\n\nP.S. How important are ECs? Do you guys know people who got into good colleges without them? Also, how good?",

      "text": "Things like tutoring, babysitting, etc are all ECs. Practically anything you spend a good chunk of time on outside of school can be an EC. It\u2019s better to put these down than none at all. \n\nThe importance of ECs increases the more selective the college is. Many less selective colleges have auto-admit cutoffs based solely on GPA and test scores without even looking at ECs.",

              "text": "That still really depends on the college. E.g. even if your scores, gpa, etc are all above the median for Harvard, ECs are still a huge component and you\u2019re absolutely not getting in without good ECs just due to the selectivity. There are more applicants with above-median scores and gpa than the number of seats. So the overall selectivity of the college still matters a lot, especially because once you\u2019re over the score/gpa hurdle, ECs are arguably the next biggest component.",
