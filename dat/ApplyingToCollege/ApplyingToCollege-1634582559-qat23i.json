  "text": "I just got an email from UAB saying they\u2019ve waived their fee waiver for everybody starting from today. But unfortunately I applied last week\u2026 Can\u2019t believe applying early cost me in this case. \n\nDo you think there is any way I could get a refund for the fee I paid? My family could really use that $40.",
