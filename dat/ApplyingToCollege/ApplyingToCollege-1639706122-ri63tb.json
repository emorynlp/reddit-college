      "text": "Hey! In terms of another LOR, it depends on Brown\u2019s policy. Some schools explicitly say no more than a certain number. I would generally shy away from submitting additional LORs, unless the recommender writes something new and of quality about you. For my LOCIs (got me pulled off the Rice and Tufts waitlists in 2020), I wrote about new things I was doing with my extracurriculars, readings I enjoyed from professors at these institutions and how their knowledge would contribute to my growth, and organizations/research at these schools I could contribute to and would help further my aspirations. I hope this helped!",
