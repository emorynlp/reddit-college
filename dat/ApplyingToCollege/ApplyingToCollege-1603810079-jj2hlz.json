      "text": "Okay but surely adverbs do help the meaning of the sentence in many cases? They\u2019re definitely redundant a lot of the time, but they\u2019re also useful. I don\u2019t use them too much, maybe 1/100 words, but I think they\u2019re necessary in some places. Here are some examples from my writing that I don\u2019t think would have the same effect without the adverbs\n\n\u201cI eagerly await...\u201d What lone verb conveys eagerly awaiting something? \n\n\u201cI know both objectively and anecdotally that...\u201d tying in my older friends\u2019 experiences with the college\n\n\u201cdo not understand\u201d vs \u201cdo not fully understand\u201d convey different things\n\n\u201cI became obsessively analytical\u201d \n\n\u201cx finally happened\u201d shows excitement and pride vs \u201cx happened\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately\u201d is a good transition word between expectations and reality\n\n\u201cNothing fundamentally changed\u201d \n\nWriting without adverbs is boring and conveys a simpler meaning than an experience may actually represent. Yes I agree, 80% of the time they are redundant, but in other cases they specify the meaning of the sentence in a way that would not otherwise be possible without sounding like a robot. There is a reason adverbs exist in the English language, and this is it.\n\nTL;DR I agree that many adverbs are useless, but some are necessary to convey specific meanings. Adverbs that amplify = bad, adverbs that specify = good\n\nEdit: Thank you for the award, this is the rant I never got to yell at my 11th grade teacher about and I\u2019m glad someone agrees with me",

One that is pretty applicable to this sub is, \"Stopping a piece of work just because it\u2019s hard, either emotionally or imaginatively, is a bad idea. Sometimes you have to go on when you don\u2019t feel like it, and sometimes you\u2019re doing good work when it feels like all you\u2019re managing is to shovel shit from a sitting position.\" Keep writing those essays even when it feels like you're getting no where. \n\nHe also compares dressing up vocabulary to putting a household pet in dress clothes. It may sound like a cute idea but once it's done the pet is embarrassed and the owner should be as well. Don't get stuck looking through list of synonyms trying to find the \"best\" word. The first word you came up with is fine. Just be direct and say what you mean.",
