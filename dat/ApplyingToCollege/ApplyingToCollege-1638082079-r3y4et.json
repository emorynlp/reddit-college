  "text": "I applied RD but submitted my application at the beginning of the month, I did this with all my applications and received portal login info for all schools except Wesleyan. Have yall heard from them?\n\nI've only received an email about fin aid and an email confirming that they'll add an update I sent them to my application. Before I contact them about it I figured I should ask yall in case it's normal since my application is RD.",
