If you're deferred, it probably won't change anything, but at least it will be in the system.\n\nAnd this is 100% pure speculation on my part, but I imagine if you were on the borderline and they saw you had checked the box but hadn't submitted your scores, they might have reached out to you for clarification. The fact that they didn't suggests that it probably wouldn't have impacted their decision significantly. I could be totally wrong of course.",

To ensure accurate super scoring (taking the highest composite score across multiple sittings), we recommend that you self-report each test you have taken to select the highest score in each section. You may also report your scores directly through your Penn Applicant Portal once your application is received. **(Note: if you are using the Common Application, your scores will not appear in the PDF preview but we will still receive them.)**\n\nhttps://admissions.upenn.edu/admissions-and-financial-aid/what-penn-looks-for/testing",
