Columbia has always been my dream school, but I know I literally have no chances of getting in, but I mean, I applied because I always thought u had to be a genius to apply to the Ivy League LMAO. \n\nIs anyone here in the same situation? I applied to 32 colleges, and I honestly keep thinking I\u2019ll get rejected from everywhere. If anyone is in the same position I\u2019ll gladly talk to them!",

Yes it will hurt if I don\u2019t but I know there will be other options for me. So no I\u2019m not nervous and I\u2019m proud of myself for that because I\u2019m normally a very high anxiety person. :) good luck everyone",
