  "text": "Collegeboard sucks. There isn't a single person that I know who likes collegeboard. But I might dislike collegeboard for a different reason than you.\n\nSure, collegeboard profits off kids despite being a non-profit. The fact that we have to accept terms and conditions stating we can't sue collegeboard sucks. Collegeboard has a monopoly on education, and we all hate it.\n\n**But the thing I hate the most about collegeboard is that the collegeboard website logs you out all the godamn time.** I will literally be in the middle of taking a progress check or a practice frq and the website logs me out. I'll try logging in only to be met with another verification and login screen. If I click on ANYTHING on the website, I have to log in again. Not only that, but I can't even access generic information without being prompted to log in.\n\nIf there's one thing that I've learned about collegeboard, it's that that they want you to suffer. I feel like collegeboard has been trying to send out this message of \\*we know how much covid has sucked for you guys so we tried to make everything easier\\* by getting rid of the sat essay and subject tests and implementing 3 different testing dates for each test. yea, no. **collegeboard, you're the root of all my problems.**\n\nScrew you collegeboard and your stupid website. I'm just trying to get through this goddamn year.",

Thank you for initiating collegeboard website slander.)\n\nI'd like to take a moment to comment on the terrible design of the AP videos feature. You may be wondering what could be wrong with the videos; they play and you listen. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\nWRONG.\n\nFirst of all, I'm not sure if your teachers are doing this but mine are making these videos graded assignments so in order to make sure we watch the videos they check for the blue checkmark that appears after watching a video. The problem that arises however is that THE CHECKMARK DOESN'T APPEAR UNLESS YOU WATCH TO THE ABSOLUTE LAST SECOND AND WAIT LIKE 10 SECONDS AFTERWARDS! Sometimes the last 20 seconds of a video are just the teacher saying goodbye and good luck or whatever so I skip to the next video bUT the stupid checkmark doesn't appear! So you have to go back and watch the same video all over again just to get that validation. That. Stupid. Little. Mark.\n\nSo what's the big deal, just mute the video and switch tabs right?\n\nWRONG AGAIN.\n\nThe video doesn't play if you switch tabs so you just have to sit there and deal with the consequences of the web designer's actions and regret that you didn't watch the outro.",

      "text": "Try not to rely on the SAT, other factors will get you to your goal. For example, I was trying to take the sat like seven times only have been able to take one to two times. None of it had really helped me. Instead, I tried to compete and get awards, research, volunteer, job shadow, and get as much recommendations, clubs, and do the best on all of the courses. Take like two AP\u2019s and two college courses, and not all AP\u2019s due to the exams. I personally end up having an admission at UIUC, and my specific major only accepts 80 freshman\u2019s out of all considering the average SAT is 1390-1400\u2019s, so the SAT must be higher to at least get an admission. So in this case, I don\u2019t favor the SAT, subject tests and etc,but the individual academic performance through GPA, College courses, Accuplacer, and recommendations. It\u2019s not worth it studying 24/7 for an SAT that might get cancelled, instead you can do a research and who knows you might win the regional contest and be state qualifier",
