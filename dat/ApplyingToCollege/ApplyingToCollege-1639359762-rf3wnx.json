  "text": "Hi! I recently got accepted to my dream ED school but it's about \\~$15,000 too expensive. We already talked to the school months before hand so we know it's okay to pull out due to financial reasons, but my dad is going to try to appeal for more money. Does anyone know if this is even possible? I'm super depressed right now.\n\nEDIT: some more things, the tuition was more than $15,000 above what we were expecting from the cost calculator. I know that it isn't like totally accurate, but $15,000 is a ton",
