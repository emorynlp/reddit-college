  "title:": "Seniors applying to college are damn toxic",
  "text": "I\u2019ve been eavesdropping in class for the past few weeks, and the loudest group has been discussing college apps and college choice and whatnot. Whether heckling someone they overheard or talking about somewhere they want to go, they just can\u2019t fight the urge to express their opinion that non-prestigious = worthless.\n\nAs someone applying to \u201ccrappy\u201d schools because I\u2019d rather not be in debt for nearly equivalent education, and someone friends with people in a similar boat, it gets on my nerves when they loudly shout \u201cif you get into (second best school in state) but not (best school I\u2019m state), you should just take a gap year and try again\u201d \u201cjeez, (non-T20) school is **terrible**, I\u2019d kill myself if I had to go there\u201d, or any time a teacher mentions doing bad in class or anything related, they\u2019ll joke \u201cwelp, guess you have to go to (2nd best in state/local cc).\u201d As if that\u2019s the end of the fucking world.\n\nAnd they literally never talk about anything else. It\u2019s one thing to joke about it once or twice, but it\u2019s like they\u2019ve made their entire life revolve around state schools/ccs being hell on earth and UCs (oos) being the pinnacle. \n\nI know the words of one group of friends isn\u2019t the sentiment of everyone, but when a 30-strong group at a school with 100/grade can\u2019t drop it, it starts to seem more like a theme than a one-off. \n\nThey\u2019re generally nice people too, so I guess imma bit disappointed in them.",

She just kind of scrunched up her face and said \"It's not like I'm gonna go there\". I know people who would be happy to get in, so it was pretty annoying. I wish people talked about college less at school. It gets so stressful and everyone compares themselves to each other.",

She is married with 5 kids and I don\u2019t think she has worked in a while. Half of my classmates are lawyers but a good percentage are home makers or working in other professions. What is important to you in high school fades away later in life. No one has those conversations anymore we have moved on to the question of the post high school journey what you learned in HS and how it shaped your life. At every reunion we have a classmate panel interview that\u2019s separate from the bar crawl, family picnics, and group hikes. This year we invited a English teacher to the mix who grew into the school\u2019s elderly prophet. He certainly enjoyed seeing how his teachings and style shaped our adult perspectives.",

I'm applying to Vanderbilt RD, and there's a girl at my school who's a complete Vanderbilt simp. She overheard me saying that I was applying there and then came and yelled at me. Why do people get so territorial over schools they haven't even gotten into yet?",

If ur going Harvard the other has to go Stanford no second arguments for that sole reason. So I get where she\u2019s coming from but again no authority to yell at u .",

It\u2019s hard not to be obsessional about college choices, but it doesn\u2019t mean everything.  Hard work is appreciated. Tenacity. People skills.  My secret hint for anyone starting college - work on your soft skills. Communication, conflict resolution, speaking, negotiating... that\u2019s what will get you ahead in life.",
