  "text": "I just submitted my first application on CommonApp and was wondering if there is anything else that I need to do as well? Since my application portal information will only be emailed to me after the EA/ED deadline, how do I know what else needs to be submitted/sent to the colleges?\n\nFYI: I'm the first in my immediate family to go through the application process (they did it like 25 yrs ago).",
