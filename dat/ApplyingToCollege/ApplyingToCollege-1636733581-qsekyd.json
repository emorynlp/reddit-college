              "text": "Oh yeah 2 hours a week is significant. These aren't classes though right? Also putting them all under one EC hmm, unless you have a lot of other EC I would separate them. Unless they are very similar and all revolve around the same sort of subject, if they are all similar combine them also. \n\nI would need a bit more info though because it really depends on what the seminars are",

                  "text": "Thank you for your answer! I only have 1 space left so that\u2019s why I was thinking about putting them all together. So basically one seminar is about First Aid, and another is \u201cSustainability: The Future of Jobs\u201d. The third one is a bit particular because it includes 4 types of meetings (in English, Spanish, German); the 4 types are: Human Rights, development of Poor Countries, Fundraising and EU External Relations, and Promotion of Equity in the Education System. \nI think this will never fit in 150 characters :(",
