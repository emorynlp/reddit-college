  "text": "so i applied ed to a school, and obviously i might get rejected but college apps get quite pricey, and if i get in to my ed school i will have to withdraw apps. i wanted to wait until i heard from ed school to submit my rd apps to potentially save money. my dad is against this because he believes that applying earlier (like months before the rd deadline) will make it easier for me to get accepted. is this true?",
