  "text": "I\u2019m considering applying to some NEECAC schools senior year but I\u2019d like to know if anyone has info about the sports / social scene combination. Seems to me like a lot of ones social life is defined by their sport and subsequent events and friends from it. As someone who isn\u2019t planning on playing any sports in college, does anyone know if this idea has any validity to it?",
