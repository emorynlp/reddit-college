  "text": "So the UT Austin portal email went to my spam and I was missing half a credit in social studies. I sent in the form to fix this about an hour after the deadline (10th) and it doesn't look like it has been processed yet (they said 24 hours I believe).\n\nShould I contact the admissions office explaining everything or is this a lost cause? I assume they will not be reading my application because of this which would really suck, so if there's any way to fix this that would be awesome. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: There's also a note at the bottom saying \" Current as of\u00a012/12/2021; may not reflect all information received/used for\u00a0admission decision. \" so it could have theoretically made it in, but since they seem to be really strict about deadlines I'm not really sure how to approach this.",
