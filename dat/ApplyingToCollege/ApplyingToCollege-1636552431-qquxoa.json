  "text": "Hi everyone! \n\nI got my TOEFL results past week, they are pretty good, better than I was expecting(102/120), and now I'm supposed to look for universities, but I don't really know which University to choose. There are so many of them and apparently, I'm not a candidate for the Ivy League. Even if I would be a candidate for Ivy, I could not risk it because I don't have a lot of money for applications fees. So, the question is, if you have some prefered university list, or you just know that these are good universities, not the best ones but still good, could you please share that information with me? I want to study Computer Science, I graduated from my school this year and I'm planning to study in the US in the fall semester of 2022.\n\nAny information is appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!",
