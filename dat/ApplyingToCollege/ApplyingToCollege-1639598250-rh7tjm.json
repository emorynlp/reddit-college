  "text": "hey guys, just thought i would let u in on a little tip. i was deferred from my top school and was super bummed, i sent the admissions office an email expressing interest and accidentally sent them a selfie too. they responded immediately and said they didnt know how attractive i was when reading my application, and then offered me admission and a full ride!!! so if u get deferred, just send a cute lil selfie to ur admission counselor and i guarantee acceptance! will only work if extremely attractive tho so pls be self aware",
