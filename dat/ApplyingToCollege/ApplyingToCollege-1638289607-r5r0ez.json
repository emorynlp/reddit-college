  "text": "So my school has a placement exam you take in 8th grade and if you don\u2019t get into any advanced (basically just honors) courses then you can\u2019t take them unless a teacher recommends you for one during freshman year.\nIs this worth mentioning or will it seem like i\u2019m making excuses for my lack of advanced courses during freshman/sophomore year?\nMy school also has a different grading system (like an A is a 93-100) so should I mention this or will it look like I\u2019m making excuses for a grade besides an A?",
