  "text": "People always ask about legacy preferences.  But what about the opposite?\n\nIf a candidate has legacy (especially if both parents are alums) at a university, will this potentially negatively impact his application chances at other universities?  Would there be the temptation that AOs at the other universities would just assume he would be applying to the legacy school and so would yield protect? Assuming candidate is a strong candidate at both the legacy and other colleges.",

I saw of AOs sitting around a conference table, discussing applicants, and one said something like 'but she's a legacy at ZZZ' and everyone else said 'hmmm...' so they definitely notice it.  Sigh, now I can't remember which school it was for - maybe a LAC?\n\nIt's similar to the question of 'I went to Columbia's summer program.  Should I list it when I apply to Cornell?'",
