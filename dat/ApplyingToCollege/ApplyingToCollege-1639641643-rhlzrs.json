  "text": "The thing is, I don't know what I got rejected for from Yale. Was it the money (I'm VERY poor, but isn't Yale need-blind? So I guess that's not it), the supps, the common app essay, the ECs, or the fact that I'm international...I don't know, and I never will. I personally think my supps (and my entire app) were good, but now that I got rejected, and not even deferred, I'm just confused if my application was even something good. \n\nAlso, as an example, can someone please check a few lines from one of my Yale supps? I want to reuse those lines but since I got rejected....idk if it's even good",

          "text": "Yeah, that is true but I thought need-blind colleges don't look at the financial needs of applicants, and Yale's need-blind for international students. So, I think it's just that my app wasn't good enough, but honestly, I don't know where to improve for the next schools I apply to. I would've still thought that I was good enough if I was just deferred instead of rejected :((",
