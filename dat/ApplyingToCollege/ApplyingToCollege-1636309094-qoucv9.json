  "text": "Y'all.\n\nThese community/diversity essays are killing me. I'm a white girl who grew up in a middle-class suburb. \n\nIs it ok to write about something potentially overused and controversial? The only true diversity I can add is that I'm asexual. This HAS been a struggle for me and I have definitely grown as a result of overcoming this struggle, but I'm worried colleges will see it as me trying to get pity diversity points. \n\nOpinions?\n\nThe prompt I'm talking about in particular is UW's supplemental.",

      "text": "Yeah UW\u2019s supplemental was a struggle to get through. The main point that you should focus on is that it isn\u2019t necessarily just your demographics that are ways you can add diversity (race, sexuality, etc) but also the communities that you come from. You can talk about clubs that you were involved in and how they give you different experiences and perspectives. I\u2019m an Indian male applying to cs so I\u2019m not really going to add much diversity either, so I just focused on how my experiences in activities that I\u2019ve done have shaped me into who I am. You can definitely focus on being asexual though, and speak on the struggles you\u2019ve faced that have made you a person with a unique identity that can add to UW. Hope this helps!",
