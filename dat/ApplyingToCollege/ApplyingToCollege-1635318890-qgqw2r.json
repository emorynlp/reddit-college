  "text": "So, I want to apply Early Action and all my recommendation letters are ready. I asked Letter of Recommendations from my teachers  and they even wrote it. But this year a new school principal has arrived in my previous school and she told my subject teacher that They are not allowed to write LORs. How do I deal with this situation? How is something not like this not allowed? Although I got the counsellor LOR from my  principal. Can my teachers submit LORs without school letterhead? She is not allowing the school letterhead.",
