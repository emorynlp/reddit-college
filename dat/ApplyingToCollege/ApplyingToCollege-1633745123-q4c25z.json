  "text": "Help!! What should I do in order to save $$$ and maximize my chances of getting a good job placement???\n\nMy dream school has always been NYU but now I'm not so sure I want to go. For one, the cost is egregious and the only way to really pay it back would be to land yourself on Wall Street or something (I want to go to Stern so that may as well be a possibility if I get into NYU), but the thing is, I don't want to work in NYC after graduation. The cost of living in NYC is too high and so even a huge income wouldn't compensate for the debt and stuff. I'm not sure about Stern's job placement outside of NYC so then would I even be able to pay off the debt? I also want to go to grad school...so I prefer not to enter grad school with a casual $70K of debt. In addition, I want to do the BPE program which means I study abroad the entirety of my sophomore year which would affect my recruiting so that just makes it more of a gamble.\n\nMy second dream school is a top 5 LAC and it would def have better grad school placement. I would still graduate with significant debt (probably the same as NYU if not more) but I know that I can at least get a high-paying job in an area that is not only limited to wall street. However, the main concern is that well...what's the point of going to grad school if I'm already in a lot of debt still? I also like the social culture of a LAC more if that does anything. However, I love the idea of living in NYC during COLLEGE and I also want to do finance/consulting, and idk if a LAC is the best way to do that. The pro would be that I could still study abroad (albeit one semester instead of the whole year) and I wouldn't miss out on half of recruiting.\n\nMy safest option is my state school. I don't want to say which one for privacy but it's a semi-decent school (think T25 for my major) and I already got in and I might even get scholarships. It is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than the other two and in fact, I probably would have enough money left over to invest or something after graduation. However, I wouldn't be able to study abroad most likely because it's harder to do so at this specific college (harder but not impossible still??) and I'm not too sure about grad school and job placement. It's quite literally a Big 10 college so I'm sure I have more than enough resources and opportunities but I've always just envisioned myself being out of state. But, with money, I don't think I have room to be sentimental about my dreams and stuff but I'm just conflicted.",

      "text": "> The cost of living in NYC is too high and so even a huge income wouldn't compensate for the debt and stuff. \n\nNYC COL is high but the top jobs out of Stern can more than cover it. Wall Street recently raised *base* salaries to $100k, not even talking about the bonuses which are 50-100% of salary. \n\n> I'm not sure about Stern's job placement outside of NYC so then would I even be able to pay off the debt?\n\nI'm currently working at a unicorn (well, have a return offer lol) not in NYC. Most people do find jobs in NYC but I'd argue that's mainly because people go to NYU, and study in NYC, because they want to live in NYC. If you're talking about recruiting though, I've interviewed at plenty of prestigious firms (Google/Blackstone/Amazon/etc.) for non-NYC locations so they definitely do extend interviews to us (and I'm not some summa cum laude who also saves the world during their downtime and worked at Goldman their freshman year candidate just to clarify). \n\n> In addition, I want to do the BPE program which means I study abroad the entirety of my sophomore year which would affect my recruiting so that just makes it more of a gamble.\n\nI'm in BPE and while most of us don't go into banking, there are a few kids every year. One really ridiculous year, there was like 3 or 4 GS IB analysts from *1 class* of BPE and what's even more insane is back then, they were required to go abroad for 3 semesters lol. BPE definitely affects recruiting, just to be upfront about it, but you're at Stern; it's super doable to recruit. If I had to estimate, probably 10-20% of BPE goes into IB. \n\nAlso, I just want to clarify that there are other great jobs outside of banking. Sure, banking is probably going to have the highest salary in terms of career trajectory and is the highest for business kids, but consulting, working business roles in tech firms, etc. all can have you starting at 6 figures out of undergrad. I went into Stern sure I was going into IB and then realised that that lifestyle would've been hell to me; decided immediately to pivot away and while hearing my friends talk about their salaries can hurt sometimes, I definitely don't regret it when I hear their hours. Also, Stern in general is trying to pivot away from this super strong finance focus (you can look into initiatives in entrepreneurship for example, the growth of the computing and data science concentration, the new BTE program, etc.) and while the communities that aren't finance/consulting are a lot more disjointed, I've found a surprising number of people who are increasingly pursuing those roles. \n\n> I know that I can at least get a high-paying job in an area that is not only limited to wall street. \n\nNYU isn't really going to keep you from getting high-paying jobs; our CS kids also go on to work at FAANG and other prestigious roles even if we aren't known as a CS school. Bottom line, if you weren't going to get Amazon coming out of NYU for example, you probably weren't going to get it coming out of Williams. \n\n\n> However, I love the idea of living in NYC during COLLEGE and I also want to do finance/consulting, and idk if a LAC is the best way to do that\n\nUnless it's Williams or Amherst, NYU will trounce any other LAC in finance (and even with Williams & Amherst, I wouldn't classify them as \"better\" targets, they're just actual targets whereas nobody thinks of Middlebury as a finance target for example.) You're fighting an uphill battle if you come out of a LAC, that's just reality. \n\n\n> My safest option is my state school. I don't want to say which one for privacy but it's a semi-decent school (think T25 for my major) and I already got in and I might even get scholarships. It is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than the other two and in fact, I probably would have enough money left over to invest or something after graduation. \n\nMy advice to you is to strongly consider your state school. You sound debt averse (same! so I get it) and $70k is a huge amount especially if you want to go to grad school. The average Sternie or B-school student doesn't really plan on going to grad school, and if they did, it would be for an MBA (in which case going to a LAC doesn't confer any significant advantages since MBAs care about work experience above all, not research experience or something else.) If you are 150% sure you want to do finance/consulting, I would say NYU is probably a good choice (especially because if you're willing to grind, being located in NYC is a really good advantage and a lot of people will hold part-time internships, which is just impossible if you're out in Hanover for example.) However, if you're sure you want to do grad school, do not take on $70k debt; while people will often still care about your undergrad, the person who went from no-name undergrad -> Harvard MBA will on average, be much better off than someone who did Harvard -> Montana MBA for example. Where you end up is far more indicative than where you started. I think NYU, or whatever LAc you're talking about (since you said T5 doesn't exactly leave many options lol) can be worth the money, but you need to think really hard and carefully and at least from what you've written, I personally wouldn't recommend either option.",

      "text": "BPE student here. Directed to this post by a friend still in high school...wow, I do not miss college apps!\n\nOne, you should not be worried about not getting a job outside of NYC. I hate to toot my own horn here, but really, do not underestimate the power of Stern.\n\nSecondly, studying abroad doesn't affect recruiting prospects - you wouldn't even be seriously job hunting until you're a junior, and even so, most if not all major firms are very open to meeting virtually.\n\nI would apply everywhere and see where you get in first. Not to suggest you are not qualified, but admissions get harder and harder every year. The cycle itself may help you narrow down your options. Good luck!\n\nP.S. full disclosure, it's true that Stern students don't plan on doing much else outside of finance, but you can still branch out. Doors will open if you kick 'em down with the help of Stern upperclassmen and counselors! I want to go to law school, for example. TLDR; apply everywhere and see what happens.",
