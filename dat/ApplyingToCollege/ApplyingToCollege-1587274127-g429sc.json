It\u2019s really about rankings in general. The big idea is (spoiler warning) that rankings are only good as the factors that are considered in the rankings. Whether you\u2019re talking cars or colleges, what\u2019s an important factor for you is maybe not an important factor for other people. A sports car isn\u2019t the #1 best car if you\u2019re driving around a family of four, you know. \n\nFor college rankings in particular, it\u2019s crazy to him that price isn\u2019t a factor in rankings. The best college is always one that you can afford to finish, just like the best diet or exercise routine is always the one you\u2019ll actually do. Right?\n\nI\u2019m a college coach and the like 90% of the students I help fall into one of two categories: students whose parent make under like $50,000 a year and will need full financial aid no matter where the student goes, and students whose parents aren\u2019t asking for aid because they can afford college no matter the price. I haven\u2019t really had many students in the middle so I don\u2019t really know what the system is. But I get the sense that it sucks. \n\nI had a close friend who, when we were applying for colleges years ago because I\u2019m old, got into WUSTL and UMich (honors college, in-state). And like she liked WUSTL better but there\u2019s no way it made financial sense and UMich (like all flagship state colleges) is a great school where you can get a great education. And that\u2019s what she got. She\u2019s a doctor now, and if she\u2019d go to WUSTL she pretty definitely would have also been a doctor. Like it didn\u2019t effect her life in any meaningful. Because the media landscape is made up disproportionately of the rich folks who\u2019d cheat to get their kids into USC without even thinking about cost, we\u2019re told to fetishize elite private schools over elite public schools. But in reality, for a lot a lot of students, in-state college makes the most sense by far\u2014the only thing that could change that is if their parents had a great deal of money or schools offered a great deal of aid. \n\nIt\u2019s just a bummer that we as a society pretend what school you go to is much more meritocratic than it is.",

I agree that in many cases, the best course for a student is to apply to cheap state schools. \n\nThe problem is most of those schools don\u2019t have essays and are easy to get into, thus leaving little need for a private consultant. \n\nThat\u2019s where it can seem more prudent to push a bright student to try their hand at endless elite private schools. Schools they can\u2019t afford. There\u2019s always that outside shot at aid coming through. But a 60k school at half tuition is still vastly more expensive than the state option. \n\nI try to be upfront about these pitfalls, but sometimes parents/students seem more interested in getting into a certain school than concerning themselves about what happens if they actually do.",

Price is such a volatile figure with merit aid and need aid and different financial backgrounds etc. Rankings need to go the rtings route and rank with no consideration for price and then it's each individual person's job to figure out their budget and prices and decide where to apply. Money-based rankings necessarily leave people in the dust thanks to the wide variety of aid offerings",

Price cannot and should not factor into a ranking, that should be on each student to \"mentally rejigger\" the rankings to suit their financial situation.\n\nI've read that article now and I want to comment on it because I think it's a fantastic article, but I think many people will have the wrong takeaway. I think it's important to separate criticism of rankings from criticism of use of rankings. That article has a lot of fantastic criticism on rankings and why they're flawed. Some people will take away that rankings are useless and you should completely ignore them. I do not agree. As the article says, rankings are a self-fulfilling prophesy. So whereas we need to criticize rankings so that they actually get better and we need to take rankings with a grain of salt because they're pretty bullshit, they're still useful measures of reputation because so much people pay attention to them that they're worth paying attention to. My rule of thumb is generally to assume that rankings can be off by about thirty spots so you shouldn't put stock on specific place in rankings, but it's worth looking at for general tier. And I'm generally more in favor of looking at rankings for your major than for the school overall.",
