      "text": "I scored a perfect 1600.\n\nGet Erica Meltzer\u2019s book. It is a life-saver.\n\nKhan Academy reading practice is also super helpful.\n\nMy main piece of advice: don\u2019t find the answer that\u2019s right; find the answer that isn\u2019t wrong. The SAT loves to trip you up with two, or even three, answer choices that seem correct. Embedded within three of the four answer choices is something wrong. Be sure to eliminate everything that\u2019s wrong. \n\nThe questions generally go in chronological order down the text, so keep that in mind.\n\nFor history passages, try and read complex history passages and try to understand them. Maybe look at DBQs on released history AP exams.",
