  "text": "So a month ago I got my August 28th SAT score report, which had the wrong grade level on it (12th instead of 11th). I immediately contacted CB to get this fixed, but all they did was keep promising to fix it and actually doing nothing (by the way, I am absolutely sure, that I chose the correct grade when I was registering for the test). So now I need to send my scores to the colleges. Will I have any problems if my score report has a wrong grade on it and what should I do?",
