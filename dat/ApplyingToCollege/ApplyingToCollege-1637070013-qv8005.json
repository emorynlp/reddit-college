  "title:": "When does financial aid get factored in?",
  "text": "This is purely out of curiosity, but when does someone's financial need get factored into their admission decision? From what I understand, financial need can make or break your application (for need-aware schools), especially if the school is expected to meet full demonstrated need. But when are AOs made aware of financial need? Do they know right off the bat and review your application knowing that you need aid? Or does financial aid come in after your application has been reviewed and they have some idea what your admission results are going to be?",

          "text": "That makes sense. I was thinking that maybe it could be something along the lines of having x number of students that they would otherwise admit if they didn't need financial aid but since they can't, they have to choose a select amount (I realize now though that's probably a very tedious + unnecessary process but didn't seem completely out of the realm of possibility).",
