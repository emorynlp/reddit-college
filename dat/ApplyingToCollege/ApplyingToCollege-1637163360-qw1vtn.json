  "title:": "Two application errors that I didn't notice, should I notify the University?",
  "text": "I accidentally listed an annual event (where I was a core team member in administration) as a \"writing position\" -- I'm kinda scared cause it's a really small part (it was listed along with 5 other relevant activities) of my Activities section but I didn't realise when I interchanged it, and I don't want the University thinking that I didn't care about it enough.\n\nAdditionally, I was already going to mail them about something that went wrong in the PDF of the app, it shows the \"??\" symbol at two places, but in the original thing I submitted, I hadn't noticed this technical error. I'm guessing it occurred due to some extension I had downloaded to re-phrase incorrect sentences, it didn't show in the previous preview originally until I rechecked the app without it again.\n\nWhat do I do? Do I keep mum about it? I'm actually worried they'll think that I didn't care enough, I swear I checked each essay around 50 times before I submitted it, please help.",
