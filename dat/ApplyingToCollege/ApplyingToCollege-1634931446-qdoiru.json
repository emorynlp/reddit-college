  "text": "Some of my school activities are not currently listed on my transcript, or they start later in the year and do not yet appear on my transcript. I may apply early action to some colleges before my transcript is able to be updated, so is it ok to include these activities on common app for Grade 12 when applying to colleges since I expect to do them/for them to show up on my transcript later, or should I leave them out of my apps until later?",
