Great merit scholarships for OOS students, beautiful campus, and really nice people.\n\n[*https://www.jmu.edu/academics/undergraduate/majors/independent-scholars.shtml*](https://www.jmu.edu/academics/undergraduate/majors/independent-scholars.shtml)\n\nI'd also look into some liberal arts colleges like **Haverford,** which doesn't have an undergrad school like Gallatin, but does have programs and structuring and advising for students who want to create their own major.\n\n[*https://www.haverford.edu/registrar/major-declaration-process*](https://www.haverford.edu/registrar/major-declaration-process)",
