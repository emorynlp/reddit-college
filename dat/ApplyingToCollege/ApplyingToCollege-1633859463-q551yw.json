  "text": "I think I have misophonia. During quarantine my siblings were home and we combined our rooms because we didn\u2019t have enough space in our house. Because of the noise, I couldn\u2019t focus and found the solution to be waking up as early as 3 am each morning. However, my misophonia is not professionally diagnosed. How should I word this? Should I even mention it? I want to mention this because it definitely is something that affected my academic, EC performance. I\u2019m kinda sure I have misophonia because I would literally cry if I heard pen clicking etc. as it drove me crazy. But because it\u2019s not professionally diagnosed I was contemplating on whether should I mention it. Any help is appreciated, thanks in advance.",
