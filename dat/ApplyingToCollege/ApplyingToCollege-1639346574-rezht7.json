  "title:": "Do I need to petition to IU kelley, and what does this message mean on their admissions criteria?",
  "text": "My UW gpa is a 3.87, and my sat is 1520 superscore which makes me feel as if I don't need to worry about a petition. However, the admissions criteria says you must have \"**Earned a cumulative GPA of 3.8 on a 4.0 scale in high school. We will use the highest GPA that is sent to IU Admissions from your official high school transcript. In most cases this is the weighted GPA.**\" My weighted gpa is a 4.6 out of a 6.0 scale. Will that gpa qualify me for auto admit if they are using the weighted instead of the unweighted like they say? For some reason someone at my school said you need to have a 4.7 to qualify for auto admit, which I don't have. I have no idea if they were just making stuff up or if that is what I need to qualify. I just need to know if I need to petition or not. I'm not sure why IU doesn't make a bit clearer as to what they mean by the highest gpa, but its whatever. Thanks!",
