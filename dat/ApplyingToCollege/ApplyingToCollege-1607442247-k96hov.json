  "title:": "T10 Schools as Teen Movie/TV Archetypes",
  "text": "Zoom school boredom strikes again. Without further ado, here are the official character bios/backstories of each of the T10 (ish) schools as teen movie/TV archetypes. Clearly these are gospel truth and should be taken 100% at face value. Sorry I don't make the rules.\n\n**Harvard:**\n\n* The Queen Bee. The closest thing you'll get to Regina George in this town. She's been \"the most popular girl\" at school since, what, elementary school? Kindergarten? Since time immemorial? It's basically just an endless self-fulfilling prophecy at this point. Her family's the richest in town, and she isn't afraid to let you know it. A reliable contender for Homecoming Court every year. Admittedly, she's also pretty smart. Always travels in a pack with her two friends Yale and Princeton -- you probably just know them as the Plastics. Everyone else looks on with a mixture of envy and disdain.\n* *Senior Superlative: Most Popular*\n\n**Stanford:**\n\n* The stereotypical, popular \"golden boy\" with a California tan. Captain of the swim team and president of National Honor Society. He doesn't buy into the old-school social hierarchy nonsense (Plastics who?), and if we're honest, he's probably a bit more popular than even Harvard (who, as much as she doesn't want to admit it, sometimes gets jealous). Cool and unbothered on the outside, but his whole arc next season is about how he's actually an anxious, insecure wreck on the inside. Also comes from wealth, but has a part-time job at Taco Bell... 'cause he likes the architecture.\n* *Senior Superlative: Most Likely to Succeed*\n\n**Yale:**\n\n* Harvard's slightly more chill, more liberal best friend/arch-rival. Often gets compared to Harvard, but doesn't actually mind it because she ends up looking less pretentious in comparison anyways. But don't be mistaken, she's still undeniably part of the country club set, and her parents are the town's high-power attorneys. Has a slightly artsier streak than her two besties (she has a musical number in every season). Always has really smart and insightful things to say in class. Loves to look aesthetic while reading a book under a tree.\n* *Senior Superlative: Most Likely to Become President*\n\n**Princeton:**\n\n* Harvard and Yale's slightly snobbier, WASPier friend. Captain of the women's golf team. Her parents chair the town's country club, and she can often be seen eating her meals and lounging at the clubhouse. She probably gets a bit less attention in the midst of Harvard and Yale's more infamous long-standing rivalry, but most would begrudgingly agree that she's probably the smartest of the three. Favorite colors are orange and black, so naturally Halloween's her favorite holiday (she dresses up as a sexy tiger every single year, don't ask about it).\n* *Senior Superlative: Best Dressed*\n\n**Columbia:**\n\n* Also part of the old money/country club set, but with an edge. President of the chess club (rumor has it Queen's Gambit was partly based on her). Has an \"urban\" flair, thanks to the fact that her family's got deep roots in New York City -- and she will *not* let you forget that about her, ever. Sometimes hangs out with her old-school pals Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, but also sort of does her own thing and can kind of be a bit intimidating and aloof -- she's *cool,* goddammit! A hard worker who studies her ass off, and can usually be found in the library. Slightly neurotic. Probably has an undiagnosed Adderall and/or coke addiction.\n* *Senior Superlative: Biggest Overachiever*\n\n**MIT:**\n\n* Basically Jimmy Neutron in the flesh. Math and science whiz, with a reckless streak. Well-liked because he's so unabashedly nerdy while also maybe kind of being a badass? Last season, he somehow got a schoolbus on top of the school cafeteria roof and almost got expelled (unsurprisingly, he's organizing this season's senior class prank). The classic tech genius who always swoops in to save the day with a line of code and some \"hacker\" magic a la CSI. Probably a pothead to help cope with his absurd IQ. Lives next door to Harvard. They're cordial.\n* *Senior Superlative: Biggest Techie*\n\n**UChicago:**\n\n* Your classic ugly-duckling-turned-swan story. President of the econ club, ex-president of the anime club. A couple of seasons ago, she was sort of a background character, but she's gotten a huge makeover since, and is now a season regular as a solid member of the \"popular\" crew. Always makes absolute sure you can see the huge-ass Ayn Rand book she lugs around everywhere. Used to be even quirkier, but she's mellowed out a bit since her pre-makeover days. Smart as hell, and also a tad neurotic like her friend Columbia. Lives in the same neighborhood as Northwestern, her childhood bestie. Main mode of communication is leaving shit tons of notes in everyone's lockers.\n* *Senior Superlative: Most Changed Since Freshman Year*\n\n**Northwestern:**\n\n* The friendly girl-next-door type who's super smart, super nice, and *kinda* does everything. Think Betty Cooper from Riverdale. Or Emma Stone in like every other movie. Editor-in-chief of the school newspaper and captain of the women's lacrosse team, but is *also* first chair in orchestra, is in the school play (catch her acting opposite Yale), *and* competes in Science Olympiad?! If anything, she has range. People never expect it since they're polar opposites, but she and UChicago are actually still really close and can sometimes be seen studying together at the neighborhood cafe (when she isn't at one of Duke's parties getting white girl wasted).\n* *Senior Superlative: Best Smile*\n\n**Duke:**\n\n* Star player on the basketball team. Also captain of the men's lacrosse team. Unironically has an undying love for salmon colored shorts. His family is part of the same country club as Princeton, so the two of them can sometimes be seen hanging out together at the clubhouse, looking down on the poors. Wicked sharp but, unsurprisingly, widely known as \"the douchebag\" around town. People let it slide though because he throws a killer house party (cue: red Solo cups). Dabbles in stocks and frequently exchanges Wall Street tips with UPenn.\n* *Senior Superlative: Life of the Party*\n\n**UPenn:**\n\n* The villain you love to hate and hate to love. The quintessential \"finance bro.\" That one kid who always brings a briefcase to class. President of FBLA. Has survived multiple seasons of being sidelined by some of his more popular friends -- but he's coming back with a redemption arc, with his eyes set firmly on Wall Street and/or bitcoin. Always talking about $$$ so people forget that he has other interests, too. Can also be reliably found partying it up with Duke and telling all the others to \"come thruu!\" in the groupchat. Frequently gets confused for a similarly named character from a completely different TV show, Penn State.\n* *Senior Superlative: Most Likely to Become a Millionaire First*\n\n**Johns Hopkins:**\n\n* The super intense hard worker who can often be found in the library with his nose buried in a textbook (rumor has it he sometimes rips out some of the pages in said textbooks in fits of frustration). The origin story? His parents are the hotshot doctors in town, so he's constantly feeling the pressure to live up to their expectations and their image of success one day. But neuroticism aside, the fruits of his labor show: he's secured the town's coveted research internship (Gwen Stacy, anyone?) and can frequently be seen cavorting around town in his lab coat.\n* *Senior Superlative: Most Likely to Cure* *~~Cancer~~* *COVID*\n\nWOW ok this took way longer than it should have. I dunno if anyone's actually gonna read this but if you've actually gotten through all of this props to you? I'm sorry this is just how I cope with all the news about schools getting larger pools of applicants this cycle. Also I hope none of this was offensive or anything lol this was all in good fun and these schools are all AMAZING and you all will reach your goals and dreams!!\n\nEDIT:\n\nAn additional parting thought... no need to speculate on who's attractive or who's not. True to the American teen genre, they're all inexplicably hot and probably have all hooked up with each other at some point, and are also 30 years old.",

His family is close family friends with Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia and UPenn -- but his family's a tiny bit less \"old money\" than the rest so they sometimes snicker behind Cornell's back, but who cares? Cornell's the more wholesome, least stuck-up of the pack, and *that's* why girls fawn over him. For spring break last season, Cornell opted for a more low-key lakeside cabin trip (probably invited his pal Dartmouth) while the rest of them planned a group trip to Europe on daddy's credit card.",

I can imagine UofO and OSU, or UW and Wasu as being twins who hate each other and try as hard as possible to avoid being identical. \n\nAlso, what would Georgetown be? The quiet, sorta mature kid who leads model UN and whose parents are high up in local government, who has an artsy side? Maybe he's a bit cloistered and doesn't make friends easily, partially because he appears unapproachable and people feel intimidated by his septolingualism but also because he's sort of convinced himself he can't make more friends and get his work done. So he's really loyal to his close circle of similarly global-minded friends but appears icy to everyone on the outside. Also, he's sorta quietly religious and old-fashioned in a way that isn't annoying but some people still find pretty weird. In this way, he's a foil to Notre Dame, who's really loud and proud about going to church every Sunday, giving way to a jocks v nerds rivalry. \n\nAlso, let's imagine all the schools in Boston as being in a family. Harvard is the eldest daughter, the family scion that the parents love and spent all their money on, while MIT got a computer instead of love and used that to become the school tech wiz, gaining affection and praise from her teachers that her parents never gave to her; so basically MIT has some weird Freudian stuff going on with the faculty, occasionally slipping and calling them \"mom\" or \"dad\". Northeastern is the middle child who used their hand-me-downs as capital to start a thriving used-clothing retailer to pay for everything herself, as opposed to relying on her parents like Harvard did. She has a bit of a complex around one day taking Harvard's place that MIT is trying to nudge her away from. Northeastern's an ambitious freshman, while her nine-month-younger twin brothers, Boston College and Boston University, kind of just hang with their friends.",
