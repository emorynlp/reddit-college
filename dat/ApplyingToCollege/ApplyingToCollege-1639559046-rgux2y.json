  "title:": "A letter to those waiting on Stanford REA from a freshman Stanford Student",
  "text": "I know exactly how all of you are feeling right now. On December 11, 2020, my life changed forever.\n\nThe 10 minutes before the decision came out I distracted myself in every way possible. I didn't go to school that day. I went to storage with my dad and helped set up for Christmas, etc. etc. I was watching \"The Lion King\" at 5:47 PM (Central time kid here), hoping to pass the time by. It only went by slower. Stanford was my dream school all of high school. Everyone knew I wanted to go. People at my high school would ask me \"when they were letting me know that I was accepted\" (this drove me crazy). It all seemed like a pipe dream until it wasn't.\n\nNow that I'm here, I do love it. There are some parts, though, that I would exchange. I don't think ANY university is perfect and don't let any university convince you otherwise. I was definitely convinced Stanford was some mecca of perfection. It is, in many ways, perfect for me. However, there are many days when I walk around and think about how, if I were to have been rejected, I would be perfectly fine. Going to TCU or UT Austin would have been just fine. I would be happy and loving life. I do sometimes think about how I would have to live with the fact of \"what if\" I had gotten into xyz, which thankfully I do not.\n\nAfter finishing my first quarter, I can tell you Stanford is a special place. However, it truly is the people that make it what it is. Sure, there are awesome resources and classes, but plenty of other universities offer similar things. I know you have heard it SO MANY times, but really, you will be happy no matter where you end up.\n\nHold on tight to those around you during these times. Never forget where you came from. Love your friends and love those around you. Support your friends. College applications is a scary time, but even now, I go to Stanford, and my life feels completely \"normal.\" I feel like just another kid going to college. Sometimes, I wish I was at a college here in Texas, with people I knew, and friends I knew I could go to who knew me well.\n\nI wish you all the best of luck. And I'm sure you've heard this plenty of times, but know that if you don't get in, then Stanford simply isn't the college for you. You will be so much happier somewhere else, where the people who know the values of the university see who you are for what you're worth and realize that.\n\nPLEASE, whatever happens tomorrow, take time to address your emotions. For some it will be the happiest day of their lives, and for many it will feel like one of the worst. Don't suppress these and share them. But, as someone who throws pity parties, I offer you this advice. Set a \"deadline\" for when your grief will stop. Then get up, and go do something you love. Hang out with people you love. These people are more important than any singular university will ever be.\n\nThat being said, if you have any questions or want any advice, feel free to leave some comments. I'll try to answer tomorrow. Best of luck, and I hope to see all of you around the farm one day.",
