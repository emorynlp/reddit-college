  "text": "I'm not sure how to quite word this, but soph year i got 3 B's, went pass fail, got all A's junior year, and now I already know I'll get 2 B's my first semester senior year. I wouldnt really say theres a trend in the classes i get my B's in, but its stressing me out considering i was on an upward trend but that stopped my first semester senior year. I know colleges send in mid year reports to report my semester 1 grades, so how much will it affect me :/",
