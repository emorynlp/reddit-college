  "text": "I applied EA to a T20 school that had a 1 November deadline. \n\nOne of my activities was \"Co-author of a research paper submitted to X journal\"\n\nJust yesterday, I found out that my paper has been accepted! So, should I call them up and tell them to change the word from \"submitted\" to \"accepted\" OR should I just leave it for the LOCI (because I most probably will be deferred I guess)? \n\nOne other very crucial info I forgot to mention in the description of the activity is that I did this research in collaboration with the primary space org of my country (basically NASA but for MY country). Should I call them and tell them to add this info too?\n\nOh and just for context- I very highly doubt I'll be doing any additional stuff now that my exams are close so I probably won't have anything to write on the LOCI.",
