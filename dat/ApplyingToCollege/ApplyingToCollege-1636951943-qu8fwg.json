  "title:": "If I have decided to take a gap year, but already sent in my application, do I have to write a new essay for next year?",
  "text": "Basically what the title says. I've already sent in my college application to colleges I'm interested in, but I have decided that it would be extremely beneficial to me (both mentally and educationally) if I take a gap year. \n\nI'm not particularly good at writing essays, and writing the one I turned in took a while. So I would like to avoid writing a new one by all means. Would I have to write a completely new one if I apply for next year instead or can I just resubmit my application with the same essay?",

Full disclosure though, I'm applying as a music major and along with my application I need to audition. Would my audition still be included with the deferment? I'd understand if this is out of your knowledge since it's kind of a specific question.",

You could also ask colleges now if deferment is something they allow.",
