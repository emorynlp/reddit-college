  "title:": "I'm in my first semester as an assistant professor in STEM at a \"selective private college.\" I'm genuinely curious about what your experiences searching for/applying to colleges are like and how professors can make the process easier/more interesting/better.",
  "text": "This is a throw-away account and I am also keeping it vague to keep with community rules. \n\nFirst off, I am extraordinarily inspired by this vibrant community dedicated to succeeding in college and beyond. As a college professor who might end up facing you across the classroom in your first college course next year, I am really impressed already. You are all amazing and I am 100% certain that each one of you will thrive at whatever university is lucky enough to get you. Make sure to relax a little bit throughout this process though, I promise each and every one of you will get through this, regardless of where you end up. For context, I went from a small state school for UG to an Ivy for my postdoctoral training. Where you start is a lot less important than what you do when you get there.  \n\nI'm in my first semester as an assistant professor in STEM at a \"selective private college.\" I have been asked to help coordinate an open house for potential students for my college. Fundamentally, I want to provide these potential students with the useful information/experiences they need to guide their application decisions. To help guide the development of this program, I decided to do some of my own research on the modern college application process.\n\nI have realized that the college search/application process is completely different than when I went through it (late 2000s) and I'm genuinely fascinated by the differences. Social media was in its infancy (facebook only), colleges were not super internet savvy (so limited youtube presence and bare bones websites), and the primary informational method was to get dozens of college mailers everyday from admissions departments. Those fliers were how I learned about colleges and open houses. I can only assume it is different now. Believe it or not, the admissions process can be opaque on the professor side as well. We do open houses and tours, but outside of that, our incoming undergrad classes just kind of show up. It is very different on the doctoral student side though.\n\nWhile attempting to get informed on the undergraduate process now, I came across this subreddit, read some of the posts, and realized that you all are the savviest folks on the planet when it comes to the college search / application process. The amount you have thought and planned around your applications is frankly astounding. \n\nI'd love to flip the script and go back to being a student so I can learn from all of you:\n\n1. What is it like to search for and apply to colleges right now? Feel free to vent if needed, lol. \n2. What caused you, during your search/application process, to attend an open house?\n3. What can I do at this open house to provide tangible, actionable information to potential students in order to help them make a decision whether or not to apply? (I am not interested in doing a \"hard sell\" for the school. I will actually need to teach these students. I'd hate to have a bunch of pissed off students in my classes for the next four years.)\n4. Where do students typically get information on colleges? Are guidance counselors still a thing? Is it all social media? Do you still get mail? \n5. What makes you consider applying to a college? Is it all about the rankings? Do individual professors factor into your decisions to apply/attend a specific school? I have seen a ton of the \"T\" ranking lists on here and then complaints about lack of swag on tours.  \n6. Is there anything different about STEM degree programs vs other disciplines when it comes to the decision making process?\n7. What can faculty do to engage wonderful students like all of you during the process and get you interested in attending our specific universities? If you spent this much time and effort do research to get into college, I can only imagine how good of an undergraduate research assistant you would be in a lab. Seriously, you all are amazing. \n8. Generally, how professors can make the college admissions process easier/more interesting/better overall?\n9. Anything else you think a new prof should think about?\n\nI apologize for the wall of text, feel free to answer any, all, or none of my questions. Lurking on this subreddit the past few days has really opened my eyes to how much I don't know about how this generation of potential students interact with universities during the application process. \n\nBest of luck with your applications, take a deep breath, you are all going to do great. \n\nTLDR: I'm a new prof. The folks on this subreddit are going to amazingly in college. You all know a lot more about the college search/application process than I do. Please answer a few of my questions about the process. Or don't. You aren't in my college class.",

(25th/50th/75th percentile)\n\nI'd want \"like me\" defined in terms of residency status (in-state/out-of-state/international), normalized wGPA, test scores and intended major.  For the \"how much do they pay\" question, include FAFSA EFC.  If the school is need-aware for admissions, then include EFC in the \"how likely am I to be admitted\" analysis as well.  Have a second set of tables for students who don't submit test scores.  Exclude athletes, legacies, children of faculty, etc. when building the tables.",

              "text": "Good luck.  :)  I'm suspect it won't be available.  At least, not at the level of detail I'd want.  My complaint with \"the system\" is how difficult it is to assess one's odds of admission and/or expected cost given all the relevant variables.  Financial aid, competitive merit scholarships, differences in the applicant pools to different majors, etc.  Also \"best case\" cost (as opposed to \"expected\") given some schools have large, competitive non-need-based scholarships.\n\nMy goal would be for each school to provide a web page where interested applicants can plug in their characteristics and get back an acceptance odds estimate and 25th/50th/75th percentile cost estimate \\*after\\* all financial and/or merit aid is assessed.\n\nSuppose  I'm a Michigan resident with an EFC of $80k/year, a 1400 SAT and a 4.4 normalized wGPA who wants to major in History.  What are my odds of getting into Michigan given I'm in-state?   What about Harvard?  What about UNC-Chapel Hill, given I'm out-of-state?  What can I expect to pay at at each of these places?",

      "text": "I am the parent of a senior and I also work at a university. I am on both sides of this equation, participating in admissions/prospective student events as a staff member, as well as coaching my own kid through this process. I also have marketing experience, and that is where I see a lot of room for improvement in university outreach and engagement.\n\nOne thing I think is sorely lacking is the humanization of departments. Sure, anyone can hit the university website and read about major requirements, faculty lists, etc. What I really want to see, and what I think would help drive prospective student interest, is vibrant, interactive, UPDATED department website, blog, and social media. Yes, of course you'll continue to issue PRs and articles about research and new technological developments, but also humanize yourselves. Talk about your areas of interest. Make funny tiktok videos of your profs and GA/postdocs in the labs. Host brown baggers or open lunches with a rotating cast of faculty. Don't even make them lunch-n-learns because sometimes those are boring. Just throw out some free food and invite kids to hang. Really get to know your students, and allow them to really get to know you. Make your department accessible. Have a department discord, meme each other, have some good natured fun. Reach out interdepartmentally and co-host a STEM Olympics where faculty and students from departments compete in stuff like titrations, egg drops, etc. Have a Hogwarts house style STEM department thing where you all earn house points during the year and had a big party at the end. Have mini departmental job meet-and-greets where you bring in 3-5 quality employers in the region for an afternoon to have some personal 1:1 time with students. These are just some things off the top of my head, but if you put a real coordinated effort into marketing and public relations, you would have kids beating down your door to become your students. People need community, they like belonging, and they like fun. The academic stuff you do is already super interesting and cool, but the way it's presented to the public and to potential students is boring and stale. Show students that you take care of your people, both colleagues and students, and show them how much you value them by giving them quality events and experiences beyond the typical classroom and research academic experiences, and keep it all documented and interactive on social media. Be the whole package. There are already so many amazing colleges out there. Set yourself apart.\n\nTLDR; up your marketing game. Rearrange your departmental budget to hire a communications graduate student or someone who's savvy enough to make this happen for you.",

          "text": "This is a really thought provoking statement/question, re an early career professors involvement with recruitment. I have been mulling this over since you posted it and I hope I can provide a cohesive answer. \n\nThe entire \"Don't involve yourself with anything (including student recruitment) unless it relates to tenure\" is certainly a common view in higher education. While I get it, I think it results in a few issues for individual programs and higher education, generally. \n\nFirst, early career professors are often the most energetic and excited among the faculty ranks. They also have the most recent experience with how things are done at other Universities. If you wait until you get tenure, I think there is substantial risk that you just accept the status quo and nothing changes. I became a professor because I am interested in training the next generation of engineers and scientists to have the technical skills to solve large problems in society while also ensuring that it is done in a manner that helps the most marginalized in our society. Part of that is getting involved in student recruitment. I don't really want to wait until I get tenure to start doing that. \n\nSecond, faculty are really central to the educational mission of a University. We are the ones who are delivering the educational curriculum, advising student orgs, writing reference letters, employing students in our labs, among many other things. I find it somewhat concerning that there all these students on this subreddit that are trying to parse through admissions materials to figure out what schools make someone competitive for medical school or PhD programs or great job placements. Professors are the ones who are writing letters for postgrad study and serving as references for jobs. A lot of times we know this stuff better than admissions. Wouldn't it be easier if we could figure out how to more effectively communicate what you all are stressing about? I'd much rather provide an experience that will streamline this process for all of you. \n\nThird, as an engineering professor, I teach \"User-centered design\" in my engineering design courses. Data on user needs are fundamental to this process. In the grand scheme of things, admissions is not the user (or customer) for an open house, you all are/will be. Engineering is about developing solutions to important problems. One needs data on the problem for future users in order to solve them. I love the fact I got responses from both parents and prospective students on this thread. Although this is obviously a skewed sample (high achieving students who seem to really, really care about college), it is still incredibly helpful and provides more info that I would have in the first place. \n\nFourth, this is was super easy to write and I honestly find the process fascinating. I became an academic to have the freedom to investigate interesting stuff. If that includes trying to tinker with an open house to make it most useful to potential students, all the better!\n\nIt honestly was more time consuming to think through your question (it was a good one!) than to compose the original post. Thank you for posing it!",

Very few professors have a passion for recruitment at the undergrad level, so it's a need that is waiting to be filled.  Bravo for taking this on.  \n\nI don't know what college you are at.  But I know that many colleges drastically undervalue service when it comes to awarding tenure.  I have witnessed tenure denials from folks who have thrown themselves into the community.  When that happens, the bitterness that the faculty member feels sometimes drives them completely out of academia for good.  \n\nIt sounds like you have a drive and a passion, and no one should try to dampen that.  But I would advise (knowing nothing about your specifics, so take it with a grain of salt) that you be careful, and that you pay very close attention to any \"red flag\" comments (however kindly worded) you get during your 3rd year review.",

      "text": "(HS Senior here. Sorry for the wall of text, I'm not good at brevity lmao.)\n\n1. Honestly, it's hard. There's a ton of schools out there, and for the most part, they all are more similar than they are different. I haven't really had the opportunity to visit out of state schools yet, so it's really been a matter of looking at virtual tours, other zoom events, websites, reading A2C posts here, and figuring out what I think I  might like and value in a school. At first when I started the search, I was pretty sure that I wanted to major in aerospace/aeronautical engineering, which really helped narrow my list. I've since realized that while AE seems like it would be a good fit, MechE, EE, or some other kind of engineering like nuclear might also be as good or better for me, so I kinda had to go back to square one and re-evaluate schools. Most schools have pretty decent marketing that (obviously) focuses on the positives. Co-op programs, financial aid, undergrad research opportunities, campus location, class size, etc etc. Everywhere sounds like a great school, at least on the surface. It's hard to figure out what the negatives of a school are from their marketing. For example, Stanford doesn't advertise that the dorms don't have A/C, which isn't a deal breaker for me, but is still a notable characteristic. Getting a list together is probably the easier, more fun part of the process though. I find that applying, especially writing essays, is somewhat stressful since it's so subjective. More worrisome is not really knowing how expensive college will be. Sure, net price calculators are helpful, but they're only rough estimates. It can also be a hard pill to swallow when a school says they'll only discount their $80k tuition by $10k...\n2. I've only done a few virtual open house type events (again, haven't gotten to do much in person stuff yet, unfortunately). The online stuff often covers information found elsewhere, which isn't super helpful. The actual students discussing their experience at the school is the most interesting imo.\n3. What is the school actually like to attend? I'd like more on the day to day life, what opportunities there are (including undergrad research, co-ops, internships, interdisciplinary stuff, etc.). What makes your school different from your peer schools? Can I afford it? How difficult is applying? (think LORs, personal essay, writing supps, transcripts, test scores, HS course requirements, etc. For a highly selective school, the main difference will be the writing supps. For example, MIT has like, 5 or 6 required short essays/paragraphs. Hopkins only has two (albeit longer) essays.)\n4. Social media, guidance counselors, emails (so many), snail mail (also a lot), word of mouth, discussing with classmates/family, etc. As for mail, I've received a stack >1' tall. Half of the stuff is from schools I'm not interested in just based on location alone or some other definitive aspect (like being super religious sounding). The cool mail is the more unique stuff - Hopkins sent me a small notebook, for example. Anything bulky usually gets my attention, while a normal letter usually goes straight into my pile, unopened.\n5. It's a mix of everything. Rankings, perceived prestige, location, programs, advertisements, family/friends that went there, sports teams even. Oh, and \\*Cost\\*.\n6. Yes, I think so. Internship/co-op opportunities, especially with places of interest. For example, University of New Mexico sent me an email about a Sandia NL internship \\*and\\* good merit scholarships. They've been the only school that has actually gotten me to apply from their mail, not from my research. I also want the option to have a more liberal artsy interdisciplinary college experience, with freedom to take fun/interesting classes not related to my major/STEM. Most private schools are pretty open to this though. Research will also be important to STEM majors, especially if there are some undergrad opportunities. But even just having cutting edge research separate from undergrad will improve my perception of a STEM dept imo.\n7. Unfortunately I haven't had much interaction with faculty yet, so I'm not sure. Caring about potential applicants (as you're doing now!) is probably a great first step. Also, explaining some research-y/complex things in a non-intimidating way.\n8. Talk about specific research. I'd love to know more about some smaller research projects, ones that don't end up in my google news feed. Things that might be in an ISEF finalist's abstract - easy enough for a HS kid to understand broadly, but not dead basic either. How did your department improve PV deposition consistency? Show off some cool lab tech. What cool things has your university done with an electron microscope? How do mass spectrometers work? Leverage the curiosity of your potential applicants. Show off a cool science-y fact. I saw a video a few weeks ago where someone took a syringe and capped off the end. He then weighed it with the plunger pushed all the way in, and again with the plunger pulled most of the way out such that the inside was under vacuum. Was there a weight difference? Maybe it was obvious to you, but to most HS kids like me, I bet you'd get a reaction. Or maybe not, maybe you'd just impress me.",

AE is great, however, almost any kind of engineering will assist you in getting into that career. In my opinion, the most important thing is what are faculty working on in your future school. If a ME prof has a number of NASA/DoD grants pertaining to mechanical analysis of new wing designs, working with that prof as a ME might be more useful than doing a bunch of AE coursework without applicable research.  \n\nIf you have any questions I can answer, please let me know!",
