      "text": "You're working off some faulty thinking here. Yes, you need hours, a high MCAT, ECs, and strong grades in pre-reqs classes to be competitive to med school. But an undergraduate school doesn't and can't guarantee any of that. They simply offer the pre-req classes; you have to do everything else outside of class time. So pick a school that has the pre-reqs (so, practically any), that's AFFORDABLE, and that has a pre-health advising center. The rest of your success is based on you, not the school.",

Premed is a slog no matter where you go, so find a school where you're happy and fit the culture well because you as well be in a good environment while you're grinding",

      "text": "U will not get in to a US med school if u are international lol. Unless u win some Nobel prize. US med schools usually only accept domestic students since it takes a lot of resources to educate physicians. Nearly a million dollars for each med school student. Even those ones that claim they do accept international students rarely do so, maybe if u get a near perfect MCAT maybe it could work, but highly highly unlikely. Sorry, but that\u2019s reality. Better off if u go to med school in ur own country, take the USMLE and come to the US as a licensed physician.",
