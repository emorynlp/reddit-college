  "text": "Title\n\nJust got deferred from Stanford (my dream school) and I'm surprisingly not sad. \n\nInstead I feel motivated and even more determined to work hard and prove to not just Stanford but every college I am applying for how great I am. \n\nI just have no direction now, but I'll claw my way to getting accepted one way or another. \n\nGood luck to everybody applying in RD.\n\nAlso, if you haven't been told this, I am proud of you and proud of how far you came to even be able to be in the position to apply for college. You've worked hard and everything happens for a reason.",
