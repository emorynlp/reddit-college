  "text": "I'm so damn confused cus every single college hides their submission policies behind \"We're test-optional !!\" \n\nIf a school says they superscore do I have to submit all of my scores (even though my score isn't based on superscore).  Or should I only submit my best score?  Should I just stick to submitting all of my scores for schools?\n\nFor example, CMU says [this](https://imgur.com/a/mfEwRbF) which unless I'm dumb is useless",

Schools are actually quite good at greater than, less than, and adding two numbers.\n\nCMU requires all of your scores, but that is well hidden. Along with the \u201cwe\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll get dumber after Sopohomore year, so we don\u2019t want those scores\u201d, and \u201cno ED if you\u2019re 16\u201c, they\u2019re up with Georgetown at the top of the p.i.t.a. admissions processes",

Now I can only find the all scores requirement in the PDF guide [https://www.cmu.edu/sites/default/files/pzh-nqzvffvba/2021-09/cmu-application-instructions.pdf](https://www.cmu.edu/sites/default/files/pzh-nqzvffvba/2021-09/cmu-application-instructions.pdf) (top of page 4). I swore the requirement was also on the website somewhere, but I can no longer find it.  Anyway, that makes the choice easy, just submit all to CMU.\n\nGeorgetown is the only other one requiring all. So, use Score Choice - or self-report in the app for schools that allow it - for the rest of your schools.",
