  "text": "\\^I didn't explain myself properly in my last post, but basically I got 11th in an international competition where the 10th person was found to have illegally submitted two entries. \n\nThis was confirmed by the hosts, but they didn't bother to delete that person's entry. Should I put 10th?",
