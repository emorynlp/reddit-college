This isn't even counting the ridiculously mathy algorithms sequence and theoretical cs stuff. While it's true that a lot of the math wouldn't normally come up in an actual job, it's not like you can get away with not using mathematical reasoning in coding in general (you could reasonably make the argument that cs is a branch of math anyways). Don't you think it's a little presumptuous to make blanket statements like that as a HS junior? Your job sounds cool, but it's not a particularly good look to assume that you understand the entire landscape of CS based on that...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>There is no way you\u2019re a undergrad student in CMU and are unable to realize that hardly any jobs have mathematics involved\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmachine learning ppl are shook.",

I can't speak for Dartmouth, but so far the CS at Brown has been incredible.\n\n* CS is the largest concentration at Brown, and most of the people I know are STEM concentrators of some form\n* Brown is a very undergraduate focused school, meaning the professors care as much about teaching as they do research and there are tons of resources and opportunities for undergrads\n* The professors are good at teaching, as I said above, but that doesn't mean they aren't extremely accomplished. My CS professor wrote both the languages he taught us with (DrRacket and Pyret) and another intro CS professor is Andy Van Dam. I'll let you look him up yourself, there's too much cool stuff to say\n* Going back to undergraduate opportunities, most classes have undergraduate TAs that run conference sections and grade work (while also getting paid) and there are always research opportunities open to undergraduates (I know several sophomores doing research right now)\n* Lastly, you can look up job placement and grad school results for CS concentrators at Brown. You'll notice a lot of people working at Microsoft, Google, Goldman Sachs, etc, and a very impressive list of grad schools (Brown being one of them of course, but also MIT, Harvard, Berkeley, etc)\n\nBasically, if you're thinking like I was and think you might be missing out by not going to a big tech school, trust me when I say you're not.",
