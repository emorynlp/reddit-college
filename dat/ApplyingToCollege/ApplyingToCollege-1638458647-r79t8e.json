              "text": "I should clarify. SAT scores matter a lot for schools and scholarships. Getting into a top school does not matter much. It matters a lot more when looking at graduate schools in your field, but for a general undergraduate education most of these schools are about the same with the largest difference being the type of students you see. I would definitely care about getting high test scores but I wouldn't worry about the 40% chance of getting into Michigan when the other universities in Michigan might accept you anyway, you know?",

They still struggle in entry level math classes like calculus 2 and differential equations because they don't study as hard for those classes. I personally didn't score a 1500+ on the SAT because I rushed through the test and made careless mistakes, but I didn't struggle like my peers in those math classes. The SAT math section only tests up to trigonometry and geometry so it's not really indicative if you'll do well in higher level math classes. Even if you did poorly on the SAT because you actually weren't good at math, you can always catch up and overtake others who stopped studying as hard.",
