I have received letters recently saying i got admitted into both. so admission is a check \u2714, thats why hass is off the table for ucb becausei didn't get in.  as for affordable i am super low income but when my grandmother passed she left a trustfund to me when I become 21. so when i said yes to both it wasn't speculation or overly confident. I am just trying to get different views form people that are interested in going to college, every one I know saying its a wast of time and money. sorry for the confusion.",
