Why do people want to go to college why then are making millions with their business? They're lying right?",

I\u2019m looking to (immigrate, first off\u2014the us is ridiculously strict on people without degrees or creds) find co-founders, network, find risks that you can\u2019t find in industry (being in the middle of research gives you an edge that few other places do), and be surrounded by people with similar ambitions. There\u2019s a massive amount of fakers out there, I give you that, but legitimate startup founders here care deeply about the things that they\u2019re building, and also see colleges as a means to an end. It\u2019s like applying to an accelerator\u2014but this time, it\u2019s for you, not your company. I\u2019m aggressively lower middle class here in the Toronto suburbs, too; college is a pretty good way to get out of the loop",
