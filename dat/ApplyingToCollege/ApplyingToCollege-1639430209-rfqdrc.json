  "title:": "Made two typos on my UC essays",
  "text": "So my first mistake was something like this: \u201cThe social anxiety I once carried around dissipated. after being asked to create more videos by classmates I hadn\u2019t even met before. \u201c\n\nSo a random period found it\u2019s way into the sentence (when you can clearly tell it\u2019s not supposed to be there, even the following word isn\u2019t capitalized) because one of my friends suggested it on docs and I didn\u2019t reject the suggestion \ud83d\ude00\n\nMy other mistake was something like this:\n\u201cThe nerves that I once shook me were gone, and in their place was excitement;\u201c \n\nI somehow missed this rogue \u201cI\u201d after reading this essay millions of times.\n\nSooo I guess what im wondering is if anyone knows whether these two mistakes will harm my application. UCLA and Berkeley are my top schools and I really tried to put my best foot forward with these essays (and I think the content of them is pretty good) but I don\u2019t want these mistakes to overshadow the rest of my application.",
