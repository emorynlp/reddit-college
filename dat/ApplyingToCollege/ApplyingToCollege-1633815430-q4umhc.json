  "title:": "Supplemental Essay Question",
  "text": "Hope everyone's college application process is going smoothly!\n\nI wanted to write a supplemental essay about an organization I'm volunteering in. It's already mentioned in my activities list in the Common App about details about the organization. Would I still need to give a background on the organization in my essay, especially if the main focus of the essay isn't necessarily about the organization but more about the lessons I learned from it? Thanks!",
