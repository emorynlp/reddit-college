  "text": "How tf does everyone have so many interesting things to talk about?? I can feel the dreaded UC deadline looming on the horizon and I'm desperately scrolling through my memories for literally ANYTHING to talk about and I... got nothin. I have no noteworthy accomplishments to brag about, no real talents, no passions or long-standing interests beyond sleeping and eating, zip zero nada. My parents are prestige simps but I know I'll never meet their expectations because I am the most boring 17 year old you will ever meet and I'm panicking holy shit what the hell am I doing with my life",
