  "text": "The website says the 15th, is that correct? In other places, I have seen it to be the 2nd Friday of December. Also, are they all released on the same day, or over a span of a couple of days. Lastly, is there any specific time (EST 8 pm/5pm PST)? Sorry if this is a dumb question to ask...\n\nThanks!",
