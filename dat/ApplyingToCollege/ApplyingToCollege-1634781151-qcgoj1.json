  "text": "I'm most likely applying to Stanford(REA) and most UCs and CSUs and I was wondering what role my senior year grades play in the admissions process. Obviously 2nd semester senior grades serve no real purpose but I was wondering whether I should be trying to maintain all A's through 1st semester(My 1st semester grades come out early January) since if my colleges looked at those grades before making my admissions decisions it would be kinda important. Anybody have any info? Thanks in advance.",
