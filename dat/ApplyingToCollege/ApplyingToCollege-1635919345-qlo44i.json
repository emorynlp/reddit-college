  "text": "For most schools, there's a disclaimer indicating that your test scores won't be displayed on your version of the PDF. Here's an example: \n\n>This college has chosen not to include certain Common App answers in the PDF they receive for your application. As a result, the following answers will not be displayed on your PDF: SSN, ACT / SAT Tests, AP / IB / Cambridge / SAT Subject Tests\n\nPlease don't freak out if you don't see your test scores on the PDF. If you're concerned about it, you can check whether the university received your scores from their application portal. \n\nHave a nice day, and good luck with your applications!",
