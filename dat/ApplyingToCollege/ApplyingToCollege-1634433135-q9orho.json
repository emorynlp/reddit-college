  "text": "Trust me on this one. (but take it with a grain of salt like obvi if it's too expensive then don't) If you have to convince your parents to let your dorm in college or are trying to go far PLEASE do so. I go to a college near home and commute everyday single day and while I do like the school... I regret every single day not standing up to my parents and dorming somewhere else where I REALLY wanted to go. So..please don't make the same mistake as me and please go to the school that you feel is right for you. Good luck.",

If there's one thing I can't stand, it's parents creating a bazillion children they can't afford and then expecting the older siblings to do all the free childcare for the younger siblings by sacrificing their own childhood and youth. It bothers the hell out of me and I'm of a strong personal belief that if you can't give all your children an equal amount of care, then don't have them. Just provide a good life for the children you already have. I'm sorry for the rant haha!\n\nP.S: Ask your friend to apply to some elite colleges and liberal arts colleges that provide good financial aid that's far away. Too bad if her parents can't afford to hire somebody to look after the younger brothers and need the extra income she brings. That's on them.",
