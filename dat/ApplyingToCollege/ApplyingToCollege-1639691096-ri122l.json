  "text": "I realized that Tulane is literally my dream school and I\u2019ve demonstrated a lot of interest, my LORs are really strong but my grades aren\u2019t exactly amazing. If I don\u2019t get in there (decisions come next monday) I\u2019m not sure where I would want to attend. I\u2019ve already been accepted to my safeties and to UTampa with a 12k scholarships so at least I\u2019m going to college. Do you guys know any schools that have the same vibe as Tulane? Like emphasis on community service and good work and social life balance etc.",
