      "text": "If it\u2019s a textbox you don\u2019t have the choice for font usually. As to paragraphing, I would definitely say it is something to consider as it makes your writing more clear.\n\nWhen you can submit a pdf, definitely. Don\u2019t write your essay in comic sans for example. If you want you can look up a styleguide like APA or MLA which tell you what everything should be, but it\u2019s a LOT. Word has build in templates that stick to it so that can be useful. \n\nJust make sure it is readable and clear.",
