  "text": "Hello all. I had a few questions regarding high school transcripts on the common app.  \n\nDo I submit the transcript myself or do I have my counselor do it?   \n Also, the counselor button inviting the counselor on the Common App just asks for my transcript, but nothing else, right? I was confused because it said it asked for other official documents, but I am confused to what those might be. It mentioned something about school report, but I was wondering if that was just another name for transcript. I believe my counselor would want to know what documents she needs beforehand.  \n Also, the counselor will not have to write a letter of recommendation at all, they are just sending the transcript, right? I saw someone online saying that they did, so I was confused. The reason I am wondering is that my counselor is new this year and does not know me very well at all (my old one left).  \n\n\n Also, do the links expire for sending out a counselor link through the common app? Just in case my counselor does not see it immediately. \n\nthank you all",
