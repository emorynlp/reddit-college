  "text": "hey guys! I\u2019m looking for universities/colleges which superscore all three sections of the SAT (Reading, Writing, and Math separately). Usually colleges superscore EBRW and Math, but I\u2019ve fluctuating reading and the writing scores which if superscored might raise the whole EBRW score.\n\nI\u2019ve searched for such colleges but didn\u2019t find any. Please suggest/drop if yk. btw I\u2019m an international student applying for financial aid. Thank you!",
