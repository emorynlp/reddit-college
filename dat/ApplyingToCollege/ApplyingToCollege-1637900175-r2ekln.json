It feels like a scummed system because in my school my two best friends and I were in all the volunteering organizations as freshman and sophomores, there were barely any underclassmen besides us. Before COVID hit we ran blood drives, multiple holiday charity events, beach cleanups - almost everything we could possibly do in the club those years, totaling around 30 hours. Then Covid hit, and they inflated so much. For instance, the summer before sophomore year I independently volunteered 22 hours at a library, reading to kids and stuff. Felt very proud of myself for taking the initiative. Then covid hit and I did the same program the next two summers virtually, which was a literal game. Filling out a crossword puzzle was 1/15 activities and you got 22 volunteer hours with all 15 activities. The volunteering organizations held a clothing drive and I got 40 volunteer hours from that. My actual work spent in freshman/sophomore year is like 1/3 of my hours, the rest of which probably took \\~5 hours combined. Sorry for the rant lmao I'm just suffering from jealousy",
