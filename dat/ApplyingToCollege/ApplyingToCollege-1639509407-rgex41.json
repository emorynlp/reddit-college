  "text": "Hiya! Current college student, former A2C lurker here. Not sure if anyone will see this, but I remember applying to college not so long ago. Now that it's finally \"mid-December\" again, I thought I'd compile a few things I'd go back and tell my senior-year self in case anyone else needs to hear it. Here goes:\n\n\\- You're gonna be okay. I know everyone says this, and high school me thought it was total bs, but I'm here to tell them (and you) that you will be okay. Believe me when I say college app season was the worst period of my life, but this too shall pass.\n\n\\- Get off the internet. Yes, that includes this sub! I mean, stick around for Shitpost Wednesdays, but don't nervously lurk here if you're waiting for decisions. You've put in the work, now it's time for you to do something for yourself. Go outside, smell the air, get coffee with a friend, do something you love. You're alive, you've survived a global pandemic, and you are enough. Just breathe.\n\n\\- You're not obligated to tell anyone anything. Not your dream school, not your complete list, not your decisions. And no, you're not being rude for wanting to keep things to yourself, as long as you're polite about it.\n\n\\- It's time to grind, but don't freak out. If you do get that golden-ticket ED admission, a wholehearted congratulations. For the rest of us in the Early Decision Reject Club, it's okay. Make a list of reasons why you hate your ED school, print out your rejection letter, burn it (safely!), and get to work. Tweak your existing essays as much as you want, but be realistic: it's probably not productive or time-efficient to rewrite your entire personal statement from scratch. Think through what you have time to do and what you don't.\n\n\\- Don't give up hope. I thought the odds were stacked drastically against me for my dream school: RD, no \"hooks\" to speak of, an impossibly large applicant pool for a popular major, and even if I got in, not being able to afford tuition to a school with notoriously bad financial aid. But sometimes the odds are wrong, and here I am. It's not true that there's a specific checklist for admissions, so never assume something won't happen.",
