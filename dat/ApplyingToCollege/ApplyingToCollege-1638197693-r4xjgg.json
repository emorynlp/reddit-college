No valedictorian or salutatorian can ever take music courses, art courses, or any other unweighted electives because of the GPA reduction they present.

I got out of those situations, did a lot of healing, went to community college, got a 4.0, and transferred to my state's flagship (a T25 school) where I'm earning straight As and attending on full scholarship.\n\nDo your best in high school, of course, but remember to give yourself space and grace to be human, too. Sorry, that's the mom-friend in me coming out. I just see so many people stressing themselves practically to their breaking points on this sub, and I wish I could just let everyone know it's all gonna work out. I wish I'd had someone to tell me that years ago.",
