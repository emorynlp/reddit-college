  "text": "My parents are divorced. I live with my father in Ohio but my mother is a California resident. Im a 17 year old who wants to go to move to Cali because Ohio is just not it lol.\n\nIf I move to California to live with my mother before I turn 18 and get my drivers license during the process, is it possible for me to score an In-State tuition if I am applying to any UC schools?",

On the UCSD Q&A it says that the parent\u2019s residence of whom you live with is considered your residence if your under 18.",
