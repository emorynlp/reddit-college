  "text": "I maintain an excel sheet to keep list of the colleges sorted by their due date for my daughter but was trying to find if there is such list available which sorts the colleges in such order so that we can manage the stress better. I know colleges in Texas and CA have due dates of 11/30 or 12/1 and then next set of colleges have due data in jan first week and then few in feb..  is there any readymade list available which we can refer?",

I was referring to list like below to find good colleges and was thinking it could have been great if they were sorted by deadlines.  for example if application is due in jan or feb.. we can come back on them later and first attack on those which are due 11/30 or 12/1. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[college list](https://www.4icu.org/top-universities-north-america/)",

              "text": "Ultimately, you will need to check individual college websites. \n\nNote that random third-party websites (such as the one linked in another reply) can be outdated or inaccurate; a college's own admission website is the ultimate authority on a college's deadlines. (Re Common App specifically, as those deadlines are input by the colleges, inaccuracies are less frequent there.)\n\nFor UC and UT, most in-state students are aware of the deadlines. PSA, public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.",
