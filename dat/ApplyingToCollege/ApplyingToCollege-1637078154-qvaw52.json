  "text": "i'm answering a supplemental question for one of my schools: \"please finish each sentence in 75 characters or less so we can learn more about you\" \n\ni'm just wondering how formal our answers need to be? is it similar to our essays like how it should show personality but doesn't necessarily have to be super formal? idkkkkkkk it probably depends on the question but i'm assuming this is how you would answer the question above ?",
