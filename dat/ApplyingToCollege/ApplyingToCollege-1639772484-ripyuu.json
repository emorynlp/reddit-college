  "text": "Whatever I write feels too short, I suck so much at emails but appreciated their help a lot\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve said where I was accepted/committing and thanked them for their help/recommendations. What else can I say? \n\n(if there\u2019s anyone that applied last year that might\u2019ve told their teachers through email, anything would be really helpful!)",
