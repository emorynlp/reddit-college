Grinnell \nSince some unis have a minimum requirement so is 12k enough?its the max i can afford I don\u2019t want to get rejected because of this factor. Also tell some other good LAC\u2019s who will at least accept me (1440 sat, international student, good/average grades, Ec\u2019s and Essay)",

      "text": "They don't have minimums. Those ones are probably also need-aware. Keep in mind that 12k isn't quite enough to pay for room and board, so you are looking for schools that offer meet full need for internationals, or a merit scholarship that meets or exceeds full tuition.\n\nYour question of where to apply as an international student needing financial aid is an extremely common question.

              "text": "With 12k, you have almost enough to cover room and board (depends on the school, typically around 15k). You could try looking for schools that give large automatic merit scholarships (google that term) - these will be less selective large publics. It'll be tough, but possible to find one that might bring your costs down to 12k.",
