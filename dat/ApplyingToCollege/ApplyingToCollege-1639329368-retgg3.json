Have you actually done that, or are you just assuming that you won't get any aid\n\nIf you have done that, then your options are to\n\n1. Take out those loans (which you won't be able to do on your own, your parents would need to cosign)\n2. Go somewhere cheaper/go to CC and transfer \n3. Look into major merit scholarships from schools themselves ([https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/oddu24/my\\_story\\_why\\_you\\_yes\\_you\\_need\\_to\\_look\\_at\\_full/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/oddu24/my_story_why_you_yes_you_need_to_look_at_full/)) \n4.
