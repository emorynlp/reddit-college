  "title:": "Just submitted my ED application to Northwestern!!!!!!",
  "text": "I submitted my ED application to Northwestern about 2 days ago, and I wanted to write this post, but I did not know what to say. I am very proud that I felt so happy after I clicked the submit button since I am the first student that applied to the US in my school; indeed, it was not an easy experience, but it was worth it.\n\nAlso, I wanted to thank a student I knew from here that helped me; I couldn't do it without her help in the confusing parts of the application; I remember every time I asked for her help, she just always said, \"Sure\".\n\nPlease, shout out to u/Puzzleheaded_Cry3545",
