  "text": "As the title suggests, I am a senior now. All of my classes last year were AP or honors. I got an A in every class..\n\nNow as a senior again all my classes are ap or honors. but i ended my quarter with straight Bs. Thankfully, colleges can;t see quarter grades in my school but only semester. Grading in my school works in a way such that A+A=A, A+B=A, B+C=B, B+D=c and so on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ncan/will my early action colleges revoke my acceptance due to my semester gpa drop of 1?",
