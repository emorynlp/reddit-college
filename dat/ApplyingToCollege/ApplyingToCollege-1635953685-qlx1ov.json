  "text": "I don\u2019t really know what I was expecting. I got a 1220 last time without too much studying, so this time I tried to study for my next one. I got the exact same frickin score. Like god damn. My parents are gonna give me shit for this I know. I am just depressed man. Im going to get into a couple colleges, but I am not gonna get financial aid since my GPA is kinda low.",
