  "text": "Hello good people,\n\nI've just finished my first draft of the common app essay. I am satisfied with the idea but I don't think I did a good job while communicating them through words. So, I wanted an expert to look over my essay. I already tried collegevine and my parents & teachers don't really understand college applications. As I'm from a low-income background I only have a budget of around $12. Please suggest to me some good essay editing services under $12 that you've found satisfying. \n\nThanks in advance...",
