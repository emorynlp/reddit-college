  "text": "Last night, I got a Harvard interview request, but I live in a country without interviews. My question is: what does this mean? Does this mean that I have questionable qualities that they want additional information on? I've heard that it might be a good thing, but I'm wondering why it would be? Thanks in advance!",

          "text": "On Harvard's interview page, they have a country list for international applicant interviews. My country is not listed, which means that they don't have alumni available. None of the previous Harvard applicants from my country (even during COVID times) have gotten an interview as well. But in this case, an alumni living in another country but based in mine reached out to me for an interview, and I'm wondering what that might mean.",

I think it also applied for Malaysia as well.\n\nThis doesn't really apply for places like the US, UK or Canada where there are a lot of alums, but in your case (esp when there's no interview to be expected in your country) it seems like a good sign.",
