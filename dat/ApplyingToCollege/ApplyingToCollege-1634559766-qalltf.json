  "text": "I\u2019m planning on submitting my research to MIT as part of the research supplement, but the problem is on the application it asks for a reference. I don\u2019t really have contact with my research mentor anymore and I feel like I would be better off if I didn\u2019t add a reference. Is the recommendation optional? Would it come off the wrong way if I didn\u2019t have a letter of recommendation?",

      "text": "Might seem suspicious\u2014if you did work under mentor, they may wonder why you didn\u2019t include a LOR. They may wonder if you could be trying to take more credit for something than you actually did or had a poor relationship with the mentor for one reason or another. (If unexplained, that is)\n\nAt worst, they\u2019ll think you\u2019re trying to hide something. At best, it may weaken the strength of your supplement as a mentor LOR provides significant context that can vouch for the strength of your work.\n\nI think it is optional, though, as they have a check box that allows students who did independent work to show it off there. However, for highly significant pieces of work, it\u2019s nearly impossible to produce anything extremely high level without a mentor.",

No need to share if you don\u2019t want to - just curious as to if it\u2019s something you could be overthinking?\n\nI think there\u2019s a massive benefit because you can demonstrate what level your work was at, you can submit if it was submitted to competitions, if you presented at conferences/published, etc. The LOR provides a massive amount of context as well as there\u2019s a ton of variability regarding high school researchers, so it\u2019s incredibly valuable imo",
