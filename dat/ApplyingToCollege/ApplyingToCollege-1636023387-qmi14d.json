  "text": "A few of my friends have applied to schools mid October, and some even as late as Halloween. I\u2019ve seen them post acceptance emails already? Feeling out of the loop because I thought it took 6 weeks to get an admission decision lol! Does anyone know if that had to do with EA or RD? Like two of my friends applied to FAMU and Bowie State (both HBCU\u2019s) a week ago and have already received acceptance emails! I think it\u2019s so cool but I was just wondering if the turn around time is truly that quick for some schools",
