  "text": "Hi everyone! I applied to brown about a month ago. I sent my SAT scores in from collegeboard and reported them on the commonapp. but, when I'm on the brown portal, the scores don't show up anywhere. on all of my other portals, there's some proof of them. is this happening to anyone else? I want to make sure those are considered but im not sure if they have them or not. i also tried to email brown, but they dont confirm the receipt of test scores.\n\nand yes i do know this is super nitpicky i just want to make sure they have them\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy application portal says:  \n\"Test Optional\n\nYou may use your Brown Applicant Portal to [self-report test scores](https://apply.college.brown.edu/register/self-reported-scores) that were not included on your initial application. FAQs regarding our standardized testing policies can be found on our [website](https://admission.brown.edu/test-optional).\"\n\nDoes that mean that i'm test optional for them??",

              "text": "Well, that's pretty irritating.\n\nSo, Brown appears not to have a question in the app asking if you intend to apply test optional, and submitting scores means you want scores considered? You submitted via the app so you should be fine. (Can you tell that I don't trust the Common App)",
