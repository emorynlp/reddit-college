  "text": "**Music taste:** [The Sounds of Spotify Schools](https://open.spotify.com/user/thesoundsofspotifyschools?si=be7b2fe3fb174793) uses Spotify data to update playlists weekly with the most popular songs from every university campus with enough student accounts (the Brigham Young University ones are hilariously clean and feature several Christian hymns)\n\n**Attractiveness of the student body**: Most schools have admitted student Instagrams with photos of a few dozen to a hundred incoming students (predictably, expensive schools are usually the best).\n\n**Fight songs:** Notable mentions to UChicago for the most pretentious (entitled \"Themistocles, Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War\") and Georgia Tech for no less than nine instances of \"hell,\" two alcohol references, and one gambling reference.\n\nplease contribute more",
