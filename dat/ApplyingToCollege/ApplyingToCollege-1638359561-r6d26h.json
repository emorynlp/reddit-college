  "text": "So basically in my essay for Chinese University of Hong Kong I mentioned a program/activity there in my essay, which fits my interest in science projects. Turns out it is only for students coming from different universities. I'm applying for undergrad, so i made a mistake of mentioning it in my essay. Will I get rejected for that? Will that raise any doubts in me?",

      "text": "It'll probably give them the impression that you didn't don't your research very carefully. Although I don't know about the nature of the admissions process at that university, I imagine you wouldn't be outright rejected solely for that, but it certainly isn't going to help you.",
