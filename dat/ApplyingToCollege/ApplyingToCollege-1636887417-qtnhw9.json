  "text": "hi fellow applicants! i did a mistake on my common app in terms of my parents workplace. my mom is currently unemployed, but I misread the question and wrote her former workplace in common app application instead of simply choosing \u00abunemployed\u00bb. \n\nin css profile i did everything correctly so i\u2019m afraid when the info is not going to match it could hurt my application. should i contact the admissions or is this mistake only minor?",
