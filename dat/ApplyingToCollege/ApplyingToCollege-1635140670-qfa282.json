  "text": "Hi all- I have been thinking of enrolling as A non-degree seeking student at my local university for the winter 2022 quarter to take summer courses. \n\nI do a ton of ecs and full ib so I was wondering if I should even bother doing this. I was thinking about taking classes that just interest me like ethics, feminism, and/or intro to international relations. Basically courses that I can\u2019t cover at school.\n\nAre these courses manageable? Are they worth taking? Etc.\n\nFor context I\u2019m a junior hoping to go to a t10 on pre law track.",
