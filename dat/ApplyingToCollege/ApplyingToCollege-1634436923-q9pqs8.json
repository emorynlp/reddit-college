  "title:": "How will colleges look upon my history as a reddit/ discord moderator (assuming I talk about it in college apps)?",
  "text": " \n\nI know that colleges love extracurriculars and have a fair share of them myself but I don't really have a leadership positionin any IRL things. I do, however, spend a lot of time on reddit and am a reddit moderator of several thousand member plus subreddits. I am also a part time discord moderator but dont care much about that. I know colleges LOVE leaders n stuff and I'm the head moderator of one subreddit where we have to manage 30k users. I've been modding for like 1.5 years and we take our work very seriously. We had to deal with raids, coups, and bans so yeah its very stressful. I know some people have gotten into college for E-sports and starting online websites and stuff, so I do think that it is possible. What do you guys think?",
