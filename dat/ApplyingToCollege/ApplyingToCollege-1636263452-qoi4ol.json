  "text": "I got accepted to my second choice through auto admit and today I received a merit scholarship. I accepted scholarship even though I still haven\u2019t heard back from my first choice yet. Does accepting the scholarship mean I have chosen to go to that school? It\u2019s still one of my high choices so I don\u2019t mind but does that mean I\u2019m lucked out of having a choice for my top priority school? Sorry if this sounds dumb :/",
