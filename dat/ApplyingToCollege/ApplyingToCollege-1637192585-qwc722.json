  "text": "I have been thinking about working for 1 or 2 years then attending community college and then going to college or a music conservatory (this is because I want to study music with a concentration in voice/opera) for 2 or 3 years (depending on how my credits transfer) and going on to get my masters, the problem is that my dad said if I go to community college he wouldn\u2019t pay for books, other fees etc. and I\u2019m scared that people will judge me later on for going to school later in life. Any advice? Also, mind you this is just something I\u2019m currently thinking about, this isn\u2019t set in stone or anything",

      "text": "I got pressured into going to school instead of community college and j regret it. I\u2019ll tell you this I thought everyone would judge for doing community college but when u finally get to college NOBODY CARES they are all trying to find their way same as you but it\u2019s so much easier for ur schedule and health to simply\nDo community college. Don\u2019t feel scared of what others think it\u2019s really just HS\u2019ers that seem to judge until they grow up and realize it isn\u2019t like the movies \ud83d\ude02 go with your heart and your wallet",
