  "title:": "Help with supplementary materials for deferred ED",
  "text": "Long story short, I have been deferred from Cornell ED and postponed to the regular pool.\n\nTheir admissions committee emailed me stating that they recommend a Letter of Continued Interest (LOCI) and extra supplementary materials such as completed projects, research, test scores, extracurricular activities etc.\n\nThe thing is I am currently serving the military and all my test scores & grades are finalised (I graduated from HS almost 2 years ago), therefore I am unable to create any new supplementary materials for the AO's further consideration of my application. All I could think of is to submit my past research papers which has already reached the age of a toddler.\n\nWould my chances be lower for regular decision if I just submit a letter indicating my interest without any new supplementary materials? \n\nThanks in advance!\n\nP.S. I am International, Asian",
