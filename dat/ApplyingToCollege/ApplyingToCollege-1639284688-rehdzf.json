  "text": "So, my school predicted me a 97 for senior year (my school system scores out of 100). I asked them if they could reduce it because there's no way I'm scoring that high ( our school system decided to completely revamp the grading system this year and that has been a disaster so far) but unfortunately that was not possible. \n\nIf I do get admitted based on the 97 overall, can getting a grade somewhere in the 90+ but lower nineties be grounds for rescindment? (I'm looking at Georgia Tech, Purdue, UIUC, UCLA, UCB and UCSD and UWisc and hope to get a conditional offer from at least one of them)\n\nEDIT: I'm talking about going from a 4.0 predicted to an almost 3.3",

I have seen students drop 15-20% from predicted grades and still be okay but some lose merit scholarships.",
