(Taking into account location and student housing and climate and town) I feel like it\u2019s UCLA. \n\nSo many beautiful campuses out there are basically in the middle of nowhere (Cornell) or surrounded by just the worst immediate city environment (Berkeley, USC).\n\nWorst campus that I\u2019ve personally been to is Harvey Mudd (even though it\u2019s a good school that seems like it has a great student experience). That place looks like a collection of office buildings. I would also like to nominate UCSC for worst campus. It\u2019s full of some of the most beautiful nature of any campus, but it\u2019s so ridiculously spread out that it just feels socially dead, and the buildings are meh.\n\nOther campuses I was thinking of:\n\nDuke: beautiful buildings.\n\nUCSB: meh campus, but best climate, great college town, and it\u2019s literally on the beach. Some freshman dorms are literally 30 feet from the edge. \n\nCornell: there\u2019s a certain big-city imperial vibe that\u2019s impressive.",
