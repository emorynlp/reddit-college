According to the announcement website, the university plans to launch its summer program in 2021, start a graduate program in 2022, expand the graduate program in 2023 and establish the undergraduate college in 2024.\n\nThoughts? I'm honestly just surprised that with all the intellectuals they have, they weren't able to come up with a better name than University of Austin... when UT Austin exists.",

But about the name they chose:\n\nGaaaahhhh it always kills me to see people/companies go through so much time, effort, and money, just to give their project a shitty name. What a waste. \n\nNow they're going to struggle with branding and building up their reputation because everyone's going to confuse University of Austin with UT Austin.",
