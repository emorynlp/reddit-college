  "text": "Hello! I'm currently applying as a freshman in Ateneo De Manila University. I am reaaaalllyy hoping to get in. I finished my essay last night (and I hope to pass it tonight since I still have to ask for recomms) but I really don't feel confident about it because 1.) I feel like I didn't highlight much of my skills? 2.) It's quite long. The Admissions Office clarified that we don't have to worry if we exceeded the ideal 2-3 pages but I kind of really went off with the length on this one. :') If anyone's willing to critique / proofread my essay (on any aspect), it will really be appreciated and of great help! \ud83e\udd0e\n\nThank you so much :)",
