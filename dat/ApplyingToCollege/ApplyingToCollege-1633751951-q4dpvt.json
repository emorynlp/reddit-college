  "text": "As a preface before my take I just wanna say. I\u2019m not angry or anything, I\u2019m just tryna get my point across.\n\nAnd now for the point\u2026I feel like with stuff like this, it doesn\u2019t help by snitching to the higher ups as it\u2019s literally none of my business. Good for you, you conned the school system. Very unethical but hey it worked. However, it bugs me a lil how I who busted my ass for everything and more didnt even get me in the top 10%.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what I realized. This is life.\nIt opened my eyes and made me realize that \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter about: how smart you are, your gpa, or anything. ITS ABOUT WHOO YOU KNOW. It works in the real world too. Yea maybe you busted your ass off to get a job at xyz office. However someone you knew, knows the Vice President of the Company and boom he gets the job and you don\u2019t. This survivorship bias is bs. There are plenty of people who busted their ass off and are now poor and there\u2019s also plenty of people who fucked around in hs and is now successful (at least in terms of wealth). One takeaway or at least a lesson, as every experience has a lesson behind it, is that it doesn\u2019t matter what you do\u2026connections matter the most. Another example, Say you\u2019re applying to like idk Yale and know and worked with three professors in your field in high school and gets accepted . While someone else who busted their ass off in high school gets straight up rejected\n\nShould\u2019ve added more but I\u2019m sooo tired",
