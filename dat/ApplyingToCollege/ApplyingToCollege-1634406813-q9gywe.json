The funny thing is that they closed the old food places down right after they just finished construction on a new food building, which was not at all what promised during construction.

It made no sense too since the old food places seemed pretty recent when I arrived in 2019. I swear the Cal Poly SLO president is embezzling funds from constructions around the school; there is always one happening regardless if it is needed.",
