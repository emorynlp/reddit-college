  "text": "I\u2019m a senior rn, and my intended major in college is Physics. Being an international student, sat/act were huge struggles for me, but I do hold great passion for physics. I took chem, calc bc, physics 1&&em&&mech last year and got 5 5s; however I\u2019m not gonna submit standardized test scores this year, for a 32 is only gonna do me harm in my application. I\u2019ve got mixed opinions on ap scores. Some say they are worthy, but others say they hardly even matter(plus I self studied for both em and mech because they are not provided in our school online or in person, which is worse) Are they actually gonna be a huge boost for my application or should I just get depressed in the corner.",

The fact that you took 5 AP exams in 1 year (self-studying for 2 of them) and scored 5 on all of them, will show AOs that you CAN do the work in college, and will help make up for any potential deficiencies in ACT scoring and GPA.  It won't get you in, but it will keep you in the running while they look at your ECs and essays.",
