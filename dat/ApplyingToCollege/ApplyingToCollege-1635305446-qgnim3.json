  "text": "a few days ago i got addicted to [zooniverse.org](https://zooniverse.org) and doing stuff on there. right now i have 700+ classifications and am on track for 1k+ during the weekend at latest. since i started this a few days ago, would it be odd to put it on my ecs? like would the colleges think im just doing it as filler? most of the projects im doing are science/transcribing which isnt related to my major (theater).",
