  "text": "I\u2019m really confused about college/university majors for undergrad. \n\nDo I have to choose my major on my application? Is there a place on the common app where I write my major eg Biology or English literature for example \n\nI\u2019ve heard the phrase undecided major before. What does that mean? Can choose my major after having tried out subjects in university \n\nI find this very confusing. Any insight would really help!",

      "text": "Most colleges have you put prospective majors or academic interests. These aren't binding, and you can choose whatever major you want once you're actually in college. If you're applying to highly selective schools, it's best to have your prospective major(s) align with your extracurricular activities. \n\nSome colleges do have you actually choose a major or general area of study when applying. This usually happens when there's a certain group of majors that are in a separate school as opposed to the general arts and sciences school-- i.e. engineering school, business school, etc. For example, you might apply to Cornell's School of Hotel Administration or Columbia's School of Engineering. Look into individual colleges' websites to see how much flexibility you have -- you might still be able to switch out of the school you applied for.",

          "text": "Thanks for the reply\n\nOh right so in the academic section of Common app theres usually a question somewhat like \u2018What academic program at X interests you the most?\u2019 \nI can select something that may interest me but I can change it once I\u2019m in college and have to declare my actual major. Am I right in all that? \n\nNow how does it work once I get into college? Am I just trying out random subjects. Like English one day and maths the other until I find something I like?",

Some schools ask for information purposes.\n\nYou would need to check the school\u2018s website to see if they admit by major, by school, or  just to the university as a whole.",
