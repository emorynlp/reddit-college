          "text": "Prestige is a fake it till you make it concept though. And in a lot of prestige industry, perception is almost entirely based on word-of-mouth than it is based on factual data. Stanford is often included as a \"super-target\" for investment banking even though their undergraduate banking recruitment is middling and they don't send a lot of kids into banking; this is off the assumption that there is very little interest in investment banking coming out of Stanford so that's why their placement is so low. But all the evidence is really anecdotal; people are judging based off of their preconceived notions rather than any hard evidence. Meanwhile, UT Austin is often considered to be a semi-target even though it sends some of the most kids into banking, off of the fact it's a huge school and the perception that they have a lot more kids vying for each spot. But how true is that really? It's hard to say.\n\nSo it makes sense for NEU to do it. For school rankings and prestige, that's really all there is to it. If you think about it, they did it all the way into the T100, and then they did it to get into the T50. People will talk about if NEU deserves to be a T50, but the fact they're in the conversation at all if you ask me is a sign of their success.",

              "text": "My two cents is that NEU is definitely a self-fulfilling prophecy, in that it is a quality school with a lot to offer and honestly, in terms of long-term brand positioning, I think they have a much more unique angle and value proposition that a lot of similarly ranked schools lack. \n\nThat being said, the other side of the co-op coin IMO is that they rely heavily on co-ops because their alumni networks in prestigious fields just don't exist. From what I've seen, Northeastern kids don't compete for the traditional summer internships nearly as well as other T50s might. I'm sure they exist, but at the company I worked at (a unicorn), we didn't have a single NEU summer intern, but half of the co-ops I saw were NEU. Which made sense, because a lot of students who would otherwise be competition and take those seats literally can't during the school semester. I'd argue that the top prestigious schools don't really engage in co-ops because there's simply no need; in comparison, that might be the primary way in which NEU grads are getting their foot in the door at places like McKinsey or Bain for example. \n\nIf the school looks like a fit, I'd say go for it. But if it's because you just want to go to a T50 or something, I'd consider doing more researchand looking elsewhere first.",

Co-ops are there longer and likely are well positioned for return offers. Also, as you said, Northeastern students do co-op's over internships, so this is basically saying you had a ton of Northeastern interns right?",

                      "text": "Co-ops come at a heavy cost. Taking a year off of school delays your graduation period and lowers your lifetime earnings. A lot of people think it's only 1 year of salary, but also don't factor in that it's your *last year of salary*, not your first year of salary. So it's a huge cost to take. The NEU who wants to work at my firm probably would need to co-op into there, whereas other kids are interning and getting an immediate return offer. End result is the same except it was easier and took less work for the kid who didn't co-op into it. \n\nSecondly, not all companies have co-op spots and there aren't as many to go around. It's less of an issue if you're into tech, but think banking for example. There really isn't a co-op system, there's working part time and there's working an internship but none of the BBs AFAIK do part-time. \n\n\n> Also, as you said, Northeastern students do co-op's over internships, so this is basically saying you had a ton of Northeastern interns right?\n\nWe take less co-ops than we do interns and NEU students do compete for internships as well, they just don't get them as much (for prestigious places) because there are so many other top candidates competing. \n\nTo clarify, having these co-ops isn't a bad thing. I'm just pointing out that they rely so heavily on that and they recruit through those networks because they don't recruit well (in my experience, this isn't like based off some industry wide survey lol) through the traditional channels. Which tells me (bc I don't think they're bad or unqualified) that what they lack is alumni pull and good reputation from a private sector side. Which is a negative point for the university. Long-term, I can see them having enough pull through the alums they're creating now to recruit better through traditional avenues but as a current or soon to be college student, that's not really that helpful to you. [You can also look at their placement for business for example here](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DMSB_UndergraduateEmploymentReport_FNL_080520.pdf) and see how it's comparatively weak. Just 6.5% go into IB. That's super low, especially when you consider that a quarter of the school goes into business.",

                          "text": ">Co-ops come at a heavy cost.\n\nAs someone who did them, I fully disagree. First you're assuming a year missed, when you can do 4 years and 2 co-op's if that's important to you, which nullifies that entire qualm. But more than that, when you look at increased pay vs salary of a year, and then factor in how nest egg retirement models work, it really doesn't affect retirement timing at all. If you want we can get into the nitty gritty there, but before we do, you have to also look at the benefits of co-op.\n\nOne of the big draws is that co-op's are highly likely to get return offers, often more so than interns. You also gain a lot more experience with the extra time, and often bigger projects as a result within a single co-op, which is crucial for long term career building in many industries. You also get extended experience across more jobs than most schools often (e.g. 12-18 months work experience vs 3-6 usually) to figure out what you do and don't like in a job, which I think is very valuable for life satisfaction here as well. \n\nI could go into many smaller benefits, but it seems you have optimized here for one single number in a way that any small change nullifies a lot of other benefits.\n\n>The NEU who wants to work at my firm probably would need to co-op into there, whereas other kids are interning and getting an immediate return offer.  \n>  \n>We take less co-ops than we do interns and NEU students do compete for internships as well, they just don't get them as much (for prestigious places) because there are so many other top candidates competing.\n\nI think you're confusing prefer to vs don't. I think drawing that distinction is silly. If most are applying in as co-op's, I would suspect many more there than interns. Again, this all washes out I think and likely is a similar acceptance rate compared to similar prestige schools. And this is only looking at one top firm, which is also a specific dynamic to the business/finance world.\n\n>I'm just pointing out that they rely so heavily on that and they recruit through those networks because they don't recruit well (in my experience, this isn't like based off some industry wide survey lol) through the traditional channels. Which tells me (bc I don't think they're bad or unqualified) that what they lack is alumni pull and good reputation from a private sector side.\n\nIt really seems like you're getting wrapped up in pedantics. If the school's name or programs is getting you internships/co-ops and jobs full time, how in the world would this be a bad reputation? To me it seems pretty gate keepy finance world to call an extended internship a nontraditional channel when the shorter version is the primary channel. To me it seems like a better one, or at least equal, all leading to the same place...\n\nComing from the tech side where all this \"prestige\" and \"semi-target vs target\" stuff is just not applicable, I think you need to zoom out here and imagine how this scales over many majors.",

I came in with absolutely no Computer Science experience, in fact I actually came in to the university as a completely different major and switched to CS in my second year. Now normally this would be a really big issue for getting internships because you\u2019re competing with students in different universities who have been coding since high school. \n\nWith the northeastern co-op system aiding me, I was able to get a position which pays me 35/hr and looks great on resume. Currently interviewing with really big name companies for my next co-op cycle like microsoft and amazon, and already have a few offers at 55/hr and 56/hr. Let me remind you: this is with switching majors to CS just only 14 months ago.

      "text": "A bit late to the party but Northeastern grad here but there are some basic answers you're missing + a lot of nuance. So first, the basics on co-op's:\n\n1. Most schools only offer co-ops for engineering. Northeastern is one of the few schools to offer co-op's for all majors.\n2. Many schools have co-op programs, sure but few are used by students generally, and thus there is little institutional support. Northeastern offers a ton of support from a co-op intro class, a dedicated co-op advisor in addition to an academic advisor, and a huge database of employers that take co-op's every semester. They even have housing in major cities across the US for co-op students. At many schools, you're mostly on your own.\n3. At Northeastern, nearly every student does co-op, which leads to a lot of advantages when you structure the school around it. At schools that don't emphasize co-op, you're the exception to the rule and are often hitting blocks and issues when trying to set up a co-op when it comes to things like financial aid, scholarships, and even social relationships with your peers.\n4. Northeastern was one of the first schools to have co-op. The program is now over 100 years old, while many schools have it as an afterthought.\n5. It has one of the top rated career services department, in part due to the point above in this section. Again, who decides that etc is up for debate too!\n\nNow, for the more nuanced answers:\n\n>how did Northeastern go from \u201coh, co-ops, neato\u201d to \u201cbest co-ops in the whole world\u201d? Is this just word-of-mouth bias?\n\nIn part, 100% Northeastern's marketing. But marketing is not magic, and i would argue that Northeastern's rise was well timed with a bigger shift in the purpose of college for most attendees. Up until recent decades, you went to college as a privilege often for education alone. A career was mostly either not thought about and/or not a worry. \n\nOf late, most people go to college to get a job, which has made co-op much more valuable, helping Northeastern become more popular and thus more prestigious. Northeastern previously was often seen as a \"working class\" school because of its focus on career and \"trades\" like engineering. The rising importance of that area of study doesn't hurt either.\n\n>How do you even quantify the quality of a co-op program?\n\nIt is more subjective, you're not wrong. But the resources above offered are a starting point. The quality of co-op's offered are another, like companies such as SpaceX, Apple, Tesla, Intuit, etc being options. Naming CS/Engineering ones since that's what I know, but this extends to other industries.\n\nSome other notable co-op focused schools, many of which have also risen in popularity: Drexel, GT, Waterloo, U of Cincinnati (the first school to ever do co-op!)\n\nu/chumer_ranion since it's been a few days :)",
