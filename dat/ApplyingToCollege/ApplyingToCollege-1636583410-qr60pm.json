  "text": "So I am primarily looking into liberal arts colleges. I've already applied to a few including Macalester and Union. However, after researching thoroughly, I have heard that although everyone in the school is smart and the courses are rigorous, there is not that much competition between students. I would also like to apply to LACs that match my stats, 3.73 UW and 1420, and are academically competitive. I have always been in competitive environments and it drives me to accomplish more. So any suggestions? \n\n(Suggestions like Amherst, Williams, Bowdoin, Harvey Mudd are not welcome because they're far too reach for me!)",

Also keep in mind that by competitive, I mean students that will bring each other up competitively--not down. Hopefully, you mean the same.",
