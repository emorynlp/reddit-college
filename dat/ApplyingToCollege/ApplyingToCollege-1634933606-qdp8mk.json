  "text": "Sooo.. to start off, my parents are immigrants and don\u2019t know much about the college admissions process in the U.S. They are also very strict and can be a bit overprotective at times. They really want me to stay in state, but I would like to go to college out of state. My main reasoning for wanting to go out of state is to get away from my toxic family and my overbearing parents. Staying for another year would really hurt my mental health. Yesterday they sat me down and let me know that they would not be filling out FAFSA because the guy that does their taxes told them they should wait and file as singles next year to get more money (pretty sure this is illegal because my parents are in fact married lol). I offered to have them speak with a financial aid advisor at the community college that I do dual enrollment at, but they refused. I also let them know that the FAFSA uses tax returns from the previous year and that I technically wouldn\u2019t get aid until my sophomore year of college. To which they replied, \u201cYou are going to have to stay in state because we are going to pay out of pocket\u201d. Keep in mind that the state flagship & the in state T20 they want me to apply to cost 30k-50k a year\u2026 we can certainly NOT afford that. If I were to attend our state flagship or the in state T20, they\u2019d force me to live at home and commute to school daily even though both schools are over an hour away. They would also not allow to go to community college or take a gap year. My father was basically pushing the notion that an in state school is my only option because they \u201chave\u201d to pay out of pocket until they get the chance to file as singles. Also, they are only \u201callowing\u201d me apply to two competitive schools in our state that they deem worthy enough for our money. I am still applying to other colleges that are out of state, but I worry that they will make me withdraw my applications once they find out. I am assuming that they are also not willing to do the css profile with me. What can I do besides applying to for scholarships to go out of state for college? Pls help\u2026\n\n\nTLDR: My overprotective parents are trying to get me to stay in state by refusing to do FAFSA until they can file as \u201csingles\u201d. They are telling me that without FAFSA or financial aid, in state schools would be cheapest and therefore my only option . They are also only allowing me to apply to 2 competitive in state schools and would not let me attend CC.( basically indirectly telling me that they are not willing to help pay college tuition if I go out of state )",

      "text": "One big thing here is the tax fraud. I\u2019d make sure that they know exactly what the penalties are (if you\u2019re low income, it\u2019ll be even worse because the IRS goes hard after the people who can\u2019t afford to lawyer up. Learned about this in a law class). \n\nAlso, to say they\u2019re separated, I believe that they\u2019ll need to file two different addresses and tax statements. It\u2019s a really laborious process and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re stuck in the middle. \n\nBest of luck, I\u2019d recommend talking to your counselor. Maybe don\u2019t mention the ideas your parents have for tax fraud tho",
