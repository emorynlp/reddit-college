  "text": "i\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s even possible that fafsa gives aid to middle class. last year i filled out the fafsa the first day like everyone tells you to. my family is middle class but we definitely live frugally like a majority of other middle class families. i literally got zero aid. none. so now i feel like i don\u2019t wanna fill it out this year since it\u2019ll be the same thing. does fafsa just aid families with low income and not help the middle class?",

Do this with your parents at your side\u2026 with their tax returns and all financial statements in-hand.",
