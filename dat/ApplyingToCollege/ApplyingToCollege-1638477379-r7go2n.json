  "text": "i\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s even possible that fafsa gives aid to middle class. last year i filled out the fafsa the first day like everyone tells you to. my family is middle class but we definitely live frugally like a majority of other middle class families. i literally got zero aid. none. so now i feel like i don\u2019t wanna fill it out this year since it\u2019ll be the same thing. does fafsa just aid families with low income and not help the middle class?",
