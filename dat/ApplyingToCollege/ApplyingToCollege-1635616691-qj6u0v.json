  "text": "Ah, November 1 is just a day away now. Tomorrow's a Sunday and guess what? Your CBSE school doesn't know jackshit about what the fuck is a transcript. Anyways, my situation was pretty similar BUT I JUST got my transcripts uploaded- sat with my principal till 6pm today and FINALLY, YES. \n\nAnyways, here's what the CBSE transcript should look like:\n\n9th grade: Basic info of student name+admission number+class/section, Subject Name, Maximum Marks, Marks obtained, grade, grading system (refer to CCE pattern's grading system, group A1-A2 as A) and mention the range) & principal's signature/seal on an official letterhead.\n\n10th grade: go to digilocker & download your class X marksheet, that's it.\n\n11th grade: same as 9th :D\n\n12th grade: due to recent changes in board requirements, your predicted would be for the term 1 and not term 2! (The term hasn't even started yet, I don't think anyone could assess you). Get predicted score from your teachers (note that the maximum marks vary from subject to subject, some have a 35 marks req. whereas some have 40). Now that you have the score, do the same as 9th and 11th; However, remove the grades column & SPECIFICALLY MENTION THAT IT IS A PREDICTED TERM-1 result.\n\n(And, tell your principal/controller of examinations/counselor to put latest predicted report as \"Quarter 2/Semester 1 Senior Year result\" on the recommender's Commonapp.) \n\nGood luck getting into UC Hicago now ig",
