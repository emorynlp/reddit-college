  "text": "I'm submitting a portfolio for design school and one of the things i'm trying to add are minecraft 3D renders. I figured its something unique and interesting, something that AOs don't see that often, and also, I generally enjoy minecraft anyway. But back to the point, I use a program called Chunky that renders minecraft builds. The problem is that it takes hours to render an image, and to move around the camera to get a different angle, I have to reset the render and re-render it all over again. If I wanted to include say 3 pictures of the same build, it could potentially take days. So how many pictures should I include of the artworks?\n\nJust to clarify incase anyone gets confused, I don't mean how many 3D artworks should I have in my portfolio, I mean how many different pictures of the same artwork should I have?\n\nPS. Don't know what flair to put this under",
