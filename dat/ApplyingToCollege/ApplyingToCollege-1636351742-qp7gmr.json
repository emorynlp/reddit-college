  "text": "One of my colleges requires a financial aid intent form that asks for my parents income. My dad insisted on me putting the net income (total - tax) but I\u2019m pretty sure they wanted just the total since the next question asked for the income tax amount. Will the college think I\u2019m lying or will they be able to tell I\u2019ve put net instead of gross income. Tbf they didn\u2019t specify it so if they ask me I could clarify but I feel like it\u2019s common sense you\u2019re supposed to put gross income my dad just refused to listen. Should I do anything about this or let it be?",
