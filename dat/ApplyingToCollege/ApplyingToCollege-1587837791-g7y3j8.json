I confronted her about throwing it away, and she said that it must have been an accident (which it was NOT), but I feel like it was her way at trying to get back at me for some of the fights we had this past week. Anyways, I try to keep my family and academic spheres separate because whenever I accomplish something she tries to downplay it or make me feel like shit about it.",

                  "text": "I wish I could keep those two spheres separate, my parents want to get all up in my business about every little thing. \n\nAlso, my mother flips her shit whenever I get the mail, yelling and screaming, so I just gave up. The other day, when she checked the mail for those pamphlet/catalog things colleges send out, she took the catalog thingy from Harvard, waved it in my face, did this whole rant thing about how I would never be good enough, that Harvard and all colleges were just wasting their money sending me shit, that I would just amount to a cashier at a fast-food restaurant, then started cry-yelling that I had no respect for her and all the effort she put in buying books (that she never read) to learn how to help me. \n\nI fucking hate this quarantine thing, I have no way of contacting my friends since no phone, no tablet, no laptop, tightly controlled internet. Stuck at home, I am sick of hearing my mother blame everything bad that ever happened on my father or I. \"you never get your work done, so we didn't go to the lakehouse this summer.\" \"Your father is a lazy asshole who never pitches in, it is his fault all these bins are stacked everywhere.\" Says the woman who sits in front of the TV all day, in a room covered in art supplies. \"it's your fault this room is such a mess, if I didn't have to help you with your school projects, this room would be clean\" I NEVER ask for help with anything beyond how much laundry detergent I should use, and even that is a risk. \n\nI just want to get out. At this point, I've pretty much stopped fighting, I feel too lethargic and just plain emotionally worn out to deal with her bullshit. She is trying to turn me against my dad, saying that the fucking horrendous mess our house is in is all his fault, but she won't let him touch anything, and half of her \"cleaning\" is just taking a concentrated mess and spreading it out on a table for somebody to clean up later when she decides that it's somebody else's mess. The rest of her \"cleaning\" is yelling at the rest of us about how we are such pigs, how it is our fault that we live in such a pigsty, that if only we were neater she could clean up the house. The third option that she uses is taking a stack or pile of stuff (think the top of a dresser) and sweeping all that onto the floor, then screaming at us to clean it up. If we complain, she says that she helped us by laying out the mess for us to see. \n\nI feel like I have been broken. I don't feel actively angry, I don't feel sad, I don't feel hurt. I don't have the energy for that anymore. I just want to hide, but I am not even allowed to do that. If I am not downstairs, she will come after me up in my room, and block me in my bedroom with her body, screaming at me about how I am no better than a toddler, hiding up in my room and pouting to get away from my homework.   \nI am at the point where I don't even feel like college is even possible, I can literally not even imagine getting into college. My mother is actively threatening to do things that would delay me getting into college, like having the HS make me do Junior year again. \n\nSorry for the rant, I felt like I needed to get these things off my chest, and this seemed like as good a time as any.",

My dad bought me a used car and now whenever I try to get free of his control, he holds it against me. I would just not use it, but because of quarantine, I'd be trapped inside of the house for months (right now i drive to the park to exercise for a few hours a day) if I couldn't drive because I live in a rural area with no sidewalks. I want to buy the car from him, but he won't let me. It sucks to be financially indebted to someone and just because they aren't physically forcing you to do these things doesn't make them any less at fault for hurting you like that. You don't owe them anything because they do things for you; believe it or not, ~~some~~  most parents will pay for their kid's college without the expectation that they can control them because of it.",

Yes, you'll have a story that your future children will not understand, even tho you try to explain it in greater detail than they care to listen to because they're busy fiddling with the newest technology or game or whatever bubbles up from this primordial recession.\n\nSo, all in all, you'll be just fine.

Been in the military for a bit and came home due to failing a physical test. Don't think I'll reenlist for personal reasons, but the one thing I miss was that sense of freedom. Leaving on my own for the first time away from family. At first it was rough, but overtime I matured, gained self confidence, and became a man. I had responsibilities, made friends. I didn't live with the label society gave me, I lived my life. Now I'm back in my crappy hometown filled with miserable old people, with a family that neglects my emotions, strugglely to find work and pay. And all that self gained confidence and sense of self went away. All the friends I made, gone to live their lives, and I don't talk to them out of shame because I couldn't make it and the guy they looked up to is doing nothing with his life. My life is literally hell for me now. Hopefully this virus situation settles down so I can get a DECENT job, I've worked at Retail and Warehouses for 3 years and I refuse to go work somewhere I'm miserable at. I want that control over my life. Maybe go up North a bit and live around culturally diverse people. Sorry for giving my life story (lol) just wanted to share this with someone who's going thru a rough situation in life.",

It's a mind game, just distance yourself from those people. Always question things in life. And most importantly live YOUR life. Don't get pressured by the expectations of others, or discouraged from doing things your way. You're an adult, or close to being 18 at least, and you're gonna make choices people won't like or accept and they will criticize you. It's your life and you need to live it for yourself. You're gonna make a TON of mistakes, but you'll learn from them. In my eyes life never gets better or worse, but it'll be different. You have to adapt to those different situations in life. Nothing changes without action, why do think people like protagonists in books and shows. K I'm done preaching to you(lol), just wanted to give some advice to a stranger on the internet.

Also, if people haven't told you this, and I'm only saying this cause I was in a similar situation, I'm so very proud of how far you've come, You're a trooper and I'm sorry you'll still need to be a trooper but going through this will make going through more mudane problems later on much easier, and it'll make the place you end up after all the strife all the vmore worth it and wonderful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe in you, OP.",

Lots of people move out at 18 to LA or NYC or wherever to make their dreams happen.\n\nThe pandemic complicates things because you can't just move and expect to find a coffee shop job when you get there, but OP can at least start planning. \n\nFor example, has he checked whether his university will be opening dorms? Most of them have contingency plans for parenting students, international students, and other students who don't have a home to go back to. Or, is there a college campus nearby? He can check out sublease opportunities and pay for it by working at safeway. Are there schools he can still apply to that offer full scholarships?",

Since I am not quite 18, any bank account I set up will be controlled by my parents. I don't even have a phone. \nThere is little to no chance I will get any significant amount of financial aid money, and there's no way I am good enough for any scholarship.
