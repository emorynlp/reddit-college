  "text": "So uh I\u2019m applying to some colleges right now but I\u2019m having trouble picking my major. I want a job in the medical field and I\u2019m not sure what \u201cpre-med\u201d route to go. I would ask this on the pre-med subreddit but it says no college admissions topics so uh right now I\u2019m debating between biology and biomedical physics but I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s other better routes to take",

      "text": "I can say this for sure: DO NOT CHOOSE BIOLOGY! Many people choose this major thinking it means an automatic entrance to medical school- it does not. If you actually have a passion for the field of bio, for sure then pursue it. If you\u2019re doing it to finish medical requirements don\u2019t do it. Do a major you love and just finish the medical school requirements on the side. Biomedical physics sounds like a great option. The more unique things you do in your undergrad, the more you will stand out as an applicant. In my opinion, hard/ applied science courses( biomedical physics) will definitely prepare you better for the MCAT in comparison to soft/ memory based science(biology) . I personally know someone who is a Philosophy major and pre-med! You would be surprised at the amount of weight/ content there is related to critical thinking on the MCAT which a philosophy + English major could be super prepared for( CARS section of MCAT).",

Nurse Practitioner?  Registered Nurse?  Physical or occupational therapist?   Those will argue for different majors.\n\nIf you want to be a Physician and will apply to med school, then two popular approaches are:\n\n1. Choose the major whose degree requirements have the most overlap with the prerequisite courses medical schools require.  This is why so many students pick biology, biochemistry, chemistry, etc.\n2. Choose the major you most enjoy and/or find the \"easiest\" since you can apply to medical school with any undergraduate major so long as you take the right prerequisite courses.  You can major in English Literature if you want.",
