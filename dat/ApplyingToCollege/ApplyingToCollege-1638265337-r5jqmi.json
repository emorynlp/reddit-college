College apps are the one time you should actually try and you have months of advance notice for these essays so why not put in the effort and do them properly? Just my opinion but for a sub who\u2019s so focused on college, lots of people seem to put it off a lot\u2026.",

I mean I procrastinate in my daily life all the time. I do it with regular school work. It\u2019s one of my worst habits. I didn\u2019t care enough about UC\u2019s tho, it\u2019s mostly why I waited so long. I was told to start these essays earlier but I don\u2019t have a ton of free time and the free time I do have I\u2019d rather spend it on my interest lol. I know that I should\u2019ve started earlier, a few months earlier, and I didn\u2019t. Spent my time doing other things I guess. Not sure if that answered the question, kinda feel like it didn\u2019t but oh well.",

Unless I suddenly find an urge to complete the application I don\u2019t think it\u2019s happening. There could be the possibility of an extension tho and if that were the case it\u2019s the universes way of telling me I should just do it. Doubt it sooo atm I\u2019m trying to calm down still haha",
