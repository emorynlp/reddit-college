  "text": "I read a post on this sub (or maybe it was a similar sub?) where somebody mentioned that if you apply to Harvard SCEA you can't apply to another private university for scholarship consideration if it's earlier than the RD date (i.e. USC's December 1st scholarship consideration date vs. their January 1st RD date).\n\nI was wondering if the same thing applied to Princeton, the school that I am SCEA-ing too, but could not find anything anywhere on the Princeton website or FAQs. Does anybody have any ideas about whether applying for scholarship consideration early is barred under SCEA for Princeton (assuming scholarship consideration is nonbinding).",

That's the question I'm looking to answer.",
