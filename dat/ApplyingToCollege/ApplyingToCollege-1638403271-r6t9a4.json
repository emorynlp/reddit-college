(hard to specifically tell because the median isn\u2019t really outlined)\n\nSend it.\n\nIf it\u2019s above or at the 25th percentile?\n\nDefinitely send it if your subscore/s for your intended areas of study are relatively high for the school. Even then, I would still say send it because it shows a college that you are academically prepared despite not being a top performer.\n\nBelow 25th percentile?\n\nI would say send it only if it\u2019s \n\n1. Somewhat near the 25th percentile\n\n2. You have some hooks like (AA, First Gen, Low income, etc)\n\n\nObviously, not all hooks are weighed evenly so do keep that in mind.",
