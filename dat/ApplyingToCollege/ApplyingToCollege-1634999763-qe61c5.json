Private schools and state run schools.\nThe state run schools are free of cost for everyone, and in many cases even pay you to attend school, buy books and uniforms and have a state sponsored meal program. But they may not provide the best education or the opportunities. Furthermore they tend to teach in the local language. Hence many people including the majority of middle class families prefer sending their kids to private schools which often provide better facilities, teach in english and so on, but lose out on the state run educational welfare schemes. These private schools may cost anywhere between 200- 20,000 usd per year.\n\nHope this answers your question.",

In my experience, there\u2019s a big difference in the religiosity levels between Catholic Jesuit schools like Fordham, Boston College, and St. Louis U, which are pretty chill, and Evangelical Protestant schools like Liberty and Oral Roberts, where religion is the main focus of the campus. My tour guide was brought up Protestant, and she said she had a lot of Jewish and atheist friends there, and she never heard of anyone feeling out of place for religious reasons. The main religious trappings are that you have to take a theology class as a Gen Ed requirement, and there\u2019s a priest or a nun in every dorm building. The guide\u2019s was called Father Leo, and he would invite people over every Thursday for bagel bites. \n\nThe main campus is in the Bronx, not really in the heart of the city, but they run buses to Manhattan close to 24/7, and there\u2019s public transport easily available. \n\nFlorida\u2019s cutting of Benacquisto for OOS students bummed me out.

Especially when you consider that most Americans die in the economic class they were born into, regardless of where they go to college.
