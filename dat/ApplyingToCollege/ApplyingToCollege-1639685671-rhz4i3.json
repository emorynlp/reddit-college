  "text": "For my top college I have to write about what moment made me realize I wanted to pursue theatre for the rest of my life... every theatre major has to write about it. How can I make my essay stand out at that point? Mine will be about getting a lead role my freshman year 2 weeks before our opening night, but even then it's hard to write about theatre when you know everyone else will be doing the same thing. Any tips?",
