      "text": "I don't know what guide you're referring to, but as someone who works with high school students on research projects, I can offer a couple of pieces of advice.\n\nFirst, do not do research because you think it will help you get into college. Doing research adequately requires you to have a clear reason for doing it and an ability to commit to doing things you have never done before. If you can not commit, or it is competing for your time with other things, it is not likely to be worth your time and can do damage to your education. \n\nSecond, if you cold email people, do not expect to get responses from very many. People who can supervise research are overworked and underpaid or are in very senior roles that require their attention to be focused elsewhere. That said, most people will be courteous and provide an opportunity if they can. You will have more luck with very junior people - graduate students and postdocs - and less luck with more senior and famous people.",
