  "text": "For example, I am in AP CSA (A), AP Gov (A), AP Lit (B), AP Bio (A), and AP Calc (B+). I believe this to be my worst case scenario, but this still makes me a competitive applicant grades-wise for schools like Stanford, Cornell, USC, etc, right? \n\nI am looking for some validation here tbh",

              "text": "Well, it will depend on how you did in the years past and what APs you have Bs in rn, cause a B in AP 2 D art is different from a B in AP Physics C. I would say for the most part though, colleges do practice holistic admissions ( I know, not very helpful, but it is a fact) so they would most likely prefer you over someone with just 3 APs for sure. No question about that.",

I also had similar questions. I was worse tho, cause it was about having B+ in Lang. Did get 5 on that exam but I was told AP exams don\u2019t matter for admissions. Also, could you be kind enough to look over my recent post regarding my recent mistake on the UC app by any chance? I just need some advice as well.",
