  "title:": "An open letter: Why do you care?",
  "text": "That\u2019s the title, the whole title. Why do you?\n\n\nYou have been inundated \u2014 maybe for the past few years, maybe for the past few months \u2014 with an incomprehensible and overwhelming barrage of expectations and opinions on the selective college process. Your parents might be bearing down on you; if not, you\u2019re at least comparing yourself to your peers. You likely wouldn\u2019t be on this subreddit if you weren\u2019t. But, truthfully, what drives your deep-seated desires and anxieties for your applications? College selectivity? The quality of the education? I\u2019m not going to sit here, as some do, and tell you that every college is the same. They\u2019re not, and they have appreciable differences \u2014 you will learn different things, your professors will have varying levels of competence, and you will have access to different resources and networks. But, as the officers devoting nine-odd minutes to your application will do so \u201cholistically,\u201d are you doing the same in turn for their institutions? You may believe you are, while your justifications for your preferences are more like post-hoc attempts to explain the opinions that you\u2019ve arrived at for all the wrong reasons. \n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that liking selective universities is wrong. It\u2019s not, they are often known for one aspect or another which do make them exceptional in some dimension. I am going to apply Early Decision to one, and I will be excited to go elsewhere if they don\u2019t accept me. Specifically, I\u2019m incredibly put off by the worst impulses that are brought out by these desires and their accompanying mindsets. With all due respect, many of the people that frequent this page are likely some of the most irritating and petty characters you\u2019ll find in your graduating class. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s their fault, necessarily. It is an ingrained desire to be better, to prove your worth, to meet the inexplicable and nebulous expectations surrounding you. I get it. I have things going for me \u2014 a SAT in the high 1500s, some good essays, a nice internship and accompanying letter. I also have a GPA lower than 3.7, a plethora of Bs and B-minuses in classes within fields I\u2019m interested in, ridiculously tepid and often short lived extracurricular activities, et cetera. I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t feel at least a twinge of regret, or irritation at the medical impediments I\u2019ve kept facing, or a hint of insecurity compared to my classmates. Ultimately, I am proud more of what I have not done than of what I have. Reread that sentence. If you care about your intellectual development, your character, and your well-being as a human being, you should too. The first 25 years of your life go by as fast as the next 75, and they should be spent living to your own standards. I\u2019m a person, not an archetype custom-fit to brute force my way into an Ivy League, and I\u2019m proud of that. I\u2019m proud to care about whatever I want, even if that means kicking tasks which will boost my \u201cprofile\u201d to the curb.\n\nCome November, I\u2019ll submit an application to a selective school which my classmates adore. I don\u2019t particularly know who is applying, but I know they side-eye each other in the hallways \u2014 they deliver more than the recommended daily values of passive-aggression, indignation and envy. They employ a mindset of false scarcity, salivating at one another like starving animals. I hope I don\u2019t get in, and I hope they do. My life will be the same, or it won\u2019t. Regardless, I\u2019ll go to college. I\u2019ll remain human, I\u2019ll carry with me the skills that I want and none that I don\u2019t, and I\u2019ll be thrilled to have the opportunity to flourish in whichever way I choose rather than whichever way I feel subliminally compelled.\n\nAsk yourself first: \u201cwhy do I like the schools I do?\u201d\n\nTry to answer honestly, not retroactively. Your parents are probably living vicariously through you, or projecting their own anxieties.\n\nThen, \u201cwhy do I care about these aspects of myself?\u201d\n\nDo you pride yourself on your ability to do stoichiometry, or to play the triangle? If not, leave the sub-A grade in that class alone. Don\u2019t be neurotic.\n\nFinally, the crux of this late-night, toilet-authored rant:\n\n\u201cwhy do I care about these aspects of others?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll tell you the answer \u2014 you don\u2019t. Not really, that is. In your heart of hearts, you know that their extra 20 points on the SAT doesn\u2019t make them any better of a person. You know that their exaggerated community service hours aren\u2019t altruistic, that their grinded-out grades aren\u2019t particularly indicative of intelligence. What you really should know is that they\u2019re in the same boat. They\u2019re subject to the same collective delusions, the same degenerative obsessions. They are the same as you: a human with idiosyncrasies. Let that moronic hate out of your heart (and ffs, stop letting it run all over this reddit page as well.) Make friends. Spill that mystery cocktail on your new sweater. Drive with all the windows down and The Strokes blasting, homework undone, somewhere fun in sight. If you\u2019re able to do this during the fall \u2014 to live, as yourself and not a fulfillment of collective psychosis \u2014 turn to a friend, and ask:\n\nWhy do you care?",

      "text": "I think it is a great accomplishment to get in to a top school, but it is by no means necessary, nor does it guarantee anything. \n\nThis applies to so much that our culture deeply values.\n\n- Jobs: \u201cdream\u201d jobs can be fun but are usually super stressful; e.g. doctors discourage their children from medicine.\n\n- Wealth: having stuff is nice but it will never be what makes your life worthwhile. \n\n- Marriage: wonderful to have a lifelong partner, but so many are toxic and end in divorce.\n\nI definitely recommend you try to get into a good school IF YOU WANT TO. To be sure, they offer tremendous opportunities to pursue selective careers, learn from/work with the greatest minds alive, and meet driven friends who become future leaders. But realize that if you don\u2019t make it in you can still have a great life. Same with a cool job, becoming rich, or getting married. All generally positive things, but which are overly engrained in our society as being necessary for a complete life. You can have a happy life without them.\n\nEvery human experience is different. No one can lay everything out for you and say this is what you should do. Follow your heart and roll with the punches. Thousands of generations of humans before us did not go to college. They climbed mountains and cooked food and sailed the seas. \n\nYou sound like you don\u2019t really want to go to a super selective school my friend. Then  don\u2019t apply. Or maybe you are typing this as a method to cope with a \u201cfailure\u201d you see coming? That\u2019s okay too - And maybe this post will help others be prepared to accept \u201cfailure\u201d in a healthy way too. To all people reading I\u2019d say: love yourself and love each other. You can\u2019t control what comes, but you can control your perspective and the next step.",

I want to be in an environment around motivated and achieved people who I can take classes and do external projects with and know they will work hard. I would assume this is most people's reasoning for wanting to go to top schools, you can tell me those people exist at other schools but obviously there will be a higher concentration of the most hard working people due to the criteria to get into such school.",

There are schools outside the set of \"top schools\" that nevertheless possess solid academic credentials and a reputation for excellence.",

I also need to make a lot of money so I could give back to my community. I don't want to be wealthy to buy luxury cars, purses or any of those things. I'm also applying for an extremely competitive major so I do need to have better grades than a 3.77uw and a crappy 1330 SAT/1350 ss. I don't think I'm going to get into a decent school like my parents are telling me. I just want out of this town and don't want to commute either so I can't be controlled anymore and worsen my mental health. There's just so many reasons.
