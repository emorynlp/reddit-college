  "text": "This is a super niche post; I apologize if I\u2019m breaking any rules. \n\nMy grades are questionable. Freshman and sophomore year were not the best, but I have a severe upwards trend so far.\n\nGPA:\nUW: 3.95/4.5\nW: 4.25/4.5\n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be able to get anything out of this metric, but I\u2019m very slightly above the range of accepted GPAs according to my school\u2019s Naviance. \n\nMy SAT score is a 1420 (730 EBRW + 690 Math). Northeastern average SAT, for context, is somewhere around a 1470 according to their website. I\u2019ve also heard rumors, though, that the statistics are super inflated.\n\nI\u2019ve been debating whether to go test-optional for a minute now. Any advice?",

      "text": "I just finished submitting my app to NEU explore program and I went test optional. My counselor told me not to submit my 1440, and also during a northeastern virtual information session the speaker told us their average was 1470, and to not submit SAT if you scored even just 20 points less. At the same time a 1420 is a good score so Idk if this is the best advice, but good luck w ur apps!! :)",
