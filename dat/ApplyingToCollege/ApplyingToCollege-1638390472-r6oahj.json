  "text": "I'm from India and every single rich high schooler who wants to apply to the US is making these fake ass startups. Their Instagram pages appear before they're finished ideating, they appoint CEOs and CFOs and Managers and Directors before knowing what they're gonna do. The problem? These look great on paper with close to no effort. It adds additional and absolutely fake pressure on (relatively) lower-income individuals like myself to do some fake ass shit to fill the common app and add that little 'founder and CEO' tag.  It pisses me off. I don't have the capacity to gather 20 of my friends (none of whom have any incentive to participate since ECs don't matter here) and start some fake ass blogging website or some shit. I know for a fact that 99% of these startups will be left to die the day these 'eNtRePrEnEuRs' get that acceptance letter from Stanford.",
