But they definitely fall on the very generous side for US schools.",

They provide over $10 million in aid to international students every year.  That's more than their peers like Oberlin, and it's more than a school like Brown which focuses it's aid more on domestic students.\n\nLACs don't get the percentage of international students Macalester has without a lot of them getting their need met, even if you see anecdotal data suggesting otherwise.",
