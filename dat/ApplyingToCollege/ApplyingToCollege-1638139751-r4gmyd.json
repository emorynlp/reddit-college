  "title:": "Is it a bad idea to specifically make my common app essay about why I want to study physics and why I'm interested in mathematics?",
  "text": "I mean if I were an AO I'd want to know why a student wants to study what they do. But at the same time I'm worried it'd come across as a little fake (even though I am actually passionate) or as stuck up like I think I'm really smart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I guess I didn't explain what I was writing about very clearly. My essay (rough draft at least) is  more focused on \"I'm fascinated by things I don't understand and I like working towards understanding them,\" and then at the end I tie in why it makes me interested in physics. I'm more worried about being clich\u00e9 or coming across snobbishly than being redundant.",
