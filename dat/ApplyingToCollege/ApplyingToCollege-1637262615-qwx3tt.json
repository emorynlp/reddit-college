  "title:": "If you're in the middle of Essay Rewrites and trying to come up with the perfect word, but don't want to sound like you swallowed a thesaurus, this resource might be helpful: 1000 Words to Write By, by Deanna Carlyle",
  "text": "Happy Thursday Applicants and Essay Writers!\n\nI came across this amazing resource today and wanted to share it with you! It was actually shared in one of my counseling groups, by Ethan Sawyer, College Essay Guy. \n\nI know I always say to avoid sounding like you've swallowed a thesaurus, and I stand by that, but sometimes you just need another word to say what you're trying to say.  This resource gives an amazing list of words to use. As always, only use words you're comfortable with and would use in your vocabulary. Don't go out on any crazy limbs here, because you'll fall off -- and it hurts. If you're not sure how one of these words should work in a sentence, don't use it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is straight up just copied and pasted from the original document I've linked in the title below. \n\n[1000 Words to Write By](https://www.bluecatscreenplay.com/the-bluecat-screenplay-competition-blog/1000-words-write/?fbclid=IwAR2pD34nj8oB_iKu4LZLxikQNnr4OJ3oAYq9oCwdW5UMny1jztt-m3-Q-Xw) by Deanna Carlyle:\n\nAll the writing advice in the world can\u2019t replace good tools and lots of practice. This is why I\u2019ve compiled the following list of more than a thousand action verbs. I needed a handy, printable reference tool that didn\u2019t strain my eyes or wrists.
