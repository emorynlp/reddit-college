  "text": " \n\nI'm an Indian student applying to unis in the UK for a BSc physics program\n\nI have 7 IGCSE subjects:\n\nPCMB, ICT - A\\*\n\nHindi second language - A\n\nEnglish - B\n\nI took 3 A-levels and 1 AS Level:\n\nPCM - A\\*\n\nEng Lang (AS) - C\n\nFor my UCAS reference, I wondering who should I ask. My math teacher of my physics teacher. Ik it sounds obvious that I should ask the teacher of the subject I'm majoring in but...\n\nI feel like my math teacher will be able to write a better reference than the physics teacher... like math probably will be 9.5/10 and physics will be 7.5 or 8 / 10.\n\nWhat should I do?",
