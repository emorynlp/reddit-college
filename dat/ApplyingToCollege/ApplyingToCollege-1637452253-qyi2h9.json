  "title:": "Changing intended major mid application process",
  "text": "So here's the situation, on my ED and EA applications I put down my intended major as political science and wrote supplemental essays accordingly, however after more consideration (better job chances + more specialized towards what I want to do + better ROTC scholarship chances + my skillset) I've decided Math/Stats is the better option. \n\n\nWhile I'm not even enrolled anywhere and obviously have lots of time to change it, I'd rather get that sorted with these schools ASAP so I wouldn't have any issues listing Stats/Math as my top major on my ROTC scholarship application (kinda need to get one to afford the schools on my list and a technical major like stats/math would give me a much better chance). \n\n\nCan I do this and would it negatively affect admissions chances for my EA schools? Would it be possible to do after a theoretical admission to my ED school?",
