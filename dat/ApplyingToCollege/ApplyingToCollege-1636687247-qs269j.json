  "text": "I was thinking about mentioning r/MapPorn in my why us essay. The context is that I browsed the sub reddit frequently during my childhood and how that inspired me to pursue to my passion in geography. There\u2019s nothing actually NSFW in the sub reddit, it\u2019s just the name that might set officers off. Thoughts on whether or not I should include this?",

      "text": "If you're writing a quirky essay you can write a cool line explaining why it's described as porn. something like \"a collection of posts so fascinating and informative, it's almost arousing\". JK maybe not? but I personally think the word is fine, I quoted a pretty offensive slur in one of my essays because it was necessary to contextualize the impact the statement had on me. I did use asterisks though. I mean you're an adult, when you're in class you'll have teachers cursing all the time.",
