      "text": "UC App site is slower than this morning on each \"Save\".  \n\nThere's issue when trying to submit the application after input the Credit Card payment.  After CC input, the website redirect back to UC App website might failed.  If that's the case, go back to UC App to submit the application with the saved payment info (within 15 minutes).  It took me 6 times to complete the application and to receive the application confirmation email.  Click each \"Save\"/\"Submit\" and wait (do not click second time).  Good luck.",

Guess what, I applied to three schools and probably because of the website crashing issue, $240 was debited TWICE from my credit card.
