  "text": "as the title explains, cheaper is not always the way to go in regards to picking a university. i made the terrible mistake of choosing the cheapest school i was accepted too. i am low-income with no family financial support and to me i thought debt was the worse thing anyone can have. \n\ni enrolled in my instate flagship university thinking i would have less than $6000 in debt TOTAL. wrong wrong wrongggg. i owe $6000 my first YEAR (this happened because they said i\u2019d get xyz scholarship but after enrolled they claimed i had one scholarship that made me no longer qualify for several) and now im in the process of transferring to the school i wish i chose. \n\nim definitely not saying this is the case for every school but please rank the pros and cons before deciding on any school!! \nalso make sure your school will have lots of clubs you are interested in because it is so hard to make friends in college and is nothing like HS.",
