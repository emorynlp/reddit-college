  "text": "Hi guys, I'm deciding whether or not to make an MIT maker portfolio, and what I should present if I do. I'm thinking of either making it about an informational kiosk that I made for my eagle service project, or a grocery delivery service that I set up during the pandemic at [https://www.care-pack.us/](https://www.care-pack.us/)\n\nI wrote about both of these projects in my essays already, so maybe I just shouldn't make a portfolio at all, or maybe I can talk about them both somehow? Let me know what yall think",
