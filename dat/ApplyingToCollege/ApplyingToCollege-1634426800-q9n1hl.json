  "text": "So, I'm a international student.\n\n\nI don't really have any teachers who'd recommend me. It is my fault. I spend my whole day locked in a dark room working on some dumb programming projects or studying something stupid. Add to that horrible social skills, social anxiety, aspergers and general idiot behavior made my teachers hate me when school was physical (pre-covid times). I don't even know my teachers names this year. And my school doesn't have a councilor. \n\n\nI feel like the rest of my application is alright, but will this be a deal breaker?",

That\u2019s what anxiety is, fearing/obsessing about the worst case scenario, whether realistic or not.   You are going to need to talk to these teachers.  Find a time and work through what you\u2019re going to say.  Tell them you enjoyed their class but you realize you were quiet.  You need recommendations and wonder if they feel they could write you a good one.  Ask if it would help for you to provide information about your activities/interests outside of class.  I guarantee you they have had kids in class before dealing with social anxiety/distracted etc.  Talk to them about your goals and what you\u2019re excited about and what you have learned so far.",

Even if you haven't interacted much, they probably think of you as a shy but studious kid and wouldnt write lowly of you because of that.",
