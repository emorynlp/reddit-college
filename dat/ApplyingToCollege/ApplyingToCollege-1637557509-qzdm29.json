      "text": "Both. Don't be overtly negative and make yourself feel terrible about your app, possibility of acceptance (etc). But, dont be so overconfident or hopeful (?) that you just know you're getting in. You kinda have to be inbetween you know? Hope for the best but expect the worst. I hope I'll get in but get that I may not.\n\nEdit: I think it's also important to try and make peace with rejection beforehand? Like, I really want to get into my reaches but I know it's unlikely. While I love them and it'd be amazing to go, I'm okay if it doesnt happen because I tried and I have safeties I'm genuinely excited for. Do you have any backups?",
