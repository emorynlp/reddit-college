  "text": "I prepared for gmat for around 2.5 months, then I got busy with college work for around 3 months. It\u2019s mid Nov now and I don\u2019t know if I should give the gmat or prepare for the 2023 intake instead of 2022 because round 2 deadlines are around the corner. My BBA will end in mid-22 and I\u2019m looking for Masters in management in uk, usa, Canada, Australia. I also have to prepare for and give ielts. Also I haven\u2019t taken a mock test so I\u2019m thinking about taking one, but in my heart I\u2019m not confident that I\u2019ll be able to achieve my target score of 700+. Really confused if I should just prepare more and stay back for one more year after my BBA ends( also would like some advice for what I should do in that 1 gap year). I\u2019m aiming for global top 50 MiM unis in only those 4 countries. \nI have a 7.977/10 Cgpa up till my 4th sem and have done 2 internships till now.",
