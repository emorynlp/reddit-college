  "text": "I've only been considering colleges that accept CLEP so I can get through college faster. I'm getting a doctorate, so it's not like I'm missing out on anything because I'll be doing a l o t of college. But, the programs I'm really excited about and want to apply for don't accept CLEP. The field I want to go into, which is acting, is earlier the better, and money isn't an issue. \nShould I go to a college that I can graduate a year and a half earlier from, or should I go to a top university?",
