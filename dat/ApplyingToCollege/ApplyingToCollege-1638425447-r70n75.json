      "text": "I think UT has a hard deadline for that part of the application since they're listed as part of the required materials.\n\nI wouldn't know if they allow late applications, if you can submit it, go ahead. If it's locked out, email them.\n\nBut, a possible work around, UT says the deadline is \"Dec 1st\" for that part of the application, whereas they specify \"Dec 8th 11:59pm Central\" for supporting materials. ([https://admissions.utexas.edu/apply/freshman-admission](https://admissions.utexas.edu/apply/freshman-admission)) Its possible the application doesn't lock out until Dec 2nd YOUR time zone, in which case, you could try a VPN and see if it lets you submit the application.\n\nIt works for CommonApp, doesn't work for Coalition App, I'm not sure for ApplyTexas. If so, this might give you a couple of hours.\n\nEdit: Also possible they just didn't clarify CST on their page for that portion.. but worth a shot?",

(ie. it deleted them, then you submitted anyways without any supplementals)\n\n2. or you submitted it, then it looked like it deleted your supplementals afterwards?\n\n3. or did you submit it late with supplementals? (having rewritten them after they got deleted)\n\nif the first, I'd write the supplementals asap and email admissions stating the error, your app details, and your essays to be added. Also say you'll upload them as soon as you get access to your account. Stress that applytexas had an error, and no place to submit them.\n\nif the second, I'm inclined to believe it's just Applytexas being wonky like it is..  email them if you wanna be safe\n\nif the 3rd, they probably have an application grace period, in which case I wouldnt worry about it and I'd assume your app will be counted\n\nEdit: possible 4th option you might mean: Submitted late without any supplementals (since they got deleted you said)\nif so, assume itll be counted with a grace period, but follow #1's steps.",
