  "text": "title\\^\\^ just want to confirm lol. ik that a score of 3+ on ap art history satisfies the F requirement but can i just take a 3 credit art history class @ a cc to fulfil it without the exam score? for reference, this is the course description:  \"Survey of Art I: Western Art from Antiquity to the Middle Ages. Art of the Western world from prehistory through the Middle Ages.\"\n\nupdate: called the UC office and the guys said with 95% certainty that it would. he said to call the specific school's office for 100% certainty so that's my next step lol",
