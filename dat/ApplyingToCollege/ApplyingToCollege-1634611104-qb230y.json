  "title:": "Stanford Art Portfolio DESCRIPTION???",
  "text": "Hi guys, uh, my stanford rea art portfolio is due in 2 days, and after grinding for an entire day straight figuring out the artists' statement, I uploaded my pieces only to find that **there is a (optional?) description for each piece**.\n\nWhat should I put there? My painting portfolio is pretty subjective: as in there are many interpretations of my art and I don't want to mess things up by giving a half-baked explanation for why I painted a piece. For context, I'm applying for the Symsys major and art isn't the main focus of my application. Is it OK to just put the artwork's medium and dimensions in the \"description\" box and go with that? Or will doing that penalize my application?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for the responses!",
