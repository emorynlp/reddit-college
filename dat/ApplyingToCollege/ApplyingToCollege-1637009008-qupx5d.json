  "text": "I will finish school next summer in Germany. My dream university is MIT, so I am currently looking into how to apply. I want to study Computer Science, though I don't have \"straight A's\" in school. The system here rates from 1 (best) to 6 (worst), my average is about 2. \n\nI do have experience in programming, but really want to understand the underlying concepts, which is why I want to study that field. I have a pretty good GitHub Profile showing my work. Two companies (one actually founded at MIT) even approached me based on that and asked if they could interview me for a Job (But obviously I am not old enough yet).",
