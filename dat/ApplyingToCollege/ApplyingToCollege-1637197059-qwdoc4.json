  "text": "So I\u2019m in my senior year and taking AP Stats. That class was, according to the internet, one of the easier APs. Apparently not the case for me. \n\nI\u2019ve been looking around and there\u2019s a decent amount of posts about how getting a W is better than getting a C since it doesn\u2019t affect the GPA. \n\nIs this really true? Should I drop the class instead of getting a C? How do colleges look at it?\n\nAny advice is appreciated. Thanks.",
