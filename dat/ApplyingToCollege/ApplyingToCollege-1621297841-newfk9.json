  "text": "I saw someone talking abt getting everyone to apply to uc Davis next year to artificially lower the acceptance rate. and yeah that's hilarious, but it's annoying to do the uc application. instead\u2013hear me out\u2013y'all should pick an incredibly obscure college and all like 300k of us apply to it. like idk get Cornell college in Iowa to have a lower acceptance rate than Cornell. I'm a graduating senior, so I'm out unfortunately. go crazy y'all. in the age of tiktok, u guys can def make this into a gigantic meme. like come on. imagine this as a nationwide senior prank. from the class of 21 to 22, make us proud lmao",

I told him how cool it was to meet a stuyvesant student in person, but I didn\u2019t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for study tips or anything.\n\nHe said, \u201cOh, like you\u2019re doing now?\u201d\n\nI was taken aback, and all I could say was \u201cHuh?\u201d but he kept cutting me off and going \u201chuh? huh? huh?\u201d and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Arizona Iced teas in his hands without paying.\n\nThe girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like \u201cSir, you need to pay for those first.\u201d At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.\n\nWhen she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually \u201cto prevent any electrical interference,\u201d and then turned around and winked at me. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",

It\u2019s a neutral thing.  We do workshops to encourage local students to apply, even if they have already accepted offers to other schools. A lot of our local schools require the entire class to apply. It helps the students who\u2019s plans fall through or who drop after only a semester as well as catching those who might not otherwise apply anywhere. I can\u2019t tell you how many people we get like 3 days before classes start who changed their plans and if they have already applied then we can usually help.",

Religion classes aren't a requirement, and most of the tenured religion professors here don't specialize in Christianity. There is no requirements for attending the church, and you won't really hear anything about those services. The only time you'll really hear about the church is during the campus tour (obviously admissions will want to show off the pretty church) and the candlelight service in December (it's not mandatory or anything). There is an active LGBTQ+ community on campus (If anyone comes to Southwestern I recommend to visit Korouva Milk Bar when it reopens eventually, it is where Pirates for Pride and the Art club host their meetings pre covid). As a non-religious person, I have never felt pressured or uncomfortable with not being Christian.",

Not all of us here are applicants in one year, but let's say 50,000 of us are. 10,000 probably don't check the sub or are in-active, leaving us with 40,000 applicantsfor the year of 2021-2022 that will see it. They could all apply to a college with a small undergraduate population(one with a high acceptance rate and no application fee is even better). A perfect school is **Boston Architectural College**(although it has 50$ fee). They have a undergrad enrollment of 359, and tuition isn't all that bad(22k). Their acceptance rate is 100% right now. So now, 40,000 of us apply to it,(even not all of us will apply, so at worst say 20k or even 10k do it for real).\n\nundergrad space is 359, and I'll try it out with different number of students to see acceptance rate after.\n\n359/10k = **3.59%** acceptance rate\n\n359/15k = **2.39%** acceptance rate\n\n359/20k = **1.79%** acceptance rate\n\n359/25k = **1.43%** acceptance rate\n\n359/30k = **1.19%** acceptance rate\n\nSo all of these will allow us to get way better acceptance rates than other top schools in **1** year.\n\n**What about yield rate though?**\n\nPeople who get accepted, should accept the offer, knowing that it will be the best college in America right after, leaving their yield rate pretty good.\n\nNow, we have a competitor that will beat Harvard and MIT, making them alright in Massachusetts.",
