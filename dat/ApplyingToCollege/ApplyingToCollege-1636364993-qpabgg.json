In the age of information, even knowledge heavy professions like medicine require much more than just general knowledge.",

Parents and educators should be preparing children/students with the experience, knowledge and skills to develop these qualities. In addition, simple life skills, think time management of academics, non-academic interests, and taking care of business (laundry, cooking, cleaning...making appointments, seeking advice/help, getting out of your own way). Helicoptering is a terrible pursuit for parents and children..my opinion.",
