And we were able to come to them often for football and basketball games and to see their shows and club sports competitions. (And treat them to something tasty that didn\u2019t come from a dining hall.) It might have been different had they wanted to work in another part of the country, or didn\u2019t have fairly excellent in-state options, but they like our area and the state schools are very strong.  Their dad, a double-Ivy, was thrilled with their decision to save their college dollars for grad school.",

I have two younger siblings and six younger cousins who I frequently see throughout the week and as the oldest of three (I guess you can say nine), I really appreciate their presence and having the fun with them. It would be nice to see them much more frequently with the option of an in-state school. In my area, the state school is pretty reputable, especially the Honors College (if I make it into it), and definitely see how your husband thought that state-school is a better option. Thank you so much for the feedback! I feel more re-affirmed to going in-state :))",

We're fortunate that we can afford that (due to finding 529 plans when the kids were young).\n\nAnd our youngest intentionally chose to apply only to out of state public universities that offer merit scholarships.  They already have one acceptance at a cost of ~10% more than our in-state flagship.  So, applying to fewer schools with a specific target of price, academics, and social opportunities has worked out well so far.",
