  "text": "I feel like the resume is a place where I can expand the description of my activities A LOT more but just writing about one activity takes up a good amount of space. Should I limit the word count or decrease the activities? The school that I\u2019m applying to requires that we describe 5 activities on its application, so idk if I could include those 5 on the resume plus 1 or 2 more even though I got 11 activities",
