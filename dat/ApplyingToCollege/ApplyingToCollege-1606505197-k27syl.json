  "title:": "PSA: Warning to any closeted transgender people applying to TOSU!! Or colleges in general!",
  "text": "On the application, there is a \u201cpreferred name\u201d section. If you\u2019re trans and not out yet, and worried about transphobic parents, DO NOT put your preferred name. They send a letter to your parents using that name instead of your birth name. \n\nI know this because I put my middle name as my preferred name (I\u2019m not trans but I just thought of this issue), and TOSU sent both my parents letters mentioning \u201cyour child (my middle name)\u201d.\n\nIf you\u2019re trans and not in a safe environment, please just leave \u201cpreferred name\u201d blank, for your own safety.\n\nEdit; some colleges have a section where you can specify which name to use in official mail. This would include stuff like your family\u2019s letters. If they specifically ask, then it is probably okay to put your preferred name in the box. But if not, please don\u2019t risk it! Your safety and life as a human being is more important than the name on a piece of paper.",

Someone may just use their preferred name with friends, and not dress different from what their birth sex is expected to, because they don\u2019t want to be out yet.\n\nA closeted transgender person usually has not made many adjustments to their physical appearance. It\u2019s a good question to ask if you don\u2019t understand. Thank you for asking. And thank you to spring for explaining what you meant :)",

Anyway, if mail came to his house w his preferred name his parents would be pissed and hed get in a lot trouble  :(\n\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that there\u2019s lots of girls w short hair/more masculine style and vise versa so even if a trans person had begun to physically transition there\u2019s a chance their families wouldn\u2019t know or acknowledge it",
