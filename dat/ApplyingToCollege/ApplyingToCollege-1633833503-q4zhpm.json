  "text": "Not sure what flair to use\n\nAm I the only one who thinks that ivies are just way too overhyped and just doesn\u2019t want to apply to any ivies? First off none of the ivy leagues will take my dual enrollment credits which are all classes that will fulfill my major requirements and the whole environment is just rich and famous people which is going to give me huge imposter syndrome and I just rather not be in that situation",
