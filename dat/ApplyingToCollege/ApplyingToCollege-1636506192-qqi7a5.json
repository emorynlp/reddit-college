  "text": "Hi a2c!\n\nI was wondering I could get some advice/info on gap years. Basically, I\u2019m seriously considering a gap year for a few reasons (the primary reason being that I don\u2019t think I can get good apps done on time). I wanted to know how much gap years affect your admissions chances or what would you need to do as a gap year applicant to NOT have the gap year affect your chances. Is just working/continuing ECs/etc enough to have the gap year not affect you? Will you always be seen somewhat negatively by admissions for having taken a gap year? Are there any stats on gap year student\u2019s acceptance rates specifically? I was also wondering if a gap year would be an inherit disadvantage just because I\u2019d be going up against hs co23, which I think may be overall more competitive than co22. \n\nIf anyone who has taken a gap year, any consultants, or anyone who works in admissions could help me out with advice and info I\u2019d appreciate it sm!",
