  "title:": "How do I show a \"rigorous secondary school record\" even though I have only taken 1 AP class",
  "text": "To get straight to the point: freshman year I was homeschooled so I didn't get on the honors track at the private school I started going to in 10th grade, so I was placed in the normal track, which has screwed me over for the rest of highschool. In 10th grade a combination of pandemic/depression led to me having a bad academic year (2 A-, mostly Bs). In 11th grade I tried to take a few APs, but my counselors told me I didn't have enough required credits yet. But I am taking AP Language and Duel Enrollment African American History. I have all As this semester (3.95 unweighted, \\~4.20 weighted).\n\nI'm planning on taking 4-5 AP classes in 12th grade, but I'm worried it's not worth it because it's already too late. I am planning on applying to some fairly high level colleges, but I have realized how underwhelming my transcript looks, and colleges don't even see your senior year transcript so what's the point. \n\nHow do I show course rigor, even though my transcript is not very rigorous so far.",

      "text": "In additional information or one of your essays, mention how you took the most rigorous course of study available to you and explain the circumstances that limited what was available to you. But reemphasize that you pursued the most challenging opportunities that were presented to you and even more but that you were hindered due to the required credits, and make sure to show an upward trend, they should accept you for who you are currently, not who you were during the lowest point of your academic career",

      "text": " Where are you looking to go? \n\nBecause \"rigour\" does not just equate to AP classes. \n\nI suggest anyway: \n\nFair SAT score (or ACT equivalent): 1150+ (use Khan academy pal. Also a bit of YouTube. Radical Prep is great for the math) \n\nJoin a club or some notable activity group offered. Don't waste time with NHS. \n\nDo some community service. See if your school has a scholarship program or some way to track it. If not it can still net you nice detail for an essay. \n\nKeep  above 3.0 GPA (3.5 is usually the sweet spot but up to you). Try to vary your AP courses and keep competitive marks( but don't kill yourself for straight A.). Passing the exam on said course keeps in you in good rank for the rigor anyway as it's free credits. \n\nLetters of recommendation are not really required unless the college says so. They don't help for college anyway most of the time. Mostly for scholarship. \n\nThat's all I got.",

          "text": "Thanks. Yeah I definitely haven't focused that much on community service/clubs that do stuff.  I got a 28 on the ACT last month, which is good, but it's fairly average for the schools I want to go to. \n\nWhy shouldn't I join national honors societies? My school offers a lot of them, but I don't know much about them (other than that all of the top ranked people at my school are in at least one of them).",
