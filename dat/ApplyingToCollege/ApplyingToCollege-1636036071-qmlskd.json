  "text": "I applied to a school REA, and I got to be honest I had no idea what Restricted Early Action meant. I decided to apply to the school last minute and I didn\u2019t realize the implications of applying REA to that school until after I submitted my application. I applied to 10 other schools early action. Am I going to get in trouble? Should I withdraw my application to the REA school? Im really concerned and I feel like I need to do something.",
