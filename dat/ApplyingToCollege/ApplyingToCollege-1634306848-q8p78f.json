      "text": "Report both. Check each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll \u2013 note that the Common App asks only for your highest section scores. Other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission; for these schools, send an official report that includes both test dates.",
