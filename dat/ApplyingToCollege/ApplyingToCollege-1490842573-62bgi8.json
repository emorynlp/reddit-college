  "title:": "My theory: Stanford doesn't exist. Let me explain why.",
  "text": "As we draw to the close of the college admissions process, thousands of students are waiting with drawn breath for Friday, when Stanford University will release their decisions. I was one of these students, until I stumbled upon revelations that have shaken me to the core and caused me to realize the true nature of Stanford. I share this as a warning, with the hope that one day the terrible truth will come to light: Stanford isn\u2019t real.\n\nFirst, we should make some observations. Stanford, or \u201cStanford\u201d as I will refer to it occasionally, has one of the most expensive application fees in the country. This will be important later. Second, Stanford is considered one of the most prestigious colleges in the country and has an exceptionally low acceptance rate. It has alumni with a wide range of accomplishments and talents, and is generally listed as one of the world\u2019s best places to study.\n\nNow despite all this, let me ask, have you ever really seen anyone from \u201cStanford\u201d? Have you ever met someone who recently attended the college? Sure people say they get in and go, but then what? Nothing, never to be seen again. Take a look at their website: the campus looks good right? But where are all the people? \n\nNow, here\u2019s the explanation. Stanford does not exist. The campus, although obviously real, is a mere prop akin to a movie setting. They can accomplish this by rejecting every applicant, and pocketing their application fee in order to keep the \u201ccampus\u201d looking good. When you apply to \u201cStanford\u201d, you are not applying to a school but rather paying a shadowy shell company close to a hundred dollars. The interviewers? All paid actors. The pictures? All fake. There is no \u201cStanford\u201d, but rather a fake campus and a network of lies.\n\nObviously, you probably think this is complete nonsense. \u201cWhat about my friend?\u201d you ask. \u201cHe\u2019s a freshman at Stanford right now!\u201d But tell me, when was the last time you saw him? \u201cOh he got an internship over the summer!\u201d You sure? Perhaps he was paid off with some excess funds to \u201cattend\u201d so-called \u201cStanford\u201d.\n\nFinally, the \u201calumni\u201d. Let me ask you a hypothetical question. Imagine you, through hard work and some luck, rose to the top of the corporate ladder and became a CEO. All your peers attended Ivies and similar institutions, while you didn\u2019t attend college. It\u2019d make you feel pretty small, right? But what if you were approached by someone from \u201cStanford\u201d saying they could register you as an official alumni for a simple one-time payment? I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019d take the deal. And so would many others, leading to a self-fulfilling cycle where people become \u201calumni\u201d in order to increase their social status, therefore making Stanford seem more prestigious and attractive. \n\nWhat we see as one of the most competitive and selective schools in the world is merely one giant illusion to keep the world\u2019s greatest minds at bay, one $90 application fee at a time. Stay woke my friends, and stay safe.\n\n\n",

A lot of people here are deeply troubled in some sense and could use mental health help and either don't seek it or find it unsatisfactory. \n\nTo personal things, I actually liked the students. Some professors were good others not so much. I found the workload to be exhausting and the classes tone rather unforgiving. I found myself to be deeply miserable for a variety of other reasons as well. I found a lot of my friends though not all experienced similar issues as well. I would certainly hesitate to recommend it as an undergraduate institution, and would not have come here if given the chance to do it over again. It's a great place to spend a summer, and it's a great place to enjoy yourself, but the academic environment and the physical environment clash in such a way that it only heightens this for me. When you feel like everything is going to shit in week ten and you haven't slept more than five hours in a night, the fact the lawn is always fucking perfect despite the university asking you to take a shorter shower due to the drought really starts to bug you.",

You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, ingochris. The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs trying to turn itself over. But it can't. Not without your help. But you're not helping. Why is that, ingochris?\n",

I flew out, took a look around (my first time in CA) and literally said to myself \"I can't go to a place with Taco Bell architecture.\"  Flew back, deferred \"Stanford\", applied elsewhere and went there. Such a profound decision making process. Edit: in retrospect it was one of the worst decisions of my life. I wound up meeting/marrying someone at Harvard who took a sledgehammer to my life.  And the Stanford community, given what I do now, would have been a much better place for me. Important life lesson learned from this experience:  ALWAYS gather advice/input/more information before making important decisions. Never make a decision in a vacuum.",

                  "text": "Fee waivers cover most of the college app process for low-income. It makes sense, though, that schools charge an application fee. Although I can't speak for every school, I can speak for the one in question here (Stanford REA admit '21). Admit officers will spend approx. 15 minutes minimum on an app (assuming that the applicant is qualified enough, C/D students will likely get less time). The better the application, the more time they will spend with it. For those apps that make it to the final decision stages, it is not uncommon for them to accumulate an hour's read time.\n\nIt's important to note how insanely competitive Stanford is. I don't think any countries outside of America really compare. Some of the IITs have lower admission rates, but entry to those is contingent solely upon test scores. It's a mathematical formula elsewhere, and if your numbers are good you win a seat. Stanford, Harvard, Yale, etc. are different. It's mostly only those who think they have a real shot that apply.\n\nLet's break it down. Last year, 44k students applied for roughly 2k slots at Stanford. By Office of Admission's estimate, 22k are qualified for admission based on numbers alone. At this point, the game changes. The relevance of SAT scores and GPAs diminishes, the importance of the resume and essays shoots up. Stanford has stopped looking for qualified applicants at this point - EVERYONE is qualified. The task at hand, then, is to build the most statistically well-rounded class from 10% of those still in the running. That's a hard enough task as is, but when considering time constraints, especially those of the Early cycle, the immense challenge of admission decisions becomes clear. All this work needs to be compensated.\n\nFinally, Stanford is the most popular school in America. I don't know how ideally its perceived abroad, but here it's basically seen by high schoolers as paradise for nerds (this is somewhat warranted, but I'm biased). $90 serves, at the very least, as a deterrent. If applying to Stanford was free and only required a couple clicks and keyboard strokes, the entire application process would be *fucked*. And even if the $90 fee deters few, it's an easy cash cow for the university.",

I regard it as a further indication of the nefarious extent to which this \"Stanford\" ruse has been scripted--down to the smallest of details, the facade must be maintained. Our mother has also sent various inquiring, urgent texts, such as \"Hi I hope you're doing well,\" that have been coldly left unanswered. Clearly, they're paying her to keep mum: Stanford's soulless deceivers design such shameful scams boundlessly, duping students despite well-founded suspicions. \n          \nWe must take the blue pill to counteract the deceptive red of those orchestrating this \"Stanford\" scheme.",

Perhaps \"Stanford\" even secretly funded *the Matrix* later to cement a generation of cultural associations and analogies between colours.

The reason it has such a low acceptance rate and the reason you never see those people that do get accepted is the same reason; Standford University is a front for the CIA.\n\nEver since the early 2000s, the CIA has been using tests to determine successful candidates for CIA Field Agents. Anyone who does not meet the requirements ends up in Government jobs regardless though students who are expelled often find themselves crestfallen and resigned to eking out their existence in a place like an electronics store with \"Buy\" in the name. Those that do end up making the cut end up becoming superb agents and disappear off the face of the Earth via new identities.\n\nThose same dropouts sometimes find themselves involved in the world of espionage regardless and the CIA has even presented Diplomas from Stanford for exceptional work in the field. Just remember that these former students need covers and aliases so the next time you get mad at a retail employee, just know that he may just be undercover and he might know Kung Fu.\n\nHe might also have a friend who likes guns and Crown Victorias as well as a smoking hot blonde girlfriend. But hey, you did walk into a Buy More. What did you expect?",

I am pretty certain that Google and FB only hire from Stanford or Cal and I know all the other techies like to copy those two so yes, it's very common to deal with people who went to Stanford.",
