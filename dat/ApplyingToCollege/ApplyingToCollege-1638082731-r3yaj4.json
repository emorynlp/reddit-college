  "title:": "AP World History VS AP World History Modern & Application Issue",
  "text": "Hello everyone. I took AP world history in 2018 before the curriculum changed and it is now AP World history modern. \n\nUnfortunately, on my college board transcript, it says i took ap world history MODERN. the issue arises when im applying to california state schools for transfer. they ask for my ap exams, & the ap world history exam is worth 6 units for CSUs and the ap world history modern exam transfers for only 3 units.\n\non the csu application there is a choice for ap world history modern and ap world history, so i have no idea which to put! do i follow my college transcript exactly as is, or do i put the exam i KNOW i took? \n\n\nwhat would you do? thanks in advance :)",

      "text": "They never offered both WHAP and WHAP Modern in the same year.\n\nBecause the test was dated 2018, CSU should know that the test you took was the old WHAP. I would try checking with the school, but I'd think you would list the old version.",
