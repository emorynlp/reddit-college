      "text": "I think a big reason why I was so set on going to my university and not any of the others ones was because it was the only one I had not only toured but I lived on campus for 6 weeks for a program. Definitely made me feel more connected to it. All of my admitted student weekends (with paid flights \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d) got cancelled cause of covid. I wonder what would have happened if I had experienced all of them. (Although I did visit harvard but it was a very dark rainy day and maybe that turned me off to it but either way the campus isn\u2019t that great to me so that one I was pretty sure I didn\u2019t want to live in).",
