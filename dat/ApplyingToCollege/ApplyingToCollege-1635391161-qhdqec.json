      "text": "Experienced teachers can write a letter in a few hours. They probably have standard sets of wording for different types of students.\n\nThey typically need advance notice because while writing one only takes a few hours, writing 30 takes 30\\*a few hours, and they have a job and a life.\n\nYou may have lucked out in being so late that all of the others were done and there was no backlog.",
