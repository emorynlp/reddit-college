  "title:": "Feeling bad about tuition",
  "text": "I am an international student, which means I 1) can practically get no financial aid and 2) is invalidated for many merit based scholarships too. I'm fortunate enough that my parents are willing to lend me money for tuition and only expect me to start paying back after college.\n\nBut I'm still both worried and feeling guilty about this since sophomore year started. I managed to get a part-time internship so I can have some income, but not much. (as well as a thing I can put in my EC.) Recently I started seeking a second internship b/c the same reason, but my friends tell me that I'm being too stressed, I should focus more in classwork and I'll be able to pay back anyway since I certainly will earn more than now after graduation.\n\nIdk why I'm feeling this way and my friends seem to have a point. But I can't stop myself from feeling bad about the whole thing.",

      "text": "You can still get a bit of financial aid through need-based aid, as some (though certainly not the majority) institutions offer need-based aid for internationals. Lots of merit scholarships (some even full-rides) are also open to international students.\n\nAlso, do focus on your classes, grades, and test scores first before ECs. Those are generally the most important parts of your application.",
