  "title:": "Dear A2C: The world will still be there after your ED rejection",
  "text": "Dear A2C:\n\nAt this point you may have been denied or deferred by your ED \u2014\u00a0or perhaps, unfortunately, you're about to be.\n\nWhenever this happens to someone who has every right to feel confident in their application, they start to second-guess themselves, their application, and the ordering logic of the universe.\n\nWhen students ask me to do a postmortem of their ED app, we spend thirty minutes combing over their personal statement, supplementals, the exact wording of their EC section, etc., to hunt down any red flags that would explain the disappointing outcome.\n\nBut we usually won't find anything. The essays are solid, the scores and grades competitive, and there's nothing screwy about how they described the three years they spent as a competitive watch repairperson.\n\nThey (and you) were simply screwed.\n\nWhat I usually say next:\n\n1. No, you shouldn't arbitrarily consider re-writing your personal essay. You have no data about why you were rejected, so don't start second-guessing (what should be) the strongest part of your application.\n2. Admission is a capricious, arbitrary process. You lost, and you'll lose again \u2014 but you'll also win.\n\nMore on that second point.\n\nI believe that if you, or any qualified applicant, could theoretically apply to your schools ten times in a single cycle, you would be accepted **at least one** of those times.\n\nThat is, there's no permanent defect in your application that makes you \"unworthy\" for JHU, Chicago, Cornell, NYU, whatever. Rather, there is an artificial scarcity of spots, a highly-qualified universe of competition, invisible demographic trends playing out behind the scenes, and plain bad luck.\n\nYour sample size is too limited. You get one application reader, one roll of the dice. **Sometimes (in fact, most of the time) that just isn't enough \u2014 even for an extremely qualified applicant.**\n\nSo brace for rejection. Then, brace for more rejection.\n\nThen, get ready for an acceptance \u2014 to somewhere you probably really, really want to be.\n\nThings aren't so bad. The world will still be there after your ED rejection. When one door slams shut, five more swing open.",
