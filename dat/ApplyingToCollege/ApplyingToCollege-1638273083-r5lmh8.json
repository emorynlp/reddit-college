  "title:": "Typo in UC Application",
  "text": "literally submitted my application at 11:58 yesterday just to feel like i was ahead of time and thought the my essays pasted accurately into the text box, but one of them didnt \ud83d\ude2d it now says \"natnamely\" instead of \"na\u00efvet\u00e9, namely\"which is so frustrating!! but i'm hoping they overlook it or something bc the PIQ still makes sense. what does \"natnamely\" even mean! hopefully with the context before and the stuff following the typo, it connects for whoever reviews my application. i'm a little frazzled, everything else in my application looks good though. gahhhh i wish i could go back and fix it.",
