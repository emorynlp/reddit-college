  "text": "Had horrible depression sophomore and junior year and as a result have something like a 3.2 (few failed classes but rest are A\u2019s) gpa. I have good test scores (1500) and have rekindled my love for academics but I\u2019m sure my stats will get me rejected by most universities. Also I haven\u2019t really had the opportunity to get a lot of academic awards outside of national merit. Is there any reason why I should still apply Ed to t20s? Thanks in advance!\n\nEdit: guess I should add that my extracurriculars are fine since I am a competitive swimmer and do competition math and those take up most of my ec time apart from a tutoring Job.",
