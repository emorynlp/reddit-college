  "text": "My gpa is a 3.8 unweighted and psat is 920. Never took the sat. Would like to study psychology. \n\nI would like to apply to an hbcu but the acceptance rates are fairly high and the graduation rate is pretty low. I\u2019m wondering if attending a school with such stats would affect finding employment options in the future? \n\nCompared to many pwi\u2019s Ive found Interest in the hbcus tend to fall behind and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s representational of their academic services.",

      "text": "One reason is financial resources.  HBCU endowments are smaller than the schools you think of as their peers -- a school like Denison or Macalester has more resources than any HBCU.  A school like College of Wooster or St. Olaf has more money available than any HBCU that isn't named Howard.\n\nYou can also see from the stats that HBCUs are less selective than schools you might think of as their peers.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but giving a wider set of students a chance is going to result in a lower graduation rate.\n\nThey are also taking on more first gen students, and students in worse financial situations than their PWI peers -- a Howard student is twice as likely to take a federal loan compared to a student at Elon or TCU for example.  Basically they have more students who would get the most benefit from going to a well resourced school.",

A school's graduation rate isn't necessarily a reflection of the school's quality \u2014 Yale's 5% acceptance rate means they're taking students that would probably manage to graduate from the University of Phoenix (infamously predatory for-profit college). *The* graduation rate is not *your* chance of graduating or anything like that.",
