Many colleges require additional forms such as the CSS Profile or the college's own form, considering both income and assets and often noncustodial income and assets as well, and each college has its own level of available resources and uses its own unique formula in calculating need. \n\nRun the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply.",
