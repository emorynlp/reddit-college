  "text": "Ungodly hours bring the best out of me. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s such a thing as being both a morning and night person. Cuz like I get energy surges and a nice mood in both. Anywayssssss, I wanted to come here and ask the question: why do you doubt yourself? Who has reflected their insecurities on you so hard that you believed it? Why are you doing so in the first place when you KNOW you\u2019re an amazing human being who deserves nothing but the best? Take a moment to reflect on this: you\u2019re a perfect being of the universe who deserves to believe in themself. Acknowledge that. \nWe get caught up in stress, drama, social dilemmas and else that we let all thoughts wander in our minds, without stopping to think how that thought got there on the first place. \nI\u2019d very much like to hear you and help, from a gal who 6 hours ago was almost down to crying and wailing. \nLove you all\nA warm hug xx\nIsa",
