  "title:": "Looking to go back to College but not a Community College since it wasn't a good fit for me but don't know where to start.",
  "text": "Hello, I'm looking to go back College and I definitely need some help. I was C and B student in Highschool and I also was horrible in math and only passed the minimum math class requirement to graduate. I also scored low on The PSAT and didn't even bother taking The SAT.  However with all that being said I was accepted into two universities that I applied  to on my own but I couldn't afford to attend either. I then started Community College but dropped when I realized it wasn't a good fit for me personally. I tried to look for support but the entire system was horrible and even went looking around at other Community Colleges in my area but it was the same everywhere. I dropped  out have been working  for three years.  I've tried hard to just get any job that would be decent enough to save money so I could go back to college. Now I'm here wanting to college to major in Business or Business Administration with a minor in design or history. I know I will have to pay for it  out of my pocket but I don't care. I have a \"job\" that pays horribly  but has plenty days off that would be perfect for online classes. I have seen way to many legitimate universities that have \"Online Classes\" only  to find out that the name is just being used by one of those for profit ventures. I enrolled in an online class from the local community college but I honestly don't want to deal with them as they lack alot of resources and aren't a good fit for me. I would really appreciate some help as I want to go back and get a degree but I just don't know where to start.",

      "text": "This program, ReUp, is partnered with the university I dropped out of 10+ years ago. Under a year ago, they reached out to me to see if I wanted to get back into school, and I did. They were suuuuper helpful at helping me get back in. I think they\u2019d be worth checking out for you, since you mentioned finding the schools themselves too overwhelmed to give you close attention. What this program does is pair you up with someone who advises you, and the advisors are very accessible and resourceful, quick to respond to emails and all: https://reupeducation.com",

          "text": "I second this suggestion. I graduated from a smaller public school after attending three different community colleges. I definitely felt more invested at the university. \n\nA lot of those schools are offering online classes, so maybe a mix. I feel like meeting with other non traditional students was helpful both in my undergrad and graduate degrees.\n\nTBH, I know tons of people who went the non traditional route. I had no idea who I was at 18. \n\nBest of luck to you.",
