  "title:": "Will a B in junior year after striaght A's sophomore and Freshman year matter for t15 schools",
  "text": "It will be in  AP Biology. For reference, I am taking APES and AP Psych in UC Scout and AP Bio, APUSH AP Calc BC  Spanish 3, English 3 and Art in school. I will probably get a B in AP Bio ngl but an A in all my other subjects. Will this matter if I am applying for environmental studies and cog sci as a asian male in a competitive region? I am aiming for schools like Cornell and Vanderbilt and would love to get into HYPSM/UChicago/Northwestern or berkeley/UCLA\n\nSophomore year I took AP CSA in School and AP Stats in UC Scout and got striaght As and striaght As freshman year with no AP classes.\n\nI also took 5 DE courses sophomore year and got All A's in all classes. Advanced College Psychology Courses and College English were part of them.",

It will not be the reason for a rejection. Idk if it\u2019s parents/peers/Reddit/whatever making you think a single B is that bad, but stop listening to that source. \n\nCan confirm I personally know plenty of people who had more than 1 B on their transcripts who ended up at T20s",
