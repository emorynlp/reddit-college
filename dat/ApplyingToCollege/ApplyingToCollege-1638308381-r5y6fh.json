  "title:": "Is a LOR from an elective teacher okay?",
  "text": "From what I\u2019ve heard, colleges want core class LORs. I\u2019ve asked for one from my English teacher, but I don\u2019t think I have any other core class teachers that could write a strong LOR for me. However, I do have my yearbook/digital design teacher who I\u2019ve had for all four years. I\u2019m also planning to major or minor in graphic design (if things go well haha), so I think she would be a good fit for a LOR. The only problem is she isn\u2019t a core teacher, but since I already have one from my English teacher, do you think a LOR from my elective teacher would be alright?\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "Check the colleges\u2019 requirements. Some colleges *require* that 2 LORs are from core subject teachers (I believe Columbia was one last year). For those colleges, the yearbook/design teacher won\u2019t count. If none of your colleges require that 2 LORs be from core subject teachers, it\u2019s fine for you to submit that LOR.",
