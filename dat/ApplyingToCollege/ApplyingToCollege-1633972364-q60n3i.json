  "title:": "Would is be wise to apply to NYU Gallatin in regards to what I want to concentrate in?",
  "text": "I want to do neural science, emphasis on the cognitive and behavioral part, but I also want to pursue graphic design and writing, which is why I thought Gallatin would be a good pick. However, now I'm not sure I would be able to create a properly structured and *valuable* curriculum out of these three since they are wildly different. I don't know much about the designing-your-major process, so thoughts on risks, better options, etc? Any insight appreciated, thanks.",

      "text": "I do disagree with the other commenter, I am a sophomore at Gallatin and know plenty of people studying math and doing pre meds. \n\nI am not to well versed in entire science part, but as a psych student at Gallatin, I do enjoy learning about sciences in a way that many others do not (which also can make you be a more desirable candidate for grad school)\n\nI did a quick search as well and found a professor at Gallatin who studies neuroscience who I recommend emailing https://gallatin.nyu.edu/people/faculty/bm1589.html\n\nOf course if you do well in a more straightforward program and the more typical math and science education, definitely do recommend possibly applying to other majors, and of course it may not be able to offer exactly what other programs do. Gallatin may not be the right place, but given your multiple interests, I do recommend doing more research\n\nHappy to answer any more questions!",

      "text": "depends on your reasoning for it. Graphic design and writing in general are not exactly major specific degrees so I don't think it's a bad idea (and it gives you a talking point). However, if you're trying to pursue something more in the \"hard sciences\" category, you might be better off with a conventional program. You can always transfer out of gallatin or apply CAs and transfer into Gallatin if you want.",
