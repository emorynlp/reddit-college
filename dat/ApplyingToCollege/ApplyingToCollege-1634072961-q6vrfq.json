  "text": "I am currently enrolled in a community college and will be transferring to a 4 year in Fall 2022 as a Junior but, I have a few questions:\n\n1. I applied to 6 schools and have only heard back from 2 so far. How long do I have to accept a schools offer? I can\u2019t find dates anywhere.\n\n2. When should I fill out FAFSA? When is it due?\n\n3. When do you generally apply for housing? As stated above, I applied to 6 different schools so, should I wait to apply for housing until I\u2019ve picked a school?\n\n4. I plan on taking Spring classes at my current college, how would those grades go towards my transfer credit if the semester doesn\u2019t end till May but all required material is due by February/March?",
