          "text": "? No, UC/CSU/CCC schools are public universities meant to serve students of California as a primary goal.\n\nI don't know if you knew this or not, but three years ago, the acceptance rates for non-California residents at UC schools were actually higher than the acceptance rates for California residents, which is pretty crazy.\n\nIf you're referring to the fact that UC schools cost $67,000 to $69,000 a year to attend as a non-California resident, and the fact that UC schools provide no need-based financial aid to non-California residents, then I could see your point, but even then, the purpose of a public university is to serve residents of that state before other residents of other states.\n\nI don't know what state you live in, but I'm guessing you'd find it unfair if students who were not residents of your state and who did not pay taxes to your state had an advantage over you at your own in-state public universities.",
