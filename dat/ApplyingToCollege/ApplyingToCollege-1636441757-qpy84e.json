  "text": "Hope this doesn\u2019t come out as a dumb question. Other than the \u201cwhy us\u201d essay (which should obviously have different descriptions for each  college), is it advised not to reuse the same college essay for all of the colleges one is applying to? Or do you apply to all of the selected colleges with the same essay? Thanks.",

In that case, I think most people submit the same essay to all of their schools, though sometimes with minor tweaks if you want to make it a little unique to each school (though you could submit an entirely different essay to each school if you wanted, which I wouldn't recommend)",
