      "text": "I just finished up my first quarter at UCLA and I LOVE it. The campus culture and the intellectual curiosity that roams throughout the student body here is just so inspiring and it\u2019s truly an amazing institution. The food is great, the residential community is so welcoming, and campus just always feels alive. There\u2019s always something to do, there\u2019s so many student orgs to get involved in, and you\u2019re literally close to so many entertainment hotspots (I mean after all, it\u2019s in LA). Campus is so beautiful; sometimes i\u2019m just walking to class in the morning thinking to myself \u201cdang, i\u2019m actually here\u201d - it just feels surreal. It\u2019s always sunny in LA, there are countless opportunities to get involved in research and other experiences, professors are great, I could go on and on. \n\nI too really liked Yale as a school, but I didn\u2019t end up getting in. Thinking back retrospectively I fully believe that this happened for a reason because my first quarter here at UCLA solidified that this is where I was meant to spend my undergrad. It\u2019s not the same for everyone, but I feel blessed to call UCLA my home for the next couple of years and I want to wish you the best of luck. If you don\u2019t get into Yale EA, don\u2019t sweat it!! That just means something better for you is in the works :)",

              "text": "I honestly don\u2019t exactly remember my UC GPA, but it was probably somewhere around 4.0 UW/4.5 W. The number of AP courses shouldn\u2019t really be compared to others bc each high school has different offerings, but for reference i basically took every single AP that my high school offered (about 9 i think?). I feel like my essays were quite unique and i suppose my EC\u2019s made me stand out beyond my stats.",
