  "text": "SAT: 1550, IB: 43/45. Chinese female, but went to an international high school in Central Africa. My school doesn't calculate GPA (grades given on a 1-7 scale), but I got a few 5s in my first two years of high school; other grades should be a mix of 6s and 7s. Doesn't calculate class rank. \n\nI want to major in something social sciency, the top three rn are sociology, international relations and economics. \n\nECs, which I'm unsure about:\n\n* co-captain of a debate club but didn't win anything because COVID stopped us from going to tourneys, 2 years\n* some environment stuff, carried out a plastic reduction campaign on campus, raised money to plant lots of trees around school and we were recognized on local news so that's kinda cool i think\n* 4 of years of volunteering and lots of hours. led a team in an international community service project design competition, did research and promotion stuff, got no.20 tho\n* tutoring kids, paid \n* some miscellaneous stuff (art in summer camps and a really small exhibition in school, cultural dance in small festivals)\n\nWas rejected from Williams ED and feeling kind of :////. I know my 'GPA' (transcript) and my ECs are a bit lacking for Top LACs, so I'm trying to look for better fits (and safeties!) that are LACs or schools that have that kind of vibe/structure + suggestions of where I can ED2 will be very welcome. Not applying for aid\n\nThank you so much!",
