You only have so many good professors at the university, and there's a limit to how many students a prof can have per course with any chance of interactive teaching. Like, if you significantly increase the intake of students, how are you going to handle the increased class sizes while keeping education quality the same?",

Ivies and other top colleges don\u2019t work like that Bc 1. They can charge ridiculous prices Bc there is always someone to pay. 2. They get more prestige and power off inflating their rates and accepting less ppl as a proportion of the population every year. 3. They invest their money, get huge grants from the government , and get huge donations from donors and alumni. And we see it clearly works considering even tho they have the least amount of people, they beat any large college in endowment by billions and billions. They have enough smart people to set up infrastructure , and there are enough good instructors , and they can open to more students. Especially Bc more professors means more research which means more money, along with more money from students. Even though they pay a lot of people\u2019s aid 1. College doesn\u2019t actually cost that much and they know it , so they are taking as heavy as a hit. 2. Not everyone gets aid fully paid off by top colleges.",

                  "text": "Well, if you want to hire good, experienced professors, first you need to make sure that you have the facilities and infrastructure to support their research. Then, you need to make that infrastructure good enough that they actually think it's worth leaving their current jobs for this one. This can be kinda tough, especially for STEM subjects, since if someone already has an experiment set up, that can be practically impossible to move, never mind the people already working with them on their current experiment, whose skills and experience may be invaluable for the experiment to proceed on time. \n\nOf course, if you ditch the requirement of experience, certainly you will be able to fill the position quickly with someone who is looking to set up their own research team at the university. But there's absolutely no guarantee they're going to be anywhere near as good at the teaching part as someone who's been doing it for quite a bit longer, at least not until several years down the line when they gather the experience. So then you have students complaining about how the quality of the teaching has gone down with the new hires.\n\nFinding fantastic professors with specific areas of expertise is not always a problem you can solve just by throwing money at it. Sure, it helps, but in the end, there simply aren't that many people in the world with the required skillset, making things a tad tough. Also, you need to understand, that practically no professor will ever choose to work at a university because of the teaching, they're interested in doing science, so the university ranking means fuck all to them if the university isn't ready to support their specific area of research.",

Naturally a lot of them are very academically driven. A few of them get into T10s so my parents had this misconception that I could do the same. Got into a T20 and they were visibly very very disappointed \ud83d\udc80 I hear them whispering in the living room all the time about it and whenever we have a convo they slide in remarks like \u201c*insert colleague\u2019s kid\u2019s name* doesn\u2019t waste their time watching tv shows, everything they do is to get a better future, no wonder they get into these top schools\u201d.

In higher ed there have been talks about partnerships between more and less prestigious schools, but most don\u2019t pan out because reputation matters.\n\nAdditionally, despite the fact that most faculty are liberal, most trustees and presidents are not.  They amassed wealth and will do everything in their power to keep it.\n\nFinally, \u201cmaking college free for anyone who makes under a certain amount\u201d sounds good from an idealistic perspective and in a world where everyone has sufficient support to succeed it\u2019s a great idea.  Unfortunately, the sad truth is that many low-income/high need students are less well-prepared than students from richer backgrounds.  Yet many colleges (i.e., all schools in lean times when they\u2019re under enrollment pressure or schools whose social justice mission encourages them to try to serve students from disadvantaged backgrounds) admit them anyway, and then they fail out at much higher rates than the rest of the class.\n\nWhat\u2019s really needed is some sort of bridging structure to help students from disadvantaged backgrounds get the requisite academic and non academic skills to succeed in college.  Otherwise, admitting and funding these students simply amounts to setting them up for failure.  It\u2019s marginally better that they\u2019re wasting someone else\u2019s money for a few semesters of college instead of their own money, but only marginally.\n\nSorry for being a downer, but I\u2019ve seen too many students come to college believing it\u2019s their pathway to help themselves and their family to a better life...and then leave school a year or two later with a large amount of debt and no college degree.  Higher education has the potential to level the playing field and lift people to better lives.  But it\u2019s not a panacea.  \n\nI\u2019ll get off my soapbox now.",

To some people, knowing your classmates matters.  To others it doesn\u2019t.  To some faculty, knowing all your majors by face and name matters.  To others it doesn\u2019t.  Stanford can choose what it looks like even if it means they have to miss out on once-in-a-generation talents like yourself.\n\n(B) It\u2019s a form letter that everyone gets.  It was written by people who get paid to give the world a positive impression of the University.  It\u2019s as true as any other marketing correspondence you\u2019ve received.  Do you believe the emails that say there are beautiful women in your area waiting to meet you?  Do you believe your call to customer service is very important to the bank because the recorded voice says so?  If so, perhaps you aren\u2019t Stanford material after all.\n\nYeah, it stings to get rejected.  But don\u2019t get lured into the soulmate vision of college. There are hundreds of good places for you and one said, \u201cNo.\u201d  BFD.  \n\n(P.S.  I looked into the future and it looks like you dodged a huge bullet.  Turns out your freshman-year roommate at Stanford would have been a drug dealer who got you addicted to the party-drug-du-jour.  You failed out, lost everything and ended up having to whore yourself out on the streets of Palo Alto for lattes and the occasional 50-minute lecture from a closeted professor.  Ultimately, your used up husk of a body was found in a dumpster, your only recognizable feature being the \u201cShould Have Gone to Community College\u201d tattool across your forehead.)\n\n(P.P.S.
