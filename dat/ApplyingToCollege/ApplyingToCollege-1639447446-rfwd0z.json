  "title:": "Currently crying because I have to turn down my ED",
  "text": "Just like the title said, yeah I have to turn it down because even tho I got aid, my mother would be fishing out too much loans and I do not want that to happen. I know ED isn\u2019t easy to back out but I going to message the admissions office tomorrow and explain to them what\u2019s happening and hopefully they withdraw my app. \n\nFeels a little depressed ngl but I want what\u2019s best for my mothers pocket\u2026even if it means turning down my dream school.\n\nEdit; So guys I talked with the FA office and unfortunately they can\u2019t boost up my aid\u2014 but that\u2019s okay! Like I said, getting into my dream school is already a great honor as in international and I\u2019ll just remind myself that wherever I go I\u2019ll receive the same great education and thank you all for advice! :-)",
