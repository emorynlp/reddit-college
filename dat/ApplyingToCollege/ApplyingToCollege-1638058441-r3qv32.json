  "text": "So I accidentally put all the AP Exams that I took last year (May 2021) as AP Exams that I will be taking next year (May 2022) in Common App. However, I also put the scores for them so college will be wondering why I have scores for exams that I didn't take even though I did. I did this for 6 AP's. Should I update colleges or nah?",
