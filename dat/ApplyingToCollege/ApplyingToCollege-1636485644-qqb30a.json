  "text": "My friend who is a math major is taking statistics this year, a somewhat easy class here at my school (all math classes are college prep level and above) and is getting an A in it. Meanwhile, I'm an education major taking linear algebra and multivariable calculus first semester, and differential equations second semester (I really don't know why). I'm definitely going to get a B in both classes, and it's gonna bring down my GPA obviously, but I was wondering if colleges view a B in a really really hard class as an A in any other class..?",

I mean it lowers your gpa and at no additional weighted boost plus you forced it upon yourself. I'd say an A in AP stats is better but honestly no AO gives a shit.",
