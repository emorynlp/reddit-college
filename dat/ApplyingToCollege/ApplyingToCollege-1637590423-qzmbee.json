If I do get into a t20, my cost for college will be significantly cheaper (USC gives free tuition to any family making less than 80k).",

Golden, CO is a small town right outside of Denver, which means you get really great nature with mountains and a cozy town, but you\u2019re also within a 30 minutes drive of a major city\n\nAlso as far as engineering programs go, it seems to have a nice focus on gender equality, and is constantly trying to push for women in engineering",
