  "text": "Hey there, I'm a senior and I'm currently dual enrolling (taking calc 3 and a proof class). I've been a bit overwhelmed, though still doing well enough, and my question is whether I should take 2 dual enrollment classes next semester like I am now or just do 1.\n\nThe classes I would take (diff eq and linear algebra) would be a lot of work, but what I'm thinking is that I won't have to deal with the stress of college apps in the spring, so it would be fine. However, my counselor has suggested thinking about only doing one, and using the time to enjoy my last semester.\n\nAny thoughts?",
