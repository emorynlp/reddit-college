  "text": "How serious do colleges take your past messages and activity online? Like most teenagers, there are some politically incorrect texts that I\u2019ve sent in the past and even though my friends have reassured me I shouldn\u2019t be worried and that they aren\u2019t going to do anything, I\u2019m still paranoid. I haven\u2019t been able to sleep, and I haven\u2019t left my room except for school in the last 2 weeks and my entire mind has been devoted to worrying about this.",
