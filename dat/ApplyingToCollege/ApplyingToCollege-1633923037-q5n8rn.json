  "title:": "College Recommendations?? Stats, EC, and Interests Below",
  "text": "Hello, I am a junior in high school currently. I am looking into several colleges. I would like recommendations of schools I should look into that people think I would be able to be admitted to.. Here is my list of stats:\n\n  \nGrade: 11\n\nRace: White (75 percent Arab, and Muslim)\n\nSchool: Public High School\n\nAP Classes I have passed: APUSH (5), AP Human Geo (5)\n\nAP Classes I am taking: AP World, AP Calc BC, AP Spanish Lang, AP Eng. Lang, AP CSP, AP Physics 1\n\nGPA: 4.0 Unweighted, 4.8333 weighted, Class rank 5 of 523\n\nMajor I want to go into: Engineering (probably aeronautical)\n\nEC: Debate team (Ninth grade only, won a medal at a Gold Public Forum Debate), NHS (since 10th), Civil Air Patrol (since 9th, I now have a leadership role in that group since I have persisted so long), learning Arabic (outside of School)\n\nInterests: Aviation (taking aviation classes, working to start flight training and plan to get my Private Pilot's License by age 17, dual enrolled in aviation program at my high school), Computers (built my own computer, have a lot of knowledge in tech and networking), math and sciences (lots of knowledge on variety of sciences)\n\nI am in the Midwest, and I have recently been looking for schools near the area, but region is not a limiting factor\n\nI have currently been looking into the following: Iowa State University, The University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, and Arizona State University.\n\nI understand that the Ivy League Schools and probably the top 20 are out of my league, I would just like general recommendations of schools people think I could get into, and ways to make my application better (my ECs are lacking)",

      "text": "I think you can aim very high.  \n\nIowa State and Arizona State would cover you for safe options I think -- ERAU is probably worth a look if you want a really hands-on approach and are set on aerospace.  \n\nIf you did/do great on the PSAT and have national merit as a possibility, I'd look at Texas A&M  - they have a good program and offer a national merit scholarship that would make them very affordable.  CU Boulder is good and well within your range, but is pretty expensive for OOS and stronger on the astro side of things.\n\nUIUC is great - Purdue and Michigan would be excellent options in that area as well for engineering and aerospace in particular.  \n\nGeorgia Tech, Cornell, and MIT might be reaches but as long as you've got a good balance of safe options and targets go ahead and shoot for those kinds of schools if you like them.",
