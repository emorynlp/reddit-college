              "text": "It's pretty common for a few reasons. My father in law was a doctor and discouraged it for both of his kids, which didn't work out well. My wife is a surgeon and her sister is an anesthesiologist. \n\nA lot of immigrant parents who push being a doctor do so because they see it as a way for their kids to have the upper middle class lifestyle they always dreamed of. Parents who are doctors often are raising their kids with lots of opportunities and room to explore what they are interested in so they may be more inclined to let their kids follow their passion. Parents who are doctors also know that it's hard to have a good work life and home life balance. Doctors and lawyers are both severely misrepresented on TV shows too but actual doctors and lawyers know what happens \"behind the scenes.\" My wife also said that in med school it was easy to tell who was there by choice and who was there out of obligation and always felt bad for the people the who felt like they had no other choice. Med school is expensive and the job will consume a lot of your life. It's a great job if that is what you are passionate about but I believe the surgeon suicide rate is more than double that of the general population. That's obviously for many reasons but it's not a job you want to start out unhappy. Most of the doctors my wife works with, immigrant or otherwise, aren't pushing it on their kids. \n\nWe have two kids in high school. Our junior wants to be a doctor. My wife isn't actively discouraging it but points out other careers and options. Premed is a path, not a major, so if she majors in bio or chem or biophysics then med school will still be an option if that's really what she wants to do. Our sophomore does very well in science but it's his least favorite subject and has no interest in pursuing anything related to the medical field in college. I think my wife is relieved.\n\nEdit: I will note that despite the parental pushback it is still pretty normal for kids of doctors to follow that path. Maybe there is a genetic link (not in our case, our kids were adopted) but I think having a parent as a doctor makes it seem more obtainable and science is a common topic of discussion. My kid who hates science despite having high science scores says he can't help but do well.",

We have learned to value quality over quantity when it comes to time spent home, especially during times like these, and are pretty adaptable if she gets called in or gets stuck at the hospital and can't make it home when expected. I gave up my career in academia to be a stay at home dad when my daughter was a baby because with both of us working long hours it felt like our kid was being raised by someone else. Neither of us have any regrets and my kids both have a great relationship with their mom. My daughter even plans on following in her footsteps so they obviously aren't traumatized by it but it's very difficult to manage both. Earlier on in our marriage there were times where we would go days without really speaking to each other even though we lived in the same house because we were both tied up with work. At that time she was working 80ish hours and then bringing work home with her. It's not as consuming anymore but she still spends most of her waking hours working whether that's at the hospital or in her office at home. I think for the majority of surgeons their career will always be top priority.",

Up until getting into college, my parents thought getting into a top school would be the gate to getting amazing things in life. I did too  \n\n\nnow that i'm about to enter my sophomore year of college though, i realize that at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. graduates of top schools on average make more, but you have to work hard at that school to do that too. and making more money also often comes with a lot of hard work at your job and a lot more stress too. and while ik money is very important and can help alleviate a lot of issues (i grew up lower-middle class), it can create just as much pressure.  \n\n\nregardless of grades/school the majority of college-educated folks end up at similar positions/salaries in life, and it's just not worth it to always stress out and shoot for the top. i'm grateful that the career paths i'm considering will make a relatively good amount of money - probably as much as my parents make mid-career within a few years. and if i am to have kids, i hope to pass on my generational wealth and knowledge and make sure my children enjoy the little things in life more.",

A lot of people hype up IB jobs on this sub but have zero clue as to what that entails. That was my point :)",

Like I hate Biology and Chemistry and I dread the horror of med school but according to him it\u2019s not hard and people over exaggerate how med school is and he makes up bullishit about how easy the profession is. He himself is an investment banker and he went to Wharton and my mom is a Vice President at a huge pharmaceutical company and he tells me that if I don\u2019t become a doctor I will grow up poorer than I was as a kid and that will be shameful. I\u2019m blessed to not have any money problems but his obsession with me being a doctor is insane probably to a clinical level. I\u2019m lucky to live in North Carolina so I hope I get into my state school UNC Chapel Hill and then I will give a big fuck you to my parents and not take a single course in medicine and major in what I want which is Data Science/Finance. AP Bio was a nightmare that I never want to go through again",

Like you said, parents don\u2019t have to outright push you into some career field or discipline to get you to major in or pursue it, they can just set up your exposure to certain career fields in a way that maximizes positive exposure to the fields they want you to go into and minimizing exposure to \u201cundesirable\u201d careers and you end up thinking the ones you\u2019re most exposed to are your preferred choices. It\u2019s all set up from the start. \n\nI suspect that\u2019s what most users in this thread really mean when they say we didn\u2019t get pushed into certain careers by parents. They just steered you into thinking they were your favorites, starting from VERY early on. It\u2019s similar to political indoctrination where you only get exposure to one perspective on things. Hard pill to swallow I bet for a lot of people but it is what it is.",

Fortunately it worked out for me. I got a great job at Google and make good money (350k+). My parents are THRILLED. My sister was forced into the med route but ended up going into dentistry. They were slightly disappointed but are now okay with it cause she\u2019s making 150k/yr. My parents migrated here with architecture degrees (which people would pursue if they didn\u2019t get into engineering back in the day). So our household income was barely 120k and it was tight sometimes growing up. I am thankful for them now though. I have settled well. Safe to say my sister is doing well too. She is married to a Big Tech Engineer and lives in the bay area",
