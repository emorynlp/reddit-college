  "text": "I'm 17 f and I'm a bit sad about the discussion I had with my parents. They're opposed to the idea of far away colleges (including schools 3 hours away). They mentioned assault statistics and although I understand they're coming from a place of concern (and don't like the idea of me growing up), I eventually have to grow up and become an adult. I'm a cautious person and I don't go anywhere other than school and shopping. Should I, along with other women, really be that worried about college?",

Alcohol, drugs, hooking up with a classmate you barely know... all those things are where the risk is much higher.  And a lot of this risk can be managed by sensible behavior.

      "text": "Women are sexually assaulted on campuses all over the country on a regular basis. They are also assaulted outside of college. It\u2019s a sad, sad fact. \n\nYou can look at how colleges respond to sexual assault that happens on their campus. You can and should ask about safety to the admissions office. It\u2019s a topic that people are afraid to bring up. \n\nYou can and should be careful, especially with drinking and drugs. You can and should develop a buddy system with your friends. You can take self defense classes. \n\nYou can still do everything right and end up being sexually assaulted. It\u2019s going to be many many more years until this problem diminishes. It will never fully go away. \n\nYou still need to live your life. So be as safe as you can. Make friends with trustworthy people. And be optimistic.",
