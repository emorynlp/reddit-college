Also, my parents have had a specific college experience by attending a top university (not in the US though) and want me to have that as well. The pressure on me is mostly from me though, I just wanted something to \u201cprove\u201d myself. Also, my best friend got into one of the top schools in the country as well, and I want to match their energy (this isn\u2019t jealousy but it\u2019s showing me what I want to try and do too, for another school). It\u2019s stupid I know, but it does mean a lot to me",

I extensively look into fit; how well a school\u2019s environment and programs fit me is my absolutely priority over rankings. I don\u2019t think I have ever been a \u201cprestige whore\u201d hence why I applied to Brown (specific programs and vibes that really fit me but also good education w undergrad focus) and don\u2019t love Harvard or Princeton or whatever else. It\u2019s just that even though I love target/reach schools like UNC Chapel Hill and NYU, my family has told me I \u201ccan do better\u201d and I HATE that mentality but I feel like I\u2019ll disappoint them and those around me if I don\u2019t go to a T20-esque school. Especially my sister who went to UMich (a fucking fantastic school) but yet still wants me to \u201cdo better than her\u201d.",
