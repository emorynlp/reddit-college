  "title:": "Is applying with a clich\u00e8 common essay topic equal to shooting myself in the foot?",
  "text": "Title! I wrote an essay about growing up interested in Computer Science and surmounting a related obstacle that led me to evaluate my ideals. I did my best in going more in-depth into the topic and covering a lot of psychological aspects, but I\u2019m scared of applying with it since it's so common ://\n\nI started writing a second one, but I'm not sure about it's structure and wouldn't be comfortable sending it either. \n\nIn short - is applying with an essay like that an automatic rejection? \n(it\u2019s not a shitpost, I\u2019m genuinely curious)",

      "text": "It seems that there's a general dislike of essays that are based around things like \"oh I've liked this thing since I was young and I did a lot (or tried a lot) to get there.\" Depending on how you write it, some admission officers may find it either cliche or just straight-up snobby, in some cases.\n\nThat being said, while saying how you're interested in CS  and how you overcame obstacles to get there is fairly overused, as long as you state who **you** are (personality, goals, how you make decisions), admission officers are more likely to sympathize with you. An anecdote or short story that explains a bigger picture are good ways to start (ex: talk about a project you've done on computer science and the struggles in the process.)\n\nOh, also make a really good hook (like story intro, screenplay intro, something totally off-topic that you'll connect later in the essay). Admission officers would most likely be sucked in and, as a result, be more engaged in reading your essay\n\nTake this info with a grain of salt; I'm just another senior dealing with college apps. This is just some of the advice I've learned from my English teacher and college counselor. Nonetheless, I hope this helps :D.",

      "text": "If it is links back to you aka your personality then I would say that the essay is fine. Admissions officers have probably seen every topic ever written on the planet...the only way to make it great is by connecting the topic to YOU. At the end of reading the essay, the college should learn more about you and your personality. Good luck!",
