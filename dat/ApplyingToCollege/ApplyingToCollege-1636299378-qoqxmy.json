  "text": "I'm a current freshman at a large T50 private. I'm not miserable at my school, but I definitely feel like it wasn't the right fit for me for many reasons. I'm mainly interested in transferring to top LAC's, but I'm afraid since these schools are so small and many are overenrolled for the class of 2025, there will be little to no space for transfers.\n\nI am expecting to finish this semester with a 4.0 as a STEM major at a school that is known to be tough academically. I also had pretty good stats in high school (ranked in top 15/400 students, 34 ACT) but my extracurriculars are nothing extraordinary. In high school I played the viola in a conservatory preparatory program and ranked in the top 3 at all state. I also was pretty involved in a nonprofit organization focused on bringing music lessons to low income kids and participated in a few other less significant things here and there.\n\nIn college I play in my college's orchestra and am a member of a club for my major, but that's about it. I know I will have to join some more clubs by second semester if I want to even have a chance, but honestly I felt pretty depressed at my current school at first and had a hard time finding the motivation to join clubs. I also don't think I will have stellar recommendations as most of my classes are very large and I've had a hard time connecting with professors.\n\nMy top choice is Wellesley and I am a legacy there. I am also interested in schools like Williams, Amherst, etc. (I was waitlisted at Williams last year and did not apply to any other LACs). So basically, am I wasting my time by applying? Also, what is my shot at some more transfer friendly top schools like Vanderbilt and Northwestern?\n\nThank you so much for reading <3<3",

Given you have a 4.0 at your current school, which is well-regarded, and a good high school resume, the likely have good odds of being admitted somewhere.\n\nThat said, unless there's something unique to the school you're at that's making you unhappy, you may find that unhappiness will follow you wherever you go.  That is, it's may not be the school itself that's the issue; it may be that *no school* would satisfy you.",

      "text": "All of those schools are expensive and if you are getting financial aid they still expect your family to sacrifice quite a bit. Why pay so much money for an experience you aren\u2019t enjoying? At full price you could have a house in pay places instead. I would try to transfer and be a little more sure about what you want this time. Or focus on value for money and programs that will move you towards your goals instead.",

      "text": "The below points of \"make sure you know why you're transferring/that your problems won't follow you\" and \"make sure it'd be financially doable\" are good ones, probably the most important ones.\n\nIf you really are dissatisfied at your school, make sure to apply to 1-2 (or more if time) less competitive LACs at which you think you'd be happier. If prestige is a requirement for you to feel satisfied with a school, then it is possible the overall transfer process won't end up panning out.\n\nYour grades are definitely solid enough to be considered anywhere\u2014if your extracurriculars are \"nothing special,\" then I'd recommend focusing in on your essays. Do your research, talk to people at the schools you're interested in, and make your essays laser-focused on why the school's programs, environment, specialities etc. would be a better fit. For your top school, feel free to say that you'd choose it over anywhere else.\n\nNot getting extremely involved in activities by the end of your first year is normal (I transferred after my sophomore year and definitely got way more involved my 2nd year than my 1st), so just try to build up the relationships with professors you currently know and to do something worthwhile in the clubs you're already in.\n\nNot knowing professors *extremely* well is okay, but it does help to have at least one letter-writer who knows you by name and has a sense of what kind of person you are (I asked my piano teacher\u2014you could consider asking your orchestra director or a club advisor for a bonus LOR?) Also, the profs will probably send you questions on what to emphasize in their recs, so you can basically guide the content of their letters to support your application without repeating too much.\n\nPS: UChicago has an ED for transfers that as far as I'm aware is the only transfer ED program at any school, which does up chances.\n\nPPS: From my experience at a T10 LAC, they don't tend to be that much more competitive to transfers because fewer people apply to transfer to them. But definitely look up the admissions data from year to year to get a sense of things.",

Also, sounds like one of your main issues is size. Schools like Mount Holyoke might be worth considering they\u2019re super tight knit and friendly.",
