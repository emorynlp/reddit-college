  "text": "I have an autistic sibling (whom I love to death). I mentioned this three times throughout my application: first in my common app essay, second as a reason as to why I want to study genetics in a supplemental essay, and third in the COVID-19 essay. In all three cases, I used around 6-10 words and my sibling wasn't at all a major part of any of the essays.  Is 3 times too much?",

          "text": "I wouldn't say I changed because of her. Growing up with her has made me more compassionate and patient, tho I guess this goes for everyone with an autistic family member. \n\nEven the classes, opportunities, and events I had missed because of her meltdowns, I somehow made up for every activity. Everything I pursued became a little more challenging obviously but my sibling didn't really hold me back to the point where I totally gave up something. That's why I didn't talk about it more. I was even worried that mentioning her 3 times was already too much.",

              "text": "Well it seems pretty darn impressive that you were able to do everything even though you had to fully take care of an autistic sibling. I would say think of some things that were unique to your situation with having an autistic sibling, like the really small details that no one else could come up with.  \n\nUltimately it's up to you to decide if you should include more of it or not, just depends on how important of a factor you think it was in your upbringing.",

                  "text": "What I meant by '100% responsibility' in the original question was that I understand it's completely a must to take responsibility for my sibling, and not that only I take care of her (my mom plays a MUCH greater role). Maybe I should change that bit\n\nSo it's not really that impressive. But thank you!",
