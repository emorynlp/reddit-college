  "text": "So, I have already listed 9 activities on my Common App and I am confused on which activity to list as my 10th activity. \n\n1. Honourable Mention (2018) and President (2019) in a Regional University's Model UN. I competed with undergrad and grad students in 2018. Led undergrad and grad students in 2019 when I was the president. \n\n2. Co-author in a research paper (in collaboration with 2 national universities). It has not even been submitted to a journal yet but my advisor can give a supporting statement that it's on track to be submitted. \n\nCons with Model UN- \nIt's too common.... Almost like a cookie cutter activity for Asians. \nIs a honourable mention and being the president of a MODEL UN in a Regional university even impressive?\n\nCons with Research-\nIt's not even submitted yet. \nI have already listed 2 research activities on the activity section so a 3rd one might be kinda redundant. \n\n\nPS: FYI, I have arranged my activity list in a theme so my 1st activity is not necessarily more impressive than my 10th.",

      "text": "Depends on your major and what the research paper was about. I would put research paper if you have less academic related EC's. I would Model UN if most of your ECs are activity related. \n\nAlso, for your research paper, simply putting its a work in progress is good enough",
