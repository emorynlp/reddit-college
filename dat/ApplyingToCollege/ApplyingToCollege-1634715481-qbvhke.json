  "text": "I need advice for my personal statement.  I'm stuck and I don't know what to write. I've read a bunch of examples and watched videos , but still can't get to write anything. Another issue I'm facing is that I did not volunteer at all before because of the country I'm living in and the pandemic; hence, I don't know what extracurricular activities should I write about in the essay. I need tips please !!\nNote: I'm a current senior and will start to apply soon",
