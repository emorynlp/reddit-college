  "title:": "Can I list dual enrollment courses on my UC application if I'm OOS?",
  "text": "I'm taking a dual enrollment course with a university in Nebraska right now, and I'm not sure how to report that on the UC application. Am I allowed to put it under the \"Colleges attended in high school\" and \"College courses taken in high school\" sections? Or does it just go under the normal 12th grade section of the application?\n\nAsking bc I've seen differing opinions. The [UC website](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/counselors/files/quick-reference.pdf) says that you shouldn't put it under the standard A-G section and only put it under the colleges section, but my guidance counselor is telling me that the colleges section is only for California students who go to community college outside of school and that I should delete the college from my application. I would trust the UC website, but I'm not sure if it only applies to students in California or for everyone.",
