  "text": "Early app timelines are unnerving me. I quite literally had a dream where I was talking to the AO of the college I applied to (as if I was his friend) and in the middle of the conversation, he said he accepted someone else instead of me. Needless to say, I started crying (in my dream) and then I suddenly woke up from the dream and started crying (in real life) too. \n\nImagine having dreams about the AO of the college you're applying ED to (someone you've encountered virtually maybe 2-3 times).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just want to be done with this process.",

Nightmares like these suck so much, and I feel you and your stress about this whole process. Don't forget to rest and relax; I'm sure you did your best, and that's what matters most \ud83d\udc99\n\nIf it's any consolation\u2014I ended up getting a 1500+ on the SAT when I finally took it :) dreams are just that\u2014dreams.",
