  "text": "I'm in a ton of clubs in a public high-school but not many meaningful things to fit on my list. Ski club, STEM club, TSA club, etc. Frankly, these clubs barely do anything even though I hold useless leader positions in some. Should I bother to put them on my EC list? I put more meaningful independent activities and hobbies in lieu of these clubs and I'm worried they won't think I'm involved enough in my community.",
