  "title:": "scared of the small chance that I don't get accepted to any schools",
  "text": "It feels ridiculous but this whole process is making me so insecure in myself, I'm only applying to 8 schools but I'm so scared that I might get rejected from all of them (although I'll probably add more reg. decisions because of this fear haha) \n\nLike even when it comes to the safety school, I keep comparing my stats on various scattergrams (probably unhealthy behavior) and I very well see my dot right in the middle or even near the top of the cluster of accepted green dots, but there's always just those few red dots even higher up than mine who got rejected and I can't stop thinking about what if I somehow end up as one of those?? And that's just for the safety school, looking at scattergrams for target schools is even scarier \n\nBefore it was just a random fear and I could ignore it for the most part but now my parents are pressuring me to add more safeties as well, \"just in case\" and constantly mentioning how that chance is always there and it's made me feel so much worse about this lmao \n\nI can't wait until all this stress and pressure is over ;\\_;",

      "text": "There are a lot of reasons why the red dots might be higher/better than you on a scattergram. Those applications may have been incomplete, or late, or poorly written, or lies, or--very rarely--yield protects. Scattergrams only follow a couple of data points, they're not the greatest measure of how you specifically will do.\n\nIf you have a good balance of matches and safeties you'll be fine. I agree applying to a rolling admissions school might at least calm your nerves while you wait for the other acceptances to come in.",
