      "text": "I would say the school itself is pretty good, but I wouldn't recommend it to you if you're the type of students who thrive under highly intellectual or competitive enviroment; ofc that kinda groups exist, but it's not the culture there. If you're the kind of students who are just into their own stuff all the time, then i would recommend the school to you. You are basically going through tier 2 admission standards(if you're not intl students) for tier 1 resources and they are generous with financial aid, so seems like a great choice to consider if those criterias matched.",
