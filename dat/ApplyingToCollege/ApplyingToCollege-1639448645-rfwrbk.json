  "title:": "I have good stats, but I cannot write my college essays",
  "text": "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me, but applying to colleges is breaking me. I have never been a good writer or someone who enjoys writing, but I had never expected writing these essays to be so awful. I have good stats and some solid ECs (>1550 SAT, straight 5s on 8 aps, college courses, volunteer work, club leadership, nat merit) and if i was just a good writer I feel like I would be a great candidate. I love my major but it\u2019s in STEM because I can\u2019t write. (I love reading though; I read constantly to procrastinate\u2014another serious problem of mine) But I\u2019ve always had attention issues and I just can\u2019t write these essays. It\u2019s overwhelming and often after hours staring at the computer getting a paragraph or short answer done, I just break down. I just start sobbing. How is everyone else getting through these essays? Even when I think I can reuse them, colleges pull out specific topics and \u201cwhy this college\u201d essay. What is worse is that I think my entire life will be changed forever because I cannot focus and write a good essay. (well it seems like 30 essays) Please help with tips.",
