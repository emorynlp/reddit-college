  "text": "Hello everyone!\n\nI\u2019m concerned about my application to Stanford. I\u2019ve read that when the admissions officers read our transcripts, they only consider grades 10, 11, and 12. In addition, they also \u201cre-calculate\u201d our GPA based on the letter grades or numbers we received.\u00a0\n\nWhen they re-calculate our grades, I learned that all B+\u2019s are rounded down to B\u2019s, while A-\u2018s are rounded up to A\u2019s. I also found out that in the US grading system, A-\u2018s are equivalent to 90-92/100, which is similar to my school's B+ grade.\u00a0\n\nHowever, since my school does not use A-\u2018s in their letter grading system, will Stanford treat all of the B+\u2019s in my grade 10 report card as B\u2019s? If yes, this might give me an unfair disadvantage over other foreign applicants whose schools consider 92% as A-. Yet, Stanford will be unaware of this letter grade conversion since they likely follow the US system.\n\nMy counselor did say though that my school will send in a grade conversion, where A+ is 100, A is 96, B+ is 92, and B is 88, etc. Will these conversions be taken into account upon the recalculation of my grades? I seriously hope that all of my B+'s can be seen as A-'s.",
