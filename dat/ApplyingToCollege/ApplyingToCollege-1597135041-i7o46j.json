  "text": "DEAR CLASS OF 2021\n\nHey you, high school senior who has no idea what to write their essay about. Chances are, you\u2019re stressed about one or more of the following things. Your ACT/SAT score isn\u2019t good enough. Your GPA isn\u2019t as high as everyone else applying to Yale. Your ECs suck and you don\u2019t have any awards. You haven\u2019t gotten any research/internship opportunities, and you haven\u2019t started your own company or non profit. Guess what that makes you? A failure? No. A NORMAL FUCKING TEENAGER. And tell that voice in your head that\u2019s saying otherwise just because you can\u2019t live up to these impossible standards to shut the fuck up. Since when did literal children have to do adult things before even entering the real world??!!! YOU ARE NOT DEFINED BY YOUR STATS.\nYOU ARE NOT DEFINED BY WHERE YOU GO TO COLLEGE. YOU DON\u2019T HAVE TO PROVE YOUSELF TO ANYONE. There\u2019s always going to be someone who has done something better than you. That person you\u2019re comparing yourself to? They\u2019re probably comparing themselves to someone even better than them. You are capable of realizing your worth. And if AOs can\u2019t see that, it\u2019s their fault! If you\u2019re going to community college for two years and transferring to a state school, I\u2019m proud of you. If you\u2019re going to a random liberal arts college no one has heard of, I\u2019m proud of you. And if you\u2019re going to an Ivy League university, I\u2019m proud of you. YOURE GOING TO GO TO COLLEGE AND DO AMAZING THINGS WITH YOUR LIFE. I hate toxic positivity and all that shit, but just know that everything WILL work out. And after your senior year is over, and you\u2019ve written all those essays and struggled so hard with applications and interviews and scholarships and standardized tests, you\u2019ll be able to look back at all of it and realize everything that had to fall into place for you to go where you\u2019re going. And you\u2019ll think \u201cwhy didn\u2019t I see all of this before?\u201d So go do normal teenager things this year, to the extent that covid allows. Do things that make you relaxed and happy because this is your last year of high school, and might be the best one if you allow it. \n\n\nTLDR: IF YOU\u2019RE A NORMAL TEENAGER, YOU\u2019RE DOING FINE. EVERYTHING WILL WORK OUT. \n\n\nSincerely,\nA college freshman\n\nP.S: the tone of this post was very aggressive because I wish I could have shouted this to myself last year.",

      "text": "If this hit too close to home or you have a hard time internalizing what OP said, stop and remember that life is *really* long.  You have many, many opportunities to achieve success, whatever that means to you.  Going to a particular college or even going to college at all isn't an automatic fast track to success or failure.\n\nRead this.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fcwcrc/stressed_anxious_depressed_or_overwhelmed_this_is/\n\nConsider some of the following examples.  These are anecdotal, but so is your life.\n\n1.  A good friend of mine was placed in remedial math classes in 7th grade.  It was pretty demoralizing for him because he really struggled in 5th and 6th grade, and that felt like failure.  He worked really hard and something clicked for him.  He went to a no-name college that wouldn't be on anyone's T100 list.  He continued working really hard and went 9 for 9 applying to 9 of the top 11 PhD programs in his field.  He is now a professor at an Ivy.  You are WAY closer in age to his 7th grade failure than you are to his triumph as one of the very top scientists in the world.  Don't feel like it's over for you.\n\n2.  Another friend of mine barely pulled off a 3.0 in college.  He got fired or was laid off from his first 3 jobs.  He ended up starting his own business and legitimately struggled to feed his kids for the first three years.  But he kept working at it and gradually things got better.  He just retired a couple years ago with a lake house and a beach house.  I only know a few people who I would consider \"more successful\" in their careers than him.  But he probably wouldn't have called himself \"successful\" until he was about 45.  Life is really long, and you get many chances to come back from whatever mistakes you make.\n\n3.  There are tons of other famous and successful people who were nothing special until later in life when they achieved something amazing.  You might be one of them, you just don't know it yet.",

I just want you to hear this: \n\nI work in a competitive industry and many of my coworkers are ivy league grads. I went to community college for two years and to transferred to a state school. My wife works in media. She works with NYU and Columbia grads. She went to a state school.\n\nIf you pick a field to work in where being actually good at something matters, then get good at that thing no matter where you start out and you'll be fine. If you don't get into a fancy school, then do your best at whatever school you get into. Work hard at what you choose, be nice to people, and you'll be valued for your talent and skill.\n\nThose fancy schools definitely help in many ways. But they're not all that matters, and the better you get at something the less anyone cares where you went to college. UNLESS you want to be a college professor. But in the world outside of academia, being good at something is more important than having gone to a good school.",

Went to USC which was nothing notable back then (I say this from a admissions selectivity standpoint) and graduated with another 2.8. Oh and my girlfriend (wife now) and i got pregnant our junior year as well. Talk about stacking the deck against yourself. Nonetheless I always had self confidence and was good with people but just didn\u2019t take school very seriously back then. When I had my first son something just changed in me. I got a job in sales right out of school and started doing well. Worked my tail off and saved every nickel. Made a transition to real estate development in my thirties and took a major pay cut but knew that\u2019s what I wanted to do. Worked hard, got experience and ultimately started my own business and today most would consider me successful. In my 50\u2019s now and I look at how stressful can be for you all. Just know that it\u2019ll be fine wherever you end up. Work hard. Work well with others. And all will be fine in the end.",

And, at the last wave, he didn\u2019t get in. \n\nSo why am I saying this? To demoralize you? No. He ended up going to Illinois Institute of Technology where the Navy payed for 3 years and the school paid for 1. He then was successful in the Navy for 4 years before an eyesight complication. He now has a low 8 figure net worth, is married to the love of his life, and has 3 great kids (kind of complimenting myself, lol). He also ended up getting into Kellogg for his MBA at Northwestern. \n\nPoint is, a better school may give you more opportunities, but it really is how you take advantage of the opportunities given to you.

      "text": "The thing for me is just that I feel like I have so much potential but the colleges won\u2019t see it. \n\nLike I have a 31 act and a 3.8 gpa having took all ap classes. I *know* this is good and i am certain I\u2019ll get into at least one of the UC schools. But the thing is I could\u2019ve had a much better transcript. \n\nI trolled my first act and was taking it more as a benchmark as opposed to an actual exam. I studied for literally 1 week and took a practice exam. Every question I got wrong (or at least I think i did) I knew would be on the exam, I just didn\u2019t study for it. I also didn\u2019t know how to set my watch properly (since I never practiced ) which caused me to get a 27 in English since I had 20 questions to do with only five minutes left. Yet I still got a 31, so just imagining what I could\u2019ve got had I actually tried makes me so mad. And now I live in a covid hotspot and it\u2019s unlikely I\u2019ll get a second chance. \n\nAs for my gpa half I didn\u2019t realize till the end of sophomore year that grades actually matter for colleges, even if it\u2019s in an ap class. And so I\u2019m left with the majority of my bs just being from not trying super hard in sophomore year and just coasting. \n\nPlus both my parents went to top20 schools in the country and are really well off. So even though I know that I will be ok and can still achieve success, it just sucks to feel like if I don\u2019t get into a super good school I\u2019ll just be a downgrade from what my parents were able to accomplish with much less resources :/",
