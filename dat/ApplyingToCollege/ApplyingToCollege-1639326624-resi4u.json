      "text": "I\u2019m going for the blood sacrifice strategy. Ya know, blood for the blood god and maybe I\u2019ll be gifted some luck for helping our eldritch overlord a little. Plus I'll be able to say I gave blood, sweat, and tears to get into college. No joke tho I've never donated blood before and it seems like a nice way to pay it forward if I get in. Maybe I'll throw in some pushups or crunches too lol, but probably not on the same day.",
