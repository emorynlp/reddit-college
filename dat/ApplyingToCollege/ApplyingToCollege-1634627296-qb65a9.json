Afaik, there should atleast be a written project for English if you are from Science. Does CBSE not have projects?",

      "text": "There's no way you haven't written essays or papers for CBSE board. Let alone essays, the coursework for class 12th English atleast includes articles, report writing & summer assignments that include analysis work. This, I assume, is what would suffice? Unless you didn't attend English classes as attentively(I can't blame you, this is the tale of every CBSE student though). I personally don't find Princeton to be a fit for me but from what I've heard, what I mentioned should work. One clever thing to do would be to get your English summer assignment graded or if your school has the SEWA program(which I think is compulsory now? Like it's social work or something, I had mine since 9th), put your research work for that as papers after getting them graded by your teachers. Even science subjects have assignments like that, for example, my 12th grade Chemistry summer assignment was about soy milk(these projects work too + they constitute the internal marks). Best of luck!",
