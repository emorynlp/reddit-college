  "text": "I just realized I told my counselor that I am the vice president of a club while really I am the co-president on his info request form. However, on my application, I accurately wrote that I am the co-president. I'm worried this incorrect title either has ended up in the school report or LOR which have already been submitted, and it's too late to change it on my early applications since those have already been submitted. The sponsor of the club is writing a LOR to some of the EA colleges with the correct title, but not all of them. I'm kind of freaking out about this. Are admissions officers going to think I lied about my position if he said VP?",

If they even notice it, they\u2019ll probably just assume your counselor made a mistake. If it really bothers you, you can email the admissions office of the colleges you\u2019ve already applied to and explain what happened.",
