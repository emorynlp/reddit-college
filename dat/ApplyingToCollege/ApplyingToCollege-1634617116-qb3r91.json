  "text": "So im finishing up my college apps right now and its just hitting me like a truck. I have strong study habits and overall, understand the concepts in my classes, but when it comes to test taking in my social science classes, i have a real hard time. Ive always had some trouble in social science classes like history, because that requires a lot of memorization that i lack. I make up for it by studying but still. my gpa is about average unweighted and decent when weighted. Im well aware that its below the colleges id like to go to and it just makes me nervous because Im afraid of my family being disappointed in me.",
