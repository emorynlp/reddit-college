  "text": "In highschool I didn't give a crap about school and put in the bare minimum to get by, if even that. I have a gpa lower than 2 I'm not sure exactly what it is. I had no sense of direction no one to give me any. I'm 28 now and have grown a lot since then and I'd like to go to college to make something of myself. I got a 21 on my ACT. How do I find a school that will take me? Will it be worth it to go to a type of school that will take someone with my GPA? Will I get a decent education?",

I would highly reccomend applying to Berkeley and UCLA, since they\u2019re both ridiculously good schools, and you might actually have a good chance of getting in. Good luck!",
