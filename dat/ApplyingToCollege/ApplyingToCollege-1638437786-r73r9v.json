No, you can't apply to UCs right now if you submitted past the deadline that's just what it is. Also, if you have Fs I don't think that they will take you since they're famously pretty strict on that. Research public universities in California, i'm sure there are several cheap options with high acceptance rates. You can also consider CC if price is a big factor for you and if your grades are low.",
