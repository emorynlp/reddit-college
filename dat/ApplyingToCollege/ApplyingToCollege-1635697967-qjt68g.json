  "text": "I feel as shit as before. I submitted Babson, Union, Columbia and now I\u2019ll submit Macalester. I can\u2019t feel proud because althought my stats are \u201cgood\u201d my situation is awful; INTL student needing almost a full ride.\n\nI feel plain, even worse than before. I sat fifteen minutes after submitting looking at the confetti at 3 am wanting to cry. Fuck I hate not living in the US.",

      "text": "I'm really sorry, OP. This is going to sound ass and I know it, but it usually helps whenever I think like I won't get in to any schools because I'm an intl asking for aid: AT LEAST WE TRIED. At least we went there and prepared all those fucking applications and learned lots about ourselves while doing it. At least we became more resilient and willing to take risks.\n\nDon't forget to have backup options in your country, btw.\n\nWishing you tons of luck and hoping Columbia takes you.",
