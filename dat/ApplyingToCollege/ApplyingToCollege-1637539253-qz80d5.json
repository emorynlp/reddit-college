      "text": "It's vague. At least come up with some sort of plan for a future career. Ideally, your mission and goal of life should be tied to your career (Life isn't about just making money).  \n\n\nIf applying to a top school, then shoot for the stars, like maybe Fed chairman and a logical pathway to get there (depending on the school's resources). A former client of mine used that strategy and got into Yale, Penn and many other schools.   \n\n\nIs it a lot of work to do this? Yes! But it's 4 years of your life and at minimum tens of thousands of dollars. Too many students rush into college without really knowing why they're going.",
