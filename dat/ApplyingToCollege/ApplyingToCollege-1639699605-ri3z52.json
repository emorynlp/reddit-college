      "text": "IIRC the deferral rate for Princeton is very high, roughly 70-80% because that\u2019s just how they are. They don\u2019t reject anyone REA unless they\u2019re an *obvious* rejection. \nI believe that the percent of deferred students getting in RD would therefore be similar to the RD acceptance rate, or even lower, since if you were deferred, it\u2019s unlikely anything will change in your favor between now and then (unless something REALLY good happens in the next month).\n\nSpeaking as a fellow Princeton deferral lmao",
