  "text": "\nHello, so I know that Georgetown and CMU are one of those rare schools in the t20 that do value your SAT score. The only problem is they ask for all your SAT scores. I took the SAT four times (I know this will act against me) \n\n9th grade: 1420 and 1510 \n11th: 1460 (ugh) \n12: 1570\n\nWill such fluctuations in SAT scores hurt my chances when it comes to admissions at these schools? Should I even bother applying to Georgetown and CMU?",
