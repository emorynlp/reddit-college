  "text": "So the supplemental essays of Colorado College include one essay about extra curricular, one \"Why Us?\", and 6 optional supplemental essays, out of which 3 need to be done right? Or is it 3 out of 4? And the other 2 are required? Because the first 4 have a mentioned word limit of 75 words but the last two have no such word limit. I am applying through the Coalition App.",

Like What is your favourite mistake, which piece of culture that you are currently consuming you want to tell people about and others? Although come to think of it, it is weird that I can't seem to find any examples of these questions on the internet. This happened with CWRU where everywhere it said they had no supplementals yet there were 2 student responses. Is this a Coalition App thing then?",
