  "title:": "Pretty average student, what are some good universities to apply to with no application fee?",
  "text": "So, I consider myself pretty below-average as a student, so I only really ever thought about going to my state university, Rutgers. However, my parents told me that if I can get accepted to Northwestern or some other good university, then I could go there if I really wanted. I have some money that I can use for application fees, but I can only really afford to pay to apply to one more college.\n\n**My preferences for colleges:**\n\nPreferred Major/Minors: I'll probably major in History, but I would love to minor in Computer Science or Creative Writing.\n\nLocation: I would prefer for it to be somewhere on the East Coast. I could apply to a Brazilian or Italian university, though, since I can speak Portuguese and Italian.\n\nWeather / Size / Costs: Doesn't matter.\n\nPolitical Lean: As long as there is a socialist/Marxist club that I can attend I don't really care.\n\n**My stats:**\n\nSAT: 1480\n\nUnweighted GPA: 3.98 / 4 (my counselor said that I am not allowed to put this on my Common App)\n\nWeighted GPA: 4.66 / 4\n\nECs: Youth Orchestra and JSA for four years, GSA for three years, Park Service for two years, NHS for two years, and I maintain the school Minecraft server.\n\nAPs: I took six and I got a 4 on all of them. Taking four more this year.\n\nAwards: Outside of Hades Speedrunning, none. I think I have the one of the longest Duolingo streaks in the world, I guess.\n\nI'm already applying to Rutgers, Fordham, Hampshire, Northwestern, Pomona, Tulane, Glasgow, and Williams. I don't want to share my essay here but my friends in college and my parents thought it was decent. \n\nWhere else could I apply to? If a college sounds like a great fit for me, then I'll pay the application fee. Thank you for any suggestions.",
