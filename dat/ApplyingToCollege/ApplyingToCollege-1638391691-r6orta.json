      "text": "Depending on your state university system, starting at a community college may save you money and make it easy to get into schools you can\u2019t with your current grades. In California, for example, nearly all the UCs and CSUs have guaranteed transfer admission programs. You just take the right classes, earn a minimum grade in each and you are in. And in college you pick your teachers and can drop/retake classes so hitting the grades you need is easier than in high school. See what connections the schools you want have to CCs. Even UCLA, Berkeley, Georgia Tech, Cornell and USC take a lot of CC transfers.",
