  "text": "I\u2019m switching between thinking that I\u2019ll ace it and thinking that I should probably withdraw my application before I embarrass myself on zoom. Wish me luck \u270c\ufe0f\n\nEdit: should be \u201cHarvard interview.\u201d I\u2019ll blame it on nerves and not me being dumb.\n\nLast minute edit: My interviewer\u2019s name is James. I\u2019m debating whether refer to him as such, or go with the friendly nickname Jimmy. Or what about the classically comedic Jimbo? Decisions, decisions.\n\nUpdate: Jimberly is late. :/\n\nUpdate update: My \u201cHarvard\u201d is complete! Jim Jong Un was really nice. Pretty standard interview questions about what I was interested in and so on. Wasn\u2019t as anywhere near as bad as my brain told me it was going to be. Stupid brain.\n\nEDIT EDIT: this post is funnier if you know that [this beautiful image](https://imgur.com/gallery/PKDLtNH) was my zoom profile picture. I forgot to change it. Hope big H doesn\u2019t mind. \n\nALSO I wanna make a discord for us because I\u2019ve had so much fun talking to you! PM for deets :)\n\nEDIT: NOVEMBER 18th, 00:02 GMT got deferred lol, see y\u2019all in March \ud83d\udc95",
