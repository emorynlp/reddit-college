  "text": "I was curious as to the reputation of certain top schools. Which would you say are very cutthroat/competitive vs schools that are more relaxed? Obviously, all top schools will be competitive to a certain extent just because of their student body, but which are much more so than others?",

      "text": "To some extent, surface-level reputations about each college are reflected in the student body. E.g. Brown will likely have a more relaxed atmosphere because of its preexisting reputation of being chill, which attracts more students who want that kind of college. UChicago may have a more stressful culture because of its reputation as \u201cwhere fun goes to die,\u201d which (surprisingly) attracts students who actually kind of want that sort of atmosphere. \n\nBut as cliche as saying this is, how stressed or relaxed you\u2019ll be at a college is ultimately up to you and how you allocate your time and resources. I\u2019m at UChicago and I know first years who spend every single free hour studying in the libraries as well as first years who get wasted partying at least once a week. It\u2019s really up to you\u2014you can find a good number of people of either type at any college.",
