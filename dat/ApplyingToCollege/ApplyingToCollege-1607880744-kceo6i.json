No, we don't need ten different climate change clubs with ten different presidents that all do absolutely nothing, we just need one that can use its scale and large membership to actually do something.",

In scouts you embrace the suck and move on. Only those who wish to improve them leves actually camp instead of going on Xbox. While others are cozy in their home, eating actual food, and acting TV. We were freezing in water, covered in mud, fingers numb, and did we complain? NO. So please be quiet and don\u2019t ever accuse us again.",

To be a household name, to be on the lips of everyone around the world, to be the focal point on which history turned. Schools promote such insane requirements to be known as \u201cprestigious\u201d. To be known as \u201cthe school that produced the next Einstein \u201d, \u201cthe school that raised those who changed the world\u201d. Same with legislation. Politicians want to get their name out there in order to make more of an impact, whether positive or negative. They\u2019ll be known if their bill is passed and lifts poverty and homelessness. They can use that influence to pass more bills, and so on, whether it\u2019s to satisfy their selfless tendencies or for their insatiable greed. I can\u2019t say I support those who think like this, but I can\u2019t blame them either.",

All these prestigious colleges simply attract \"Einsteins\": the high-achieving and extremely talented students of our age. They don't turn anyone into successful word leaders or entrepreneurs. These students already have it in them to do so.\n\nI honestly believe that true purpose of education is to take someone who is down and out and turn them into someone who has the ability to be successful. The Ivies and all these prestigious colleges don't do that. They simply take the best of the best. \n\nMaybe that's how it supposed to be though.",

          "text": "I literally went around to the other 8 climate clubs at my school for several months trying to find enough people to start a new project and all the new interest I got was from people NOT in clubs. The doors of classrooms were locked, teachers had no idea they were running clubs, and the members were no where to be found (and didn\u2019t reply to dms). It was hella depressing and tbh now that we\u2019re in distance learning I don\u2019t have enough energy to do that kind of thing again on top of the volunteering I\u2019m doing with actual organizations. It\u2019s made me so pessimistic regarding clubs :/ sometimes I\u2019ll assume the worst of new clubs even when it looks like they can be actually effective",

The way I see it, assuming there is little to no [financial, transportation-related, etc] facilitation from parents or teachers, at most the club can manage to raise awareness and/or some funds around school and/or around the community...then what? Donate it to some random environmental-care eco-friendly organization?  Sure, if the awareness they raised was strong enough, maybe the community/town could be encouraged to reduce usage of gasoline cars for some time, or whatever else. But how likely is that? Ultimately, if it isn\u2019t doing something as effective as even *that*, or at least great efforts weren\u2019t invested into that goal, the club isn\u2019t even worth sharing about on college apps and resumes.",

Or maybe it's journalism: take the classes, join the student paper, start your own blog or newsletter, get a letter to the editor of a real newspaper published, volunteer for a paper or online news outlet, join national journalism organizations, attend journalism conferences, etc.  Go deep in ONE thing and have a distinct identity as an incoming student.",

As much as colleges keep explaining that they aren't looking for students that have all checked all the boxes, students keep trying to check all the boxes.  The bottom line is that you need to show a legitimate, deep interest in or passion for ONE significant thing.  If you can't, you're legitimately not of interest to a school with no shortage of students who can, as the school tries to put together a community of DIFFERENTLY engaged, passionate (about something) students.  If you're not that kid, just accept that you're not that kind of student and pick a different school.  There's nothing wrong with you, you're a typical senior. It's not your fault that there are a small group of kids legitimately doing dope shit and certain schools with small student bodies can have a whole class of those kids.  A few typical kids will skate by or trick them, but your chances of doing that are slim.  Just stop with all the angst over it already. Yes, you would do fine at those schools, pass all your classes, and graduate, same as the team of Avengers or Power Rangers they assemble and let in. But you'll do the same at the school that admits you, and you'll end up in the same place as those other kids, and if you don't, it certainly isn't because of the schools you each attended.",

Before then, I didn\u2019t know about the types of ecs that will perhaps get me into college. At school, I just joined whatever things piqued my interest, then left. I never had any solid ecs. Now, I regret that a ton when I see the stellar things others my age have done. But, I also think it\u2019s bs because how are we already supposed to have a \u201cpassion\u201d that would last all throughout high school, let alone after that. The teenage years are about self discovery. So shouldn\u2019t we be exploring clubs and activities during that time? \nI consider myself very skilled and smart (not only academically), but since I don\u2019t have solid \u201cqualifications\u201d or an impressive resume, I am not going to be successful? I understand that colleges want students who will be successful in the long run. But, I really don\u2019t think what a person may or may not have done in high school determines their future success during or after college. I mean, of course we would be more successful in college and after because we would actually be adults!",

My dad during this whole thing has been helping me with organizing my college application in the same manner that you did. Despite being total strangers to this process as immigrants, we were able to find out a lot by living in an area that's (in a way) like a East Coast Bay Area in that there are lot of rich people who seem very well versed in college admissions and how to work it. Idk why I'm writing this, but I just thought about that when I saw your comment.",

Just because I'm not the president of any freaking club doesn't mean I don't do stuff. I'm too busy trying to write 3 books simultaneously because I like all my ideas too much. And yeah, boo-hoo, I'm not in student government because I don't want to waste my time planning homecoming (and that is all my student government does, I know people in it) when I don't even like parties, I'd rather spend it actually doing things that I care about, like reading books because that's actually fun (and no that's not just my nerd brain speaking) or doing karaoke with my friends. Maybe I haven't solved climate change but I pick up trash from my local beach because that stuff is nasty and I don't want little kids to have to search through old beer bottles when looking for shells for their sandcastles. Just because it doesn't seem that wide-impacting or significant to you, doesn't mean that it's not meaningful to me. I'm fucking 17 years old, I'm trying to learn and actually enjoy my youth, I'm not a retiree with too much time on her hands.",
