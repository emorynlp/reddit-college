I'd say\n\nDuke - Harvard (really prestigious old rich kid school that ranks top 10)\n\nVandy - Columbia (Big City campus, lots of greek life, climbing up the ranks quickly)\n\nEmory - Yale (Where the duke rejects go)\n\nTulane - UPenn (simps for their ED applicants, everybody studies business)\n\nRice - Brown (premed liberal vibes)\n\nWake Forest - Dartmouth definitely. (small liberal arts very expensive school in the middle of nowhere)\n\nUVA - Cornell (very large university with a strong engineering that gets overlooked)\n\nPrinceton would probably also be duke, but to vary a little bit\n\nW&L - Princeton(Small and focused on undergraduate, tight student community, only one grad school)",

Both schools also do an excellent job when it comes to career placement. \n\nEmory/Rice on the other hand, are known for a more intellectual vibe. I can\u2019t really decide on which of the two would be more \u201cHarvard-like\u201d as Rice has the residential college system that makes it similar to Harvard, yet Emory is good at the \u201crich people sports\u201d (which Harvard is also good at). I guess I\u2019d go with Emory since it has a fairly northeastern-heavy student body and is somewhat preppy.",
