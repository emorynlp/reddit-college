  "title:": "Need help with the Recommendation of Counselor in Common App.",
  "text": "I am an international student trying to apply for fall 2022 in the United State Universities. I completed my common application and applied to some colleges. I asked my high school's principal (since we don't have a counselor) to accept my invitation, he chose the offline way and filled the form and two other subject teachers wrote recommendation letters for me.\n\nBut the problem I got is that they will not be able to mail the evaluation papers and the letters to each college, so, they gave me the evaluation paper and the letter of recommendation written on the school's paper pad with the school's stamp and their signature and told me to email those documents to each college by myself.\n\nCan I email each college by myself? What can I do now?",

      "text": "I'm assuming you are talking about physical documents here. You can't email physical documents. Not unless you open them and scan them yourself, which is a no-no in this case. If I remember correctly from the last cycle they don't consider school records submitted by the student to be official documents.  \n\nThere should be instructions for mailing them on the school's website. If they specify they should be mailed by your school, shoot the school you're applying to an email asking them for guidance. They can help you from there.",
