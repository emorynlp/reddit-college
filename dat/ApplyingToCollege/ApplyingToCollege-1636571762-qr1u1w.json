You prob wont find ice climbing classes or other specific intense outdoor activities, but Ithaca is a similar sized town, lots of beautiful lakes nearby just like Burlington and and they same artsy laid-back vibe-  I've had a ton of friends go to both.  If you really want extreme outdoors though your prob better off looking west instead",
