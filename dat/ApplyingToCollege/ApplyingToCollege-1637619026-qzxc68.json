  "text": "Title? \nI\u2019m int\u2019l student and i was applying to USC this December. Later it came to my attention that USC doesn\u2019t offer need-based fin.aid for int\u2019l applicants and less than 1% is considered as merit scholarship. My question is: does USC offer full ride scholarship to int\u2019l student? If no, what\u2019s the solution?\ud83d\ude12",
