  "text": "I applied to 7 schools EA and Syracuse for my ED. I have not gotten an interview request from any of them. I keep seeing post about people getting interviews and being worried. I noticed that everyone posting about them are getting them from super schools like UC Hicago or Cornell. Even someone I know in person is having an interview with UPenn tomorrow. So I was wondering if it was just these top top schools that do interviews, or is something up with me? \n\nAlso for reference, None of the schools I applied to are in the T50 of the states, so idk if its just something super schools do.\n\nI'm starting to get worried that I missed something in my application and thats why i'm not getting any interviews. \n\ntldr: Why have I not gotten interviews from any of the colleges I applied to, is it something most schools don't do, or did I mess something up in my application??",

      "text": "I know for some schools, you actually have the option to request/schedule an interview date on your own (optional) instead of waiting for them to offer you one. I was able to request an interview for Case Western Reserve, Brandeis, and College of Wooster, none of which are T20s, but then I was also able to request an interview for Swarthmore, which is very selective. (I was able to get interviews for all of them, but I also requested one for Tufts and haven\u2019t gotten one yet, so it\u2019s not always a guarantee that you\u2019ll actually get one). \n\nBut I think the lack of interview offers comes from a combination of them having a finite amount of admission officers/willing alumni interviewers + it could also depend on the availability of these interviewers in your specific region. T20s get A LOT of applicants, so for them to offer the option for prospective students to self-request/schedule interviews would be a nightmare. For the ones that DO get interviews, it\u2019s pretty random (I would assume, not 100% sure). I\u2019m sure that there are many T50s that offer interviews, but they may just be for scholarship opportunities/honors colleges where they would actually need a bit more information from the specific applicants interested in those opportunities.\n\nTLDR; Interviews aren\u2019t just something T20s do, but quite a few schools that conduct interviews are going to handle them differently (some have enough availability to let you self-request, some let you self-request but you still may not get one, some don\u2019t let you self-request and just offer them, and some are only for scholarships/other opportunities \u2014 and ofc, some don\u2019t have an interview option at all)\n\nHope this helps! :)",

      "text": "IMO size is more important in interviews, I\u2019ve noticed Ivy+ and smaller LACs are the ones which prioritize interviews. For Ivy+ it\u2019s another differentiating factor in the mass of apps and as UPenn says, it\u2019s a way to keep their alumni engaged and donating, my ED is UPenn and got an interview almost immediately, their goal is to interview 100% of applicants. In LACs, fit is generally really big, and even if not required is highly encouraged (in my interview with an LAC, it was with my actual admissions officer who had my whole app in front of her LOL, not just a normal alum). Comparatively, even other top schools like UVA, due to their size, don\u2019t do interviews at all. Most big schools don\u2019t, neither of my state flagships don\u2019t them, even for most of their selective programs.\n\nAnd honestly, the interview is never a make or break factor. Colleges always realize that esp with alumni, reviews are subjective, one alumnus might give an average of 5/10 while another one gives everyone 10/10s. Plus, if they\u2019re random, who knows if your interviewer just doesn\u2019t have any shared interests (you might have heard the story on here of the Environmental Science major being interviewed by a Houston oil baron\u2026luckily I ended up with a Wharton finance alum and that\u2019s exactly what I applied for).",

          "text": "Yes, it's definitely a thing with LACs. My daughter applied to a bunch back in 2019-20, ranging from T15 to T60 and had interviews with all of them. Most of them she did as part of her campus visits (you could select that option when registering) and she also requested a few afterwards (and got them). Basically she had all her interviews before she even applied. So, it varies a lot and yes, I wouldn't stress about that in the OP's situation.",

      "text": ">Why have I not gotten interviews from any of the colleges I applied to ...None of the schools I applied to are in the T50\n\nYou can check each school's website to see if they offer interviews. Most colleges don't offer interviews. The whole \u201cT-arbitrary number\u201d thing is silly. I agree with the general consensus on this sub that II is not an important factor in college admissions. However, I don't believe selective colleges would waste time and resources to interview people they aren't interested in.  I don't believe alumni availability is an issue either since all interviews are virtual now. Unlike med school admissions, no II doesn't mean rejection in college admissions. But if applicants to highly selective colleges can't think of a good reason why they are auto admits, no II can't be a good sign.",
