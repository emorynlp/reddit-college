  "text": "I am a second year CA community college look to transfer to UCLA next fall.\n\nI want to study sociology or education and transformation studies. However, I can not find the education studies transfer rate online. Perhaps it is a new major.\n\nShould I put sociology as my major and education as my alternate or the other way around?\n\nAlso, if I am equally decided on two different majors and am applying to UCSD, should I put the major with the lower or higher transfer rate as my major and the other as my alternate for the best chance to get into the school.\n\nThanks!",
