      "text": "It's really up to you, but a lot of people change their major in college once they find something they are truly passionate about. While CS/Econ/Eng majors tend to make more money, I'd say that it may not be the case for those who have one of those degrees when it's not something that they are passionate about. Pursue your passions to the extent that you are able, you can look into what jobs tend to be higher paying for your intended major, learn more about these careers in college, but don't force yourself into a career that you'll hate for the rest of your life. Have fun, and good luck!",

With that being said though, not every opportunity is meant for everyone.\n\nIf you pick something you hate, you won't be able to learn about it. Interest and curiosity are the main drivers of learning. If you aren't interested in the subject you won't want to engage with the curriculum. It'll just seem confusing, irritating, and pointless.\n\nFor the majority of people, economic stability comes with age (and some luck). You should focus on what you enjoy doing - you're already on track for a college education, which should increase your earnings regardless of what specific major you choose, and if I'm not mistaken both English and International Relations can make for some suprisingly lucrative career paths (e.g. diplomacy).",
