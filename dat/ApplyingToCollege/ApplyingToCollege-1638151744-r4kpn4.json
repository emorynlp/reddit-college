  "title:": "There\u2019s nothing I hate more than Princeton\u2019s \u201cGraded Essay\u201d requirement\u2026",
  "text": "I\u2019ll write anything but that! I love the campus and Princeton as a town so much, not to mention the ORFE program is so perfect, toured the place and felt at home. I can write whatever introspective or pandering supplement you want and my stats/ECs are on par, but the graded essay requirement is killing me. \n\nLong story short, I had a rocky relationship with my junior year AP Lit teacher and absolutely refuse to ask him to regrade one of my papers with feedback, and we haven\u2019t (and won\u2019t) write more essays in this year\u2019s AP Comp/Lang. \n\nSo I have no graded essay, and therefore, pton is no longer for me\u2026",
