  "text": "long story short some of my financial aid documents got screwed up\u2026 \ni applied EA - uchi received my CSS on nov 1st but not my fafsa until today and  i didn\u2019t know that documents had to be uploaded into the portal bc my school\u2019s guidance counselor (who quit 2 weeks ago) told me they didn\u2019t so i did that just now\n\nhow should I proceed, should I call admissions? I probably should\u2019ve emailed them before this oops\n\nalso, do you think that the fact that no one has reached out regarding missing documents means that I wasn\u2019t accepted LOL\n\nany guidance would be super appreciated :))",
