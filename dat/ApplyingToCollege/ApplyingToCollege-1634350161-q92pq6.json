  "text": "I just got my SAT score and it is not satisfactory. So I want to take the test again in december. But I need to apply early this year and the deadline is November. I e-mailed some university to know if I can report the SAT score later but most of them replied in negative. Now I'm very confused about what to do. I need some suggestions.",
