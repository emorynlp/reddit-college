  "text": "Hi all, I applied REA to Stanford and I was wondering if I should update my application with Gates Scholarship Semi-finalist, since the results were released today. \n\nIs it something worth updating for, or is it too late to affect my admissions file anyway? It's already Dec 1st, and results are probably coming out on the 10th (or 3rd!?).\n\nThank you, and good luck with your apps!",
