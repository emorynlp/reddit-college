  "text": "Now I know that this is a college admissions subreddit and all that and you probably think I'm asking for extracurriculars that I should do to get accepted to Harvard or something like, let me make it clear, I do not want that. Even though I don't want that though, I can't think of what I'm passionate about to be a part of extracurriculars for that passion. In summary, I want to find a passion to enjoy myself instead of wanting to find ECs for admissions, but don't know how to find the passion. Any advice?",

This can mean things like baking or reading\u2026 really anything can be turned into a project. \n\nIf not, maybe join some clubs or watch some cool YouTube videos on things that intrigue you. There are so many great things in the universe to get excited about :)",

Or just interview people that you think are doing awesome things. \n\nMaybe look if there are any clubs or other opportunities in your area. You could take classes at art studios, volunteer with an organization, etc. \n\nTime travel is a fun topic, not stupid at all. Maybe make some videos on that? If you do enough research on it you could probably make your own documentaries!",

But time travel and YouTube still don't really fit that bill, more like don't have anything else to do so I just do it, sorry to be making this seem like I'm just deflecting everything right now and not really clarifying from the beginning\n\nReally thanks for the help though! Even if it may seem like I'm deflecting but it genuinely is opening my mind to things",

You shouldn\u2019t force yourself to enjoy something. \n\nBut also you don\u2019t need to wake up in the morning always 100% excited about something to be passionate about it either. \n\nJust try out some things and see if they work for you. There\u2019s no pressure :)",
