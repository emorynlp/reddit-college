  "text": "So I\u2019m really stuck. I\u2019m pretty much on my own and financially independent. I have my dad but he is very unsupportive and isn\u2019t able to help me with anything. I\u2019m half way through my semester at college and I have a hold on my account because I haven\u2019t paid my tuition and I\u2019m completely stuck. I don\u2019t have credit to pull out a loan and my dad was denied the \u201cparent plus loan\u201d. I don\u2019t know what to do because I don\u2019t have credit and I can\u2019t get my own loans and I really want to continue with school. I don\u2019t know what to do. Are there options that schools offer to people who are like me? Are there any programs that could help me?\n\n\n(I know I should have been more prepared, but I truly didn\u2019t know how paying for college worked. I thought you were just offered loans and you accept them. I didn\u2019t know you had to get approved or denied. Before I even applied to school, I asked my dad how paying for college works and that\u2019s what he told me so please don\u2019t tell me I should\u2019ve have been prepared bc I tried).",
