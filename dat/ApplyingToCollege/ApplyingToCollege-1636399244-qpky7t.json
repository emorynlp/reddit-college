Prior to that, the Big 10 had ads with all the schools flags in them -- including Chicago's; Chicago told them to knock that off pretty quickly.\n\nThe Nebraska addition was a *major* schism. Before that, the Big 10 was proud to be only one of two conferences with all members in the AAU (in addition to the UAA). Right before Nebraska was added, they got booted from the AAU... and that's the sort of thing it would easily take a century to revert. Nebraska also wanted to drag in all the other Nebraska campuses which led to a hard-line on affiliates. That mean ejecting UW-Milwaukee and UIC (an R2 and an AAU-contender R1). Thus adding Nebraska to the Big 10 forced a bunch of changes which meant the research profile of the CIC went down. (One Big 10 Vice-Provost I talked to was *livid* \\-- so angry they debated leaving because athletics had grown too strong.)\n\nThe CIC became the Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) and it was at that time that Chicago pulled the rip cord and exited the CIC/BTAA. It seems they even insisted on most references to Chicago being scrubbed -- since there were some history references added to the new website but those disappeared quickly. Their may be some tiny bit of association left via the Traveling Scholar program... though maybe 80% of that was exchanges b/w Chicago, Northwestern, and UIC and maybe 15% was exchanges between Michigan and Michigan State. The TSP went from a crown jewel to a minor bauble in a matter of months.\n\nSo not only did Chicago leave the Big 10 decades ago, they stomped out the last vestiges of relations once the Big 10 seemed to pay more heed to athletics than academics.",

I've seen references to this at other member schools, but those memos seem to all be scrubbed or behind secure walls. Not surprised they keep it on the downlow: the [members of the Ivy Overlap Group (Ivy League + MIT) were charged with price fixing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/09/03/mit-aid-process-violates-antitrust-law-judge-finds/f11a2386-e577-4d70-a06f-4213866d6203/) because they equalized aid packages.\n\nIt's also an athletic conference with mostly so-so athletes, so nobody's traveling to Chicago to play them or, worse, to California to get wrecked. So... MIT.\n\nAs for any of WashU, Chicago, Case Western, Emory, Carnegie Mellon, Rochester, or NYU... they're [already in the UAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Athletic_Association) and have made nothing out of that. (JHU even used to be in the UAA.)",

By equalizing financial aid so that applicants made their choices strictly on academics, the overlap schools effectively restricted prices which meant they did not have to compete with one another and offer more aid. Now, their argument was that students should choose based on fit, not money (since they could all offer sufficient money), but did that maybe stop some schools from offering more aid? Probably. Hence price fixing.",

Don\u2019t carry the same number of sports. Athletics is more on the periphery.\n\nAs for the question, there won\u2019t be a ninth Ivy. If there is a reshuffle, it will be due to three things:\n\n1-the Ivies catching additional flack for athletic pref \n\n2-a few more years of NCAA incompetence\n\n3-big state schools deciding to get greedy with football revenue, breaking away, and dumping their private counterparts. The NUs of the word decode that without the football revenue, running a big D1 program is more trouble than it is worth. \n\nIn which case I could see most of the private AAU schools and a few others ditching the NCAA altogether and forming their own organization that extends to further academic cooperation. Athletically it would fall somewhere between current Ivy level and high end D3. Ivies + UAA + Rice, NU, Vandy, Duke, Tulane, MIT, JHU, Tufts, BU. Maybe Georgetown. Maybe Wake Forest. Maybe some Patriot League schools as well. Schools like USC, Stanford and Notre Dame would likely stay where they are. \n\nThe Ivy League would still be the Ivy League. But there would be scholastic and athletic ties within this new association and other conferences would form within the association. It seems a bit crazy now, but over the next 20-25 years, this is as likely as the status quo.",

I'd also agree this is likely to happen from football schools getting greedy.\n\nPity was letting JHU go instead of just giving them an out on lax.",

And they think of something else entirely when someone mentions AAU. It\u2019s a D3 athletic conference with some degree of collaboration of extremely strong institutions with underwhelming compared to their quality. \n\nRe:JHU. The problem with JHU wasn\u2019t that the UAA wasn\u2019t keen on the lax exemption. It might have been spun that way by certain groups who felt rejected by JHU when they left. The real problem was that JHU found it easier to have an all in one (except lax) close to home. Less travel. No need to join other conferences for both football and baseball. That\u2019s not a luxury that several other members have. D3 schools are fairly scarce in Missouri and many of its neighboring states for example. D3 is kind of an awkward hodgepodge classification anyway. When I was at WashU, I remember teams going to Trinity in San Antonio, Grinnell, Kenyon, etc to play remotely similar schools. There was always an obligatory Fontbonne or Westminster game, but most of the D3 schools tended to be in fairly remote locations at least 3-7 hours away. Just as easy to jump on a plane to go to Boston or Atlanta at that point. \n\nIf certain members of the power 5 conferences get greedy, the I could see schools either leaving the NCAA or at least D1 with the NCAA caving on sport specific exemptions.\n\nThe originally envisioned Magnolia League (Rice, Tulane, Vandy, Emory, Duke, Wake Forest) teaming up with UChicago, NU, WashU, Case as a 10 university Ivy affiliate. \n\nThe other 4 UAAs + JHU, BU, MIT, Tufts, Georgetown, maybe one other school doing something similar in the northeast. \n\nThose 28 or so schools would partner and do their own thing or force the NCAA to create different divisions.",

USC, Stanford, BYU, ND?  Sure. Maybe BC. And the Texas football schools. If the major conference flagships break away, they don\u2019t need to take a Duke, Vandy, NU, Wake, Rice or Tulane with them. Schools like Cincinnati, Memphis, Temple, UMass and UConn are more valuable in that endeavor. More alumni and the alumni are more concentrated, which works better for TV markets. I can\u2019t imagine something like this not happening in the next 15-20 years even if TV markets are irrelevant with on demand programming. \n\nAnd when it happens, it will be interesting to see what the schools left out decide to do. There\u2019s probably more value to them running sports like more of a D2 (but non-scholarship) level with the Ivies and the schools I mentioned as its own alternative brand than trying to exist as a D1 entity on more of mid-major level in other sports while playing football at an FCS level.",

In the Mid-Atlantic or Northeast region.** *This knocks out schools like UChicago, Stanford, and Duke, which I'd consider to be in the South, not the Mid-Atlantic.*\n\n**3. \"Old Money\" prestige.** *I know Tufts isn't as \"old money\" as Harvard or Princeton, it still has that level of prestige to an extent.*\n\n**4. Highly selective.** *This rules out schools like Fordham, which meet some of the other criteria.*\n\n\\-----\n\nI would also argue that **Georgetown** would meet these four factors, so would **Johns Hopkins.** And **Boston College** meets the first three factors, but is just slightly not selective enough to be an Ivy League school.",

The Ivy League is not good for stem, so MIT wouldn't be a great fit. \n\nAlthough these games are fun, it's important to remember that the Ivy League is just a sports league. For an undergraduate education, Ivy League schools aren't that good anyway. Don't be a prestige hunter; choose a school that's actually good for you. I'm at a NESCAC right now and I'm far happier than my Ivy League friends and we all get the same internships and jobs at the end of the day. The only difference is that I don't hate myself for 4 years and I actually get a good experience.",

To me, Georgetown makes a lot of sense it is as a midsize school that is selective and holds old-timey prestige.
