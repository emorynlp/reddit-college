      "text": "Worth the hype? I\u2019d say so, although imo not to the extent of metaphorically killing yourself for 4-7 years because you\u2019re hellbent on getting into Stanford (as some students do). Worth the money? Depends on the cost for you, your family situation, whether you\u2019d have to go into debt, etc.",

      "text": "Definitely, with the amount of resources that Stanford has, you will find success where ever you would like to go (considering you are using your resources well). Financially, I would say this depends on your career choice. If it were like computer science, you would have higher chances to get into FAANG and other good companies. But again, you could go to like ASU Barrett and still get a great job and work with the software companies in AZ and land a jackpot job. At the end of the day, it's how you utilize your resources and skills",
