  "text": "She told me that this was the longest interview she ever had, and that she had a great time talking to me. Unlike a question interview, we had a conversation. I cracked jokes and exaggerated my story. Apparently the story I told covered a lot of questions she wanted to ask.\n\nAt the end, she said that she can tell I have a real passion, and will look forward to hearing back from me if I get accepted.",
