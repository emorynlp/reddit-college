  "text": "I've just been rejected from my Colgate ED, so it's time to move on. I want to apply ED2 to a school I where I have a decent chance.\n\n**Background** *(the WORST combination ever):* International from Southeast Asia, EFC about $20k (so I need a ton of aid), test-optional (due to COVID-19). DET 130. GPA 9.6 (9th), 9.5 (10th), 9.6 (11th). I got multiple local and provincial awards, average (or mediocre) ECs.\n\nI'm considering Denison, Grinnell or Kenyon for ED2. I love the vibe in these 3 school but I also want to know where I can get in.\n\nAny suggestions besides these 3 schools are also welcomed. Thank you all!",

My daughter got into both Grinnell and Kenyon in 2020, ended up at Kenyon, although we loved both schools. She's thriving at Kenyon, is super happy there.",

Kenyon is the least endowed of all of them so I am not sure if they will meet your financial aid needs unless they desperately want you. Good luck!\n\nEdit: forgot to say that I am a parent.",
