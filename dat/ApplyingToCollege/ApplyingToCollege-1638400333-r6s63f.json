  "text": "I am a Questbridge Finalist who did not match today.\n\nThat being said 3/6 schools I ranked offered to move my application from the QB pool to ED application pool (UPenn, brown, and tufts)\n\nOff the bat, I don't want to ED to tufts. That leaves Brown and Penn both schools to which I would love to go. Now the issue is 2 other students at my school are ED'ing to brown and nobody is Ed'ing to Penn. I like brown more than I do Penn. What do I do? ED to Penn and play the numbers (again would be happy here) or ED clash with 2 other students and be happier but have a much lower chance.",

There is not a min/max/quota per HS. Similarly, Penn will not accept someone simply because they were the only one who applied from that HS.",
