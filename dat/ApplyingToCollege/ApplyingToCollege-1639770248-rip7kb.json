  "text": "I've been lurking here for a while and have been super impressed by many (most?) of you. I'm not in your same life stage (for most of you), but I think you can help me advise someone thinking about college.\n\nI'm acquainted with a senior in high school here in Florida (no I'm not Florida man :-). I think very highly of this young man as do many of his teachers - We generally feel he's bright and wants to lead a good life, but he comes from a challenged background: Lives with his family in a trailer park known for drugs, didn't have electricity and/or water for months on end, doesn't get a lot of parental support, that sort of thing.\n\nHe was never interested in school, but over the past year and a half has gotten his grades up, scored a 1200+ on the SAT (which he was disappointed with and thinks he can do better), and is interested in pursuing a career in mechanical engineering. Trouble is, applying to university / financial aid / scholarships is all very daunting to him, as none of his peers are on the college path and his high school counselor seems to have too many students to give him the individual attention he needs. I've offered to help him & while I have a good relationship with him and know he wants to pursue university, I don't even know where to begin. And am worried we're too late altogether.\n\nSo I'd welcome any basic advice re: helping someone get a late-but-well-intentioned start re: getting into college.",

      "text": "It's definitely not too late to start, though it is very late in the process for F22. You'll want to start by looking at application deadlines for Florida universities. While the state of higher education in Florida, specifically, is a complicated topic, the state has many fine research and teaching universities.\n\nFor someone with the background you're describing, I would personally suggest a community college path. This will be very low cost (or free in some states) and often community colleges have guaranteed transfer pathways into public universities. He would complete his general education and lower division coursework in 2-3 years at the community college before transferring to complete the degree at a university in the latter two years. \n\nFolks on this subreddit generally have the misconception that there is something special about prestigious private research universities. For the most part, there is no difference in educational quality between those schools and public teaching/research universities as far as undergraduates are concerned. So it isn't necessary to have a profile similar to students at those schools to get an excellent education. Teaching universities offer more support for undergraduates and students from disadvantaged backgrounds, which generally helps them have better educational and career outcomes. Research universities (such as the University of Florida) are not focused on undergraduates and can be very difficult places to go to school. That said, these places to have resources and may offer more financial aid.\n\nYou may, however, want to look at what schools have rolling admissions. You can Google that phrase to find lists of in/out of state options. Some of those universities are among the best in the country, so there's also still time to apply to prestigious places (even if it isn't Harvard). \n\nAs far as financial aid is concerned, you'll need to have him fill out the free application for federal student aid (FAFSA) - it is a nightmare of a process, but it opens up access to need based grants and loans. It is likely that he will have zero expected family contribution, and so may recieve adequate federal aid to not pay out of pocket for tuition. Other expenses may have to be paid with loans. \n\nYou may also want to connect with an independent educational consultant. While many of these firms are quite expensive, they often offer lower cost or free counseling for students who meet certain criteria.",

          "text": "oh wow this is awesome, thanks! I have to re-read this, but in brief:\n\nYes I think getting a consultant is the way to go - I've started looking for one who specializes in Florida. Haven't found one yet, but I know someone who likely will know.\n\nThey don't have wifi over there so they're having extra trouble filling out the FAFSA. But I'm getting them a wireless network doodad so they can connect with his school laptop, hopefully that will get done over Christmas break.\n\nHe's not planning to do the community college approach because, as I understand it, Florida's Bright Futures program works for seniors coming out of high school. It's a pretty amazing program that pays for eligible kids' university tuition, or the lion's share at least, if they go to Florida universities. But someone who knows Florida universities would know for sure, maybe they'd agree that community college first would be the way to go.\n\nThanks again for your advice, Internet stranger!! :-)",
