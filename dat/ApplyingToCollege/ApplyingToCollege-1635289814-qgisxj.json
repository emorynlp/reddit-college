I\u2019m trying to fill out the Coalition application and it doesn\u2019t say if I should use weighted or unweighted specifically. It also says I can\u2019t go above a 100 even though some of my weighted grades are above 100. The same goes for the California applications. I\u2019m sending them my weighted transcripts",
