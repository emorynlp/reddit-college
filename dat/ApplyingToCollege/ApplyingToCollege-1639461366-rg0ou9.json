  "text": "I kept getting emails from this school that would be an extreme safety for me that I honestly know nothing about, and applied to it on a whim. Now I\u2019m scared because I read that you only have limited space for colleges on common app, and I can\u2019t get that space back. I feel like I just wasted one of my spots for a legitimate safety that I\u2019d actually be interested in going to and now I don\u2019t know what to do.",
