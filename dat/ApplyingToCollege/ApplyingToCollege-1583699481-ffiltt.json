  "text": "Seriously. I posted a long in-depth recounting of my high school years, and how I managed to get by the college process with almost no stress. In the comments, I was criticized when someone found I\u2019d only been accepted to my safeties (because my others haven\u2019t come out yet). \n\n\nIt\u2019s disheartening. They told me it seemed like I slacked off in high school, and that that\u2019s why I achieved \u201clow levels of success.\u201d \n\nCome on dawg. I just want people to know that the college process doesn\u2019t HAVE TO BE HELL. It can be managed well. But some people just cannot handle me posting about how I got into good schools without stress, just bc I didn\u2019t get into top 10 schools. \n\nI only bring it forward because their comments got an upsetting number of likes. \n\nI don\u2019t care if you want to go to a top tier school, I really don\u2019t, but come ON. I was just trying to give advice to those who find themselves stressing about the process, it was so uncalled for.",

          "text": "They\u2019re also the ones who know that everything they do is pointless. They see someone who\u2019s actually living a relatively enjoyable life and get salty. People need to realize that they should do what they love, not what they think colleges will love. If you\u2019re forcing yourself to apply to \u201cMIT math camp\u201d or whatever, even if you don\u2019t want to, you\u2019re wasting your life. People rarely find long term success in trivial work they feel obligated to do. Those who are truly happy and self fulfilling follow their dreams. If you spend your whole high school career killing your self to get into Harvard, Princeton, Yale, any highly competitive school, you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure. We\u2019d all love to get into one of those -Princeton has been my dream school fire years- but the truth is, I probably won\u2019t get in. Sure I have good grades, test scores, and EC\u2019s. So does everyone else applying. But I\u2019ve finally realized that my worth is not determined by whether a school admits me (randomly). Set your goals higher than something that\u2019s only four years of your life. Set your sights for NASA, the government, something that will BETTER yourself and others. Do you truly believe that the most successful people out of HYPSM spent their entire lives vying for a spot in one of those schools? So ask yourself: why should you?",

Connections are a huge part of success (atleast in my mindset), and these connections you form in college will push to the top of the major you wish to pursue. Obviously this is my take on success, and everyone will have different opinions on it. However, I believe that you can\u2019t connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards. You gotta trust that the dots will somehow connect your future. Making connections is important, find the fastest route to make important and valuable connections that will lead you to connect your dots. (In my case, the fastest route would be going to a T20)",

I just want to let you know, that based on what you\u2019ve said previously, I absolutely see and understand why you think that way, and for some part of it you\u2019re right. If you wanted to get into let\u2019s say investment banking, if you\u2019re not at a target, it really is tough luck and networking. For almost all other highly competitive careers (tech, medicine, law, engineering), there is no such real thing as target, since they\u2019re looking through school applications and the opportunity cost of them spending time on evaluation is way lower, or they simply have other metrics to evaluate people on (technical interviews, gpa, standardized tests)\n\nIt seems like you\u2019re gunning for a career in IB or some desk job, or something finance related, I can\u2019t tell you that you won\u2019t love it and that\u2019ll you won\u2019t be come wildly rich. What I can tell you is that you are tunnel visioning in a field where it\u2019s a literal rat race to the bottom. What you\u2019re thinking applies to a very niche subset of people where connections will actually be required for anything. Most other careers rely on so many other metrics while finance and business is literally prestige + stat padding your resume.\n\nI think two things are going on here.\n\n1) you\u2019re massively overrating the quality of kids at these institutions. Majority of these kids will either be legacy or rich as hell and party all the time (all t20s aside from engineering have huge party scenes) or will be other normal ass kids who happen to be pretty good at school. I go to a t20 (t21 if you wanna shove a stick up my ass, and it\u2019s in the same state I\u2019m presuming you\u2019re in) and I have noticed that there are three types of kids. Kids who are pretty smart but party a lot and go out a lot (like maybe 1/4 of the class). Kids who study their ass off, grinding to be the best, and are the types of connections you\u2019re imagining (maybe another 1/4). And the other half of normal kids who try to take a balanced approach. \n\nThe upper echelon of kids are everywhere basically t-100. It\u2019s just a matter of how large they are in respect to the rest of the class. If you really work that hard, you\u2019ll find yourself among that group. Doesn\u2019t matter where.\n\n2) if you\u2019re gunning for financial freedom, and retirement by age 28 and ruling the finance world, you have a long way to go buddy. Maybe the idea of target schools have made you jaded, but there are plenty of schools you probably haven\u2019t heard of that are very respectable in certain fields (e.g. Rochester institute of technology for engineering, Williams university for math, University of Delaware for ChemE). And they probably have just as bright, if not brighter kids in their programs than t20s. I picked the school I went to irregardless of rank, but rather quality of life, novelty of the experience, and importantly if I fit in with the program and culture. And that\u2019s what I advise most people to do. Look for the school that\u2019s best in your desired field. If you don\u2019t know, pick the school that\u2019s best for undergraduates as a whole. Places like Harvard and Columbia don\u2019t give a shit about undergrads since they don\u2019t bring in research dollars (they\u2019re still great programs, but if you\u2019re trying to optimize undergrad experience, it\u2019s not the place). There\u2019s a lot more that goes into it then just the ranking of some website or bank.\n\nYou really just gotta chill. If you derive enjoyment from working hard and grinding to the top, you are certainly lauded to do so. I hope you do find success in finance and are able to retire by age 28 (shit I hope I do too).  But what I will tell you is that if you\u2019re going to give advice out on this sub, realize that the stress of someone grinding for t20 connections may be literally worthless to them if they\u2019re not going to utilize them. For somethings like med school, they\u2019re not nearly as important as they are for business. \n\nSo you can say \u201cfor me and my career goals, it absolutely makes sense for me to want to go to a t20 and if your goals align with mine, here are my reasons why\u201d\n\nBut you can\u2019t say \u201cthere is absolute value in going to a t20 due to the connections you\u2019ll make and the drive of the people to succeed\u201d. That\u2019s just simply not true for all disciplines or even all career goals.",

You can\u2019t have both.\" \n\nI'm sorry, but excuse me?\n\nLet's clarify some misconceptions.\n\nI applied to several t20s, and there are many things wrong with your statement above. First of all, although prestige is a factor, inevitably, it is merely a microcosm of the reasons why I chose to apply. Most of us educated college applicants would not risk wasting the four most crucial years of our lives attending a school we do not even think we will fit in. That's a waste of time and money. Therefore, the majority of t20 applicants heavily research their potential schools, visit campus if financially possible, and demonstrate interest. I am sure most other t20 applicants, especially this sub, can agree with me.\n\nFurthermore, implying that all t20 applicants are \"anxiety-ridden pretentious prestige-whores who don't care about their mental health\"  is just as prejudiced as calling all non-t20 applicants \"lazy underachievers\". \n\nAs a final caveat, my mental health is great, and I have been described as \"infallibly put-together\" by my peers, and even one of my college interviewers noted it! Yes, I acknowledge that I get stressed and sad sometimes (as is human), but not to the extent of a clinical diagnosis. It is a minority of people who have clinical depression/anxiety/etc, and of those individuals, they were most likely already mentally ill to begin with, not because of college apps. \n\nIt is natural to be stressed, but I and the vast majority of t20 applicants have coping strategies regarding this. Personally, if I knew I was not mentally stable, I would not be applying to t20s because mental health is incredibly valuable and I cherish it.\n\n I am sure some people are clinically anxious and depressed, but stating that ALL t20 applicants do not take care of, or prioritize, their mental health is a grossly prejudiced misgeneralization.\n\nThe vast majority of t20 applicants are diligent, resilient, and intelligent people. Do not downplay their merits by generalizing them as mentally unstable prestige seekers. That is unfair and offensive.",
