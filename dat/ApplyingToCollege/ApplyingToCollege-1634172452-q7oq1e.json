  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a junior at a pretty competitive high school right now. I'd say I'm pretty behind on extracurriculars because I'd like to go to a competitive college as well. Optimally, I'd like to go to Brown, but that's gonna be quite the reach.\n\nI was talking to a friend today who's brother got into Vanderbilt. He said he was interested in history when applying, but switched to finance/econ right away after getting accepted? Is this a common practice? I wasn't aware of it until recently. \n\nI'd like to do finance/business in college which is concerning because a ton of people out there seem to want to do the same. I'm worried this will be too competitive at higher-level universities. Will saying I want to do that in my application/interview have any negative impact on my application? Would someone really benefit from saying they are interested in a less common major? \n\nIt seems pretty unethical to me. But I'm curious to know what others think. Thanks.",
