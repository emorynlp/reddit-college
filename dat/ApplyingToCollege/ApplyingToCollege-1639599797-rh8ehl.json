  "text": "I have a IOA Level 3 Diploma in Adult care awarded by Innovate awarding and I am planning to apply to become a nurse. I don't have the A Levels required (not from UK originally) but I would be more than happy to skip the access course so been wondering if my qualification could be accepted in the university instead of A levels/access course. Thank for everyone for the help.",
