      "text": "You can always transfer to NYUSH but any scholarships/merit would not transfer and you would need to reapply.  Also, the core classes are different so you'd need to be very careful about which classes to take in NYC. NYUSH is in a difficult spot given the pandemic and restrictions to get into China, so you may have a good chance.  There are posts from last year and I have a long one describing NYUSH that you may find helpful to understand what the school is about. It is very difficult academically depending on your major.",
