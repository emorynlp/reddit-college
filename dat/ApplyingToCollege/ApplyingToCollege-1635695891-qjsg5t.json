      "text": "CS jobs basically pay the same regardless of which college you go to. I\u2019d go to Chico and really try to maximize your opportunities due to connections with the Bay Area. For example you can take classes at Berkeley in the summer because it\u2019s open to everyone then. Chico is close enough to SF I\u2019m sure there are plenty of connections to Silicon Valley - find out about those and take advantage of them",
