  "text": "I know how to code a little bit. I know python and did a few fun projects. I also like photoshop and can work on GIMP a little bit but I don't know if I wanna do that in college too.\n\nMy bro is going for CS but I want to go for electrical or computer engineering because I feel that I can do a few data science and ML courses online and be qualified for a tech job so I won't be missing out on much. \n\nEngineering is different because it has a lot more practical and hands on projects to do and can't be replaced by a online course so easily.\n\nI don't think that just because I can do DS and ML courses online they would be easy and that a CS degree is easily replaceable. I DO NOT think so at all. CS is a competitive degree which is in high demand with great jobs but I don't think that I should choose CS just because of that. But again what of I am wrong and I find out that EE isn't for me? What should I do the ? \ud83d\ude29\n \nWell on a similar note how easy is it to switch majors in Texas A&M? Can I switch to EE from CS or the other way around?",

That being said, pursuing a degree in a subject you don't particularly like / have an interest in, is not very smart.",
