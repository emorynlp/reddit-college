      "text": "Yes.  Some interviewers are busy and much prefer to keep these short and sweet.  This won't be an issue for you.  Sometimes it makes the interview easier because the interviewer will drive the conversation more and you can just relax and let them do their thing.  In my experience the students who struggle the most with interviews are the ones where the interviewer decides to \"test\" the applicant by sort of making them step up and lead the conversation.  It's so dumb and for a lot of less outgoing/gregarious people it's challenging and awkward.  So at least you won't have this issue.",

          "text": "Oh that\u2019s reassuring, thank you for clarifying!! Also, since the request came now (pretty late since decisions are in 2 weeks) do you think it\u2019s likely I was deferred and they\u2019re interviewing me for RD? It\u2019s pretty late so I\u2019m not sure if this interview would actually help them accept me at this point. Does it matter the interview request came later?",
