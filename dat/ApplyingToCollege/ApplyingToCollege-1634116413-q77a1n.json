  "text": "Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, if you know a better place for it, please tell me.\n\nI'm applying to Oxford University through UCAS and it says on the website that not having predicted grades significantly lowers your chances of getting in.\n\nIs the teacher I chose to write the reference letter for me supposed to just go around the school and ask teachers in 15 different subjects what they predict my grade will be at the end of the year?\n\nAlso, I have multiple subjects and teachers this year that I did not have last year. How is a teacher, who has known me for less than a month and who hasn't given me a single grade yet, supposed to know my grade I will have a year from now? Not to mention that, because of COVID-19, we go to the school half of the week and attend the other half online, so there are teachers who \\*literally saw me once\\* in-person, since the beginning of the school year.\n\nI have had the maximum grade in all subjects in years 2 and 3 of high school, shouldn't this be enough to predict my grades in grade 4?\n\nThank you in advance.",
