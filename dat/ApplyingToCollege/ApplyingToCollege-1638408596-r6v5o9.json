  "text": "I just had my Cornell interview and it went better than I could have imagined. We just hit it off super well and we both play the oboe so that was cool because there\u2019s not many oboe players. Sadly the interview doesn\u2019t weigh much towards the decision process. Should I still send a follow up email thanking her for her time or just leave it be?",
