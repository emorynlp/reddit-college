  "text": "I have struggled with school and started to build my life together this past year I currently have a 3.5 gpa for my senior year but only adds up to a 2.2 for my last 4 years. I really want to go to university but don\u2019t know where I already am completely informed about community college and will probably end up there however I at least want to try applying to colleges and universities. Is  there any universities that would give me a slight chance of getting accepted or even a program that I can start right now that would give me a guaranteed admission by the fall or spring semester of 2022 all given advice will definitely be taken into consideration and appreciated. \n(I rushed while typing this so my bad if I messed up a couple time)",

      "text": "Can you take an SAT/ACT?  There are some schools out there that have auto admissions based on a test score as long as you have passed enough core high school classes.  University of Nebraska will admit with a 20 ACT / 1040 SAT for example.\n\nYour state might have some schools where your drastically improved grades might help a lot.  Where I live that's Metro State in Denver - 2.6 GPA is the standard for auto admission, but they will consider students with lower stats with a letter of recommendation and essay (and will auto admit 20+ year old students who have a GED or high school diploma).  It's possible your state has some similar options.",
