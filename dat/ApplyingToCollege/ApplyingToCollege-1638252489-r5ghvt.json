  "text": " My counselor today told me that in the \"School Report\" section, she uploaded 4 transcripts: 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th Mid-term. She uploaded and submitted.  \nShe, then, moved forward and saw the \"Mid-year report\" section, but she had already submitted it in the School report section. Now she can't edit it.  \nWhat do we do? Like, is it ok to submit the Mid-Year report in the \"Transcript\" section of School report because it asked for the current or most recent Transcript.  \nIf that's how it's supposed to be, then why is there a mid-year section?",

The admissions officers will easily figure that out.\n\nI\u2019ve read a lot more troubling errors on here recently \u2026 like the poor person who applied ED to Dartmouth and they claim that on their \u201cpeer reference\u201d evaluation, their friend just typed \u201cballs\u201d and submitted it.  I think you are fine.",
