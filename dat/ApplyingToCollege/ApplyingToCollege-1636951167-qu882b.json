  "text": "I wasn\u2019t really able to take the SAT/get the score I wanted, so I went test-optional for a majority of my schools. However, I just remembered that for my PSAT, I scored in the 97+ percentile range nationally and won an award from College Board this year because of it. Can I write a personal update and submit this information to the colleges I went test-optional at? Will this help me in any way? Thanks!",

          "text": "I listed them, but I was thinking I could write an update to explain the award and what my percentile was because it doesn't show that on the awards section of my application. Like I could use the update of my PSAT as sort of like a placeholder for the actual SAT, instead of the SAT being completely absent from my application. I'm not sure if that makes sense haha",
