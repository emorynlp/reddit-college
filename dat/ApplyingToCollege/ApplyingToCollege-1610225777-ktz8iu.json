I've gotten all of my information from Reddit and done everything on my own so I've been clueless about so many things throughout this process. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nColleges should really make it more clear instead of hiding all of these things deep in their websites. And applying to aid is even worse. I've sent 3 emails to each of my schools so far just figuring out how to apply to aid. Can't colleges make like, a flow chart on how to apply?? Instead of forcing us to dig through their websites months before applications are even due to find necessary information.",
