  "text": "I'm currently writing my Why Tulane essay and it's only 480 words long. The essays are all optional but 2 of them are 800 words. Should I try and make my essay close to that word limit? I've run out of things to write and 800 words seems excessive. I also have a community essay that's about 550 words. Should I try to add on to this essay so that it is also close to the word limit? I feel like my writing will look weaker if expand both of my essays to 800 words.",

      "text": "Hey I just submitted my Tulane App, and quite frankly it\u2019s perfectly alright if you don\u2019t maximise the word count. 500 words for the why Tulane essay is anyways a lot, there\u2019s no point being redundant if you believe that it\u2019s not helping your application in any way and you genuinely don\u2019t have anything to add. Though my why Tulane essay was long (684 words) my community essay was short ( 350 words only) it\u2019s the content that matters not the word count",
