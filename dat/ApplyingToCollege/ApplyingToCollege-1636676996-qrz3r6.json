Per their stats, Dartmouth is 51.4% male (2,142 out of 4,170) and Columbia is 50.8% (4,142 out of 8,148).\n\nI went to each school's most recent CDS, but Columbia (AFAIK) doesn't publish one.  [Here](https://opir.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/Statistical%20Abstract/opir_enrollment_gender.pdf)'s what they do publish, which claims that 49.4% of its undergrads are men (4,372 out of 8,842).\n\n[Here](https://www.dartmouth.edu/oir/pdfs/cds_2020-2021.pdf) is Dartmouth's latest CDS, which almost matches what was at univstats.  51.4% male (2,141 out of 4,169).",
