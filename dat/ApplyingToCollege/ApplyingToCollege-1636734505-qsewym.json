  "text": "Hey everyone. I am from Dhaka, Bangladesh and currently i am in my A levels (A2). \nSo it is high time for me to start my application to universities abroad, so here it is:\n1)I want to apply to Germany as i want to do my undergrad in Mechanical Engineering but I dont k ow  which universities are best for that. Keep in mind that i am a mediocre student and probably i cant get into top tier german universities. Hence please suggest universities likewise.\n2) Its too late for me to sit for any tests except the IELTS or SAT exams. I do know that you can apply to a lot of universities out there using only your IELTS certificate. So does German universities accept ielts?\n3) is it necessary to learn german before application or can i learn it in germany alongside my undergrad once i get admitted to an university?\nAny advice/suggestion is appreciated.",
