I wanted to apply CS because of a). parental pressure b). growing demand \n\nHowever, I'm a 20 time country-wide national debate champion in India, I have more debate achievements than all the students in my school combined. Would it be preferable then, to say, apply as a \"Communications\"(or any other suggestion you might have) major and then convert to CS+Communications if I get accepted?",
