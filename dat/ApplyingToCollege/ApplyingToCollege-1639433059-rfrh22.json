  "text": "So I am currently a Junior working on my classes for the next year, and after a counselor discussion I have an interesting predicament. I want to go into computer engineering/science and am looking at applying to some very strong colleges in the field (MIT, UCB, Stanford, Harvey-Mudd). To improve my application portfolio I\u2019m now stuck deciding which math to take senior year, and which looks better on a portfolio/helps more. Any advice from people with experience?\n\nTL;DR: is Stats AP or Linear Algebra/Calc III A look better on a college portfolio for Strong engineering colleges?",

I have an easy A in Stats with a teacher who\u2019s students average score on the AP exam is 4.3 over the last couple of years. Number crunching wise there\u2019s very little work and conceptually everything is honestly common sense so far\u2026 Now I am obviously not an admissions officer but I\u2019d find it hard to imagine stats would look better than calc 3.",

I don't know about the other colleges, but at Harvey Mudd it's rare but possible to test out of the core math classes, so you'll want to be comfortable enough to really test out if you don't wanna be bored in math first couple semesters (calc then linear algebra). However I think while it doesn't look as good if you're going to these colleges you're gonna take these classes regardless, and you might not end up taking a stats class. So in terms of long-term educational value I'd actually go with Stats.",

              "text": "In terms of applying, be genuine in your essays should help. Especially in the \"why Mudd\" essay, if you are passionate about a specific non-STEM subject (art, English, theatre, etc.), they like well-roundedness. Exclusively STEM doesn't mean you won't get in, but this'll help. That's a thought in terms of classes too: if you have the space and have been taking an elective/doing an extracurricular that you enjoy, continuing that will help, even if it's not STEM-y. \n\nIn terms of deciding to go to Mudd, this almost certainly applies to the other schools on your list, but come to terms with the fact that you will not be the best student in every subject, or even in the subject that you feel strong in. That's okay and expected, and collaboration is highly encouraged.",

If you can't and want to get a sense of the students, look up the history of pranks at Harvey Mudd and read up on some of those. Also, the honor code is big at Mudd so be aware of that. \n\nIn terms of student mental health and stress, there was a report done in 2017 called the Wabash Report at Mudd. It's pretty concerning but gives you a good sense of what you're getting into so you're not surprised. Things have definitely improved since then (most of the quoted professors no longer work at Mudd), but I highly recommend reading it so you have a full assessment of the college.\n\nOh, and if LGBTQ+ friendliness is something you're concerned about when applying to college, there's a surprisingly high percentage of queer students. I think those are all the big points of consideration and good luck!",

                              "text": "So the honor code is basically an agreement of trust between the students and the school. It's agreeing to not cheat on tests but also to behave responsibly and courteously. If you break it you're expected  to self report. It's not a specific set of written rules because it's about following the spirit of the code not the letter. Because we sign the honor code, students have things like take home exam and underage drinking being allowed (responsibly). There are few specific rules, mostly for COVID regulations, but also always crediting help on homework, no climbing the warts (the weird squares on the side of the building), no siege weaponry, that kind of thing. Also anything illegal is generally considered an honor code violation. It also comes with things like the no prank list, a school wide spreadsheet where you list whether you're willing to be pranked and what you're uncomfortable with, since prank culture is huge here.",

From my experience as a high school student, statistics was probably the easiest AP-level class I've taken, and if you need a GPA boost, you are more likely to get that.",
