  "text": "So I am currently a Junior working on my classes for the next year, and after a counselor discussion I have an interesting predicament. I want to go into computer engineering/science and am looking at applying to some very strong colleges in the field (MIT, UCB, Stanford, Harvey-Mudd). To improve my application portfolio I\u2019m now stuck deciding which math to take senior year, and which looks better on a portfolio/helps more. Any advice from people with experience?\n\nTL;DR: is Stats AP or Linear Algebra/Calc III A look better on a college portfolio for Strong engineering colleges?",

      "text": "definitely lin alg/ calc 3. as long as you didn't struggle much with math in the past you should be fine. i'd just add that legitimate college courses (non-AP) like these often stress conceptual understanding so be prepared for that. also stats is pretty easily self studyable if you're interested for the credit. last point is that lin alg/ calc 3 at your home high school/cc or whatever probably won't give credit at virtually all private schools whereas stats almost definitely will.",

      "text": "From someone who is currently in AP Stats, don\u2019t even waste your time taking it. I am a fairly smart student but not at all MIT smart. I have an easy A in Stats with a teacher who\u2019s students average score on the AP exam is 4.3 over the last couple of years. Number crunching wise there\u2019s very little work and conceptually everything is honestly common sense so far\u2026 Now I am obviously not an admissions officer but I\u2019d find it hard to imagine stats would look better than calc 3.",
