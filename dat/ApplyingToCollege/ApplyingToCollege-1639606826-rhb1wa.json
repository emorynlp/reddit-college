Still trying to figure this one out.  House system reminds me of Hogwarts.\n\nYale:  Good, particularly in some of the liberal arts, with some world renowned thought leading professors, but New Haven sucks.\n\nBrown:  Never been there.  Feel like I should know more about it, but don't.  Maybe that in and of itself is insightful\n\nCornell:  Pick a a major it is known for, and you'll do great, else avoid it.  Suicides and gorges.\n\nColumbia:  Pick it if you love living in NYC (which I have done and do)\n\nUPenn:  Philly.  Not the same as NYC (by a long shot).\n\nDartmouth:  Cultish.  Graduates seem to have liked it, but again, cultish.  Kids of graduates make up a big percentage.",
