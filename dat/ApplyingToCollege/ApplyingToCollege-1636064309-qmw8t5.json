  "title:": "How to write to your interviewers",
  "text": "Hello! I noticed that a few students were asking about how they should address their alumni interviewers by email. I decided to consolidate my advice here, in case it's helpful.\n\nIn particular, I hope this will be useful to first-gen applicants, students applying to U.S. universities from outside the U.S., and others who know letter-writing as well as anyone else but aren't sure whether the rules are different in this specific instance. The short answer is no, but just so there is no uncertainty, I'm going to be very specific about every part of the email.\n\nSource: my authority for writing this is just that I'm a college graduate who is accustomed to writing in a professional context. I am giving you advice based on what is typically considered polite in that milieu.\n\nIf other adults comment with their own takes on what is polite, they are probably equally justified in their advice. I'm going to tilt toward what is more formal. You can't really lose with formal when you're writing to a stranger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFORMS OF ADDRESS\n\nYou probably received an email from the alumni interviewer's personal email account. I would suggest starting the reply with:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Pratchett / Ms. Pratchett / Dr. Pratchett / Prof. Pratchett,\"\n\nI think you should reply in this format even if they signed their email using their first name. I also think it's okay to look up the person's title (like do they have a doctorate) on the internet, since that's what I would do before replying to a stranger in a professional context.\n\nIf you're writing to a woman, I think you should use \"Ms. Pratchett\" rather than \"Mrs. Pratchett,\" even if you think she's married. Use \"Dr. Pratchett\" if she has a doctorate. And I definitely think you should avoid calling her by her first name.\n\nIf the person writes in their reply email, \"Please, call me Terry,\" then you can start your next email, \"Dear Terry (if I may)....\" And any emails after that can start \"Dear Terry...\" (This advice works the same regardless of your correspondent's gender.)\n\nIf the person does not write in their reply email, \"Please, call me Terry,\" then you should keep calling them \"Mr. Pratchett / Ms. Pratchett / Dr. Pratchett / Prof. Pratchett,\" even if they sign their email, \"Sincerely, Terry.\" You have to wait until you receive an explicit invitation to call them by their first name. If that invitation doesn't come, that's okay. It just means the other person is more comfortable being addressed formally when talking to a high schooler.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBODY OF THE EMAIL\n\nYou can probably imitate this pretty closely, because this is a formulaic way of responding to a meeting invitation:\n\nHello! It's a pleasure to hear from you.\n\nOf the times you've provided, the best time for me to meet by Zoom is Octeday, Grune 71, at 3pm PST. If you find at any point that this time no longer works, please just let me know and I'll be happy to find another time that works for you.\n\nIf you send me a Zoom link, I'll put it on my calendar right away. I look forward to talking with you about Unseen University!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSIGNATURE\n\nAlmost any conventional signature line is fine: \"Sincerely,\" \"Best regards,\" \"Thanks.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDO I ATTACH MY RESUME?\n\nI personally think you should avoid giving your interviewer homework, but you aren't going to harm your application or upset the interviewer regardless of whether you choose to attach your resume. If you choose to attach your resume, you should include something like this in the body of your email: \"I have attached a copy of my resume for your interest, but there's no need to read it if you don't have time!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWHY SO MANY EXCLAMATION POINTS?\n\nSo you don't look like a sociopath.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDO I SEND A FOLLOW-UP EMAIL AFTER THE INTERVIEW?\n\nYes, you should; that's conventionally polite after any kind of interview. Just say something like:\n\nDear Ms. Pratchett,\n\nI very much enjoyed talking with you today/yesterday/on Octeday about Unseen University. I'm even more excited about the prospect of attending after hearing you talk about the intramural math team. But no matter what happens, I know that I have a lot to look forward to in the college years.\n\nThanks again for your generosity with your time and experience.\n\nAgain, many thanks,\n\nYour name\n\n&#x200B;\n\nISN'T THAT SAYING THANKS TOO MANY TIMES?\n\nYou can't say thanks too many times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nISN'T ALL THIS FUSSINESS KIND OF STUCK-UP? AM I IN A JANE AUSTEN NOVEL OR SOMETHING?\n\nPoliteness is a way of making other people feel comfortable. You're writing to strangers, and furthermore to strangers who are different from you in some ways that you might be able to guess (they're older than you, maybe a different gender from you) and other ways that you might not be able to guess. Being polite is just a way of making them feel comfortable during that first contact across those unknown differences.",

      "text": "Disagree on a few things. If I sign off my email as \u201ctalk soon, Terry\u201d that\u2019s me setting the level of formality I want so feel free to call me Terry. I definitely agree that it\u2019s better to lean more formal when in doubt, but don\u2019t forget that most of us interviewers are just recent grads doing this in our free time. Also if you look up my official title and call me that without any context that\u2019s kind of weird. \n\nI also don\u2019t really want to see your resume. The interview is for us to get to know you as a person and see if you\u2019re a good fit, leave your credentials for the rest of your application. \n\nI think OP\u2019s advice is good for job interviews and professional interactions, but this isn\u2019t my profession. I do this because I enjoy it.\n\nFinally, I definitely second sending a follow up email. If someone takes time out of their day to help you out then you should thank them for it.",

A little. I would love, love, love to live in a world where she and her colleagues had no experiences that would cause this to happen.

Many women actually don't change their last names after they're married, and it just sounds wrong to them.  The immediate fleeting thought is 'I'm not Mrs. Smith, that's my maiden name'.\n\nAnd the doctor's ego won't be bruised...but she'll have a less-than-stellar first impression of the young teenager who says 'Hello Mary' instead of 'Hello Dr. Smith'.  She's had patients, mid-level providers, nurses, operators, etc. calling her Doctor Smith 24/7/365/30 years, so it's going to just sound strange, to have a relative stranger call her by her first name.  Sure, she'll probably forgive you, but why not start off with a great first impression?  Absolutely NOONE will think poorly of you if you start with 'Hello, Dr. Smith'.",

Often enough, students write to me using my first name and to him as Dr. Lastname, even though I'm the senior instructor in the class and the department head. And hold a doctorate.\n\nThe kids don't mean it; they don't even think about it. That's why we have these rules for being polite: because it's easy not to think about others even when you're talking right to them.\n\nFor instance, if you reply to a post about women with doctorates saying, \"If a stranger called me lieutenant, I would laugh at them,\" you are showing that you're not really thinking about others even when you're literally replying to a post about them and not you.",

      "text": "i am just a humble college freshman but i think it\u2019s fine to switch to using someone\u2019s first name once they sign their emails to you with it. no adult i\u2019ve emailed (both in high school and in college) has ever said \u201cplease call me ____\u201d and i think most people can understand signing an email under their first name as an invitation to call them by it. it also feels a little awkward to me when they sign off with their first name and i continue to use their full title, almost like i\u2019m ignoring what they actually want to be called for the sake of formality.\n\nedit: also major disagree on the \u201cyou can\u2019t say thanks too many times\u201d part, i think you definitely can. AT MOST i would say thanks once at the beginning and once at the end, but thanking them twice one right after the other is pushing it. you don\u2019t want to come across as desperate or like you\u2019re sucking up to them either.\n\notherwise this is solid advice.",
