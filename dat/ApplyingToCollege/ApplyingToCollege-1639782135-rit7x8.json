  "text": "Last week, I got into Williams, my DREAM school. I\u2019ve dreamt of the moment for months and when I got in I was overjoyed for\u2026 an hour? Nothing compared to all the anxiety and anticipation.\n\nSo now when it\u2019s late at night and I think of all those classic high school experiences I missed. Like outside of classic high school friendships and \u201cpopularity\u201c and the occasional drama I feel like I\u2019ve missed it all. I never took the time to figure myself out, never took the time to really have fun, turned down so many invitationa that could have been awesome with my friends. I feel like even though I have my future set and I\u2019m going to my DREAM school that\u2019s ranked as the best LAC in the country and I\u2019m in that sense ecstatic and I know it\u2019s what I worked for I\u2019m so sad about never really being a person. I missed so much just being a cardboard cut out and missing so much of those experiences I once dreamed of having in high school and that stings because I can\u2019t take that back. Either way, it\u2019s own wards and upwards from here, and I think knowing this will help me remember to make sure I \\*have fun\\* in college and work on myself as well as my academics, EC\u2019s, other commitment.\n\nDoes anyone else relate to this feeling or have I just lost it because i can\u2019t really tell. Also \u201cteen idle\u201d by Marina basically summarizes my high school years and it\u2019s rude as hell.",
