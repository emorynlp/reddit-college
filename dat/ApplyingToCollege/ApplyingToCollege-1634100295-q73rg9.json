  "text": "Hi I'm an international applicants and I have one question: It is written on the school's website (UH to be exact) that \"Multiple sponspors are acceptable but each sponsor must sign an Affidavit of Support\". I know nothing about this affidavit and I can't find the form for this anywhere on the website. So can you tell me what it is, how can I find/fill the form and is it compulsory for other schools too? Thanks a lot in advance",
