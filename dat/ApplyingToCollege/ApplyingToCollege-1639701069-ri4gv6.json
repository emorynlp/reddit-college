You can receive a similar if not the same level of education from a decent private/private university. In the long run, it doesn't matter which school you attended; you can perform just as well as your peers who went to ivies.",

Top colleges give you exposure to make connections with current/potentially future - millionaires; world leaders; masters of their respective skills; globally renowned activists and more.  \n  \n\nAnd this is way more important than just a degree.  Collaborating with such people can simply change your mindset toward our society and grow both of you in the process.   \n\nThis is the primary reason extremely wealthy wants their child to attend such schools too (since their kids don't require a top college degree - to get a \"job\" like odinary people if it was for that only reason).\n\nPlease keep in mind I'm in no way supporting the extremely rigorous (and corrupt) admission process for these schools whatsoever.",

Furthermore, there state schools with similar breaks as ivies into FAANG etc. even if what you are saying is true, you have to be the cream of the crop even in an Ivy to get that job. Why do you think everyone else is going to an Ivy? Because they want the same job you do. So now you\u2019re fighting over limited spots with the best of the best, many of which are legacies and have better connections than you. Look up some famous people. More often than not, if they didn\u2019t come from wealth/industry parents, they went to a school A2C would laugh at",

Furthermore, it doesn't mean that even if you do meet them, that the meeting will result in a meaningful interaction.\n\nGoing back to my initial point, while I likely have met more, that is also likely due to a combination of random chance and circumstance. \n\nBut if you want to actually interact with people to challenge how you think, and will likely be the best recommenders for you on either grad school applications or job applications; smaller, undergrad teaching focused universities should be what you are looking at, not R1 universities.",
