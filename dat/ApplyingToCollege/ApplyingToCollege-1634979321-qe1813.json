  "text": "I have taken care of my grandmother since 10th grade. She had 2 heart attacks and stones in her kidney. She later had tuberculosis. She was very weak. I used to help her bath , dress up , cook nutritious food for her in the evening and took care of her after school since my parents are both working. \nDo u have any ideas how I should describe this activity on common app description?\nThank u in advance.",
