  "title:": "If I'm applying to UCLA Herb Alpert, how big a role does my standard UC application play in my acceptance?",
  "text": "For context, I would say my essays are certainly above average, and I have a 4.0 unweighted GPA. But alas, despite my greatest efforts, I realized my activity list is not quite up to par. There is a minor spelling error, and to be quite honest, the quality of writing itself is below average. None of this would be an issue, had I not made this discovery AFTER hitting the submit button.\n\nHowever, despite this tragic realization, I have been meeting with the head of my prospective music department for some time now, and he has expressed great enthusiasm towards my application. Were I to get accepted into UCLA Herb Alpert for my discipline, would my sub-par activities list in any way prevent me from my dream acceptance?\n\nI do hope this is needless stress on my end, but perhaps I am right to worry? Either way, I appreciate the response :)",

      "text": "Idk, but I wouldn't think so because of what you said about the head of your music department. Does the music school read applications early or something? I would assume they just read their application and not the standard UC app. But take that with a grain of salt.",
