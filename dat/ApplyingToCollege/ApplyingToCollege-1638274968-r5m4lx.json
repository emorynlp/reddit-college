  "text": "For context, I would say my essays are certainly above average, and I have a 4.0 unweighted GPA. But alas, despite my greatest efforts, I realized my activity list is not quite up to par. There is a minor spelling error, and to be quite honest, the quality of writing itself is below average. None of this would be an issue, had I not made this discovery AFTER hitting the submit button.\n\nHowever, despite this tragic realization, I have been meeting with the head of my prospective music department for some time now, and he has expressed great enthusiasm towards my application. Were I to get accepted into UCLA Herb Alpert for my discipline, would my sub-par activities list in any way prevent me from my dream acceptance?\n\nI do hope this is needless stress on my end, but perhaps I am right to worry? Either way, I appreciate the response :)",
