  "text": "I was thinking about what classes I want to take next year and I was deciding between  regular American lit and ap lit. The school I want to go to most is gatech and I want to do chemical engineering so I was thinking, \u201cwhy would I try to show colleges that I\u2019m good at lit if I want to be an engineer?\u201d. English is definitely my worst subject and it drags down my gpa every year so if I take ap lit I feel like my gpa would just tank down. I\u2019m really really good at math and sciences and take the highest level ones that I am allowed to each year ( 9th- honors bio and honors geometry 10th- honors chem honors algebra 2 and Ap stats) and in those types of classes I have so far only made above a 95 in. If I show the college that I\u2019m more focused on math and science by taking \u201charder\u201d math and science classes and easier language arts classes, would that matter?",

      "text": "it doesn't really matter, my transcript was unfocused and i got into an engineering school T5 for my major, another friend was \"focused\" and got into UC Berkeley. at this level i'd argue it's hair splitting\n\nnow the caveat is if you are barely scraping B's in normal english then you may want to hold on AP Lit because while a B in an AP class is debatable a C on an AP class definitely isn't something anyone wants to see. protect your GPA and don't overextend",

      "text": "Taking easier stem classes to accommodate harder humanities would be bad, but taking easier humanities vs harder with the other classes staying the same will only hurt you\n\nColleges want a well-rounded applicant. Humanities class grades don\u2019t only show your skill in the humanities (which stem colleges do care about since you need those skills to be a good engineer), but also they represent your skills. Where math classes show your skills at theoretical thinking and coding classes show your skills at precision, English classes show skills in perseverance and interpersonal skills and history classes shows understanding of people and memorization.\n\nPlus, in terms of APs, if you want to go into a STEM field and want to graduate ASAP, you\u2019ll want to get your electives / general education credits fulfilled by AP classes, NOT major specific classes.\n\nMajor specific AP classes will help you get accepted, but the tests are unlikely to give you credit\u2014be it because the department rejects it or because you want to make sure your foundational knowledge doesn\u2019t have gaps.",
