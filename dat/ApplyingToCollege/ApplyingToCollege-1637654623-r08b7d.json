I stopped swimming club a while ago though, because I wanted to have a life so my times are no where close to my club times. So I used to be a breaststroker/ imer but now just swim the 100 br, 100 fr, 200 free relay, and 200 medley relay at HS events. It\u2019s so sad because every year after regionals and states I always miss club swim SM",
