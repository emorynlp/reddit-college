I would be happy to get into any of them and really can\u2019t decide. \nMostly concerned with campus experience and prestige. \nAnyone have any suggestions?

          "text": "I agree, these 3 colleges are very different from each other, and if you research the schools online, read comments on reddit about each school and maybe attend an online information session if one is coming up soon before the ED II deadline \u2026 you will have a much better idea and maybe that will let you eliminate at least one of them for EDII.\n\nBoston College has a religious affiliation and it is perhaps slightly more conservative. The campus buildings are beautiful.  BU is a very urban campus \u2026 like NYU.  I don\u2019t know much about NE other than everybody thinks of its \u201cco-op\u201d model, so you should google \u201cNortheastern Co-op\u201d.\n\nIf you asked 100 people which one is most prestigious, you would probably get 3 similar sized answers.  If I had to choose one for me, I would probably go 1)BC 2)BU 3)NE.\n\nThe ED acceptance rate for BC and NE is very similar.  BU\u2019s ED acceptance rate is higher, if you are concerned about maximizing your chance of admission through EDII.\n\nSounds like you really want to be in Boston \u2026. perhaps to be near a boy or girl \ud83d\ude02",
