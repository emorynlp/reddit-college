  "text": "I've taken a gap year and am looking to start university in 2022, I already have my A Level results. I did well in AS Level with AABB grades, but due to reasons, I could only achieve BBBC in A Level, with the subjects: math, IT, chem and phy. I also have an extra AS Level subject with grade D which I didn't continue in A Level. Being an international student without help from school I didn't know you have to apply a year early so I had to take a gap. Anyway, which good universities would accept me for a Computer Science course, and how can I tell the universities that I could've gotten higher results?",
