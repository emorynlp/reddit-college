It\u2019s a 35 page booklet but it\u2019s intensely helpful. I give it to all my students but I especially focus on it for my students who can only come up with fairly \u201cboring\u201d topics that won\u2019t help to differentiate them from other students. \n\nOne thing I\u2019d also add is that the common app topics tend to fall into two broad categories: your history/background and ideas that fascinate you. For kids who have \u201cno story to tell\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve got no hook\u201d but are otherwise smart and want to get into top schools especially, I think the \u201cideas that fascinate me\u201d\ntopics are underrated. I had a student write an excellent one last year about quantum computing (make sure it\u2019s still about *you* though). *Hacking the College Essay* mentions them a few times but I feel like they could have covered them more and talked through how students can develop those ideas. Still, the building blocks are there, thinking through the conversational style, etc., so it\u2019s a great resource no matter what kind of essay you\u2019re trying to write.\n\nAgain, it really helps increase your potential of writing a genuinely good rather than merely \u201cfine\u201d  essay.",

          "text": "So, I read the book you recommended, and I think it\u2019s kind of awful? I edit essays professionally, too, so I\u2019m very interested in seeking \u201cpro advice\u201d. \n\nThe first 15 pages I mostly agreed with, in that I encourage my students to write things that will be memorable. He uses a shooty war analogy, I say they want to be the \u201cX kid\u201d where X is what they recognize about them as soon as they bring up their application for review. \n\nBut then around page 20 he gets into specific essays he worked on...and they\u2019re terrible? I\u2019ve done work with grad students, and all of his proudest essays read like first drafts from very smart, driven students that aren\u2019t natural writers.  They\u2019re overly wordy, confusing, and make a lot of literary puns and connections that at best are confusing, and at worst are pretentious gobbeldy gook. \n\nHe also let a kid write that Billy Beane *invented* OBP, which if I was an admissions person would instantly make me think the kid was either a phony or a moron. \n\nAlso, despite all his advice beforehand, his interview strategy seems to be to badger the kids and call their ideas boring until they mention something they're insecure about, and then he pounces on that and forces that to be their topic. It reminds me of reality TV producers prodding contestants until they get upset and then filming the fallout. \n\nGo to page 32 and read how he talks to the girl writing the EMT essay. He just bullies her, for no real clear reason. I work with these kids and they\u2019re stressed and sensitive about their work. If I started asking them bizarre questions about what Spanish word they studying when they saw a lady dying all ticktockticktock like this was game show they\u2019d probably start crying. \n\nI just feel like all of the work he\u2019s proud enough to feature in a book reads like a 45yo writing for a 17yo, and not doing a very good job of doing so. \n\nPlease let me know if and how you disagree.",

              "text": "No, I actually think I mostly agree with you. I wrote somewhere that his advice on what not to do and how to approach the essay conceptually are probably more things I agree with, but some of his actual examples are meh. As I put it in another comment:\n\n>My other advice is don\u2019t get stuck writing about the first topic you think is good. That\u2019s what I really like about *Hacking the College Essay*\u2014while I don\u2019t always agree with his positive advice, I love his negative advice. He helps students break free from the paint-by-numbers mold of what they think an essay *ought* to look like.\n\nWhen I teach it with my students, it's usually as they're struggling to pick a topic or when I think they're taking a boring approach to a topic. That's I think what he's really good at--how to approach the topic, how to think about this essay in a way that gives students the best chance to have to stand out.\n\nI think he's good at getting students to focus on what's actually interesting about the story they want to tell, what actually matters, what actually shows something about them as a person, not what the student thinks a college wants to hear. Like, for example, how he reframed the debate club thing on page 11 (\"I'm the kind of person who...\" to \"I argued mandatory voting actually does more to preserve individual liberty...\"); even if as a reader I don't agree with the student's stance on mandatory voting, I want to know more about. He's got me hooked. The fencer example on the next page is also great. I sometimes have my students do the \"footnote method\" he mentioned early on. I love the \"embrace your cliche chapter\", and while I don't give advice exactly like this (I emphasize it's still important to avoid cliches), I think his approaching to thinking about how to write a new essay on a well-worn topic is good. Going through those four typical topics and four interesting (well, two interesting, two potentially interesting) lines is really useful for my students, for example. And I actually really like the story of how he got the Korean over-achiever with four parents named Kim to shift perspective and have a really different look at her life story...\n\n...but you're absolutely right that then the essay that comes out of those conversations isn't always great. I give a lot of caveats on the Tyler essay, for example (\"I don't like when we have extended metaphors through the entire essay,\" \"I would be careful about saying you don't want to date Asians, even if you are Asian, even if you say you do date Asians in the next sentence,\") and I feel like it's a big waste that, after pushing for conversational essays, the best lines from the conversation that led to the essay aren't in the essay. Like why didn't the essay start, \"I'm the most Korean person in the world\", and then go one to discuss how she feels like she breaks from her families expectations while appreciating what they've given her? The extended team metaphor seems like it's an attempt to tie together family and basketball, but the student is already the tie; the metaphor I just find distracting.\n\nBut his own analysis of the essay is what's useful to students, namely, \"Does Tyler have a big theory about teams? No, she just keeps it honest \\[...\\] She never says bogus things like 'now I know who I am' or 'what it means to mature as a person,'\" even when the resulting essay isn't as good as it could have been given the material and likely the student's writing skill.\n\nYou said you thought that the good advice stopped on page 20, and that's page 21, and I think that's always the last example I use with my students, which probably supports your theory because I can't even remember what comes after this. Looking, no I sometimes use the failing badly (hitting the hurdle) essay on page 22 or the baseball essay that's next when I have students who are really struggling with \"What can I write about? I'm so boring.\" I guess what I recommend the book for is getting started. By the time the essay's taking shape and you're doing extensive edits, it can be--and maybe should be--left behind.\n\nI don't know what kind of students you work with, but I've just found that the hardest part for many students is actually finding something interesting, especially when they're looking for an interesting perspective on what they know is a common topic. And I think this iswhat *Hacking the College Essay* is good for. It is a good resource for getting students to write an essay that represents *who they are* rather than *what they think an essay should look like*, you know? I find it's most useful at breaking habits and correcting expectations, and I have my own set of essays that I use as good examples (if you use essays that you didn't help edit as your examples, which ones do you use?).\n\nI don't mind the author's questioning of students because I do similar things. Not, I don't think, in an aggressive manner, but because I think they often need to take two steps back and explain why something matters *to them* by extension why I as a reader should care. And me asking, \"Wait, why should I even care? Why does this matter to you? What do you want me to learn about you here? Why are you telling me this?  What else were you doing at the time that can give us little details to help the reader go on the emotional journey that you went through?\" I think helps them realize what the story looks like to other people, which in turn helps them understand how to tell it more fully. My students, at least, don't seem to find this stressful; as when they say something smart to one of these questions, they often know it and their eyes light up.\n\nI can't put my finger on what I don't like about his essays. It doesn't really matter to me that a student says Billy Beane invented OBP, I actually think that's one of the better essays he shows us most of. Maybe what I don't like is that the essays sometimes sound almost dumbed down rather than actually conversational (though, to be fair, most of these kids are not necessarily going to Ivy Plus schools)--the writer definitely has an aversion to words like \"aversion\" and it seems like 90% sentences are \\[subject\\] \\[verb\\] \\[object\\] and so they feel, at times, simplistic rather than oral. He allows too may exclamation points. He also frequently tells before he shows, like \"I will never forget what I saw. The color caught my eye even from far off,\" whereas I teach me students, if you need to tell, you should probably do it after you've shown. The paragraph would be stronger if he dropped, \"I Will never forget what I saw,\" and added the color \\*of blood\\* to the second. Since all the essays have a similar rhythm to how the sentences flow one to the next, I assume he edited them into that shape on purpose (he'd never allow a phrase like \"one to the next\") and I think the essays would have benefited from more variation.\n\nNevertheless, I think *Hacking the College Essay* gives a student an important tool kit, an important starting place, and I don't know of any other essay guide that's as good at helping students avoid writing just a *fine* essay on a boring topic. Sure, the example essays read like they're one or two drafts away from being really good, but that's all stuff that can be fixed later, as they edit, if they're a good writer or have a someone helping them edit. Fixing a boring topic sometimes takes a complete tear-down, rather than just another draft or two.\n\nIf you could only give students one thing before they started, what would it be?",

This information is harder to come by than you think, I couldn't find it aggregated somewhere so I went to every school's website and added up tuition+room+board+fees+insurance, basically everything you need to budget for 1 school year.\n\n\\- Average starting salary from Payscale.com\n\n\\- SAT ranges\n\n\\- Deadlines\n\n\\- Nearest major city and associated stats\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope it helps all you kids who are applying and need to get a visual of the place. Selecting which schools to apply to is a major life decision and you need all the resources you can get!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHalf the vids are in 5k and have drone/walking footage on the main quad, library and student center (I only went to those places so comparisons are easier). The other half is in 4k and being updated with better footage.\n\nAbout 20 have 360 drone footage, if you ever wished you were a bird, you'll enjoy these\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoodluck everyone!",

Many of these topics have been covered in the book titled \"College Coup: Achieving Success in a Broken System\". This book is about the way that successful college students approach college, how they execute while they are in college, and the impact these efforts play in their professional career.\n\nI encourage everyone to give it a read here:  [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W5LFD3Q](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07W5LFD3Q)",
