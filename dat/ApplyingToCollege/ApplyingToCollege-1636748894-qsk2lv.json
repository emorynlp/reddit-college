And since they recruit teens for a living I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re pretty ok with learning that you are, in fact, a teen. \n\n52 year old CEOs probably aren\u2019t as serious as you think they are anyway. They put that on when that\u2019s what the occasion demands, but they\u2019re otherwise pretty normal. Just like financial aid officers and college applicants. We cannot be on our guard at all times and probably shouldn\u2019t try. So don\u2019t be afraid to be yourself. Laugh it off and move on.",
