I\u2019ve never had an interview in my life, my English speaking skills are not the best, and I get very anxious when speaking to strangers. It will be a miracle if I don\u2019t pass out during the interview\ud83e\udd72",

      "text": "Look at this as positive! Generally, the interview is with an alumna from your country (or perhaps someone over in the US who speaks your language). If not, it will certainly be someone who volunteered to interview prospective students, knows where you live and what language you speak, whose intent is to make you comfortable. It needs to be an easy exchange of information...giving you the opportunity to ask questions about the school that you can not find online. You will not pass out!",
