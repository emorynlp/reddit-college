  "text": "My personal essay is essentially going to be about me \u201csucking the bone marrow out of life\u201d in regards to learning. I get quite passionate about things I\u2019m learning and go all in, so I decided that defining feature would be good to write about. \n\nThe issue is I can\u2019t decide if I should write my personal essay on one example of this and really dissect it, or do 3-4 examples and go fairly in-depth, or just list a bunch of anecdotes about it. \n\nHas anyone got advice?",
