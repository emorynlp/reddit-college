  "text": "Hello I'm a junior in high school, gonna play it straight and just say my first 2 years of high school weren't the best. I didn't fail any classes but I got 3 D's and so now my cumulative GPA is around 2.6. I hadn't planned on college so I felt it was fine and I also learned I was suffering from depression and anxiety which had several very negative effects on me. But now I think I would like to enter the field of cyber security as it strangely sounds quite fun. I'm working on improving my grades and now have a mix of A's, B's, a high C and a low C. Sports have never really been my thing, and the electives at my small rural school don't really help push my interest, I mean the only elective I rode nonstop so far is choir and the musicals which I have grown to love since middle school. I would like to get into a prestigious university, or at least one that offers a fantastic program for my major but the best ones here in the US seem to require top of the line grades, be the top of your class, (I'm currently 101 of 133 or 134) or have a killer extracurricular resume but I don't have any of that. I just have a desire to improve my life for me and my family. That was kind of ramble but my simple question is this:  \n\n\nWhat advice can you offer me that can get me to a good university from my current position? (disregarding instate as Iowa is nonexistent tech wise)",
