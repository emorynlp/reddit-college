  "text": "Hi, I'd appreciate some help with my college list!\n\n***-- ABOUT ME --***\n\n**Demographics:**  \nMale Asian\n\n**School:**  \n\\~Top 50 (in-state) public high school  \n\\~Top 5% ranking in class of size \\~200\n\n**Intended Major(s):**  \nComputer Science, considering double major/minor in Music Theory & Composition\n\n**SAT:**  \n1540 (750 RW, 790 M)\n\n**GPA:**  \n4.7 W, \\~3.7 UW (+1 for AP/Honors)\n\n**Coursework:**  \nTook 14 AP classes as of present  \n9th: AP CS A  \n10th: AP Chem, AP Bio, AP Calc AB, APUSH I (school split up APUSH into 2 classes)  \n11th: AP Physics 1, AP Calc BC, AP CS P, APUSH II, AP Lang  \n12th (current year): AP Physics 2, AP Stats, AP Lit, AP Music Theory\n\n**Awards/Honors:**  \nAP Scholar with Distinction (took 9 AP exams, only got 1 score less than 4/5 and it was a 3 in APUSH)\n\nMen's Choir, Chamber Choir, Orchestra won Gold at National Festival\n\nNational Merit Commended Scholar\n\nAccepted into Columbia Science Honors Program\n\nAccepted into Mannes School of Music Pre-college Program\n\nState-level music competition honorable mention\n\n**Extracurriculars:**  \nMen's Choir (All 4 years): Audition-only select group. Gained position of co-president. Group consistently wins Gold at annual national festival.\n\nChamber Choir (All 4 years): Audition-only select group. Group consistently wins Gold at annual national festival.\n\nOrchestra (1 years): Only viola player. Group won Gold and 1st at annual national festival.\n\nTutoring (2 years): Volunteer online tutoring in coding (Scratch, Javascript, Java) and various other subjects. Had 5 students.\n\nMath team (All 4 years): Participated in-state high school league, consistent top placements/placed 1st this year in-school.\n\nNHS (2 years): Community service/peer tutoring\n\nCounty Select Choir (1 year): Selected top 20 out of \\~100 auditionees for audition part\n\nRegional Select Choir & Orchestra (1 year): Selected top 20 out of \\~200 auditionees for audition part\n\nOnline app development (this year): Mentored app development process where I am researching, designing, and developing an app to finish by the end of the year.\n\n**Essays:**\n\nWriting an essay about juxtaposing a cute ethereal childhood story to the present cold reality, and how music brought me back to realizing the beauty of present life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***-- WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR --***\n\n**Financial aid:**  \nI qualify and need financial aid. Money is an issue in the sense that I cannot afford a full college tuition.\n\n**School type:**  \nLooking for decent diversity (there should be no clear single majority/if there is, it must not make up more than 50% of the population)\n\n**Geography:**  \nAs long as it isn't politically conservative, I don't think I mind any specific geography.\n\n**Location:**  \nAs long as it isn't rural, meaning that there are *significant* things to do outside of campus (ex. restaurants, theatres, parks) or in near proximity to somewhere with things to do (ex. near NYC).\n\n**Weather:**  \nNo extreme climates: I hated Nevada in the summer, and I would not like to wear heavy clothing for the majority of the year. I can tolerate SoCal weather because I like SoCal.\n\n**School size:**  \nSmall-medium class size to where its not a few students per class but intimate enough, I would like to know my professors decently\n\n**School vibe:**  \nNerdy but still social, no heavy studying/competitive toxic nature, more on the quiet side but still has a lot of social events.\n\n**Program:**  \nNo specific program comes to mind\n\n**Stats:**  \nProbably can't qualify for T10, but I believe I can at least qualify for T50/T20 for Comp. Sci.\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nThe only college that I'm currently sold on is Carnegie Mellon (SCS). I liked the vibe of Boston University, Swarthmore, and Pomona from their information sessions. I am planning on applying to UCs.\n\nI know that it is very, very close to the early deadlines, but I would still like recommendations with that fact ***not considered***, solely just on what you think would be best for me.\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "I would definitely consider Harvey Mudd - Pomona might be a better fit for you, but I'd look at both at least.\n\nJHU has a lot of what you want - I would reach out to current students though about heavy studying and competitiveness, and specifically about how that is in CS as it can vary. Lots of pre-med heavy schools get a bad reputation for competitiveness, but it isn't always true and even if it is true it doesn't necessarily affect the entire university.\n\nRice could be really good - not sure if that's too extreme weather wise though, or if the overall political climate of Texas is too big a negative.",
