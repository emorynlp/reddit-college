  "text": "I have written the SAT thrice \n\n1) 1500 - 720 EBRW 780 Math \n\n2) 1470 - 680 EBRW 790 Math \n\n3) 1500 - 760 EBRW 740 Math \n\nI am applying as a physics major. The portal asks to submit the highest total score without supers scoring, so should I submit My 1500 from my first attempt over my second attempt  as my first attempt has a higher math score? Or should I mention my second attempt  score of 1470 as it has the highest math which is more important for a Physics major? Personally i think the difference between the 790 and 780 isnt much so i should apply with the 1500 from the first attempt.",
