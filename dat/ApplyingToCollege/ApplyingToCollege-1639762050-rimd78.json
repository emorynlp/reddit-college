  "title:": "I'm a high school dropout and had to withdraw from two universities, best steps for Ivy League?",
  "text": "Hi team,\n\nI\u2019m 24 from New Zealand. To cut a long story short, I had some mental health problems through high school, from being bullied, and other personal experiences. This meant that although I finished high school, I never matriculated. I was a good student with reasonable grades and participated in class more than most. I had multiple extracurricular activities but I had no goal of going to an Ivy League when I was in high school, and my parents wouldn't have been able to afford it anyway. So, until my last two years of high school, when my mental health fell completely and I failed a large part of my exams, doing what I could do to matriculate was good enough for me.\n\nI managed to get into two universities here after I turned 21 under special admission but had to withdraw due to COVID and then a death in the family.\n\nMy main question is, what can I do to get back on a solid footing again and have the possibility of Ivy League?\n\nThank you in advance, and I hope you're all staying safe during this frantic time.",

      "text": "Sorry friend, but I honestly think you're not going to be a good candidate for direct-admission to the Ivy League schools.  \n\nThis sentence right here, is the problem:  \n\n> I was a good student with reasonable grades and participated in class more than most.  \n\nYou don't have to be the absolute top-performer at your school, to get into the Ivy League, but you pretty much need to be among the top-performers.  \n\nYou need robust academic scores, and a history of equally strong academic performance throughout your High School experience.  \nThey also like to see noteworthy extracurricular involvement, to generally include leadership.  \n\nThere are over 4,000 universities here in the US. I guarantee you we can find a couple that are better aligned to your performance-level, and interests.  \n\nIf you really want to attend an Ivy, your best bet will be to enroll at a college or university and flex every academic muscle you have to turn out exceptional scores, and noteworthy involvement in clubs or activities relevant to your academic or career interests.  \n\nOur top-tier universities DO accept transfer appilicants, but only in small numbers, and only if they are solid performers.",
