  "text": "i\u2019m tired of seeing these posts.  You are bragging. that\u2019s all you are doing. celebrate where you choose to go, don\u2019t list all the schools you got into for the clout. there\u2019s no benefit you or anyone else gets from u posting that info, it\u2019s just feeding your ego.  that\u2019s just boastful. \n\nyou\u2019re lying to yourself if you justify your bragging by telling people they\u2019ll get off the waitlist. just because you decline your offer doesn\u2019t mean someone is getting off the waitlist. waitlist acceptances are not 1:1 to declined offers.",

      "text": "Yes.  And people need to think through the logic on that.  \n\nLet's say you got into 10 schools, so when you make your decision, you decline nine of them.  Do you think that nine people (one per campus waitlist) will now get an admit letter, all because you made your decision?  It's pretty exhilarating to imagine that by making up your own mind on a college, you may have enabled the dreams of nine of other people, but that's a fairy tale.\n\nThis shouldn't ring true if you think through all the information you know about the colleges you've applied to.  If that's how it works, doesn't it seem impossible that in some years schools do not go to their waitlist at all? Did they get 100% yield that year?",

Harvard could easily educate a class twice the size without sacrificing any academic excellence. Scott Galloway (marketing professor at NYU) just discussed this in a recent article where he recommended that schools which do not expand their freshman classes to match the growing population should have their endowments tasked.\n\nThis leads to a certain level of randomness in terms of admissions. Which is important to keep in mind because it's very easy to allow your results to rewrite the story that led to it; it's easy to feel like it was meant to be after the fact when luck probably played a huge role. \n\n>  All the work I've put in, I can't help how I feel man.\n\nIt's fine to feel proud of it. I think OP's point is that people are basically humblebragging because they know that bragging directly about their prestigious admissions will just get eyerolls. Also, I personally feel that if you're proud of your work because of its intrinsic property, then there wouldn't be a need to flaunt it. If flaunting it is part of how you express your pride, then you're interested in praise and compliments from other people. There's nothing wrong with being interested in praise and compliments (we all have some of that in us) but it does get obnoxious at times.",

You realize that  telling strangers on the internet how they should behave is quite a futile task, right?",
