They also work so much that the family has no time to do anything, and the kids still usually have to work extremely hard. They\u2019re not the donate a building to get in types, and they usually don\u2019t have a much better shot at need-blind schools than the average person. Sure they have nice cars, a nice house, go on vacation but it\u2019s not like they\u2019re hanging out on yachts smoking with celebrities and getting into really good colleges without an extreme amount of hard work.

Even Palo Alto is only 158k. In NYC it's 64k. These are all 2015-2019 numbers pulled from the Census. 500k is *over three times* the average income in one of the richest neighborhoods on the planet.
