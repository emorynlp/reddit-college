  "text": "So my mom started doing instacart earlier in the year and we spent a good amount of time doing it together would that count lol I am a bit confused on what exactly counts as an ec also I was in this all girl program and they offered internships after you completed the program and I applied but never heard a response will that negatively affect me? Also before covid hit I was a volunteer at a kids cafe with other volunteers and we watched kids checked them in and out when their parents came but it did not last long bc covid hit should i bother including that? Thanks",
