  "text": "I need to submit an application today to meet a scholarship deadline, and\u2026. the common app essay. I just reread it and it felt very bland. Then I pulled up my 650 words optional essay for my REA school, and it gave me a much stronger emotional response.

Why can\u2019t I just be decisive for once\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",
