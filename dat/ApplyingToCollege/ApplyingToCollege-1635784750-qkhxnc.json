  "text": "I\u2019ve submitted 6 out of 12 applications so far (4 of the ones left are UCs but still) and I just want to be done. Luckily EA decisions come out early so if I get into my choice school with decent financial aid I don\u2019t have to apply to the past two that are due in January. Is anyone else feeling burnt out?",
