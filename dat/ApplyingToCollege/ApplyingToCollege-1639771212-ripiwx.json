MID\n\n- Class sizes are huge, as is the school. Technically 15k is upper-medium sized but I'm look at schools between 1-5k now\n\n- don't love the clique culture, poor transportation options unless you have $1000s in Uber money\n\n- food SUCKS, meal plan SUCKS (even without covid issues, the meal plan offers 1,500 calories per day IF used to it's maximum efficiency, which it wont be)\n\n- The main part of campus feels super cluttered, we have like one field that feels open, and they decided to start constructing a new building right next to it. It's not like a city campus, but not like a LAC either.\n\n*Bonus Reasons*\n\n- They denied my request to take a remote final. I had to fly home for reading week to see my family that I haven't seen in 2 years due to covid, and asked if I could take a remote final instead of paying $350 to fly to St Louis for **36 hours** to take two finals.... apparently you can't take them remote unless you're sick or someones dying.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point\n\n- WashUs covid response is pathetic. They think some daily self-screening that everyone lies on or ignores is enough, along with masks indoors (which, of course, no one follows unless it's a lecture hall)\n\nWell... it's not going to be enough. Especially since you have to pay for covid testing unless you have symptoms, and they only report cases 2 times per week (it's more like once a week in practice)",

I\u2019ve just been so self deprecating and anxious. The three weeks after thanksgiving were so stress and work filled. I truly felt like I had no soul. Then a day earlier than expected smack dab in the middle of finals I got into my ED school. It felt like everything was going to be ok again. My first words after my acceptance were \u201cit\u2019s ok, it\u2019s gonna be ok.\u201d I may not be going to an ivy or anything but i\u2019m going to my favorite school by far. I\u2019m already so excited and I have hope again. I also raised my math grade up (not that it rlly matters anymore)! Overall this week was my lowest of low and then like two hours later highest of highs, my pro tip is to have the panic attack after you open your college acceptance letter and not before\u2026 It took me two hours to calm down enough to open it up.",
