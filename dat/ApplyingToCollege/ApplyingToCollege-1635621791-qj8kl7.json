  "text": "Is the Applied Science Program in Biomedical Science a competitive major to apply to within the school of engineering? My other option is going undeclared in SEAS, but I don\u2019t if admissions officers look down on that? UPenn is ultra competitive in general but I\u2019m just trying to increase my chances. I\u2019m fine with both major choices, and I know it is relatively easy to switch majors within SEAS",

          "text": "Yep I know. But for example, computer science is super competitive (for any university) so it\u2019s much harder to stand out.. Right? So I feel like they hold competitive majors to higher standards because there\u2019s so many qualified applicants applying as that major? Do you get what I mean? Or does it truly not matter what major I apply to within SEAS?",

              "text": "There\u2019s no competition by major.\n\nThat said, if you have a better overall admissions story to tell about one major or another that might work to your advantage.\n\nBut there is no \u201capplying as Major X is harder/easier than applying as Major Y.\u201d\n\nLogically, that makes sense right? Otherwise everyone would apply to the perceived \u201ceasy\u201d major and then switch to whatever they really want on Day 1.\n\nI think something like 1/3rd of students apply/enter SEAS as undecided.
