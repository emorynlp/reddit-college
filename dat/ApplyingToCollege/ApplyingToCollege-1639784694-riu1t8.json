  "text": "Yesterday I gathered around my computer with my family ready to record a reaction video to Upenn Ed. My entire family of six was all dressed up in their Penn gear. We were so positive I would get in. I took a summer program there, my sister attended, and even knew some of the professors there. Unfrotunently as I opened the letter it was a complete rejection. I was devastated. Since I was younger I have always dreamt of attending Upenn, but today I learned everything happens for a reason. At approximately 3 pm I was admitted to Uchicago Ea, although I'm not sure if I will attend yet I can happily say that rejection just means a redirection. You all got this, much love!!",
