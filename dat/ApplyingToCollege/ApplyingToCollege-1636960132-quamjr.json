  "text": "My name is Prakash, and I'm from India. I have a dream of studying in the USA, so I gave up my jee mains and advanced and started preparing for the SAT. Although my parents couldn't afford my cost of attendance, I kept hoping on scholarships and financial aid. So, I want your suggestions about which college might suit me and would provide financial aid or scholarships, and some suggestions about what can I do next so that my chances could increase. I have tried to give a basic description of my profile down below,\n\nGrades : \n\n9th class - 90+%\n\n10th class - 10/10 GPA\n\n11th class - 94+%\n\n12th class - 96+% (expected)\n\nTest Scores :\n\nSAT - 1450+ (expected)\n\nExtra-Curricular Activities:\n\nFreelancer (WEB & APP Developer)\n\nStudent Captain ( 7th, 10th, 11th, 12th classes)\n\nCommunity Service ( from 9th class )\n\nSoftware\n\nActivity (Youtuber for more than 3 years)\n\nInternship\n\nDebate / Speech\n\nWord ( Paid ) - Maths Tutor for 2 years\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a compelling essay about my journey of overcoming a near-terminal illness and what I learned during that journey.",

      "text": "See this may seem harsh but it is true. DO NOT AIM FOR VERY PRESTIGIOUS COLLEGES.\n\n* You need aid then that affects your admission chances\n* Stick to public universities (way cheaper)\n* Scholarships are not very easy to get for internationals (more if major is engineering or CS)\n* So I recommend first checking out schools which offer internationals scholarships (cuz many don't)\n* Then apply to schools for which you are overqualified **(cuz the basic aim of scholarships is to lure students with money to their school if they feel you could get a better and more prestigious university)**\n* Some schools to apply to Michigan State, Penn State, Georgia State, Arizona State, IUPUI, University of Delaware, UT Arlington, Oregon State, Colorado State etc.",
