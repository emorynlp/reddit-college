      "text": "It honestly depends on you. I suggest looking more into both schools. Parsons is more well regarded than SCAD, I think, but a lot harder to get into. Both schools can be expensive and, if you need it, aid may be out of your reach as an international. Both schools have good HCI-esque programs but what are you looking for out of the program? More of a technological focus? More emphasis on design (etc). Both SCAD and Parsons are good schools for the major (though if you are looking for more, there are other schools with similar tracks!).",

          "text": "Thank you for your reply. What I heard is that Parsons start courses related to UX in junior year of undergraduate and I am worried if the course prepares us to be ready for jobs. About SCAD, I think its UX major is really great after I check their projects, curriculum and awards. NY and Savannah are different environments. And yes, Parsons has higher rank than SCAD.\n\nWhat I am looking for out of the program is that after I graduate, I would like to be ready to start working in the industry. So, I am confused where to choose by considering the environment, curriculum and connections.",

              "text": "I think both will eventually prepare you but just from a prelim look, it seemed like Parson is focused on building a strong design (art) foundation. While SCAD focuses more on the specific discipline itself. Most schools tend to have sophomore and freshman years filled with less major-specific courses though. But, just from your messages, it seems like you like SCAD more!",

                      "text": "Just from a cursory search, Savannah does have some concerns but I think you're a bit mistaken if you think NYC, NY is any safer? New York City is by no means safe. Big cities like that never are. However, the areas around campus are generally secure. \n\nRanking can be important but, like other things, it depends on your major. I don't know if your undergrad school is important for UI/UX. (Hopefully not since I'm going into the same field!) I would think not since a lot of people in the field just go to boot camps anyway.",

Each one has bad places and good places. The SCAD locations have 24/7 security and physical barriers that require keycards to get into, along with a private bus line only for students. You will be okay.",

From what I\u2019ve seen it\u2019s pretty good with Alumnis graduating and working in big names like Google, NASA, Apple, Amazon etc, California is well-known for their tech industry so you can get a lot of good internship opportunities for being in Artcenter. Hope that helps. (Although I actually lean towards SCAD just because of cost and there\u2019s more information about it\u2019s program)",
