  "title:": "I went on a college tour by myself. And I cried in a Subway parking lot.",
  "text": "I am an international student living in the US without my parents since sophomore year. I live with my legal guardian who is very nice, but he rarely is involved with my life since he is very busy and knows that I can handle things. I would say I've been doing pretty good so far. Although I'm not legally allowed to work and is dependent on the money that my parents send me, I've never asked them for any extra money and made enough saving over the years that I paid +$1500 application fees out of my pocket. I learned how to drive got my driver's license by myself, transferred school in my junior year and did all the paper works related to my VISA by myself, and applied to all the colleges by myself. That's probably why I didn't feel like I miss my parents much although I've never seen them for almost two years. I may have been tricked myself that I am not only physically independent, but also emotionally independent. I was wrong.\n\nYesterday, I went on a campus tour to a college that is about 3 hours away. Since this is the first tour since pandemic and my first time driving this long, I was very hyped about it. I made exactly 3 hours long playlist, packed a bag a week in advance, and planned everything from buying merches to eating in the best restaurant around the campus. I was so happy driving to the college, singing along and talking to myself. \nBut my happiness broke real soon. The tour started and there were two other families, and I obviously was the only one alone. I felt extremely lonely the whole time, watching other parents chatting with their kids and smiling. The campus was very nice and the tour guide was kind enough to give me advice as a CS major, but that didn't stop me for wishing my parents were there.\n\nThe last time I went to a college tour was when my parents visited me for a week, and I remembered small details about them that I didn't realize at the time. After the tour, I found out I didn't have any good picture of the campus. And I realized I always left that job for my dad who loves taking photos. If my mom was here, she would not stop talking about how nice the campus was and ask bunch of silly questions to the tour guide. But no, she wasn't with me.\n\nAfter the tour, I felt extremely lonely and depressed. So even though I planned to stay in the campus and do stuffs, even though the tour guide recommended me to visit other buildings in the campus, I left the campus. Eating Subway in the empty parking lot, I really wished, that my parents were here and I was still their little kid.",

My relationship with my parents is almost the same... they know i can handle things on my own, so I grew up if this sense of independence... however, most of time I have the same feeling you are feeling right now. It would be great to have my parents around me, helping me and treating me as a teenager without any sense of responsibility. Lol\nIt would be great to talk to them about the application process, ask them a shoulder to cry...\nI would like to tell you that my pm are open to you. If you want to talk to me about life, college, funny memes, books, anything... i\u2019m here!",

All I can say is we're kind of growing up earlier than our peers since we don't have our parents with us. We start learning and doing things that our parents were doing for us way earlier than other kids, like finances and visa thingies as you said. But if you think about it in the long run, this is a wonderful thing. There's many people out there who'll never get to achieve this and we already did at a very young age. If anything, we should be proud of ourselves. And I know it kind of sucks to not be able to visit colleges with your family but imagine how impressed those people who saw you drove for 3 hours and came there alone, it shows how mature and determined you are and it's very brave. You have done a crazy job and you should be really proud of yourself. This is something a very few people can do and you're one of them. So honestly I am proud of you and I bet the tour guide was really impressed by your situation. So keep your head up, because you rock :)",

My parents haven\u2019t stepped foot in the country I now live in, much less the city and seen the campus. \n\nYour feelings of loneliness are completely natural. I know that it sucks so much, I feel it too, but take comfort in knowing that it\u2019s a normal thing. I can\u2019t speak for you, but sometimes crying it out is extremely therapeutic for me, and I like to lean into that feeling. \n\nMake sure you call your parents. Tell them all about the campus, about the things they would love. Tell them about what you thought was amazing about the school, what your reservations might be, etc. They can\u2019t be there with you, but the next best thing is for you to tell them all about it. \n\nThe nostalgia you feel for wanting to be a kid again is probably one of the worst parts of growing up. Just remember that what made that time valuable was that it wouldn\u2019t last forever, and the same with the time you\u2019re in now. Make the most of every minute you have with your parents going forward, because it is going to go by quickly. \n\nYou\u2019re doing great, no matter how much it might feel like you\u2019re tearing at the seams. I know I\u2019m not alone in being proud of you.",

It\u2019s only natural to feel the way you do/did, don\u2019t beat yourself up over it. Hugs to you! \n\nIdea - Since it\u2019s only 3 hours away, what if you did a redo and brought a friend or perhaps even ask if your friend\u2019s parent can come with to be your college \u201cmom/dad\u201d for the day? It wouldn\u2019t require too much of them since you wouldn\u2019t have to stay overnight. Only thing you\u2019d have to be careful of is Covid so make sure everyone is masked and maybe drive separately from them?",
