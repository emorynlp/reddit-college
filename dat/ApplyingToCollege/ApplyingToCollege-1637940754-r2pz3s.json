  "title:": "How often do colleges contact counselors?",
  "text": "I'm an international student, and from a rural area. My teachers hardly know anything about the US college applications, so I had to help my counselor and recommenders with the CommonApp because If I didn't help them, they wouldn't have been able to even submit my recommendations. So I wanted to know how often is it that college contact counselor or school. Because my teachers were reluctant to be contacted. I know it sounds weird to some people, but this is a very common case in my area. And according to my teachers, I'm the first student they know who's applying to USA. Most students usually apply to Canada, China etc where teachers were never required to fill up forms or write recommendation letters. So it really took me a lot to explain the whole process to them. And from their attitude, I figured they don't want to be bothered after submitting the application. It's kind of scaring me, because I feel like my recommenders won't even remember being my recommenders and they won't be able to give all information about me upon being contacted.",
