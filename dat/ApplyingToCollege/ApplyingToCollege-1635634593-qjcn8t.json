It looks like I'll have to work throughout Sunday to do it but I'm sure it will be ready to submit everything by Sunday evening. \n\nWill the platform handle Sunday evening fine? I heard it may crash on Monday?",

      "text": "There have been times in past years when it crashed late on the night of the deadline. More commonly, however, people can have problems with payment, payment glitching, as you are taken away from Common App to a payment mechanism and then go back to Common App. Minutes pass. Just an observation, people sometimes have an issue with an international credit card, for example.\n\nIt probably won't crash, but the earlier you can finish, the better. Sunday will be fine.",
