Do you not have meetings and brag sheets? You literally give them what you want them to write. They\u2019re not going to write something bad on it.",

              "text": "Let\u2019s say you request letters from 5 people, which you totally can do. Now college X accepts 3 letter. If you waive your FERPA, you need to think: which teachers know me best, who knows my drive, who knows me as more than just a student. you ask those teachers and hope your right, but ultimately you\u2019ll most likely never know what they said. Or, you don\u2019t waive your FERPA and read all the letters. Then the college suddenly knows that you know what they all say and picked the ones you think are best, which may put you in a light that\u2019s not really representative of who you are.\n\nAlso, moving forwards, coming across in a condescending tone is a sure fire way to make people not like talking to you",
