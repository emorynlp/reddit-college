If you do, especially a significant amount, that will be the biggest determining factor for you. \n\nWhat is your prospective major? \n\nWhat are must-have or must-avoid factors for you? (e.g. proximity to a city, guaranteed on-campus housing, etc.) \n\nThose are some questions to start with, but it really depends on how you personally define \u201cbest for me\u201d which nobody here knows. If you have more specific criteria you\u2019re searching for (e.g. good for film studies, supportive of lgbtq+ students, etc) people could give better answers.",

              "text": "Need-based aid is hard for internationals. Some colleges are need-blind, meaning asking for need-based aid won\u2019t affect your chances. Most are need-aware, meaning asking for need-based aid will affect your chances, often very significantly. Not to be a downer, but many intls asking for significant aid end up not getting into any US colleges every year. It\u2019s the unfortunate reality. \n\nStart with this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/p871lc/lots_and_lots_of_college_lists_for_you_to_check/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and check out the folders of colleges that offer merit aid and the colleges that have historically been generous for intl students. Check out this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/qw1one/is_it_possible_to_afford_a_75k_per_year_education/hl0cepi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) which has some more info and resources. Check out the r/IntltoUSA sub and the pinned post there. \n\nFor queer-friendly colleges, campus pride index is general go-to resource, but [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/o74cu7/happy_pride_month_this_post_is_for_our_lgbtq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) is an excellent post with extra resources too. Hope some of this info helps!",

PhDs receive stipends, rather than paying themselves, so that\u2019s also a plus.",
