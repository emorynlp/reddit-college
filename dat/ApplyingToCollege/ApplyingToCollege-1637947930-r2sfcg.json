  "text": "Hi yall\n\nI submitted my UTAustin yesterday and I wanted to submit my transcripts through MyStatus, but there is one issue.\n\nTheres a bunch of warnings like you wont be able to retract the pdf you upload and your application is prone to being cancelled because of late submission\n\nSo I just wanted to confirm with people who have already submitted their UTA applications about how you upload transcripts\n\nIs it like, you upload 9th first then a new upload entry shows up for 10th and so forth  \nor is it like you combine all your transcripts in one pdf and then submit it in the one pdf entry that shows up",

      "text": "Most (if not all) transcripts are one document with your high school grade history. Are you sure you\u2019re uploading a transcript, not individual year-end report cards?\n\nA typical US High School transcript can be seen at [https://www.cjr1.org/site/Default.aspx?PageID=569](https://www.cjr1.org/site/Default.aspx?PageID=569)\n\nIf your offcial transcript is multiple files, I\u2019d find a way to merge them into a single file. There are several free online pdf merge sites.\n\nAre you uploading documents for RD? The document deadline for priority admissions was November 8. If RD, it may just be a generic \u201cif this is late, then \u2026\u201d (which is just sloppy, lazy programming).",
