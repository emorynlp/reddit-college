  "text": "I'm trying to fill out the Courses & Grades section of the Common App, but I'm having issues with the grade range it allows. I wanted to submit my weighted grades because that's what's listed on my official transcript, but for a grading scale of 1-100 the highest grade it allows you to select is 105, and I have a couple higher than that. Should I just use my unweighted grades?\n\nAlso, my transcript lists Gifted Participation for each year with my other classes even though it's not really a class and doesn't have a grade or credits. Do I still put it on Courses & Grades?",
