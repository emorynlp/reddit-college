  "text": "Screw it, I think this post has to be made. \n\nThis year's application cycle was a bloodbath. Just one look at the numbers will tell you that. Nearly every top college had its acceptance rate halved. Schools are closing waitlists left and right, accepting fewer kids and more. Mix that with COVID, a virtual senior year, almost no outside support - and you get the perfect mix of stress, exhaustion and a deep-seated bitterness. \n\nPeople on this sub are getting all riled up because the class of 2025 is complaining, but we have arguably every right to complain. We got a shitty end of the stick. Now the class of 2024 and 2026 are struggling as well, but I'm not trying to win the pity Olympics here. The truth is that our grade pushed through a lot and found pretty abysmal results. And yes, I know that nobody is \"guaranteed\" a college anywhere, and that nothing can \"ensure\" you get into X school - but when you see 15 percent acceptance rates fall to below 7.5%, its a struggle to keep pushing forward. \n\nOur grade got screwed over by covid, by test-optional, by the gap-years, by the financial issues, and god damn the list just keeps going. And I understand, I understand why the class of 2024 took gap years, I understand why schools went optional. But it still freaking hurts. It hurts because the class of 2024 did take seats away from the class of 2025 (there's no disputing the fact that many schools either accepted fewer kids to account for the gap year students or are closing their waitlists to account for the over enrollment that happened due to gap years). It hurts that I tried so damn hard on the act to get a good score - only for those hours to not be worth anything. It hurts because a lot of us did everything right but as an entire class, we still got screwed over. \n\nSo the very least everybody on this subreddit can do is stfu and let us grieve. Let us grieve over our dreams and over what we lost. Let us complain and then let us heal. We all know that \"in 10 years this won't matter\", but guess what? It matters right now and because it matters right now, it matters. We all know that its silly of us to complain about not getting into dream schools when there's a pandemic going on. We know. We understand. But that doesn't make the pain hurt any less. I also think that if you are not a member of the class of 2025, you should stay out of the discussion on posts like this unless its a cheering up comment like \"congrats on wherever you're committed to OP!\" The class of 2024 cannot truly understand this struggle and I'm honestly sorry to say it, but next year the class of 2026 may indeed understand this struggle (I genuinely hope you don't have to face this battle, but its not looking too hot rn).\n\nI also think that scaring the juniors is not the best way to get this message out - but my last bit of advice to you is to guard your hearts carefully around these schools. Research about them, learn about them but try not to fall in love until after you have that acceptance letter in hand. Its far easier to fall in love with a school rather than fall back out of love. \n\nI try really hard on this sub to be optimistic and a source of some happiness with the insane WL season that we're in rn, but I really think this had to be said. \n\nMuch love guys and remember we WILL be successful. We WILL do great things and we WILL get off these WLs :)\n\n**Edit**: I'm trying to reply to everybody, but I'm sorry if I couldn't reply lol. I'll try to get through to everybody as soon as I can",

              "text": "But I also think these changes and their effects thereof can be a good learning curve for many people's borderline unhealthy approach to committing to top schools.\n\nGrieving right now is completely understandable, but in the long, people have seen the more overt implications in trying to commit to romanticized versions of a life after getting past the waitlist for T20s. Hopefully some sophs and juniors will see the more covert presentations (that are quite similar in nature - isolation, poor mental health, overexertion for a better chance against acceptance rate etc.) - and how because there is no guarantee for getting accepted to your reaches, settling for slightly lesser prestigious safeties isn't compromising four years of grueling hard work.\n\nFor those going from T5 to T20, or T20 to T50s, 10 years from now, the amount it matters will very well be of negligible magnitude. And while grieving is necessary I suppose, it is important not to do so in retaliation to the callous '10 years from now' fact, because that superimposes the same covertly unhealthy mindset for future seniors with dreams of the top of the top schools.",

Why be a fruitless little dude with a big brain when you could be driving trains or welding or pyrotechnics? All those careers have some serious dough to be made!

US colleges have become far too saturated and in 15 years the bachelors will become the new associates (from my uncle, a professor at duke).

The way ur post initially sounded really made it seem like you were saying that our cycle wasn't hard and that we were a bunch of cry-babies, which is what I think ticked a lot of us off.\n\nLastly, saying this cycle was a bloodbath is a metaphor for how difficult it was. Even if technically no blood was shed, a lot more tears and dreams were shed for sure. The kind of pain that many of us feel is something that most other classes won't be able to understand. So just be a but gentle with us seniors rn as well. Many are just lashing out from hurt, and are not trying to be mean or cruel.\n\nGl next year!",

I made sure to clarify this wasn't my intention multiple times in the original post, and then again in my edit, but I understand why people would be pissed if they just read the title and ignored the preface + actual content lol.\n\n>Lastly, saying this cycle was a bloodbath is a metaphor for how difficult it was.

However, I just think when super emotive terms such as bloodbath are used, it overemphasizes the importance of college admissions, which is already seen as the \"end goal\" by many that browse A2C- which makes people feel stronger negative emotions and polarizes them (like we're seeing play out today). Though, this is just my opinion- I don't intend to gatekeep your diction lol\n\nalso goddamn i did not mean to start a whole civil war with this LMAO thanks for being understanding/open to my viewpoint because our views are honestly pretty similar \ud83d\ude2d",

Shit, watching my friends who were presidents of giant (>100) clubs and organizations getting waitlisted everywhere and ending up at a state school is not a fun sight. Yes, its still a good school. Yes, it wont matter in the long run. But goddammit if we knew we were gonna end up there, we wouldn't have poured all that time into extracurriculars and competitions, sacrificing time and sleep. \"Stop saying that your 4 years went to waste?\" Screw it, compared to the amount of work we put in, it did. And yall need to realize that whether we like it or not, many more of us will now have to deal with toxic relatives looking down on us (I believe this is a large portion of the motivation in some cultures). And after seeing the fantastic outputs in co 2020, we cant help but compare ourselves. I'm not saying they didnt deserve their place. They totally did, and with all the circumstances colleges could simply offer more places to kids who were already deserving. But it's also a fact that those seats came from what was supposed to go to co 2021, and that all boils down to this \"bloodbath.\" None of you will understand this odd feeling of dejection because while we recognize that nothing can be done about it, like what OP said, it doesnt lessen the pain. The least y'all could do is let us grieve. Let us vent in the forum and be sad about what was taken.",

I'm not invalidating their efforts however, but I used to skip out on spending time afterschool with them in order to attend practices and clubs, yet the outcome of these sacrifices were pretty discouraging to say the least.

But I promise you that you're good enough, no matter what happens in college admissions.\n\nNo one factor will disqualify your college application and there is no perfect formula  to get into the schools you like. I wrote fantastic essays, led multiple extracurriculars including one that has helped change my school district, and got a glowing letter of recommendation. I got an above average SAT score and GPA and I go to a wealthy public school. I still got rejected from UofM even though it usually accepts about half my senior class.\n\nBut you know what? I'm going to be okay. I'm going to make friends at my safety, I'm going to eat my parents' wonderful cooking every day, I'm going to graduate without any debt.\n\nIt's difficult to set a goal without worrying about falling short. It's okay to be anxious. But I think the most important thing is valuing yourself and believing that you are good enough no matter what happens. You can find things to be excited about whether you go to an Ivy, a state school, or work at the shop down the street.\n\nIf you ever have worries you want to talk about please feel free to start a chat with me.",

I think you have every right to complain but I also think the juniors (like myself) feel frighten by 2025\u2019s responses to everything. I\u2019ve seen posts that are telling juniors they don\u2019t have a chance because of some 2025\u2019s experience which crosses the line imo (not your\u2019s but others) and I think with this transitional shift from co2025 to co2026, we could all try to be a little more civil to each other. Best wishes in college op! :)",

Our safties become targets, targets became reaches and reaches were just outright impossible. We saw this shift with our own eyes. When you fall in love with a target school and then watch it become a reach it really fucking hurts and like everyone says you're not entitled to getting into any school but still being rejected at all your targets and reaches and even safeties stings. On top of that we're bitter that we were kind of lied to or at least told information that ended up not being true. We were told that gap year kids wouldn't have a major effect when in reality it did. We were told test optional kids would have a fair chance which wasn't the case at a lot of schools. This entire thing was a massive clusterfuck and just to add insult to injury we're all in zoom classes so any sense of comradery that seniors had is largely gone. Also want to touch on the argument that this won't matter in 10 years because at least for me it absolutely will. Senior year was supposed to be one of the best years of our lives but for many it was brutal. I thankfully ended up at one of my safties and I'm a little happy but still feel that I put too much effort for my outcome but there are people who work harder than me and are smarter than me in worse situations and that just shouldn't be happening. I hope this gives some juniors just a small sense of how we feel or what we're going through.",

I must've rewritten my essays three times each.\n\nGuess what? I got into no T50s, and people whose essays I edited (and frankly, not all as polished) got into HYPSM(D) schools. I'm going to a music school now, and I had written that off 10 months ago. That application had none of what I wrote above in it. It just hurts to know none of that effort turned into anything.

I mean this in the most genuine way, you guys have pushed through a lot and i\u2019m very proud of you all for getting to this point. just know that you aren\u2019t struggling alone, and you will look back a year from now with a VERY different perspective than you have in this moment. speaking from experience, as i said, i was SO upset when i deposited to my school, but looking back, i\u2019m grateful to have had an experience that forced me to grow and learn a lot about myself. i\u2019m even considering declining my transfer acceptance to stay because i feel way more positive about the school now. the decisions you face now may hurt, and i know that this won\u2019t help much, but you will look back on it with a different mindset. i promise!!! \n\ni hope everything works out and you find happiness soon!! take out your frustration, but don\u2019t let it define how you proceed when august rolls around. sending love!",

Now I don't just mean shotgun to every T20, but if you have a dream school with a less than 30% acceptance rate - apply to other schools similar to it whether it be in terms of vibe, programs, etc. In the end, you might think you are a great fit for a school - but the ao might not. \n\nI know every generation of seniors says this.

My younger sister really wanted to go to ND like my older sister and dad. She did everything she could.

She did everything right, applied early, all the things I didn\u2019t do. ND strung her along for 5 months just to let her know a week or two after waitlisting her that she didn\u2019t make it. It sucked. I\u2019m not going to say I can empathize with you all.

Acceptance rates decreased, but that was mostly a product of the test policies which enabled a vast majority of additional applicants to apply, most of whom would have never applied without these test optional policies. Most of these students really don't have a chance to get in, so in reality the competitiveness of admissions at these top schools remained relatively the same.\n2. Getting mass rejections is not abnormal. My brother applied 3 years before me and was a fairly competitive student, but literally got rejected from every single top school, as well with a lot of his friends. The only difference is that him and people like him weren't quarantined at home with nothing better to do than complain on online forums. A lot of what is happening this cycle, at leat what we are seeing, is due to sampling bias.\n\nI could go on, but these are two misconcptions that should be cleared up. Also, for the record, I'm absolutely not saying it's dumb to be upset--COVID defintely fucked a lot of us over financialling, mentally, etc. I'm just saying that for most of us the notion that \"our dreams were lost\" is absolutely not true; you would not have gotten into a top school if you had applied in a different cycle, most likely. Of course it's not that black and white, but people really need to stop reinforcing this notion that not getting into your dream school is purely due to what happened this cycle.\n\nAlso things like test optional, etc. are good things and are not the reason you got denied...can't believe i even have to say this.",

It made the process much more difficult to gauge and the colleges were not ready for the massive inflow it would cause. Test optional also increased the number of qualified applicants, who previously would've been \"thrown out\" because of those scores. That made the process harder - which was not an expected change. \n\nHonestly, the end-point is that this year just came up out of nowhere and threw us all under a bridge.",

They were the first to get hit with the pandemic; do not blame them for wanting to take a gap year, and in many situations, being forced to take one. Like yeah, it suck our class had lower acceptance rates. But in 10 years, that class will have an even more difficult time getting into top schools as admission rates continue to fall. It is totally okay to complain about our circumstances, but goddamn it I see way too many posts blaming everyone and everything for the reason they didn't get into the schools they wanted to go to. \n\nBlaming anything on 2024 is ill-hearted and makes the class of 2024 feel shitty for trying to cope and adjust their situation. I think anyone from classes affected by Covid are VERY welcome to the conversation because we were not the only ones affected and we aren't going to be the last. I'd love to hear from any 2024 class members and 2026 members as well. 2024 especially can understand this, even if they had more of a senior year and higher acceptance rates. They were seniors when Covid hit, many lost loved ones or turned down schools they were accepted to because people in their families might have gotten laid off. \n\nParts of this post read as a bit tone deaf to me, even as someone who experienced what it was like to be a graduating senior this year. It's okay to grieve or to let yourself process this year/app season, but I don't think it's okay to exclude others that were also affected by this pandemic and partly blame another class for being forced to take gap years that \"stole our spots\" and lowered admission rates. Statistics show that top colleges saw a spike in applications and lower ranked ones fell, that could also have something to do with it, but not ONE person has brought that to the table in all the posts I've read. \n\nI think we just need to be kind and allow open discussion. Reddit is a website full of forums open to whoever joins them and abides by the rules, and discrediting someone because they don't know what it is like to be a 2025 kid is not cool. We don't know what it was like to be a member of the class of 2024, or 2026. Feel free to go off in the replies, but some parts of this post hit me the wrong way and I wanted to give my opinions. \n\nI sympathize with any person who had been affected by the pandemic, had a bad application season, or is dealing with personal issues affecting their livelihood. I want to be an advocate for you and that's part of why I made this reply. \n\nHave a good day and wear your seatbelts.",

We are all just trying to cope in all this insanity and I think with the pain of this app season still fresh - we're gonna see an uptick in some rants on here. If we just let people complain and move on, it'll be better for all of us :)",

Here's what Harvard and many other schools have said. \n\n\"The Class of 2025 reflects the increasing diversity of the College\u2019s applicants, with 18 percent identifying as African American/Black, 27.2 percent as Asian American, 13.3 percent as Latinx, 1.2 percent as Native American, and 0.6 percent as Native Hawaiian. Women account for more than half, 52.9 percent, of all those accepted to the class.\"\n\n[https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/04/harvard-college-accepts-1968-to-class-of-2025/](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/04/harvard-college-accepts-1968-to-class-of-2025/)\n\nAnd typically, these students have hooks. Which increases their odds (Except for the Asains I believe). The data also suggests that applying without a test-score hurts you. Here's UPenn's ED stats regarding that:\n\n \"24% of the Early Decision admitted students did not include testing as part of their application. For the admitted students including testing in their application, the middle 50% testing ranges are 1470-1560 on the SAT and 34-35 on the ACT.\"\n\n[https://admissions.upenn.edu/blog/university-pennsylvania-class-2025-early-decision-program#:\\~:text=The%20University%20of%20Pennsylvania%20received,the%20entering%20class%20of%202025.&text=22%25%20of%20the%20admitted%20students,for%20a%20Federal%20Pell%20Grant](https://admissions.upenn.edu/blog/university-pennsylvania-class-2025-early-decision-program#:~:text=The%20University%20of%20Pennsylvania%20received,the%20entering%20class%20of%202025.&text=22%25%20of%20the%20admitted%20students,for%20a%20Federal%20Pell%20Grant).\n\nOnly 24% of those kids who applied with a test score got in.\n\nAnd regarding your personal experience with Stanford, I'm also a low-income student. I was homeless before. And I had what was considered a strong spike in the Classics. \n\nI got Gold on the National Latin Exam (4 yrs), National Roman Civilization Exam (4 yrs), National Vocabulary Exam (4 yrs), National Mythology Exam (2 yrs), and the Medusa Exam (2 yrs). I had a position on my state's JCL chapter, I was the president of 3 clubs, and I had a perfect GPA (4.0). The only thing missing was my SAT score because it got canceled 3 times.\n\nAnd guess what? I didn't get in anywhere except for my state school. Congrats on getting into Stanford, but not all of us are as lucky as you are.",

Stop telling me that my friends who had published research papers deserved to get rejected from every single place they applied to. I\u2019m the one who had to tell my grandmother that I got rejected from all my top choices. I had to look her in the eye and see the disappointment. When you have to do that then talk to me. All of us worked insanely hard this application season which was hard during covid okay. We couldn\u2019t do a lot of ecs. I was on the swim team and basketball team and all our swim meets and games were cancelled. I was in the debating club and we couldn\u2019t go to any competitions. So yeah it was hard. We put in work. A lot of qualified applicants got rejected because this was a hard application season. Let us mourn our rejections and waitlists. Please. Don\u2019t criticize us and tell us we\u2019re whiny entitled brats for having emotions. We just tried to help the class of \u201822 with their expectations and we\u2019re just trying to let them know how our season went so they can\u2019t be prepared but if their egos can\u2019t take that then that\u2019s fine.",

More student applied to reach schools outside of their \u201cnormally expected range\u201d compared to normal years because of test-optional status. Acceptance rates are just that. Rates. Thus the number of students accepted do not change only really the number of applicants. I doubt that any abnormal amount of students just flat out did not get accepted in college, that is unless they made poor decisions and did not apply to schools to which they have a decent change at getting into. In normal years you have self selecting individuals who outright do not apply to high level schools because their stats do no match the average acceptance to said school, during this cycle, more of these students took the chance given that stats were deemphasized. This makes sense, particularly when you pair it with the fact that waitlists were larger. There was more uncertainty overall and there was more options for many students.",

I cannot go to another state to take the test like others I know did, but in the end test optional DID help and I am paying less than my nearby CUNY and SUNY schools at a private research institution in the Boston area, so no.

You were never an ethereal snow angel manifest destined for greatness. You're a teenager who really wanted something\u2014more than anything you've ever wanted in your life. You didn't just want it; you took active steps over a sizable percentage of your time on Earth to try and get it. You spent very real time and made very real sacrifices to try and achieve something bigger than you. And then you didn't achieve it. To tell you that this isn't a big deal is to directly imply that you are a fucking moron to have ever acted like it was in the first place.\"\n\nA lot of people right now are incredibly stressed, burnt out, underwhelmed, are understandably floundering. I just don't understand why you think aggrandizing others or trying to stifle their emotional outlets is in any way amusing. You may think you're more mature for not taking admissions as seriously, but your \"troll\" comments are just showcasing immaturity.",

      "text": "Wait one minute. \n\n**Nobody** forced students not to take standardized tests. \n\nStudents intentionally **chose** not to take tests, riding on the **false assumption** that if they did not submit test scores, institutions will just shrug and accept them based on GPA, essays and activities.  \n\nWhat really happened is that institutions were given the opportunity to hand pick applicants based on their decades of patterns of prior student performance. They can predict fairly well if a student with x GPA and y test scores will be successful in their program. So this year, they had to make the same predictions without test scores, which meant that unless you had a stellar GPA, you just missed the chance to convince them with a high test score that you are a viable applicant. Remember, their goal is to build the most competitive (qualified) incoming class.\n\nApplicants who would have no reason to believe they could be admitted, saw \u201ctest optional\u201d as a chance to apply to top schools that under normal circumstances would be unreasonable to even think they can be admitted. \n\nThe conclusion here is that you need to build a **realistic** college list. Yea, have a reach place you would like to apply but can\u2019t complain that Harvard, Yale, Stanford or whatever did not admit you when they received 50%+ more applicants after going test optional because applicants thought they could trick admission committees in admitting them.",
