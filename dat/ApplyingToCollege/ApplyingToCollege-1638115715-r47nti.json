  "text": "Hello! \n\nfor the UC application I want to report two awards I got from the same organization but from different competitions (one is computer science the other is engineering). I was wondering how I should go about writing the \"Requirements for the award\" and \"What you did\" sections. Since it is the same organization and the awards were won in the exact same way, is is acceptable to use the same text for both? Or should I just reword it for the second award. Thank you for your time!",
