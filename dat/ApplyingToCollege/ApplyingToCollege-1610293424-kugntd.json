I had to go to mental hospitals, took medication for a year and a half that was way over the dosage for my age, and went to several programs for my depression and anxiety disorder. Now, about a year later, i never attempted suicide again and i'm doing amazing at school with a 3.58 gpa right now out of the 4.0. But because I literally wasted 2 years doing nothing but thinking of ways to die, i have literally no awards no clubs no sports no nothing. I was planning in playing soccer junior years but becuz of covid i opted out. No EC or awards will kill my app, right?\nAlso, i have great relationships with my sophomore world history teacher and a counsler who knows my journey with my mental health.",

Like I really don\u2019t want to explain for the fifth time that just because I have good grades or that they sent me a letter it means I\u2019m a shoe-in for the Ivy League, when I\u2019m really just trying for my state school lol",

Also, I COULDN'T apply to Brown University because this university DOES NOT accept DIRECT application ONLINE; ONLY THROUGH COMMON APP. Many students applied to more than 20 universities to improve their acceptance chances. I DON'T understand the logic behind limiting students from applying more than 20 applications on COMMON APP. In addition, why Brown University DOES NOT allow students to apply directly? Because of this limitation, I am being denied the chance of admission to Brown's 7-year medical program straight out of high school. The only way to attend Brown now is through transferring at the later year from another university.",
