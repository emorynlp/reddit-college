      "text": "hi\ni also got rec letters from teachers who no longer work at my current hs. first of all, i tried to notify them beforehand like very informally simply cuz we are very good friends with them. then, i wrote an email where i firstly thanked them for agreeing first hand, then attached official commonapp recommendation letters guides, then gave a list of my extracurricular activities so that they know what i have been engaged with, told about the deadline (i did 15 days before my real deadline and ofc all of them submitted it past my deadline yet in time for the real one) and then did some PS just to make sure they don\u2019t put any specificity about any college as these letters go to every single one i apply to through commonapp if i assign them. then i thanked them once again and that\u2019s pretty much it",
