      "text": "see if you can self report but also most schools still accept that stuff late. Some schools like Michigan and WashU require everything is in or at least sent by the deadline. But for most colleges things like letters, transcripts and test scores can be sent or received after the deadline. Just check their website to be sure. Some colleges even allow i to upload new test scores to your app on their portal after you\u2019ve applied.",
