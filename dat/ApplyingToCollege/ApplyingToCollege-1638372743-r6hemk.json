  "text": "EDIT: to clarify I meant that like if I ask for the recommendation again for a different school naviance can just take their first one and send it to that school also \n\ni want to add some schools in common app but I\u2019ve already asked my teachers for recs on naviance. Someone told me they transfer over and they don\u2019t have to do any work, but I don\u2019t want to give them extra work in case they do and pester them because I\u2019ve been pestering them constantly for the first round of recs anyway",
