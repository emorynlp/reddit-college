  "title:": "33yo college dropout, I have some questions about going back",
  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI want to go back to school and I would love to get some unbiased advice, either from here or maybe you can point me to the right direction. I left my university back in 2014 because I was dealing with stuff, but I am ready to go back. \n\nI want to take online courses as much as possible, for as cheap as possible and then transfer them back to the university I dropped out of. So I'm trying to take 100% of prerequisites online, and I am also trying to do this for as cheap as possible, seeing I will not qualify for financial aid. \n\nAlso, I don't know how to read my own transcript :( I don't want to post it for the whole world to see. Would someone ever so kindly help me to read it? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you!!!!!",

      "text": "So, in terms of taking classes as cheaply as possible, I\u2019d just go to a local community college. Many of them have online classes, and are pretty decent about transfer credit.\n\nIn terms of reading your own transcript, the best place to go would be your old college. Anyone on here would be able to guess as what it means, but we\u2019d have as much information as you do.",

Get the best academic/life advice you can. That alone may save money and it will definitely save your sanity. Good Luck...you seem like great candidate.",

      "text": "Call your community college where you're taking online classes and ask them if they have an articulation agreement with the university. You should also be able to find it online with a little digging. Make sure the classes you are taking will transfer. Then call your advisor and make an advising appointment to create a transfer plan for yourself.\n\nDon't have some reddit rando evaluate your transcript. That's literally the job of your academic advisor.",
