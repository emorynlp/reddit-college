  "text": "ok so i saw a post that was like most high school kids don\u2019t spend their time on a subreddit abt applying to college but like we did not acknowledge how insane it is that we all are here. every single person on here is unhinged. me included. i hope all of us have a good second semester bc there\u2019s no way a person should be operating w so much stress they spend a lot of time here. and i hope we all figure out how to manage our stress bc if this is how we\u2019re acting in high school we might all lose our minds in college.",
