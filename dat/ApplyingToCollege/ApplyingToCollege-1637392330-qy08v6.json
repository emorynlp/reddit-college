  "text": "I have heard that sometimes when you apply as a transfer student, the university to which you apply in the US, can require transcripts of the curriculum of the University where you were studying. In my case translation of the curriculum might be a very expensive and hard process that can also require a lot of time, so I really don't want to do that. So should I hide that I am already enrolled in the University or apply as a transfer student? BTW this is my first year of studying and I still haven't finished my first semester, as I enrolled in September(fall of 2021).",

      "text": "This depends on the policy of the university for transfers.\n\nAs an example, UChicago considers someone a transfer if AND only if you have completed \"one full term (e.g. semester, quarter) as a full-time student in a degree-seeking program.\" They consider you a first-year applicant if you haven't completed a term yet even if you are enrolled at a university.\n\nMeanwhile, other universities, like say the University of Toronto (iirc), consider anyone who  has taken up college courses to be transfer student.",
