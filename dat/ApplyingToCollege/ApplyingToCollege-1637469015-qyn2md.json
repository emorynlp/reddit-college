  "text": "Hey all,\n\nI have a question regarding college courses on the UC application, and I haven't been able to get a straight answer from the UC admissions email. Basically, I have taken summer courses at a local community college the summer after 9th and 10th grade. The UC application has a place for college courses, but it is listed by grade. Would I list summer courses taken the summer after 9th in the 9th grade section? Or in the 10th grade section? And what about 10th grade? Is it the same thing?\n\nI appreciate any replies.\n\nThank you!",
