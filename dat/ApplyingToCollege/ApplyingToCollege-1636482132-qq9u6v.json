  "title:": "DO NOT ATTEND WILLIAMS COLLEGE if you have even the slightest inkling of mental problems",
  "text": " \n\nThis school will pretend that because of the small community the administration will really take care of you. This is absolutely not true in my experience. If you have a disability they will recommend medical withdrawal before giving you actual solutions to your problems or accommodation. It seems like literally no one is happy here. I know several people who are considering transferring because of how toxic the work culture here is and how damaging it is to the mental wellbeing of the students. Somehow this school costs over 70k a year yet the counseling center and office of accessibility are understaffed.\n\nAdditionally, the administration has treats us like actual children. Yes, it is great that with COVID they ensured we did not have an outbreak. However, they put unnecessary measures in place that literally no one supports. For example, there was rumors that someone got roofied a few weeks ago and the school decided that we could only swipe in to our own dorms. And this was at all times. Just a major inconvenience that did 0 to help the situation. And now campus security is shutting down parties in dorms when they never did before, killing the already non existent nightlife here.\n\nAnd this is not even to consider the additional stress if you are not rich, white, cis, and able bodied.\n\nThere have also been 3 suicides in the class of 2024 so far and all the college did was send out the same generic emails with absolutely no changes despite this trend.",
