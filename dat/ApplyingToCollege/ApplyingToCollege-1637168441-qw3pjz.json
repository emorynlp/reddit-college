      "text": "Check with the individual schools you're applying to and ask. \n\nI was told by one university that if you are currently taking a dual-enrollment class and the class is listed on your high school transcript then you don't need to submit the transcript from the dual-enrollment university until the course is completed. The mid-year report from your high school will have the current grade on it. \n\nOnce the course is done, contact the dual-enrollment university and request the final transcript. \n\nHowever, if all of your dual-enrollment classes are already completed, request and send the dual-enrollment university transcript now.",
