  "text": "I am literally at the very last moment before complete and total burnout so sorry if this sounds rushed or incomprehensible. \n\nANYWAYS, I am currently a first year student at a decent state school, however I want to transfer next fall to the college my mom works at for free tuition (yay!). \n\nHowever, the college I\u2019m transferring to wants me to complete two semesters at the college I\u2019m currently at (fair, fair). \n\nBut the issue is I\u2019m applying right now. I barely have a semesters worth of college to show. Should I wait until the end of my second semester to send over my transcripts and application? \n\nThanks for the help.!",

      "text": "If you are applying for Fall 2022 as a Transfer student, you need to apply by the deadline for Transfer students...it's usually in early 2022 (Jan-Feb? or Spring April?) That date can be found on the college's website. It is fine to go ahead and submit your application and transcript, with the caveat that you will need to update with first grades and courses. Do you already have  a semester's grades?",
