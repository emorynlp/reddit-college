      "text": "Some T20s won\u2019t transfer credits for DE classes or they limit how many units they\u2019ll give you credit for. Unlike many state schools, they really want you to earn your degree by taking their classes with their professors. AA is generally not to be competitive/advantageous for these colleges, because the quality of program varies a lot. I would take classes that interest you or get out and do interesting things in your community.",
