  "title:": "Question about Sending SAT Scores",
  "text": "Hi, I'm about to apply to the University of Pittsburg, and I have pretty much set to hit submit and make the payment, but I realized that they don't accept self-reported SAT scores.\n\nSince this is the only school so far that required an official report, I was kinda confused on how the process worked. Should I first send the score report through Collegeboard to Pitt and wait until they've received the score, or should I submit the application and submit the score report (which is supposedly scheduled to arrive after 2 or so wks).\n\nThe thing is, it's rolling admissions, so I want to submit my application as soon as possible, and I'm not really sure how to proceed with the school needing SAT reports.",

Schools are good at matching up application components.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm about to apply to the University of Pittsburg,\n\nIt would probably be advantageous to spell the school\u2019s name correctly.\n\nThere\u2019s a Pittsburg State (Pitt State) in Kansas and a University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) in Pennsylvania.\n\n(And for those wondering. Perdue is a chicken, not a University)",
