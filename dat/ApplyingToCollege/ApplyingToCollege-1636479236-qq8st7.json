      "text": "Apologies for the delay in responding here \u2014 I just noticed this post! \n\n[EPIC](initialview.com/epic) is a great way to get to know colleges if you are still trying to figure out which colleges to apply to. Some schools do track demonstrated interest, so if they see you engaging this way, they will make note of it. But the schools on EPIC really mostly want to engage with you and answer questions about the process. You will get a video (or multiple video) response \u2014 which can be a huge confidence boost.\n\nIf you are a senior, you should consider including an [Elevator Pitch](initialview.com/elevatorpitch) to include with your application. It\u2019s an opportunity to insert your actual voice in the process and gives the admissions officer reviewing your application \u201cmore evidence\u201d to advocate for you and bring to the admissions committee table. They want to be able to imagine you on campus, and what better way to imagine you than to hear your actual voice. It\u2019s also honestly a little bit harder to say no to someone who you see/hear than to just an essay/supplement in a file. \ud83d\ude09\n\nThe nice thing is that it\u2019s just one video for all the schools you are applying to. So you don\u2019t need to try to contort yourself to one school. Just talk about a few things that are important to you that were hard to describe on the rest of your application. You are more than 600 words. \ud83e\udd29",
