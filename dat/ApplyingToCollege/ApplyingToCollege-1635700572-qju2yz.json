  "text": "Hey guys, I'm about to submit my ED app but my chances are pretty rough so I wanted to know which of these 2 Unis would be a better choice for ED2 if I want to study CS? I want to know which has the objectively better STEM and CS program and which has better prospects for intl students that need aid. I would also like to know which one offers a bigger ED boost that might push my application over the edge.",

      "text": "WashU and Tufts have roughly equal CS programs.\n\nWith STEM overall, WashU is probably better due to the life/physical sciences.\n\nBoth WashU and Tufts meet 100% of demonstrated need, but are both need-aware for international students. Both should provide roughly equal aid.\n\nI believe the ED boost is greater at WashU, but there's no way to really tell with ED2.",

          "text": "Unless something has changed very recently, Tufts is significantly better about providing aid to international students -- not all need-aware schools are equal here.  Tufts provides large need based aid to around 150 international students - WUSTL does the same for about 50 international students. Details can be found in section H of their common data sets.",

                  "text": "U Chicago doesn't disclose that info.\n\nThe third chart below is a pretty good info source - if a school is missing info there it can be worth checking if they provided stats in a previous year (Tufts for example has numbers for 2019-2020 on their CDS, but not in 2020-2021 form so don't have the numbers on the spreadsheet). \n\n[https://www.bigjeducationalconsulting.com/resources](https://www.bigjeducationalconsulting.com/resources)  \n\nThe section of the CDS that really matters for this is H6.  Obviously the few need-blind, meet full need schools are exceptional.  Then you have schools that aren't need blind but still meet the need of a lot of their international students (Dartmouth or Williams are prime examples), schools that provide some aid to lots of students but don't have large average aid packages so aren't meeting full need usually (NYU), and schools that limit how many students with need they admit but meet the need for those students (Tufts and WUSTL are both in this group, as are schools like Brown and Cornell).",

              "text": "This is true, but it\u2019s very difficult to translate this into odd because a) a much higher proportion of Tyfts students are internationals at the undergrad level (STL vs Boston) and I\u2019d imagine a much higher proportion of applicants on top of that are probably found at Tufts. The endowment boost has also thrown another 30 million or so into domestic aid with additional commitments to international aid. How much and how significant that is for this years class is anyone\u2019s guess though. \n\n\nThat said, OP, I imagine Tufts is a bit easier admit than WashU, so if you\u2019re relatively neutral in preference with respect to everything else, I\u2019d choose Tufts. Key word:  probably. Because we have a good of idea what the admit rate for internationals is at both schools nor do we know what the admit rate is for internationals with aid. If you find yourself preferring WashU somewhat decisively outside of the core discipline, I\u2019d pick WashU.",
