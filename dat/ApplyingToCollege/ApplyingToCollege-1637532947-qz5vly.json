  "title:": "Do I have to write an admissions essay if I was offered a scholarship without applying?",
  "text": "I was recently sent a thick envelope from University of Michigan Ann Arbor, offering a 4 year full ride scholarship. This scholarship is called the HAIL scholarship and it does check out, as I know others who currently attend U of M with this same scholarship. I had never applied to U of M, for a scholarship and never taken interest in the college on any of those websites high schools make you use to plan your future. My question is, if they are offering me this scholarship without an essay or an application do I have to write one to accept the scholarship? Logically I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to write an essay because they were offering me a scholarship without an essay to begin with. But that could just be my procrastination speaking lol. Anyone have any answers? TIA\n\nTLDR: I was offered a scholarship without applying for it or to the college in general, do I have to apply to the college/write an essay now?",
