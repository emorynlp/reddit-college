  "text": "Hi guys!\n\nI'm from Vietnam and I want to apply for a BA in nursing (presumably in Australia). At first, I was looking through some reviews about La Trobe, Swinburne and Edith Cowan and 2/3 are mostly bad and I am a little confused. I just want to ask if this link is legit or is there any site to see college's review that you know of. Also do you know any other institution renowned for Nursing in Australia with a nice budget?\n\nThank you y'all",
