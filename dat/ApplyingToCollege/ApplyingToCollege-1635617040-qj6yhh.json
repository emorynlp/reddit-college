I had never heard anything about it, and when we entered the page, the first step involved the Social Security Number.  We don't have that in Colombia, and we probably don't have the files that will be requested in the next steps. \n\nAOS, Should we still try to fill it in or is it only for U.S. citizens? \n\nTHANK YOU and HAPPY HALLOWEEN woooo!!!",
