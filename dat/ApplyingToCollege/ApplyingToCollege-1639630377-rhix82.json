  "text": "Im applying to UC\u2019s and safeties in California but I really don\u2019t want to stay here. I just don\u2019t belong here, but Im scared of also applying to oos unis because of my academic record. Can someone recommend some colleges that are good for econ? I have a 3.51 and I think Im going to end with a ~3.6 - 3.7 by spring. Im looking for places with a good mix of nature and city life, I also like small towns but not like suuuuper small. preferably a place that snows and has actual seasons and not just fog \ud83d\ude2b",

We\u2019re still incredibly young and Cali has *great* schools to serve you in the meantime.\n\nHopefully each of us can go to our desired locations in the future, but spending the tuition just to go OOS may simply not be worth it for the time being and in the long run.\n\nOh but if you can get like a full ride scholarship to some OOS school go right ahead and disregard what I said lmao, but it\u2019s just not likely",
