If the school doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re the right fit than that\u2019s okay, everything happened for a reason. \n\n\nI literally just bombed a virtual audition after practicing for 3 months straight (the set up screwed me and so many people over). Those were the words my band director said to me. And he\u2019s right. \n\n\nYou\u2019re going to be okay, go get some coffee or ice cream. Take a walk, grab you fav meal and just let whatever happens happen",

I\u2019ve written a couple of posts recently that might help you prepare \n\nHere\u2019s my first one about emotional planning and what that means: https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/r8sjp7/happy_weekend_beautiful_seniors_if_you_applied/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nHere\u2019s my post from yesterday with some stories about baby trees, lotuses, college decisions, and you: https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/rdhia6/you_can_handle_this_college_decision_time_is_hard/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nAlso-- I was recently on the \"Inside College Admissions\" Podcast with Scoir talking about handling your decisions and how it hurts, but then it passes.  Even if it feels like the worst thing in the world right now, it will pass. You are the sky; everything else is the weather.

College decision time is hard --- and it really sucks sometimes, but you're gonna grow stronger.\n\nxoxox \n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-",
