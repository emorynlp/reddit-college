It depends on the person, if your EC was for a month vs years, if it was impactful, if it was believable, if you showed that it was something you\u2019re truly passionate about, if you did it for fluff, etc. Have a quick look over here to get an idea: https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/wiki/activities?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",

      "text": "Just to be different:  any EC that humanizes you, involves self-sacrifice and conveys something positive about your character.\n\nFor instance, if you had a sibling with a cognitive disability and devoted a lot of time and energy to Special Olympics, that could be extremely impactful.\n\nIt's not all about academic competitions, research papers and founding non-profits.  Not every EC needs to make you look \\*smarter\\*.",

For example if you want to major in computer science, building successful apps and succeeding in coding competitions is a good way to show ability and passion. The most important however is to do something you like, because you will always do better in something you love to do rather than something you hate doing",
