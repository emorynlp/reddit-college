  "text": "I love both Tufts and UIUC equally. Should I apply ED2 to Tufts? My ECs are not the best, and I know that they value demonstrated interest a lot. I don\u2019t want to ruin my change as well ;(\n\n\nContext:\n- I received a scholarship that will give me a full ride to its partner schools only (including Tufts)\n- I want to do CS atm, but it may change (I\u2019ve changed my major over 5 times this year, but I know that I want to do something in STEM for sure)\n- a FGLI & undocumented HS senior in IL (in-state for UIUC)\n\n\nTufts (guaranteed a full ride)\ud83d\udc18\ud83d\udc99\n- easy to change major\n- more individualized attention\n- pay you for doing unpaid internship\n- amazing support for undocumented students\n- quirky ppl ( I consider myself quirky ig\ud83d\ude1d)\n- was accepted to their fly-in program and had a blast\n- far from home\n- close to boston\n\n\nUIUC (about 115K for 4 years)\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc99\n- applied as CS + X major (guaranteed a 10K scholarship to use over 4 years if accepted)\n- T5 for CS\n- changine major is not as flexible\n- school spirit/ so many RSOs + parties\n- close to home\n- My father loves this school (he said he\u2019s willing to pay but still)\n- I don\u2019t qualify for the illinois commitment (bc im an undocumented student) -> not undocumented friendly\n- fantastic career fairs\n- ample research opportunities for ppl in my desired major",

      "text": "If you are an Illinois resident, how is CS+X $115k? I see in-state tuition at $15k -- unless you are talking about room+board and other expenses included. Is the Tufts scholarship for all expenses or just tuition?\n\nIf you think UIUC CS is not quirky, you haven't hung around North Campus enough. Also... the UofI system (so UIUC and UIC) has fantastic support for undocumented students and has increased that support recently. They caught a bit of heat for this over the past few years -- which was why the previous President even hosted (then canceled) a rally near UIC.\n\nUltimately, do what *you* want -- but UIUC CS is a jewel most people would clutch tight and not even consider trading for Tufts.",

Now you just need to get in and sounds like you have that covered somewhat.  My vote is for Tufts absolutely.  You will love it.  The new engineering building is awesome.  Lots of opportunities for work in the Boston area afterwards also.",
