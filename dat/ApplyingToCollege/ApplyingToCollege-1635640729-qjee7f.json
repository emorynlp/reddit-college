  "text": "Hey so recently I've submitted my common app for umd and gained access to the application portal. I was looking at the checklist and it says that my application is not complete and next to each question it just says \"Received Date.\" Is this just because they haven't matched my materials to my application and will it be updated later on? Because I know that I sent my ACT scores almost a month ago so if anything they should be listed as received.",
