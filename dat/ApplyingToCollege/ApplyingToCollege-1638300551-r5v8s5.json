The PLO site has already been updated with the interest form so make sure you fill that out.\n\nAs for helping with college admissions, I don't think you should do something just so that you can put it on your application. With that said, I think it is a good indication that you are a bright candidate. I know a few people who did the linguistic olympiad that got into Cornell, Dartmouth, MIT, and duke. This doesn't imply that they got in just because of this. Their overall application must be outstanding. \n\nI believe that it will help you grow otherwise as well. Best wishes!! :)",
