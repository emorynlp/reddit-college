  "text": "Went on for about 56 minutes, honestly don't know how to feel. She was really nice and we kinda just talked about random things rather than questions I was expecting. Talk about my volunteering and even about just mask mandates and thing happening across the US (definitely couldn't think much anecdotal evidences so mainly just talked about how I felt). It was kind of awkard especially when she said she tells everyone but remember that whether I get rejected or not, it's not about the college (felt kind of bad right after since it's probably not a good sign). Towards the end after running out of questions and not knowing what to say, she ended the meeting with the usual how it was nice to talk to me and everything and said she had another interview soon and had to cut it short. Good experience though, she was so nice throughout.",

I thought that meant the interview went badly, but afterwards I emailed them and thanked them for their time and they said \u201cThank you. I sent a very favorable report.\u201d I think the end speech is kinda part of the interview protocol??",
