  "text": "Hi everyone, I'm writing Colgate supplement essay and have some confusion about understanding the meaning of this prompt:\n\n\"Colgate cultivates a skilled and engaged student body. Through their achievements, our students reflect the University\u2019s reputation as a great place to pursue one\u2019s **academic interests**. Tell us in **150-200** words about an **academic or personal** **experience** **that highlights your** **skill and potential as a Colgate student\".**\n\nI want to ask that does my answer need to include what resources and opportunities at Colgate help me pursue academic interests later (like \"why us\" essay) or do I just need to highlight my academic and personal experience to highlight my skill and potential (learning style and curiosity).\n\nI'm so confused with \"as a Colgate student\", btw there are only 150-200 words so the space is really limited to mention Colgate's resources.\n\nWhat's your opinion about that prompt?",
