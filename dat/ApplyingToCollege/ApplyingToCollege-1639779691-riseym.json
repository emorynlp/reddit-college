  "text": "It\u2019s been halfway thru my sophomore year, and I live in a pretty competitive part of the country. My parents expect me to get into MIT or Stanford or similar. My grades during 9th grade were decent (As and Bs), and they\u2019re getting a bit better. I also have a decent amount of extracurriculars so far. However, it feels like I\u2019m way behind my peers in terms of readiness of college admissions. I feel like I\u2019m mediocre compared to them. I often end up screwing a major test or my grades in general because I tend to procrastinate. Is it too late to change myself? How can I change myself to be hardworking? What are things I can do now so I have a better chance at MIT or Stanford?",
