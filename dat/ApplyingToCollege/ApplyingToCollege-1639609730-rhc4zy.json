  "text": "Hi A2C, I need some advice about letters of recommendation.\n\nTL;DR: Is it better to submit only the required number of letters of recommendation, or an additional/optional letter, knowing that it's probably better than one of the other ones. \n\nBasically, at the beginning of this year, I asked my English teacher that I had online for a semester junior year for a letter of recommendation. She submitted it for all the EA schools I applied for, as well as most of my RD ones. But now, I feel like my current English teacher knows me a lot better because we are in person now, so she wrote me a rec letter too. So, I wanted to use her rec letter for all my RD schools, but my other teacher already submitted them for most of my RD schools. My school uses Naviance for rec letters, so my counselor and I could not figure out a way to remove the letter, even though I haven't actually submitted my application to the RD schools yet. So, would it be better to just use the old rec letter, or also include this new one (that I think is better) too? When I looked online, most people agree not to submit an additional/optional letter unless it's different from the rest, so I came to ask for advice. Thank you!",
