  "text": "Hi, My name is Ian Speer. I'm a Career Advisor. I have spent the last 2 years teaching I.T. and Cyber Security. (This can be validated if you go to my profile, I have a post on my profile that links my LinkedIn that has proof of my credentials) If you are looking into going to school for I.T. / Cyber you have 4 options. Formal School, Online Live, Online Live with Career Services and Learn at your own pace, I've concisely listed the differences below. (feel free to search anything I say)\n\n1.) If you go to formal school, GET A DEGREE IN SOMETHING ENGINEERING-BASED, if you get a degree that covers any existing non-networking systems or applications the majority of that information will be out of use by the time you graduate because those systems won't be current anymore 4 years in the future. Google, Apple, IBM and others have directly stated that they don't hold a degree over a certification anymore and others are following suit, (you can verify it easily yourself, there are many articles on it) The Department of Defense also puts more weight on the certifications via DoD Directive 8140. Most certifications require re-certification which guarantees to an employer that your knowledge is at most under 3 years old, proving to them you can at least use their current systems. Formal school has the highest cost/time dedication required and except for very few select schools do not offer job placement, or career sustainment. Information Security degrees are the only non-engineering based I.T. field that has held any viability in the job market lately, I.T. should always be learned from institutions that specialize in the I.T. field because it creates a huge difference in the viability of the training. There will be a vast difference in a degree from any non-tech College/University focusing in I.T. and a degree from a school like M.I.T, to the point they are nearly incomparable while both being degree programs, they are simply not the same thing and do not carry near the same weight. Typically formal schools with have career services of some kind, but this could just mean they have you go to a job fair after graduation and may have some resume templates or a free course on how to use LinkedIn, but to be honest you could get better help from YouTube in most cases.\n\n2.) Online Live, these are certification based, if you go this way use a sizable school, it takes tremendous resources to make good training programs for these certifications because they teach you more about the field in less time and they must be large enough to actually be able to create and sustain the training they advertise, this is why small I.T. schools typically have horrible reviews, you have to be able to teach more information in less time, so in order to compete with a university you must have the means to afford it. These 'Schools' will provide you with live certification training including live training with an instructor you can communicate with. Make sure your school has instructors who are certified in the subject they are teaching before registering.\n\n3.) Online Live with Career Services, (This includes everything from #2) This CAN (depending on school) include everything from Online Live but will also carry a varying number of services. This can include job placement assistance, resume assistance and LinkedIn assistance to help your personal branding, interviewing practice, vouchers for the certifications and retakes, 1-on-1 certification tutoring with certified teachers, job replacement (say you get placed in a job and it's not a good fit, they'll move you to a new company. This is a very rare offering) free course re-takes and lifetime services (any of the above services can also be offered in a non-exhaustible capacity). Online live will typically take much less time to complete than a degree, cost less and if certified in a lower level cert like security+  it can have similar payout to a 4 year degree in information security in a fraction of the time for a fraction of the cost. Proof: \n\n[https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Certification=CompTIA\\_Security%2B/Salary](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Certification=CompTIA_Security%2B/Salary)\n\nvs\n\n[https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Degree=Bachelor\\_of\\_Science\\_(BS\\_%2F\\_BSc)%2C\\_Information\\_Security/Salary](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Degree=Bachelor_of_Science_(BS_%2F_BSc)%2C_Information_Security/Salary)\n\n4.) Learn at your own pace, these can be good for some but be careful because most of these are predatory, ever see those advertisements on social media for a bundle package of self paced training courses for under $200? Go to the website and look at the course codes, they might be selling you valueless training for an expired version of the certification you can't even test for anymore. Always look up the current code for that course and make sure they are offing the same course code, otherwise it's a bad purchase and they are just trying to make a quick buck unethically. If you are already fairly versed in I.T. and comprehend the subjects easily, a learn at you own pace course could work well for you, just make sure you only get training directly from the creator of the certification or from an authorized training partner of that company. This can take the least or the most time to achieve. (100% depending on how easily you take to I.T. and for job placement you will be totally on your own.)\n\nLastly, there is no easy road into I.T., you will have to study hard to get into I.T. regardless of the path you take of the 4, this will be the case without exception. All four paths have their place, just ensure you make the right choice for you. Engineering should be done at a reputable university, general I.T. / cyber should go option 3 because it's going to be the same payout as a 4 year degree with less commitment when it comes to time and money, with a higher change of getting a job later on. There is no reason to go for number 2 over 3 unless there simply are no options 3's available to you. If you are gifted in I.T. or have your own experience in I.T. and naturally take to the topics, Learn at your own pace may work well for you, but for most this will be unrealistically difficult to teach yourself.\n\n If anyone has any questions feel free to contact me.",
