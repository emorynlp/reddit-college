  "text": "Alr so basically somebody just got in EA for Harvard in my school. Ik that Harvard usually only accepts 1 student per school and like its pretty rare they accept 2 students per school. I didn't apply ea bc i wanted to get my sat score up (the person who got accepted went test optional so rip me). Heres the thing tho: a very prominent Harvard prof is writing me a letter of rec and he's basically the chair in the major I am applying for. He also alluded to the fact that I may be on the deans interest list (cant confirm tho) and he really wants me to go there so we can work together. Do you guys think I still have a chance at being accepted? Ik my overall profile is stronger than the person who got in (not to sound douchy) but idk if their acceptance would get in my way. The person is also urm and first gen like me so our hooks dont set us apart at all. Will the letter help or will the deans list be the only thing that can help me? Sorry if I seem like irrational but tbh I really dont wanna screw this up and disappoint anyone.",
