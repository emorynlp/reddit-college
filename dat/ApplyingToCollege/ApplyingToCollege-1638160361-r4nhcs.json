No ECs would certainly harm an application, but it really depends on the student and the AO.",

Whether there are any schools you'd consider \"high tier\" whose stats are far enough away from perfect that it would admit an applicant with perfect grades/score/rigor but no ECs...that's an open question.\n\nIn-state applicants to UCLA or Michigan, possibly.  Or maybe even out-of-state.  May depend on major.  Full-pay probably also helps.",

      "text": "The answer to that would most likely be no. Assuming you're an international student, acceptance rates for you are already lower than the normal rates reported on the website. That said, many international students apply with near-perfect grades and scores. The school you apply to can probably only admit 3-4 internationals and if all of them are academically qualified (aka grades and scores), then extracurriculars and essays are the way admission officers determine who is more likely to be successful at the school. \n\ntldr: probably no. but nothing is set in stone in US college admissions.",
