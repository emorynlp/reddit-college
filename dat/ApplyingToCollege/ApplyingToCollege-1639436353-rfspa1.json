If I break the binding contract and attend this other school, how drastic would be the consequences? I\u2019ve heard that doing this will damage the relationship between my school and the ED school, but I\u2019ve also heard that I could get sued. If I were to get sued, how much would it be for or would it vary depending on the college?",

Your preferred school may rescind their offer of admission.\n2. Inform your school counselor, who may send followup letters to all the schools you applied to rescinding his/her counselor recommendation and informing those schools that you reneged on your ED agreement.\n3. Keep your name on to file to auto-reject if you ever apply there for graduate school.",

The dilemma would be whether to use my ED2 option on NYU. NYU is the only school that provides the ED2 option, but I don\u2019t like the binding factor because I would rather go to USC over NYU any day. So in the case where I get into NYU and USC, I\u2019m wondering if I should break the contract. In the other case, the ED2 would play into my favor if I didn\u2019t have the ability to get into regular round but the binding agreement gave me a boost into acceptance, so now I would have the option to attend a college even if I didn\u2019t get into USC. Worst case scenario, I now apply to both regular round and don\u2019t get in anywhere. I\u2019m struggling with deciding on which scenario to go through.",

But there are consequences.... like, it would show a severe lack of character. So I'm pretty sure if the school you subsequently choose finds out they would probably rescind your application, at least.\n\nBest chance would be to probably contact the ED school and explain your position and see if they'll work with you to \"release\" you from the agreement.\n\nEdit: Im also sure, that as long as you didnt get accepted to the ED school yet, you can pull your application or change the decision type at any time before the actual acceptance date.",
