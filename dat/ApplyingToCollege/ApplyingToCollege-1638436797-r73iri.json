  "text": "Im going to go for pre-med route for college, but knowing that there are so many competitive people in top20 schools make me kind of if I really want to go to a top20. I think it is probably rly hard to stand out in college especially at a top20 school. But at the same time being surrounded by motivated peers will also help me. Some thoughts?",

      "text": "Here\u2019s my copy pasta for premed applicants:\n\nMed schools don\u2019t really care about how highly rejective/selective  your undergraduate college is. For applying to med school, you want to graduate with as little debt as possible, have some research and/or hospital based experiences, make high grades, get strong letters of recommendation, and get a  high MCAT score. \n\nBe sure to check into the school\u2019s med school acceptance rates. Ask whether they support all med applications or not. Some will just support their top students making their rates higher, so you need to be able to do comparisons about rates. \n\nAsk about opportunities to do research with professors and not just wash bottles. And think about and ask about ease of access for shadowing doctors. \n\nLook for colleges where students can build good relationships with their professors so that you can get strong letters of recommendation. Often, liberal arts colleges will work best for what you\u2019re looking for if you can make them work financially for you. \n\nNotes about major from UT Houston McGovern Medical School:\n\n\u201cThe study of medicine is based upon science, so the medical student must be a capable student of science. Therefore, majors in the scientific disciplines such as, but not limited to, chemistry, biology, and physics are satisfactory.\n\nA liberal arts education is an excellent basis for a medical career. Accordingly, applicants may have majored in such areas as classics, languages, history, English literature, belles letters, music, or philosophy, provided the specific scientific requirements listed below are fulfilled. All applicants are expected to be well educated and able to demonstrate the intellectual interests associated with entry into a learned profession.\u201d",

      "text": "You'll find \"motivated peers that will help you\" in most colleges, even those outside of the T20.\nSince you're going pre-med, I'm assuming you're going to med school after undergrad, which I believe puts a lot of emphasis on grades at the end of college. Maybe it might be a good idea to go to an \"easier\" college if you're unsure about whether you can keep up with the academics/competition",
