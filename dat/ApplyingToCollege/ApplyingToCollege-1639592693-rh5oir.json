  "title:": "I've been accepted to 2 HBCU colleges with a 2.25 GPA",
  "text": "Throwing this out there for anyone who us struggling to find a college. I've been accepted to Alabama State University,  and Alabama A&M University.  I'm waiting to apply to more after a significantly improved transcript next semester, but if you're looking for a spot, and don't have a problem with a majority black school, a HBCU may be for you. \n\n\nBenefits: Costs are significantly lower than other colleges, many colleges accept starting at 2.0 GPA's, and most students and faculty are closer knit and more supportive towards you than PWI counterparts.  \n\nI haven't committed to a college yet, but this is huge for me. If you're looking for a college to go to, and are running out of options, try a HBCU if that fits for you.",
