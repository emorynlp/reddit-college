  "text": "My counselor just talked about them in class today and about how these schools often offer merit based scholarship. My family's not poor or anything but I know neither of my parent will get pension so my college tuition is basically coming from their current incame and savings. I also realized that most schools that I'm looking at are public. It would be nice if yall could recommend a few private liberal arts schools because I want to study education, which most schools offer as an graduate program, so I got to finish undergrad first.",

      "text": "For LACs that offer a merit scholarships, the maximum amount is somewhere between $30k - $40k. And most colleges will not stack need and merit aid. \n\nAt the most generous colleges, this still leaves the student with a yearly cost of at least $28k, assuming you earned the maximum scholarship.\n\nAnd it's hard to recommend any schools without knowing your stats. But I recommend looking at the USNWR LAC rankings starting around #50.",

      "text": "SLACs (Small Liberal Arts Colleges) are probably somewhat \\*less\\* likely to offer merit scholarships relative to public schools, generally speaking.  However, they're comparatively more likely to offer financial aid, and there are still many that are generous with non-need-based (\"merit\") aid.   Just not the top 15 or so, which offer zero.  Hard to recommend because there's like a million of them, and they're often schools without a national \"brand name\" (i.e. I would not have heard of them).\n\nSome people swear by the ones listed in the \"Colleges that Change Lives\" book (they have a website now), but there are tons and tons of others you could consider.  You might try using a site like [edmit.me](https://edmit.me) to estimate costs.  I've looked at it briefly but haven't actually tried their cost estimation feature, so I can't vouch for whether it actually works.  IIRC it takes into account a student's finances \\*and\\* grades/scores.",

      "text": "The distinction you are looking for is not large universities vs LACs - that's mere size. For merit scholarships, look at less-selective schools that offer merit to attract students who may be at the top of the class at that school.\n\nFirst rule out whether you are eligible for any need-based financial aid. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. (Private colleges often offer need-based aid to out of state students.)\n\nIf need-based aid does not make the college affordable for your family, then look for merit scholarships. Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves.\n\nLook for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college.\n\nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. (These tend to be large publics.) Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: [https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/](https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/); see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family.",

      "text": "Look into some of the Pennsylvania LACs. Run the net price calculator with your parents using real numbers and get an idea of what exactly they can afford out of pocket each year for 4 years. A few I\u2019ve been looking at for my freshman who\u2019s also interested in education is: Elizabethtown College, Susquehanna, and Juniata. Wheaton College in MA NPC was pretty generous for my circumstances so we\u2019ll check them out in a couple years along with Endicott and Springfield. Look up at any school you\u2019re interested in whether their education program is a teacher certification program or is it just an education studies major where you have to use an alternative route to actually work as a teacher.",
