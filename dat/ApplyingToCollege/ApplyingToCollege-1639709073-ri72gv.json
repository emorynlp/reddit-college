  "text": "Would anyone be able to read my essay? Right now, it is in shambles because I keep going back and forth between topics. I don\u2019t even know if the one i\u2019m writing makes sense at this point, and I just need some outside perspective. It is currently not finished, so there is no set conclusion yet, but would anyone be able to give feedback? Thanks",
