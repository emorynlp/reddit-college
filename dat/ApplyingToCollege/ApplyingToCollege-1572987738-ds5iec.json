  "text": "[https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-sale-sat-takers-names-colleges-buy-student-data-and-boost-exclusivity-11572976621?mod=hp\\_lead\\_pos5](https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-sale-sat-takers-names-colleges-buy-student-data-and-boost-exclusivity-11572976621?mod=hp_lead_pos5)\n\n(ETA: no paywall) [https://www.insider.com/college-board-sat-student-data-colleges-to-reject-students-admissions-2019-11](https://www.insider.com/college-board-sat-student-data-colleges-to-reject-students-admissions-2019-11)\n\nJori Johnson took the practice SAT test as a high-school student  outside Chicago. Brochures later arrived from Vanderbilt, Stanford,  Northwestern and the University of Chicago.\n\nThe universities\u2019  solicitations piqued her interest, and she eventually applied. A few  months later, she was rejected by those and three other schools that had  sought her application, she said. The high-school valedictorian\u2019s test  scores, while strong by most standards, were well below those of most  students admitted to the several schools that had contacted her.\n\n\u201cA lot of the rejections came on the same day,\u201d said Ms.  Johnson, a 21-year-old senior film major at New York University, one of  three schools that accepted her out of 10 applications. \u201cI just stared  at my computer and cried.\u201d\n\nThe recruitment pitches didn\u2019t help Ms. Johnson, but they did benefit the universities that sent them. [Colleges rise in national rankings and reputation](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/rankings/united-states/2020#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats) when  they show data suggesting they are more selective. They can do that by  rejecting more applicants, whether or not those candidates ever stood a  chance. Some applicants, in effect, become unknowing pawns.\n\n......",

      "text": "This is the main reason I ignore all the mail and emails I receive from colleges. They mean nothing to me. I went to my schools college night where colleges all around the nation came to my district. (small town but amazing scores. My friend even complained of having an 1460) I talked to the officials (some where alumni) of those schools and they explained their school, who they are, and if my career/degree was given at the school and how successful people was with that degree. My top school that I ended up picking never contacted me or anything.\n\n-Do not believe that they\u2019re really interested in you, most times they\u2019ve not.\n\nEdit: (more advice)\nIf you have a few colleges in mind then go tour them, ask a billion questions, and try to visualize yourself at the college. Also If your school had college night or anything where colleges come down then try to go to those. \n\nYou will be surprised. The college that you assumed was not going to work for you will end up being the one you love. That\u2019s how it was for me.\n\nAnother piece of advice:\n-Be careful of desperate colleges. \n\nLike I mentioned above, pay no mind to emails and mail. Try to look for it yourself. However there will always be one college repeatedly emailing and sending you mail to get your interest. One college sent nearly 20 emails begging me to come. Offering fee wavier, no essay, \u201ctop priority\u201d and 2 week decision. Be careful of colleges who do this. This will mostly happen around the beginning of your senior year or when your state opens up applications. Same thing goes for when they send emails on fasfa.\n\nI may do my own post on her own my experiences with things like this. If anyone is interested let me know",

Being a part of the search service my e-mail is now filled to the brim with school admission spam, some of which are selective, but I know with my stats and the actual admission rates that I would stand no chance of getting in. I do think that students should be aware of a school\u2019s student profile in comparison to theirs, but I do think to a certain degree it should be critiqued for giving that false hope in the first place. We can also recognize that all it does it put in a return for these selective colleges as well, as they get more hopeful applications which means $$$ in application fees. The overall selling of student information that gives nothing in return but spam mail... deserves to be heavily criticized by students, admissions officers and parents.",

That sounds obvious but my parents see Northwestern at #9 and UMich at #23 or something and they think Northwestern is the better school for me. Even though UMich Engineering is arguably better than NU McCormick. Part of the ranking is also attributed to the \"selectivity\" and people see low acceptance rate = more selective = better school.",

          "text": "Feeding this dynamic is the College Board, the New York nonprofit that owns the [SAT, a test designed to level the college-admissions playing field](https://www.wsj.com/articles/college-board-drops-plans-for-sat-student-adversity-scores-11566928181?mod=article_inline).\n\nThe  board is using the SAT as the foundation for another business: selling  test-takers\u2019 names and personal information to universities.\n\nThat has helped schools inflate their applicant pools and rejection rates. Those rejection rates have amplified the [perception of exclusivity that colleges are eager to reinforce](https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-elite-college-worth-it-maybe-not-11553084146?mod=article_inline),  pushing students to invest more time and money in preparing for and  retaking exams College Board sells. Colleges say the data helps them  reach a diverse pool of students they might have otherwise missed.\n\n.....\n\nThe admissions scandal hasn\u2019t put a dent in the [SAT\u2019s popularity, which has surpassed its main competitor, the ACT](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sat-tops-college-admissions-rival-act-for-first-time-in-seven-years-1540475100?mod=article_inline). The more students who take the SAT, the more data College Board has to sell schools.\n\nAbout  a quarter of U.S. colleges have stopped requiring the SAT or ACT for  admission, saying they favor the wealthy and don\u2019t predict how students  perform in school. A Los Angeles-based civil-rights group is pressuring  the University of California system to drop the test requirement.\n\nMr.  Goldberg said the company provides test-taker data to \u201cgive students  the opportunity to start the important conversations with colleges and  scholarship organizations and explore their options,\u201d adding that \u201cthe  benefits\u2026outweigh the concerns.\u201d ***College Board says it licenses, rather  than sells, student names because schools may use the data for only a  prescribed period and agree to abide by certain other rules***. (to me, this is the funniest part of the article)\n\n.....\n\nTo find more students to solicit, admissions officers can turn to  College Board, which sells lists of high-school students\u2019 **names,  ethnicities, parents\u2019 education and approximate PSAT or SAT scores**, at  47 cents a name.\n\n.....\n\nEach year, *1,900 schools and scholarship programs buy combinations  from among 2 million to 2.5 million names*, College Board said, declining  to say how many names in total it sells. Schools target combinations of  geography, socio-economic class and academic interests. A college could  buy a list of, say, soccer-playing Caucasian girls from Colorado,  Wyoming and Montana who scored 1,200 to 1,300 on the PSAT, are  interested in engineering and whose parents didn\u2019t attend college.\n\nSome  schools buy a half-million names a year, admissions officers say.  Tulane University said it bought about 300,000 names last year from  College Board. Tulane\u2019s applicant pool climbed 174% between 2002 and  2017 and its acceptance rate declined 62%, federal data show.\n\n......",
