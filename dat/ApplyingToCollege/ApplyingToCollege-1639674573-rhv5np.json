  "title:": "Not getting into your ED school could all be for the best - perspective from a college grad!",
  "text": "This first story is about my boyfriend, who applied ED to CMU back when we were seniors in high school. IMO he should\u2019ve been a shoe-in. 4.0 GPA, took the ACT once and got a 35, varsity sports for 4 years, passionate about what he chose to study.\n\nHe did not get in. Didn\u2019t get in to Cornell either. Smartest person I have ever met in my life, I mean truly he\u2019s going to change the world one day.\n\nAnyways, he ended up at Northeastern which is still a great school for obvious reasons. He\u2019s about to graduate with a 4+1 (masters and bachelors degree), a 4.0 GPA, continued playing sports through college and loved it, has his dream job secured and starting soon, figured out exactly what he wants to do with his life, and wouldn\u2019t change a thing. We\u2019ve been able to plan the next few years of our lives because of this!\n\nOne of my best friends from my university didn\u2019t get into her ED1 or ED2 schools either. Also had a near 4.0 in high school, insanely smart, everyone knew it. Well, she completely excelled at our college. Graduated as valedictorian of our extremely competitive business school, has a great job, and wouldn\u2019t change a thing either.\n\nIt\u2019s just an anecdote or two but it goes to show that the schools people once thought were the best for them didn\u2019t work out and THATS OKAY! You\u2019ll be happy. You\u2019ll create new opportunities. Your life isn\u2019t over, it\u2019s just beginning!\n\n:)",
