  "text": "Hello everyone!\n\nRecent graduate here and reflecting on my past 4 years of highs and lows of university/college/placement work experiences. \n\nI think I\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes and avoided a lot of \u201coften made mistakes\u201d as an international student and I would really like to write a few blogs or posts for future students who are in the same position just starting university like myself 4 years back. However, I am hesitant as to which platform to do so, as this type of reflection/journals/blogs doesn\u2019t seem to fit in with the already existing platform people are using (Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook etc). \n\nI wonder if you guys would find it useful if there\u2019s a specific space on the internet where university/college students can casually share information with each other on their studies, institutions or general info on being a student wherever they are. Can be like a LinkedIn but instead of finding a job, you\u2019re sharing and getting information and help on universities/colleges etc. Where people can act like \u201cmentors\u201d for each other while having a space to jot down their learnings, experiences and fun stuff during their higher education?\n\nWhat do you guys think about this concept and how would you see yourself using it?",
