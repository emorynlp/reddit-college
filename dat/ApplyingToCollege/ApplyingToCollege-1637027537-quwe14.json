  "text": "I\u2019m a 1st gen applicant in the U.S and my parents don\u2019t speak English. This whole process is new to me so naturally I\u2019m lost as shit. Please explain the steps like I\u2019m 5 if you can \n\nHere\u2019s my current situation:\nI\u2019m working on the Common App and some of the colleges on my list need a manual input of \u201ccourse & grades.\u201d I\u2019ve taken one college class but it wasn\u2019t dual enrollment. I\u2019ve also taken some AP exams. Do I score report them now or after I\u2019m admitted somewhere? And do I need to send my official transcripts from my HS or community college? If I do, when do I send them? Or is that my counselors job?\n\nHonestly if you could just run me down all the things I need to submit and when I need to, you would be a life saver\n\nThx infinitely",

AFTER you apply, you'll receive a login to your \"application portal\" for the school. most schools allow you to submit extra files on the portal; if you're able to do that, then upload your cc transcript there! if not, THEN email it to their admissions email. but, either way, wait until AFTER you apply and receive the application portal login.\n\nalso as far as test scores, there's a whole section on the common app titled \"testing\" to report ap scores, sat/act scores, etc! just self-report them now (basically you don't have to pay to send the scores you're just typing them in; after you get in, you'll be asked to submit official scores to make sure that you weren't like lying lol) \n\n if you need any more help please don't hesitate to reach out <3",
