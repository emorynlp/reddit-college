  "text": "I applied to a few unis in my state to transfer into and got accepted to all but one which I'm still to hear a response from. The problem is that two of them have not had a chance to process my fafsa so I don't know my financial aid situation with them and they are also the only two that would be a jump to on-campus living which currently I'm a commuter. One of these unis in particular has their enrollment deadline later this week and as I haven't heard from one uni which if I get accepted to I will be attending and including the fact that I don't know my financial situation if I take up the offer on my acceptance makes me hesitant to pay for the enrollment fees. Can I still enroll in another school if I enroll in this uni at the end of this week?",
