  "text": "I'm applying for a math major at MIT/Columbia and CS to SCS CMU. The thing is... my superscore comes up to 1520 with an 800 in maths, but CMU SCS and MIT's SAT percentiles are so high I feel like I'm never qualifying with a 720ERW. My GPA is definitely qualified, so should I lean towards not sending my sat score?",

Some T20 schools use the sat as a way to waive english test requirements, and I've seen qualifying scores around 650-670, so the standards for SAT ERW seem to not be too high",

Look at the percentages admitted with SAT and ACT scores, from their admissions data, then do the math on how many may have been admitted without scores.
