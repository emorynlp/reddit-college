  "text": "Hello everyone, \nSome days ago I saw a place in the common app where they said students can attach a profile URL if they have an art page or something like that. Today I cant find that option. Googled it but it also couldn't give me any answer. I would be grateful if someone can tell me where that option is or if common app has deleted the option or not...thanks!",
