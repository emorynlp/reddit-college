  "text": " Will my chances be good if I indicated that I wanted to send supplementary materials on the Common App, but only did so via the Harvard applicant portal and NOT Slideroom? I thought that by \"supplementary material\" they meant things like transcripts for summer programs and college courses as well as published papers, not music/art/theatre or any kind of audio/video submission as indicated on the harvard slideroom site. I haven't submitted anything to Slideroom for this reason--only on the portal.",
