Posting a comment I posted yesterday to someone to give you some info. \n\nAmong UCs and CSUs, Cal Poly has the 3rd highest business starting salary, behind Berkeley and UCLA BizEcon.\n\n> I\u2019m a Cal Poly SLO business student and I\u2019m heading into a $41/hr internship. I can expect around $100k when I graduate. The big4 recruiting presence is absolutely gigantic here and you can get some amazing opportunities from the business school.\n\n>That said, USC does have better exit ops. The name is known better in finance, IB, consulting, etc. Cal Poly has a better name in tech. If money is a factor, Cal Poly 100% because you\u2019ll literally pay like a quarter or what you will at USC. I\u2019d only pick USC if you\u2019re targeting IB or MBB. Cal Poly SLO is almost as good at everything else at a quarter of the price.\n\n>Ask me anything about Cal Poly and our business program.",
