  "text": "Hello! I am filling out the GPA section on the Common App. I got my GPA from my guidance counsellor along with a cumulative average of all 4 years. My average is 95.75% but my unweighted GPA is 3.83. The thing is that when I go onto different websites (like Collegevine and stuff) they say that an average of 95.75 should be a 4.0 GPA which is definitely more impressive. Should I report my percentage or the 3.83?",
