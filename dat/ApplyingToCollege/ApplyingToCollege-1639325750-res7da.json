  "text": "Hi! I'm an international student who recently got accepted into a college in the US. This may seem like a dumb question but what is the enrollment process after receiving your acceptance letter? \n\nI checked the website for admitted students and all it has are instructions to set up the school email. Are there any additional documents to submit and forms to fill up and sign (aside from visa-related matters of course)?\n\nDo they ask for hard copies of documents like transcripts, financial documents, etc which you submit upon arriving on campus?\n\nIt's quite old school in our country because you usually need to submit digital and physical copies of numerous documents so I'm quite curious as to what it's typically ike in the US. \n\nThank you!",
