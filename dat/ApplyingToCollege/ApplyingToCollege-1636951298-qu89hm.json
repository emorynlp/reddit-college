          "text": "For the CommonApp, do you know offhand whether people should be optimizing for how the essays look in the pdf for review or in the CommonApp\u2019s text boxes?  For example, leaving a blank line between paragraphs in the text boxes results in a huge gap between paragraphs in the pdf. However, a single carriage return to separate paragraphs (with no blank lines between paragraphs) in the text entry box makes the pdf look right but the text in the text box looks wrong. \n\nI know that this isn\u2019t a make or break decision, but which do you think is preferred, given how the admissions officers will be reading the applications?",

              "text": "I would just go with what looks good in the PDF preview, which is a single enter - leaving a blank line turns into three blank lines, which looks really weird... A couple of AO's have confirmed that they see the essays very similar to the PDF preview, but don't hold it against you if the spacing is too much - they care more about the content than the formatting.",
