  "text": "So i got into Dartmouth through the questbridge match but for some reason it just doesnt feel good or right. I only ranked 5 schools and loved Dartmouth before the decisions came out but now that im committed to it I just cant get myself to want to go or be excited for it. I didnt even do the peer recommendation or submit an sat/act so i feel bad on getting accepted, so i guess it might have something to do with imposter syndrome. I guess deep down I thought the process was gonna be more suspenseful or stressful and cutting it short at the match may have ruined the inflated image I had of it. Still, I'm not sure how I feel, any solace on how Dartmouth was the right choice would be appreciated.",
