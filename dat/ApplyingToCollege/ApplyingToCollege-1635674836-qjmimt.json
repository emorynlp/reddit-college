  "text": "Tomorrow is November 1st in my local timezone. I plan to submit my UChicago ED application tonight, at midnight on October 31st. But the Common App states that the payment might take 24-48 hours to process for some applicants. Would this interfere with the deadline or does it only matter when I actually submit",
