  "text": "So, I was on track to take calculus my senior year (current junior), but a combination of a moron admissions counselor and online school mayhem screwed my math schedule up so that I'm now a math class below where I should be, though still at standard grade level.\n\nIssue is, everything and everyone seems to be implying that in order to major in STEM, I need to take calculus in high school. I want to study environmental science, and now I'm worried that I won't be considered for the major at any good colleges. My dad says that most of his STEM major friends took calculus freshman year of college, but this was in 2000, when college applications weren't quite as cutthroat.\n\nWhat's your verdict, good people of Reddit? Am I fine, or will my schedule screw-up bar me from my dream career?",
