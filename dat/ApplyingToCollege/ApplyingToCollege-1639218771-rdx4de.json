For Black students, it\u2019s helpful to know that some liberal arts colleges are <80% white and for LGBTQ+ students it\u2019s helpful to know if there are honor codes that make lgbtq students unwelcome at some religious schools. Now white people who made these threads come off as \u201dwhat about me I\u2019m oppressed too!?!!\u201d so I partially agree",
