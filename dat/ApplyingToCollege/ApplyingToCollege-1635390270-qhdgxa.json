  "text": "Currently a hs senior. I've taken 4 years of art class in hs including the two year course of IB Art. I plan on taking that test in May/April. I don't want to study art (my focus is pre-med/bio), but it is a hobby of mine, so I'm wondering if I should submit an arts supplement to give me an edge. I have no awards for art either.\n\nI have decent art ig. People are usually impressed say I am a good artist. I have a few projects I can pull into a supplement and some sketches I think I can make look legit. Idk any thoughts?",
