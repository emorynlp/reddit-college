Sorry I should\u2019ve said something like funniest situations instead of craziest blunders. Regardless I still think there are a lot of issues with financial aid. \n\nLike if we go to my friend\u2019s situation with the approach of sell rugs, even if he sells an $80000 rug it\u2019s likely that he bought it for $72000 and had to wait 2 years to make a sale on it when someone rich was looking for the kinds of rugs he sells.\n\nRugs aren\u2019t an easy asset to liquidate and when you add the fact that his dad\u2019s work experience, money, and livelihood have been put into a business that doesn\u2019t bring in much money, it seems ridiculous to deny all aid because of rugs. Granted the school shouldn\u2019t be liable to help someone because their parent/s chose a career with poor economic stability but also they should look at it holistically instead of deny aid purely off income and assets especially when in the grand scheme of things his dad looks rich on paper but is essentially living paycheck to paycheck. \n\nAlso I never said he should get full aid but I think he\u2019s sorta given up on college since he\u2019s been out of college (with no degree) for I think 4 years now. All he needed was maybe $5000 of aid per academic year but his dad had too many rugs.\n\nMeanwhile I\u2019ve been in a much better situation than him overall and because some personal stuff happened I\u2019m an independent so I haven\u2019t paid a single cent towards my education due to full aid. I think there\u2019s something wrong with that. I\u2019ve been in a more economically stable situation than him but based on a single personal situation I\u2019ve experienced and how I look on paper compared to him and his parents financial aid has determined I shouldn\u2019t have to pay for school and he should.\n\nHopefully I didn\u2019t come across as to harsh in this post if I did it wasn\u2019t intentional. I just wanted to explain why selling rugs doesn\u2019t work and the financial aid system can be a bit silly at times lol",

I don't think a family that has a million dollar's worth of assets should be receiving significant financial aid, that seems ridiculous to me. I understand their assets weren't very easy to liquidate, but I have to imagine if you sold a rug or two at enough of a discount you could sell them within a year - even if you took some loss, you still have hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of assets and your child can get an education. That being the case, and assuming he didn't buy the rugs with debt but outright owns them (otherwise they wouldn't be considered at their value for financial aid anyway), it seems the same as any other family with a fortune that just doesn't want to spend it on college - not exactly where I'd want donor's money to go if I were a school. \n\nI want to have an open mind here, and certainly I personally couldn't have gone to college without financial aid, but I don't really see this situation as financial aid's fault. It seems to me that this family had plenty of assets and just chose not to use them for their child's education, which is not a scenario that FAFSA is designed to deal with (for somewhat good reasons).",

                                                  "text": "To be fair I don\u2019t know how exactly his dad acquired all his rugs. I know he doesn\u2019t produce them. Also I don\u2019t know the exact value of all his rugs but I\u2019ve been to their and there\u2019s easily a few thousand rugs of varying quality. I\u2019ve seen several rugs that were valued into 5 figures so I know his dad would probably be at least in the second highest bracket if not the highest.\n\nI guess the point I\u2019m trying to make is his dad (this is an assumption on my part because his dad sorta keeps his actual thoughts to himself) feels like he\u2019s in too deep with his rug business since he\u2019s spent most of his adult life building it, is not actually rich because the rugs don\u2019t sell frequently enough. The rugs are a specific type of rug so they aren\u2019t just your general all purpose rug meaning his consumer base is limited to customers looking for the specific kind of rugs he sells.\n\nAnother parallel that I feel might be normal is would you consider someone who owns a restaurant rich? Obviously they own a restaurant and there\u2019s likely a lot of value in the property in of itself plus there\u2019s the added value of owning a business. However most restauranteurs are not rich and in fact scraping by. In this restaurant example I\u2019m thinking of someone who owns and manages a single restaurant. So thats the way I think about it. Also for both a restaurant and a rug store you can make a lot of money but the profit isn\u2019t necessarily high. If you sell an expensive rug most of that money is going to go to either necessary expenses like taxes, food, recouping losses, and buying more rugs because if you sell a rug you\u2019re eventually going to have to replace it to stay in business. \n\nAnd they aren\u2019t a family that comes from a fortune. All their value almost exclusively exists in rugs. They don\u2019t own a house, they usually are just barely making all their necessary payments. They do own a few cars so they for sure aren\u2019t as bad off as others but their situation really isn\u2019t that great. Again I don\u2019t know the specifics but for convenience sake and if you decide to respond, I think they get their rugs from the following sources. Outright buying them, receiving them/buying them from his home country, getting them as payment for favors from people looking to get rid of their rugs, and from family friends in his home country.\n\nSo in summary it\u2019s not that his parents didn\u2019t invest in their kids education (though they certainly could\u2019ve been smarter with their money) it\u2019s that in order to make more money they have to put their profits back in the business so they can have rugs. So maybe we do disagree, I wasn\u2019t arguing that he should get full aid, he was just trying to get some aid so he didn\u2019t have a lot of student debt. Maybe this is more an issue with rising education costs and mediocre to average schools being able to charge more than they should but either way nice talking with you",

I think the rug example is quite a bit different from the restaurant scenario, and I'm pretty sure they're considered differently by FAFSA as well. In the case of rug guy, the way I summarize it is this family had assets they owned, which collectively had enough value to comfortably pay for his education, perhaps selling 1/3-1/4 of those assets. If they couldn't be sold for the value that was reported to FAFSA, the value that was reported should have been the true market value they could be sold at at a moment's notice. Obviously that might be a big discount, but you can certainly argue that's their true value and therefore it's fine to report at that price - obviously not something every family knows, particularly immigrants, so I understand that's part of the process that can be unfair. That being said, even if they have to cut into the growth of their business in order to fund college, my overall understanding of the situation is still that they had more than enough assets where it would have been feasible to sell some and pay. To put it another way, if this weren't included in the FAFSA calculations, every family would just buy assets like art, cars, collectables etc. before their child applied to college and get big aid packages even when they could pay - this is basically exactly what FAFSA aims to prevent. \n\nIn the case of the restaurant I agree it's much more complicated - a single monolithic asset that you can't sell and barely generates income is a hard situation, and I believe situations like that are considered differently although I'm not sure to what extent. If it is the case that a student in that situation can't get financial aid, when their family owns a restaurant but doesn't generate much from its operations, then I think that's bad and should probably be changed, but it's quite different from the initial situation we were talking about at least in my opinion.",

But by far my cell techniques course I'm in right now with the lab manager is my #1. She's terrific and we're basically doing an intro to STEM cell research (windowing chicken eggs, dissecting embryos for growth of organ tissue, and transforming CHO cells). My cousin tells me all the time that she didn't do half the things I have in her four years at the University of New Haven.",
