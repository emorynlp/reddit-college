      "text": "The hardest part about college is figuring out why you're going to college and answering those essays.   \n\n\nThose essays are a major right of passage that is asking you to think very deeply about yourself.   \n\n\nIt sounds like you're taking the questions very seriously as one should since it's a major decision.   \n\n\nBUT... it's not a big deal at the same time. People build up college like it's a make or break situation. Go to college anytime in the future or don't go at all.   \n\n\nThere are people without degrees living a good life with all manner of success.   \n\n\nThere are Ph.Ds and people with all sorts of fancy titles and even Presidents of countries that are horrible, miserable people doing the worst things humanly possible.  \n\n\nYou're probably a good person trying to do a good job and that's what matters. Be kind to yourself and don't try to live for external expectations.",

      "text": "This is a TOUGH time!  Though my son is pretty tough mentally, but I saw him diminish a month ago for a 3 week period as he was working on submitting the bulk of his applications. As a parent, it was scary to see him lose weight, not sleep, etc. Now- he\u2019s back to himself and you will be too- in time. Make sure to give yourself a break, focus on ending this semester strong and enjoy the winter break. Go out with friends, read a book, hug a pet, eat a good meal. You\u2019re not the only one, kid!  You\u2019ve got this!",
