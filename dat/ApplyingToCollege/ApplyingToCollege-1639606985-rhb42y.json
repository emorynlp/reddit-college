  "title:": "are there any schools that only look at biological parent financial information?",
  "text": "I\u2019m in that weird divorced parents financial situation where both my custodial and non custodial biological parents are low-income aka would make me qualify for max aid (EFC of 0 for both)\n\nbut my non-custodial parent remarried and that step-parent has a very high income so schools that look at his income would ask them to pay the full sticker price :( however, he has refused to contribute \n\nim already applying to schools that only use FAFSA (since they\u2019d only look at custodial parents income) and some of the only \u201c\u201d\u201dtop\u201d\u201d schools that don\u2019t look at non-custodial parents income (Georgia tech, vanderbilt, Uchicago). \n\ni was wondering if there are any schools that use css profile (including non-custodial profile) but don\u2019t look at step-parents Aka only look at biological parents? or any schools that specifically don\u2019t look at the step-parent if they remarried the non-custodial parent? \n\nim not sure if this makes any sense but i figured I\u2019d ask just in case",
