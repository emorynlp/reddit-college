  "text": "Howdy fellow high-achievers, \n\nGot rejected from Cornell ED1. Rip. But we\u2019re moving on.\n\n(Background: White, Male, 3.95 uw, 34 ACT, solid ECs. Prospective entrepreneurship/Econ/business major)\n\nI\u2019m now deciding between Colby College, WashU, Wake Forest, and Vanderbilt ED2.  I was wondering if y\u2019all could give me some of your thoughts on these schools. I\u2019d be happy to chat more, I just can\u2019t fully decide yet and I\u2019m stuck rn. Even if it\u2019s just something small about student life, I would greatly appreciate it!",

      "text": "Just for some stats perspective-WashU and Vandy are brutal for ED2 because of the Ivy rejects/deferrals. Statistically, you have the strongest shot at Wake Forest and their business program is legit. \n\nBut you should honestly ED at the place you are most interested in/would want to go to. What is it that you are most interested in with each school?",

          "text": "At Colby I love their athletic facilities, student-faculty ratio, their makers pace, and their entrepreneurship center. It\u2019s close to home, but not too close. Downsides would be that it\u2019s cold and dark for a solid third of the year. But my school has strong connections with this school and I\u2019d have a strong chance here.\n\nWake Forest has solid athletic facilities, a maker space, and unlike Colby it has a proper business program. It would also be warmer at Wake, and I would have the chance to socialize more. Farther from home, but that also has its strengths. However not much in the realm of entrepreneurship from what I know.\n\nBoth are affordable for my family, have strong study-abroad, and have at least some program supporting my interests. But I can\u2019t decide between warmer/business/Greek life and colder/outdoorsy/entrepreneurial. It\u2019s by no means the worst problem to have, but any input about job placement or student life would be appreciated. (I probably won\u2019t do WashU or Vanderbilt they\u2019re too unpredictable)",

              "text": "Totally different places and such awesome spots so you really can\u2019t go wrong.\n\nSo let\u2019s zoom out for a second. It makes sense why Colby has an entrepreneurship program because they don\u2019t have a traditional business program. If you wanted to do business-y things and went to Colby, you\u2019d probably start your own thing (fun fact-founders of Netflix went to Bowdoin and Hamilton and DIDN\u2019T get CS degrees). Kids at a place like Colby are going to be comfortable with uncertainly because their business path isn\u2019t so linear, hence the entrepreneurship center. So you have to think about the time and emotional labor involved with that path and whether you are excited/cool with that. Remember-you can always go and get an MBA if you want a more traditional foundation! \n\nA place like Wake is more structured so they have a great track record of sending kids into existing business spaces. But they also have a Center for Entrepreneurship that you could take advantage of. \n\nI guess it comes down to the vibe and how traditional you want your education to be as it relates to business. Personally, I think liberal arts grads are some of the best entrepreneurs out there because they are so much more creative.",
