It by no means good, but according to kaptest.com and Prepscholar, it claims I\u2019m at least in the 75th percentile\n\n\nI have room to improve of course, but what do you guys think about this score?",

Definitely not bad, but like you said, there's room for improvement. I suggest you ask a more specific question if you want any meaningful answers, though.",

      "text": "My PSAT was lower than yours at a 980. none of the students knew what the exam was and we were all unprepared. then when I took the SAT for the first time I got a 1090, then got a 1190 on my second try. I never really studied or prepared for the exam. I knew my university didn't have a high score requirement so I never bothered that much. so I would just check the SAT requirements for the university you want to attend and judge your score from there. then if it's too low just look at your weakest area and improve that but still study for the other subjects.",
