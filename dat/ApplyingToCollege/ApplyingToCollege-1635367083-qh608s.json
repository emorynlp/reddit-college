  "text": "Aside from the obvious fear that I\u2019m getting from college apps, I\u2019m scared for school and it\u2019s literally leading me to question my existence. Maybe not to that extent\u2026 but in a sense, I\u2019m questioning everything. \n\nThis year, grade-wise, I haven\u2019t been performing as well as I usually do & it\u2019s scaring me. I\u2019ve basically gone these past 4 years attaching my worth &amp; merit to my grades and now that this is happening, I\u2019m scrambling & questioning my own capabilities &amp; even my value as a person. Plz don\u2019t give me any hate ik that I shouldn\u2019t be thinking this way &amp; it\u2019s something im trying to grow out of but it\u2019s hard. I just wanted to see if there was anyone else out there feeling this way? Maybe it\u2019s just me but I\u2019m just scared of the outcome of this semester bc I\u2019ve been taking hella L\u2019s &amp; I literally feel like im drowning. It doesn\u2019t help that I feel like everyone around is doing better than me and performing well. Idk anymore to be honest\u2026 I just hope I can make it through and pick myself back up.",
