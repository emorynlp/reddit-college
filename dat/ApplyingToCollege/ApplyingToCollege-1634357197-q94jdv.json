  "text": "I love researching languages, like the various aspects of different languages. The sounds, words and grammar of different languages just really interest me, and I do spend a good amount of time researching, watching videos and lightly practicing on the topics. The thing is though, I'm not the best at it. I can listen or read and get the general gist in German, Spanish, Korean, Chinese and Japanese, but since I don't know the vocabulary too well I don't know exacts. And I don't have any certificates on anything or good enough skills. So, is it worth putting down as an activity on the Common App for the time I've spent (~6hours a week) or is it not solid enough?",

That\u2019s what first came out of your heart, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s true by how you describe it. You don\u2019t have to (apart from college apps) to measure in a quantifying way, how much you do or don\u2019t like something. It\u2019s important to you and it looks like you enjoy it. I\u2019d list it. It\u2019s something else that you\u2019re passionate about and shows self respect, discipline, curiosity and more values. Don\u2019t overthink it too much, go for it! Good luck xx",
