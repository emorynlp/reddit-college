      "text": "I disagree with your friend. I think classical dance sounds like a good idea. Have you made close friends through dance? Do you give advice to younger participants? Do you compete? And if so, do you push each other harder to excel? Do you bolster the spirits of those that have failed? Have you failed and served as a role model to others with your good attitude and perseverance? Have you comforted a friend who was laid up with an injury? Have you had to raise money through fundraisers for your dance company? Just a few ideas that may or may not apply.",

              "text": "Teamwork and what you learned is good. Also, you could talk about how this community was suddenly taken from you during the pandemic and how that afforded you a unique appreciation for what it had meant to be a part of it. The community question is really just giving colleges the comfort that you're a joiner who will be actively involved in something and will contribute value.",
