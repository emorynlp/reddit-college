  "text": "I\u2019m considering sending all my applications on or before Nov 1st for most of my schools (excluding those that have ED2 deadlines). \n\nIs there any disadvantage to sending your app in by the ED deadline for schools that you\u2019re not EDing to? Im assuming that they just sit in a digital pile until the RD deadline before being evaluated. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be changing my applications anymore between Nov 1st and the Jan deadlines. I\u2019ve gotten all my teacher recommendations, official transcripts (where needed) submitted. There\u2019s a a part of me that just wants to be done with this in one shot but curious if there\u2019s any disadvantages to sending them early? \n\nThanks!",

Haven\u2019t felt strong about any of my ED schools but as I said, this could change between now and Nov 1st (unlikely though).",
