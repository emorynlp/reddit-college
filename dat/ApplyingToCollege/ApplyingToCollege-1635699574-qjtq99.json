  "text": "All but the top 3 UCs have a Transfer Admission Guaranteed program that promises you admission if you meet certain qualifications. Basically you must have 60 semester credits (AP exam credits count!) including 30 UC transferable credits from California community colleges, and you must take all the GE and prerequisites required for your major with a minimum GPA of about a 3.4 (as low as 2.9 for some majors at Riverside/Merced). For more detailed info:\n\nhttps://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/transfer-requirements/uc-transfer-programs/transfer-admission-guarantee-tag.html\n\nIf you have a bunch of AP or dual enrollment CC credits, with careful planning, it\u2019s totally possible to do a 1-year transfer. But you need to take at least 1 summer CCC class, have your courses planned out and apply for TAG your first month of school.  Process described in detail here is basically the same if you want to take 2-3 years to transfer. https://ca01001129.schoolwires.net/cms/lib/CA01001129/Centricity/Domain/441/UC_oneyeartransfer.pdf\n\nSo if you don\u2019t get into a school you love, you can choose the UC as a fallback option and know you are GUARANTEED admission to one of these outstanding universities if you plan classes carefully and work hard at a California community college. It does mean a delay in starting your \u201ctraditional college experience\u201d but you\u2019ll also save 2 years of tuition so you\u2019ll miss out on some of the \u201ccollege loan repayment experience\u201d too. And if you really want to move away and live in apartment with friends, schools like Santa Barbara City College are located near neighborhoods with a lot of student apartments. \n\nOf course there are limitations, and you should check carefully before committing to this. Every campus has specific rules; Davis wants to see you were taking CC classes the spring before you apply for TAG, for example. And because of high demand, you can only TAG as a CS major at UCR and UCM. Other popular programs like business at UCI also don\u2019t have enough spots to offer guaranteed admission. But you can apply for other programs alongside your TAG, and transfer admission percentages at all UCs are higher than for freshmen; for example over half of transfer applicants are accepted to UCSD (which has no TAG). https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/transfers-major\n\nYou can boost your chances at getting into UCLA or get guaranteed admission to UCI by participating in honors programs affiliated with those schools, although not necessarily to your first choice major. Honors can also help boost your application to Berkeley and competitive programs at all UCs. In many majors (not CS!) you can TAG UCSB, H2H UCI and apply to UCSD and UCLA with a fair shot at choosing between the 4 if you prepare carefully with the right grades and classes (which will be different for each school)\nhttps://admission.ucla.edu/apply/transfer/ucla-transfer-alliance-program#TAP\n\nhttps://honors.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2019/10/HonorstoHonorsFlyer_2019.pdf\n\nSo does this work for out of state and international students? Yes, it absolutely does. Every year, for example, Diablo Valley College sends a group of foreign transfer students to Berkeley. Santa Monica Community College sends a good number of students to UCLA and UCI. It\u2019s important for OOS students to realize though that if they move to California on their own and immediately enroll that won\u2019t be an easy way to gain residency for cheaper UC tuition later; it\u2019s a lot more complicated if your parents aren\u2019t paying taxes here and the UC rules stricter than CCC\u2019s or CSU\u2019s. But in terms of admissions TAG is offered to all CCC students - and with most CCs offering a slew of online classes and low tuition it\u2019s something you could maybe even start on from Anchorage or Toledo or possibly Amsterdam.\n\nWhile scholarships can make the UC very affordable for low-income families, a CC is also a great plan if you know in advance you want to cut costs and admissions stress. I know some families switch their kids over to CCs during their junior or senior year of high school and with summer CC classes throughout high school and AP credits some can apply at the same time as their friends or just a year later as transfers - and graduate from college faster. \n\nWhen my youngest daughter applied  to colleges in high school she had high grades, 8 AP classes, and lots of leadership experience - but didn\u2019t get into a UC program she really liked. (If you are from California you\u2019ll see this happen to a significant chunk of highly qualified students, so have a \u201creal\u201d safety plan you can afford if the majors at UCM/UCR/UCSC don\u2019t fit you) The top-notch out-of-state public and private schools she was admitted to were all more expensive than the full UC price of around $120k we had steeled ourselves to pay. The CSU she was accepted to required a very competitive major admission process as a Junior that seemed to favor CCC students over their own. \n\nMy daughter felt trapped into accepting one of these options because those were the best opportunities she was offered after applying widely. It\u2019s easy to feel like you are at the mercy of these college admissions officers, and not a savvy shopper looking for a great bargain on education that makes you happy. But this is one of the biggest purchases you\u2019ll ever make, and you can\u2019t return or resell it. Your family shouldn\u2019t take out enough in loans to get a mortgage on a house. \n\nIn her heart, my daughter really preferred UCI to all of the schools that accepted her. We discovered the TAG program applied to a major she wanted there. Going in as a Junior transfer would actually cut the cost in half since she could live at home the first part and CC in California is dirt cheap for most residents, often free the first year. So she turned down all her admissions offers, made a schedule plan that included all her prerequisites and GE, and signed up for a fun summer class. In September she joined the campus honors program and filled out her TAG for UCI; she already had over 30 credits from her APs and previous CC classes. In November she reapplied to just her favorite UCs. There wasn\u2019t too much different in her application from the year earlier. \n\nShe found college easier than her competitive high school; keeping a 4.0 was mostly a matter of discipline. It was a bit lonely\u2026 until Covid sent all her friends back  home. We were all really happy not to be paying huge sums of money for a college experience that mostly took place in her bedroom.\n\nA year after getting rejected from the top UCs, she received a string of acceptances to all of them. But at this point, like most transfer students, she was a bargain shopper looking for the best deal. Many of her friends picked CSUs because they offer more practical majors that aim to prepare you for specific jobs. She opted for Berkeley, the UC closest to home, because there was so much uncertainty around housing with Covid still a big issue. Turns out all classes were online anyway. No housing costs and summer CC classes have cut her total cost for a UC degree to around $25k. She is happy to have saved that money as she is applying now for grad schools and graduating a year faster than most of her high school cohort. She says that while the students at Berkeley are generally smarter academically, some of her CC classes were better taught, and she finds her fellow transfer students have better interpersonal skills that will likely help them in their careers.  \n\nWhen I first started looking at college planning with my oldest, CC wasn\u2019t something I even considered.  When I heard a family say that was their backup plan I didn\u2019t understand. But over the years I saw several bright students do a 1-year transfer to Berkeley or UCLA, so I knew it was possible. Now having done it my daughter is already thinking that CC is where most people should start higher education rather than letting hefty loans hijack your 20s and beyond. So if your heart was set on a UC and you don\u2019t get in the first time or you really want to cut costs, this is a very solid safety plan.\nTLDR California community colleges have guaranteed UC transfer admission programs than can save you money and serve as a safety plan for most majors",

          "text": "I personally agree - UCs are not worth the price you pay as an out-of-state student. They don\u2019t offer aid to non-Californians and it\u2019s rare for a non resident to get a merit scholarship.  Getting residency is hard unless your parents live and pay taxes in California. If you move here alone the semester you start at a CC you will be considered to have moved here for college so that\u2019s not time building residency. It is expensive to live in many areas, so it would be very hard to work and pay your own way to demonstrate independence especially as an unskilled 18-year-old. We looked into ways to establish residency in other states after my daughter got into some good OOS flagships and they often make it difficult to do that. For most people I think staying close to home or attending a school that gives you scholarships/aid is the best plan. \n\nHowever, if you are one of those people willing to pay out of state or international tuition for a UC, you can reduce your tuition costs significantly by taking a big portion of your classes at California community colleges, either before or during summers/gap semesters after attending at least one quarter. Annual tuition for OOS and international students varies but is around $10k - a lot cheaper than OOS at the UC. Living costs in California are quite high so a plan like SBCC and transfer next door to UCSB is still pretty expensive as college plans go - but the vast majority of CCC classes are online for now so you could take them from wherever you live. \n\nI\u2019ve seen the CC start plan work pretty well for international students with good English and study skills and families that can afford full costs of study in the US. This approach is also good for someone coming out of US military service (I think they\u2019ll consider you a resident) and can work if you have parents happy to move to California with you. \n\nAnd if you are one of the many A2C subscribers who goes to a competitive Bay Area or SoCal high school the CC transfer plan has so many benefits over paying OOS/private school tuition because you didn\u2019t get into a UC you liked the first time.",

                  "text": "I went back and looked at the transfer application - I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s possible to check the freshman one from 3 years ago. Transfer app just shows each class and grade as you reported, not gpa. It\u2019s basically a print out of everything you input. \n\n I know the UCs DO see if you are ELC but I don\u2019t know if you can see that or if that, along with gpa, are calculated and added as notes automatically to the file later. I believe Berkeley and UCLA look at unweighted and uncapped weighted GPA as well as UC GPA. There are several calculators you can use to figure out your UC GPA accurately especially if you are in-state so you can see if you get honors points. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to submit until the end of November  so you could wait and post your question next week if it really matters to you. One thing we realized is that the huge number of applicants means the schools just pick a reasonable group of students that would do well - and overlook some great people, especially in big competitive high schools that have 200+ qualified students. It can feel pretty random. But Davis, for example, is pretty clear - if you still want to come just do a year or two of CC and you can reapply and get in. It\u2019s more of a deferral than a rejection because they can\u2019t accept everyone above a certain level the way they used to.",
