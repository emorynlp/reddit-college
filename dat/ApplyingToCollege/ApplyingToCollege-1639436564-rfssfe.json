  "title:": "Should I submit the maximum number of general reccomendations?",
  "text": "So I know how many academic letters of recommendation I should submit, but what I'm wondering is, should I ask for more general letters of reccomendation so I can max out the slots on applications that allow multiple?\n\nI already have one from my coach, but I could also get one from my magnet teacher (who also knows me from mock trial club), and even a 3rd from the other coach who knows me just as well as the one I'm already getting a letter from\n\nis less more? or is more more?\n\nSome schools allow even more than 3 general letters of rec, so I was just wondering if I should go for submitting all of them I can, or use the less is more approach. (they would all be pretty great LORs)\n\nI'm applying test optional if it matters",
