  "text": "Hey does anybody know how long it usually takes for colleges to respond back to you? I tried asking something 10 days ago but no response. Maybe they\u2019re busy because the ED deadline is approaching, but it\u2019s weird cuz last time I emailed them they responded in 30 minutes. Anybody experiencing something similar or have any ideas? \n\nThis email is the only way I can submit my ED application (QuestBridge app has different process) so I\u2019m worried. ._.",
