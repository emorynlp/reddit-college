  "title:": "Took the SAT without a calculator, blew my second (and final) attempt.",
  "text": "On my way to my SAT testing center, I realized that I forgot to bring a calculator. I brushed it off, thinking \"it's fine, they'll provide me with one. They had extra calculators last time\u2014I remember.\" Oh, poor poor me.\n\nWhen I'm sitting at my desk, waiting for the test to start, I ask my proctor if I could receive a calculator. They hesitate, then tell me that they don't provide calculators. Upon hearing this, everyone else in the room turns to look at me, probably taking pity on me for how screwed I am.\n\nI ask the proctor once again, \"Are you sure you can't give me a calculator? Like, I know the math classrooms have calculators in them.\"\n\nThe proctor, slightly annoyed, left the room to ask another staff member. When they returned, they once again confirmed that they don't supply students with calculators.\n\nI laughed nervously. \"So... Am I just supposed to take the SAT without a calculator?\" I knew I was taking a risk by asking this, as I wondered if they were going to kick me out. This would be my second and final attempt, so I really wanted this chance.\n\nThe proctor responded, \"No, you can still take the SAT, since all questions *can* be answered without a calculator.\"\n\nAh, so everything is fine, then... right? \\*Sigh...\\*\n\nReading and writing sections went decently well. Non-calculator section went well, too. Then comes the calculator portion. I definitely received a few glances as the proctor instructed us to take out our calculators... Hey, at least I'm challenging myself, right?????????\n\nFirst few problems, easy. Already I was hearing people clicking away on their calculators, while I had to do scratch work. But the proctor was right, all the questions were possible.\n\nAs I near the end, I stumbled across some difficult problems. I could have solved them with ease, if I had a calculator! Instead, I had to triple check my extensive scratch work, which covered the entire page. Definitely lost valuable time there.\n\nThen came one of the final problems. It was easy, just needed to find the zeroes of a quadratic equation in standard form. Unfortunately, it was not easily factorable. Okay... I'll try the quadratic formula. Uh... Square root of 3?!? Not gonna work. Guess and check? It's not multiple choice! Plug random values of x into the equation in hopes that it equals zero??!??!!? -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. Close, but slightly off. Fractions, then. -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2, 5/2. Nope. Quarters? Still nope. Fifths?!?! Still nope!\n\nAs time was called, I tossed my pencil down in exasperation. \"All questions can be answered without a calculator.\" Oh, very funny. But hey, it was just 1 problem. 10 points off my Math score. It was okay. But when I found out there was a fifth section, I was already mentally exhausted. And, it just so happened to be another Math: Calculator section! Needless to say, I did quite poorly on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get my results tomorrow",
