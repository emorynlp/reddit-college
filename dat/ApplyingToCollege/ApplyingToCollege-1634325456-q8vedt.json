  "title:": "SPEAKING AT MY SCHOOL BOARD! and i have no counterargument for my case",
  "text": "I labeled this as rant, but i do kind of have some questions for some people as well... I also dont know if this is the right place to put this, but I thought that most you guys would have some sort of opinion on the matter! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo my dismay, my school refuses to adopt a weighted GPA system (in addition to our regular unweighted system ofc). This means no one in my super small school is ever incentivized to take college-level classes, as our principal complains that no one ever wants to take hard classes! It also means students who don't take harder classes are annually rewarded with high class ranks and valedictorian scholarships, as they have 4.0s.....compared to someone taking every AP and College class possible barely making the top 1%.\n\nSo.... I'm supposed to speak soon on why we should have weighted GPA to our school. Last year a lot of people tried to push this but they wouldn't budge. Even though its my senior year and nothing will change for me, I don't want our 3 AP classes to diminish because no one wants to take them. Right now, our classes are Bio with a SINGLE STUDENT, APUSH with 5, and Calc with 5. \n\nApparently, I need to come up with some counterarguments or reasons not to have a weighted GPA to anticipate for, but I really cant think of any and i cant find anything online. For those against having both weighted and non-weighted GPA, what are your reasons?",

      "text": "Reasons not to have a weighted GPA? You'll hear plenty. Remember: most of those parents have kids who will look worse from this, so they will fight it.\n\n* You'll hear parents complaining how hard school is already and how they don't need to encourage their kids to take on more work and then have to stay up later. They might even go off about the value of more sleep and how teens are sleep-deprived. So you'll need to be able to speak to how much more of an advantage that gives their kids when applying to universities and how this might not reduce sleep if students spend less time doing non-academic activities.\n* Some might (no joke) ask \"are those classes really that much harder?\" and you'll want some evidence or quotes on that as well.\n* Some parents will say \"it doesn't matter; the universities you apply to will take course rigor into context.\" While that's true, most students respond to their GPA and class rank, so anything encouraging them to challenge themselves is a good thing. Furthermore, should the school's valedictorian really be the student who challenged themselves and still did well or any student who finds a way to get the most easy A's?",

      "text": "Try googling Palo Alto high school and see if you can find anything about their fight. For years, Paly didn't weigh AP classes, and there were major complaints (and let's not forget many of those parents are some of the brightest minds in the world). I believe the most valid one I heard (because kids are not supposed to be GPA grade-grubbers, and there was a suicide problem already) was that it kept kids from being competitive for college scholarships, as many have cut-offs. Good luck, and strong work for speaking up at the school board meeting!",
