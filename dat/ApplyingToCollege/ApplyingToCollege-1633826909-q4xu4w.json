  "text": "for context, i took last year off due to medical reasons, so i asked the education coordinator who helped me with my online courses for a letter of recommendation.  she emailed it to me (yes, i know this isn't supposed to happen) and it has spelling and grammar errors.  multiple obvious ones.\n\nshould i still use the letter?  i'm grateful that she took the time to write one for me, but the mistakes kind of ruin it and i'm not sure how admission officers would read into them.  i don't have any other teachers who could write me letters, except a few from sophomore year who i could ask if i have to.  i'm not sure what to do.",
