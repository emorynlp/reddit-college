  "text": "Hey guys! I got into the ED school of my dreams, but I don\u2019t want to pull my CSUN application because I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll rescind my offer. Like I don\u2019t know, I just feel like me getting in was probably a mistake and they recognize it soon. All the applications I\u2019ve sent out aren\u2019t really towards any competitive schools, so would it be alright for me to keep them just in case?",
