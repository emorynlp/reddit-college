And then, pursue the hell out of your goals.\n\nif the question is \"do i reeeally want to go to the party instead of doing my work/project/homework/ec\" then I feel, you already have the answer. But then, there's also times when it's worth it to lighten your stressload.\n\nIdk where the \"being stressed is a bad thing!!\" circlejerk came around, probably grinders trying to sabotage other kids, but the opposite- an obsession with grinding being idolized- is true.

The ones who make an excuse will just be your school acquaintances, the ones who want to go do it will do so because they want to further your relationship. It might be awkward to ask them to do something but that\u2019s only because you\u2019ll be worried they will say no; but you get valuable information about the standing between you two from it and they won\u2019t think twice about it if you just play along when they tell you they can\u2019t do it. \n\nAll you have to do is make one good friend, then your bubble expands. \n\nSimilar technique with the crush. The way they talk to you is a good gauge of how they feel about you. I.e. if you ask them what their favorite movie is and then you go \u201coh I haven\u2019t seen it\u201d, then they\u2019ll either say \u201comg we should watch it some time\u201d or \u201comg *you* should totally watch it sometime\u201d. Are they the ones starting the convo or you? These are the things you have to look for. \n\nThe best way to get a social life is just to get one. It\u2019s not going to stop you from doing anything else, it\u2019s just gonna make you plan your time better. Just do it.",
