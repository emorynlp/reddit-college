  "text": "So I am an international student looking to apply as a freshman to various unis in the States.\n\nI just came across the fact that I have relatives living very close to the UDub campus and they offered to well, take care of me during my four years there. \n\nThe problem is that I was told this today and upon researching I found out that I already missed the 16th November deadline for the application.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs there any way at all I can still apply to UDub?",
