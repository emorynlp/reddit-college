  "title:": "Cornell Financial aid To do list \"No current item\"",
  "text": "Does anyone who applies or applied to Cornell University know why the student portal 'to do list' says \"No item current to do item information found\" ?\n\nI did submit my CSS yesterday and will submit Fafsa today, but the student portal, which should tell me which information I should submit, says there are no current item I should submit.\n\nSome say I must wait few days for the financial aid to do list to be activated, but I am not sure if this is true since the Cornell website doesn't specifically mention this part.\n\nPlease help if anybody knows anything about this issue. Thanks.",
