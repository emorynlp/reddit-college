  "text": "Hi!\n\nWhen applying to my ED school I accidently checked the box that I want to apply for the honors program too. They sent me a whole separate application for the honors program, and I have to write an essay which I have zero time to do. Plus I'm just not interested in the program.\n\nMy question is, should I contact the school asking that I not be considered for the honors program, or just not fill out the form. I would think I should contact them, but wanted to see if this matters.",
