I know a lot of folks who started out this way and ended up leading parts of campaigns because they were consistent and dedicated.\n\n**Non-profit based:**\n- Lobbying. Some organizations will have positions specifically for high school students, especially if they\u2019re an organization that serves young people. Others won\u2019t explicitly say it, but if you reach out, they\u2019re happy to have you. \n- Shadowing/interning at a non-profit that works in a field you\u2019re interested in. Lots of smaller nonprofits will let you get very hands-on since they always need more people to help out.\n- Social justice work/community advocacy work. There are probably groups pushing for change in your community that you may be aware of. Always good to advocate for things you believe in.\n\n**Wait\u2026 this is political science?**\n- Writing for your school paper\n- Interning with your local paper or submitting op-eds/letters to the editor to your local paper\n- Writing for a small blog or youth publication about policy or freelancing \n- Community service is always rooted in the idea of meeting needs not fulfilled by the government, so it\u2019s inherently tied to politics\n- Essay competitions/speech competitions\n- Research with a local university or CC professor in the field of political science",
