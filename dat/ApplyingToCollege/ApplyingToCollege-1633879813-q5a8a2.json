  "text": "like can i put reading or baking as extracurricular? i did spend a lot of time doing those things. It\u2019s just i didn\u2019t really go out and do stuff (no competitive sports, competitions), other than a bit of volunteer stuff in sophomore year( stopped because covid). I also joined Science NHS which we got the application for second semester of 10th grade so once the club actually started, covid happened really soon. Then i did online school all of 11th grade so zero extracurricular or club participation(most of my school went back in person and a few ppl stayed online, my parents wanted me to do online), so i am behind on ECs compared to the rest of my school. Also we got an application for NHS end of junior year so i applied and got in but it didn\u2019t start until senior year. So idk what to put for the hours/weeks per year of participation. I put like 1 hour per week and 5 weeks per year but i feel like that sounds bad. I just estimated and even 5 is a bit exaggerated",

Not so sure about reading, but baking is great.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, US unis are messed up, so they like to see some level of deeper engagement- eg blogs, cookbooks, food donations.",
