  "text": "I am an applicant to ie university, and it seems great. I\u2019ve learned Spanish, have always wanted to move to Spain, and they have the program I want. \n\nCan anyone give me any information they know? I\u2019ve done my own research and I for some reason just can\u2019t shake  the feeling that there is something I don\u2019t know, or that it won\u2019t be what I expect. Maybe that is just the angst of going international, but it can\u2019t hurt to ask.\n\nThank you!",
