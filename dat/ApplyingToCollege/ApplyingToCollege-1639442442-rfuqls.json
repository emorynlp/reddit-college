  "title:": "My guidance counselor never sent in my transcripts",
  "text": "I talked to my guidance counselor TWO WEEKS AGO requesting transcripts and he said he would send them in *that day* and now I have Canisius AND Daemen admissions officers emailing me to tell me they STILL don't have my transcripts OR my letter of reccomendation.\n\nI applied early decision and the deadline has passed, will they even consider my applications at this point? Naviance SAYS my transcripts were sent out and I don't know why. Also, schools are emailing me personally to ask for my transcript, letters, and SAT scores, but my school's policy is that students have ZERO access to their transcripts and letters of reccomendation and the guidance counselors can't stop us from seeing our own scores of course, but the counselors send in the official reports for us. Do I have any right to demand a copy, and if yes, will colleges accept transcripts and letters directly from a student?\n\nAlso, there are some schools that have not contacted me, so I don't know whether or not they have my transcripts.",

      "text": "You should log in to your account in each college\u2019s portal to confirm what documents the college has received for your application.\n\nIf Naviance indicates that the transcript and recommendations were submitted, then they were submitted. \n\nIt can sometimes take up to two weeks between when the documents are submitted by your school to when the documents are confirmed as \u201creceived\u201d by a college. The emails you\u2019re receiving are automated because the college\u2019s application system hasn\u2019t recorded your documents as received yet. It sounds to me like the delay has to do with the processing of the documents by the colleges. It sounds like your counselor did exactly as they promised.",
