  "title:": "Please DON\u2019T Apply to WashU",
  "text": "WashU may be ranked 14th on US News and may be a T20, but I\u2019m a sophomore who goes there and I\u2019m sorry to say you should really weigh your decision before considering applying here or making the decision to come here. One thing I will say right off the bat is if you cannot afford to come here, please please please don\u2019t bog yourself down with heavy loans to come here. \n\n- Social Life/Things to do in STL\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a car and don\u2019t want to pay Uber fees to go literally anywhere - you WILL be left out! It\u2019s fine for the first 1.5ish warm months of fall sem because you can walk without feeling cold. But, even then there are not that many places to walk to nearby. There is the Delmar Loop, but even that gets quite stale after going a few times and everything that\u2019s not a club/bar/drinking house seems to close quite early.\n\nAlso, if you don\u2019t drink or go to clubs, you\u2019re pretty SOL in terms of what you can do around town and with kids. Party culture is pretty big, non-party fun shit - not so big. The campus is in the city of STL but because STL is a very spread out city, it is NOT a convenient city to traverse. Taking public transport is definitely not as easy as people make it sound. Without being super dedicated to using public transport or having some other way to get around - you will feel pretty confined to the campus bubble.\n\n- Campus/General Vibe\n\nThere is an air of affluence and wealth around the school. People will often talk about spending \u201csmall money\u201d on things like Ubers or food or something else, but in reality, these purchases add up and can be expensive for you. In addition, if you\u2019re taking thousands (I mean like 100k+) of dollars in loans to come to WashU - IT isn\u2019t worth it because nothing you get on campus is really worth the money.\n\nThe facilities on campus are terrible when compared to the kind of money you are paying and the kind of money the school has (*65% Returns on Endowment*) the gym is so small and busy most of the time that you can\u2019t even get a bench/weights without waiting. In addition, the food prices are terrible and there is NO dining hall buffet on campus. The dining options that you do have get very repetitive and old very quick and they are simply bland and lacking in good flavor. There is variety, but even so the flavors are dull. You will also be left hungry more often than not requiring you to purchase double the food. I\u2019ve spent around $20 in meal points (which is a lot) on single meals before because one entree often doesn\u2019t cut it. In addition, the libraries on campus all close at 8 PM which is abysmal for any research institution and actually makes me feel more like I\u2019m literally attending a high school more than a university - I go to class, I have lunch in between classes, and then I come back to my dorm in the evening because things are pretty much closed anyway.\n\n- People\n\nOftentimes it seems like people have drank this Kool-Aid about the school. They talk about how they knew this was the place they wanted to be and how they really enjoy the place and have no complaints or can overlook the other things. It\u2019s to the point where even if you criticize things worth criticizing like the food or the fact that the administration makes questionable decisions regarding political views and the handling of certain events - people will simply look at you funny and wonder why you came to the school in the first place. I would say there is groupthink pressure as a whole and I have only found a handful of individuals who are willing to consider that other schools do exist and that WashU truly isn\u2019t worth the money and is overhyped. I definitely feel pressure to behave and think a certain way if I want to fit in with groups which is really not something anyone should have to experience. People are very fake and insincere in my experience.\n\nThere are also a lot of rich people here as I mentioned earlier. IT definitely can make you wonder about your socioeconomic status and question whether or not you belong at the school both socially and financially.\n\n- Internships/Career Opportunities\n\nMany of the people who have sophomore internships at the kind of big firms that you may want to come to a T20 for are actually people who qualify for diversity programs or have connections through family. The WashU reputation has not really been anything extremely helpful in any fashion. People from my (non-private, public) high school at my (non cali, non michigan, non Virginia, non UNC, non Texas) state school have been getting better offers and more consistent internship opportunities at the same companies I have been applying to  whereas I have not even received a single interview. Our profiles are largely consistent with each other\u2019s but people with lower GPAs and less EC involvement/work experience have still had a better time getting fortune 500 internships at my state school.\n\n- Conclusion\n\nOverall, WashU just isn\u2019t worth it and I feel like a pretty big lemon for being drawn in by the prestige and thinking I would enjoy my time here. Me and my roommate who also feels the same way as I find ourselves in situations where our state school comes up either through a friend or something we see here on WashU\u2019s campus and are reminded of how the experience there would have been better almost every single day. Please weigh your choices carefully and know what you\u2019re getting into. I am happy to answer any more questions in comments or dms.\n\nEdit: For those that think I am bad at networking or hang with the wrong crowd or don\u2019t do anything on campus, that\u2019s not the case. I\u2019m involved in a professional fraternity on campus and have four other clubs that are both business and non business activities. I STILL feel like it\u2019s difficult to make lasting connections with people that go beyond club related programming or casual conversation. My big in the prof. frat hasn\u2019t even made the effort to check-in with me despite me reaching out multiple times and stating we should do something when they\u2019re free. People are superficial in my experience, I\u2019m sorry to tell y\u2019all the truth about my experience but it is what it is.",

I\u2019m in my final year at Cornell, and I regret enrolling here. It was nothing like I expected. I hear the same thing from my friends at other T20 institutions, too. The entitlement is rampant on campus, and I have found it difficult to meet people because they are much more concerned with themselves than they are with you. My sister just started at UCLA and has been describing the same things. I\u2019m trying to be positive for her well-being, but I now know how toxic these environments are.

Proximity to my hometown, friends, connections, and family is definitely something I wish I had put more thought into before choosing UCLA. even though people were telling me that choosing UCLA for pre-health is the obvious choice (mostly bc of GPA and prox to hospital/labs), i felt really connected with another university that i was committed to.\n\nmy sibling also almost solely chose their school based on prestige and regrets it as well. i think we all always look at the other side, and think the grass is always greener, so please take my rant with a grain of salt. i overall do not regret choosing UCLA over other schools - i think if i went to the other university, i\u2019d have the same thoughts of wondering what going to UCLA would have been like. \n\nin each university, there\u2019s usually a range of personalities and diversity where you can find people with whom you feel comfortable, but a lot of universities have a certain environment that i think can really influence your experience there. \n\ni hope you and your sister is doing okay (and let her know that she\u2019s definitely not alone at UCLA!) <3",

                  "text": "In general, your university GPA matters if you are planning on pursuing further education after undergrad, especially if you are in the pre-health field. Though it\u2019s not fair to compare the importance of GPA for undergrad admissions vs grad admissions, I think the amount of consideration towards GPA for graduate admissions is much more weighted and emphasized than undergraduate admissions. \n\nI was told by many people who have had experience with graduate school admissions that I should really consider which school (UCLA vs Berkeley) would be better for my major, overall experience, but most importantly, GPA. In other words, \u201cwhich school will it be \u2018less difficult\u2018 to get a higher GPA?\u201d\n\nIt was made pretty apparent to me that it is very difficult, although not impossible, to get a decent GPA at Berkeley. Many students and alumni have shared their experience in that Berkeley\u2019s lower division pre-health classes (even if you\u2019re not a LS major, you still must take these classes as requirements for grad school) are infamous for \u2018weeding\u2019 students out and having grade deflation. I don\u2019t know how true that is (it seems like it is though), but overall, it is *known* that Berkeley isn\u2019t known to hand their students easy As. That is not to say that it is \u2018easier\u2019 to get As at UCLA - the classes are probably just as rigorous/difficult, but it seems like they don\u2019t purposefully try to tank student\u2019s GPA with deflation curves and weeder classes. **For any Berkeley or UCLA students/alumni, let me know if I am incorrect. I\u2019m simply a freshman at UCLA, so my info may be totally misguided.**\n\nMy heart was telling me to stay committed to Berkeley (was committed for MCB in March-June then got off the waitlist to UCLA neuroscience). However, after researching so much about each school, it became pretty clear that UCLA is probably better for pre-health students. Honestly, in terms of grad school admission, they probably don\u2019t view UCLA as that much different than UC Berkeley. Even though, AOs might know that it might be more difficult to get a high GPA at Cal than UCLA, there are so many other things to consider. Like u/ThatCornellBitch said, I wanted to ignore what others were saying about Berkeley, but ultimately, I think they were right and I\u2019m glad I received feedback from a lot and a variety of people and resources.\n\nHonestly, there\u2019s not much of a point in thinking about whether I made the best decision for myself. Just want to let others know to consider things that you might not think are very important when choosing where you are going to spend your next 4 years and how it can impact your experience in college and your future. \n\nSorry for the rant (again) .-. This was something I spent a lot of time thinking about especially as an overthinker.",

If your friends are making it past resume screens and you\u2019re not the simple truth is that you have a weaker resume. If you are making it past resume screens and not getting offers then tou need to work on your interviewing skills. Getting internships/jobs is a grind even for people going to T5/T10 lol no employer is just handing these out to someone because of the name of their school. What I dislike about Vandy is just Nashville itself. If you\u2019re not white / not a country music fan it probably won\u2019t be that fun for you. There\u2019s also no real dance club scene , just bars. But Black Vandy parties are really fun and there\u2019s HBCUs in Nashville that also throw parties that are more my vibe.",

Yes, but it's also just not that much in absolute numbers. [See here](https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/ex/sustainablecitiescollective/top-20-cities-venture-capital-investment/1144451/). Durham is not within the Top 20 cities (worldwide tbf) in terms of VC investment, and cities like Austn, Philly, and Phoenix get more VC investment. You will note that Durham is 4th per capita, but that just highlights that the tech scene going on in Durham, while being lucrative and obviously very attractive, is very small. [If you look](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-03/the-geographic-concentration-of-venture-capital) here, you'll see that Durham is the 20th most invested in city in the US for VC, putting it behind places like SLC, Denver, and practically every other major metro in America.

It's not location, but alumni that drive networking. Duke's alumni network is global and student outcomes match the top 20 \"prestige\", but I'll return to that.\n\n1. I know it's not unique to Durham, you just can't call the NE a \"Megalopolis\" without acknowledging the same linked effect takes place in the Triangle. Plus, your first link has Durham top 4 in venture capital per capita (worldwide). I know you downplay this, saying absolute numbers matter more, but for individuals coming out of college that's less competition for more funding than all but 3 other cities. Why would you not want that? Why would most funding matter if you are competing heavily for every opportunity? Now, is Durham the tech epicentre? No, of course not. But [the Research Triangle](https://www.researchtriangle.org/the-triangle/) area really is a growing tech center that is enticing companies like [Apple](https://www.forbes.com/sites/korihale/2021/05/06/apples-1-billion-north-carolina-building-could-spur-corporate-diversity/?sh=15dd9c804073) to move there, and I just think you are underselling it.\n2. I know Chapel Hill, Durham, and Raleigh all wouldn't make many top twenty lists alone, especially if you ignore per capita, but combined they are an up-and-coming tech center, see above. But sure, alone they don't move the needle.\n3. I 100% agree. I come from florida, and yes if you go to UF or FSU (or UCF, etc.) that can be huge in helping you get a job there. This is where I'll bring back up your original comment at the top, I think some schools, and I'll say Duke because that's the one I know for sure, have such geographically diverse alumni-base paired with such high national recognition that it overrides the local effect. A Duke degree can help you get a job anywhere in the US- not just NC. A UCF degree doesn't hold nearly as much weight outside FL as inside. Another point, you act like everyone knows where they want to live as a high school senior when the reality is people change their minds. College is a transformative period, directing people away from schools that could get them a job anywhere because they're in a poor location, is just bad advice. This is not true for all universities, but between alumni locations and national prestige there are universities that have that ability.\n\nNow back to the original point, location doesn't hamper any top school that has a de-centralized alumni base. I know Duke has widespread alumni so I'm making them my example, but other \"prestigious\" schools may fit the bill too. As you say, networking is king, not location.\n\n[http://cuberis.github.io/duke-alumni-infosite/](http://cuberis.github.io/duke-alumni-infosite/) \n\n[https://alumni.duke.edu/groups?groups\\_filter=regional](https://alumni.duke.edu/groups?groups_filter=regional) \n\n[https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/duke-university/student-life/diversity/chart-geographic-breakdown.html](https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/duke-university/student-life/diversity/chart-geographic-breakdown.html) \n\n[https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/career/about-us/career-center-stats](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/career/about-us/career-center-stats)",

                                      "text": ">  It's not location, but alumni that drive networking. \n\nWhich is highly location based. Your links literally make that clear. North Carolina is small af but is the largest centre of alums in America for Duke. Great if you want to live in NC, otherwise, those are all alums that, if it were Columbia for example, would be in NYC. Now think about going to NYC as a Columbia alum vs. as a Duke alum. Who is more likely to have friends or opportunities in high places? \n\n>  Duke's alumni network is global and student outcomes match the top 20 \"prestige\", but I'll return to that.\n\nI never made this claim? I said that these schools are harmed by their location, not that they aren't T20s. You seem to have come to a conclusion I never made. \n\n>  I know you downplay this, saying absolute numbers matter more, but for individuals coming out of college that's less competition for more funding than all but 3 other cities.\n\nI downplay it because it's peanuts. Going back, it's the Netherlands example all over again. The Netherlands produces a disproportionate number of Nobel Laureates, specifically in physics, but that does not mean it's a better place to go to than traditional physics powerhouses. Per capita ignores that scaling doesn't really work like that. To give another example, Iceland published a ridiculous number of books per capita. I'm gonna take a big guess and say that as a general publisher though, you probably don't think that Iceland is actually a better market to be in than say the US or even Canada. \n\nI'm gonna be real with you, you seem to be taking this personally for some reason and I'm not quite sure why. I literally said that Duke was a fantastic school, just that its location harms it if you want to work in the *traditional economic centres* of the country. In other words, what I am arguing is that ceteris paribus, Duke does worse because of its location in NC for West coast tech recruiting than it would if it were located in California. I don't think this should be controversial. \n\n> But the Research Triangle area really is a growing tech center that is enticing companies like Apple to move there, and I just think you are underselling it.\n\nI'm not underselling it, I just think you don't understand just how much of an economic powerhouse the US is. If the same amount of research and tech output happening in Raleigh were to happen somewhere else like Jakarta, it would indeed very notable and perhaps make Jakarta a regional tech centre but in the context of America, it's miniscule. \n\n> I know Chapel Hill, Durham, and Raleigh all wouldn't make many top twenty lists alone, especially if you ignore per capita, but combined they are an up-and-coming tech center, see above. But sure, alone they don't move the needle.\n\n*Together* they don't move the needles. \n\n> Now back to the original point, location doesn't hamper any top school that has a de-centralized alumni base. \n\nIt certainly does if you want to work in a certain industry. You seem to be considering this as a binary, but it isn't. It's on a gradient. I'm arguing that ceteris paribus, even Harvard would do better in tech if it were located in California instead of Cambridge. This is certainly not unique to Duke. The reason why I brought up the traditional Southern elites like Vandy and Duke is because they have a specific issue that's hard to overcome, which is that they are not too close to any of the traditional economic centres of the country. They have a \"power base\" within their home state and what that means is they do very well within that region, but they don't have as much influence and as many alumni as they would otherwise had they had a different location. This is not a baffling or controversial concept. \n\nMy point is that unless you want to live in NC, if you got into Duke and a comparable school that was located in an area you want to live in, you should probably go with said comparable school. My point wasn't to choose only based on location; my point was that location has a *huge* impact on where you end up working and living so you should strongly consider that (which most college students dont. They often treat college as a 4 year vacation away from somewhere before they plan to move back or move away.)",

Kids at SJSU and SDSU place incredibly well into tech vs. their relative prestige and it has much to do with their location. The power of top schools doesn't come from their insane placements (there just aren't enough students from there), but from their flexibility. The top students at Harvard have a network that is much more nationwide than a student from UNC for example. \n\n> At the end of the day your resume (things you\u2019ve built / past internships) is the most important for getting interviews and you passing interviews is on you \n\nI respectfully disagree. Getting your first round is the hardest part of the interview process, but it's hardly based on just the resume. Networking is king. Especially as an entry level grad, most don't have much experience and very little to differentiate from the competition. Google APM for example gets 8000 applications for <50 spots; the number of people applying who have FAANG internships on their resume for this entry level role already exceed the number of spots there are so if you think you're solely getting in on just a resume basis I think you're being optimistic. \n\nThere's this weird idea going around that tech is super-meritocratic (I get it, I fell for it too), but the reality is that hiring is done by humans and humans are not meritocratic at all. They hire from the same schools they know and are familiar with, from those within their network and who share similarities to them, etc. just like any other industry. Something like 40-50% of Google's SWEs come from the Top 25 CS schools (as defined by US News) for a supposedly meritocratic institution. For comparison, the [Top 10](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forums/comprehensive-list-of-target-schools-for-investment-banking) schools in terms of numbers of students sent to banks produce just 22% of the overall class at investment banks (tbf they don't do a good job of distinguishing roles and stuff and I'm sure the number in IB specific functions is way higher). The point is, Google's hiring is very asymmetrical and decidedly not a meritocracy. \n\n> This can be done with more or less the same difficulty from just about any recognizable school\n\nHaving alums in key positions is always better than just coming from a \"recognisable\" school. If you want to work where tech is popping, a school like SJSU or Cal Poly Pomona is honestly better than many schools considered more prestigious. I wouldn't choose them over national level schools, but I would probably choose SJSU over Case Western if I knew I wanted to go into West Coast tech for example. \n\n****\n\nLocation is king. The reason why so many West Coast schools are known as CS power houses has little to do with the intrinsic technical capabilities of those in the West, and entirely to do with the tech industry around them. Similar reason as to why East Coast schools are finance power houses. There's a reason why schools like UCLA, USC, etc. despite being fantastic schools aren't considered targets and a large part of it is distance from where finance happens.",

That's international though. \n\nFor [QS](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/usa-rankings/2021) however, it's 18 vs. 25 for WashU. \n\nAnd in a lot of the \"traditional prestige\" fields, Michigan is stronger. It's a target vs. semi-target (for finance/consulting), it's a top CS program whereas WashU isn't well-known for CS, etc.. \n\nThere are some benefits to attending WashU and it's certainly not a bad school but at the cost difference, transferring just because you view it as more prestigious is not a good idea.",

I feel like people have drank kool aid about college in general. it's not \"life-changing,\" and people should disabuse themselves of the notion that getting into their dream college will be a \"dream come true.\" \n\nThe rich people problem is especially the case at every top college basically, and even non-top colleges. Food almost always sucks for one reason or another. I don't disagree though, these things might just be worse at WashU than others\u2014heck I transferred (not from WashU), so I know what it means when ppl say a school is bad.\n\nBUT, just remember that the people who come on here to post are most likely those most disaffected. I don't doubt any of this isn't true, but let me also just put a few things out there that I actually happened to like about WashU when I was looking at colleges:\n\n1. it has a really nice campus vibe and look. idk about the gyms though.\n2. the dorms are wild\n3. they have a lot of libraries, though what OP said about them closing makes this a lot less cool\n4. they're definitely closer to downtown than other schools that are sometimes associated with cities, like UChicago, Northwestern, CMU, Pitt. For context, WashU to The Arch in Saint Louis is about the same distance as Columbia is to the One World Trade Center. Arguably though, NYC has way better public transportation.",

Social stuff has been a bit rockier, but that's life for you, and I'm pretty happy about where I'm at right now (and I'm not a partier - I love climbing, game nights, random events through the gym and student life, etc). I think the socioeconomic stuff is fair, but when you get off campus (which you can do after freshman year), St. Louis is actually one of the best bang for buck cities out there. There are people here who hate it, as is the case with any other school, but I love this place and I'm so grateful for the opportunities I've gotten here and the person it's made me.\n\nI think entering during COVID was an L for your experience (library used to be 24/7) and I'm sorry about that.",

And the vast majority of students at any of these schools end up in comparable positions to one another across these schools. The average business student at WashU ends up in the same functions as the average Wharton student and the former isn't even a target. \n\nPeople really love to focus on the margins like they're going to be the 2-3% (read: 12-20 kids) who get into a top PE firm out of undergrad instead of what they're realistically going to be: yet another kid who works at a reputable finance or consulting firm. In general, all the people trying to emphasise the vast differences between one top school and another top school in terms of quality are trying to create distinctions out of on a macroscale, very small differences. It doesn't mean they don't exist, just that for the vast majority of people going to these schools, they don't matter.",

          "text": "> You've to ask why some \"prestigious\" schools need to use ED2 to lock in students.\n\nYour argument seems a bit nonsensical to me. UChicago is undoubtedly prestigious. As are schools like Vanderbilt. Different schools have different tactics in order to draw more students and build the reputation of their schools, and choosing to laser focus on this one point is a bit meaningless. \n\nWe've become so desensitised to low acceptance rates that we've seemed to forgotten that even acceptance rates that would feel high today for a top school (say 30-40%) still means that roughly half or more of students who are *perfectly qualified* to attend a school and would be predicted to succeed at said school, are getting rejected. \n\n All of the Ivies who do ED accept 40%+ through ED and many (like Penn) do over half their class through ED. This ignores that schools like Penn were early adopters to ED because they were specifically afraid of losing talent to the T5 and being seen as second choice schools. UChicago doing 80% from early is certainly abnormally high, but don't they also have EA?\n\nWhich brings up the question: does that mean Penn, an Ivy, was not prestigious back then. Or that we should put prestigious in quotes. Even back then, Penn was a T10. If so, then we're really restricting prestige to refer to like 2-3 schools in which case it's basically meaningless. \n\nAlso, I think people always try to find some way to measure prestige in a simple and easy to reference number and that is always going to fail. Yield doesn't mean much. BYU has one of the highest yields in the country on account of Mormonism for example. Yield results can also be a reflection of financial aid and the packages that UChicago is giving, as much as it is a reflection of prestige. \n\nAlso, yield rate falling for ED is common. I don't think any of the ED Ivies break 50% for RD yield rate IIRC. Do we actually know what UChicago's RD yield rate is? For example, if they accept a very low number from ED but still maintain something between a 40-50% RD yield rate, then that means that they are still competitively vying for students who are admitted at other T10s (if you assume that there are cross admits) since as I stated before, <50% is where the RD yield for schools like Columbia and Penn are. Northwestern an Ivy+, admitted 3654 students in total and 1901 attended. Of those 1105 were admitted under ED. Which means 796 students attended through RD. That gives us an RD yield rate of 31% vs. an overall yield rate of 52%!!! UChicago doesn't publish CDS so I can't check but keep in mind Northwestern is an Ivy+ that is regularly T10 and always T15. \n\nAccording to this, UChicago's yield rate was 73.6% for co24. They accepted 2511 in total and 1848 chose to attend. If 80% of those who attended were ED, then that means 370 students were accepted RD and attended. Since 1478 students were ED/EA, then that means their RD yield rate is (370/ (2511 - 1478) which gives us a yield rate of 35.8% through RD yield. That still places them firmly above what Northwestern got. Also, do you remember where you saw that UChicago's ED acceptance was that high? I think it'd be ridiculous for the ED to be 80%, which makes me think at least part of it would be through EA. In which case UChicago's yield would obviously go higher. If we ran a simple scenario where 70% were through ED and the rest were EA/RD, you'd reach 42% EA/RD yield rate which is much closer to the Ivy Ballpark. \n \n****\n\nAnd going back to my point about tools used to lower acceptance rates and other things, let's think about just how many different tactics are used in order to draw more students and raise the prestige of a school:\n\n- ED: As you've mentioned, ED is an obvious one as is ED2. \n\n- REA: REA is also used similarly. There isn't any inherent need to have an early round and schools like USC do not have REA or ED. USC could almost certainly drop its acceptance rate a few percentage points by implementing an ED but they don't.\n\n- Likely letters: Likely letters are a way to also lower acceptance rates and increase yield rate, and get students. Why use it? Does a school like Princeton really need to give out likely letters? Are they really prestigious if they have to resort to doing so? \n\n- Common App adoption: Use of the common app (and also getting rid of supplements in order to get more applications and such) is a great way to increase your application pool and many schools have done so and seen acceptance rates get halved or more. Schools like Georgetown have resisted though on the premise that you get a lot more students who'll apply but who aren't committed and Georgetown would prefer students who actually want to go there. Are schools like Harvard really prestigious if they need to be on the common app to keep their acceptance rates so low? \n\n- Marketing: All of the marketing you've seen such as flyers, emails, free gifts, etc. are all just ways for colleges to convince you to apply and give them an opportunity to reject you. Is MIT really that good if they're having to send you an email to try and convince you to apply?\n\nI'm obviously being facetious here but my base point is that ED strategy is only one tactic and a lot of schools do things in order to try to improve their status. Harvard is Harvard, but part of the way it stays Harvard and not just another school among the mix is by cultivating its reputation and working hard to stay ahead of the game. Prestige is a finnicky thing in that it is sticky but also very malleable. The rise of schools like Northeastern is a great example of this. People tend to hold the biases they have for schools that they developed when they themselves were in schools. Case in point: a lot of old people in NYC tend to have a very underwhelming view of NYU because they remember the times when NYU almost went bankrupt and when it was treated as a safety school. But the new generation tends to have a very different view for obvious reasons and even in 20 years if NYU becomes worse, they'll probably still have a similar perception of NYU being a very good school even if it objectively isn't.",

You seem to be a faithful reader of U.S. News & World Report and take its content as facts. Many people don't blindly trust information on a magazine and like to do their own research. They find that UChicago doesn't  publish either CDS or admission statistics. Some people like it this way, some don't. People also observe that UChicago itself chose to join  ED2 league (like Northeastern University, Case Western Reserve University, Boston University, Tufts University, NYU, Emory University, Vanderbilt University, WashU, etc.). They form their own opinions about how attractive a school views itself. Most people who need FA think SCEA schools >= ED schools >= ED2 schools. Also someone [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/pap3a2/if_you_need_any_financial_aid_dont_apply_to/) here recently that UChicago front-loaded financial aid packages. Middle-class will be turned off by such information.",

It also does not match the experiences of recent grads I do know. \n\nI see a lot of \u201cvaguely specific\u201d issues here that could very easily apply to a long lost of \u201cprestigious\u201d schools. NU, Duke, Vandy, Cornell, Brown, Rice, Tufts, Emory, and so on. Just off the top of my head. Are these schools expensive?  If you\u2019re not someone who will receive some of their very generous merit assistance, then yea they are. $80,000 per year isn\u2019t cheap. Are they expensive compared to the 65,000/yr people would shell out to (insert non-tippy top Catholic university here)?  No they\u2019re a total bargain compared to those schools. And for many public universities, it really does depend. \n\nBut these criticisms aren\u2019t things I hear from recent grads...and I am connected with many of them. But I\u2019m not qualified to answer/refute anything here because it\u2019s been too long for me. \n\nA couple of things that a couple decades since college has taught me:\n\n1-don\u2019t pick a school based upon how you think others will perceive it or an idealized version of what you think college will be.  You\u2019re picking for the wrong reasons and you\u2019ll be disappointed. \n\n2-there will always be people who complain about the X. I knew a minority of folks at my time at WashU who loved to complain about the school. I keep in touch with a couple as distant Facebook friends. Know what they do now?  They complain about their jobs, the city they live in, the high school their kids got into, restaurants, etc. This isn\u2019t to say there can\u2019t be valid complaints about something that many people find to be \u201cgood\u201d or enjoyable. But when someone goes on a \u201cdon\u2019t go to x\u201d rant about something other \u201cconsumers of x\u201d are happy with, it raises some interesting questions.",

      "text": "WashU sophomore here. I\u2019m just gonna throw my hat into the ring here. I get that OPs experience is theirs, but mine has been drastically different. \n\nRight out of the gate, the price tag is a lot. Scholarships help, but it\u2019s still expensive. \n\n- Social Life\n\nAs far as social life, we started college during covid, and WashU was pretty strict at the beginning of last year. I can see how people struggled to socialize. Personally, I made a lot of really good friends, and now that Covid restrictions have been eased, I\u2019m making more. \n\nAdditionally, I don\u2019t drink, but I haven\u2019t had any issues with others. If I\u2019m not drinking at a party, that\u2019s just more for those who do. \n\nThe criticism of the loop as stale is understandable, but also flavored by covid. There are restaurants, a movie theater, and a concert venue, all of which are more active now. Outside of the loop, there are still a lot of things to do. We have a top-tier Botanical Garden, a nice art museum, a zoo, and forest park, which is absurdly awesome. \n\nI really take issue with OPs comments about commuting. Sure, a car would be nice, but a bike is significantly cheaper, and St. Louis is a very bike-friendly city. Last year, I commuted year-round, and I think there were about 2 weeks that I didn\u2019t bike (heavy snow). In those situations, the public transportation was a completely functional replacement. \n\nI come from Chicagoland, so Metra/CTA has definitely spoiled me, but the STL system isn\u2019t terrible. The buses/trains run frequently enough, and are FREE for students. There are some parts of the city the trains don\u2019t cover, but a bike+train or a bus can get you there easily enough. \n\nI will say that a lot of my peers don\u2019t have experience with public transportation, but the Metro is fairly easy to learn.  \n\n- Campus + Vibe\n\nThe air of wealth is tangible. I do not understand how some people budget, but I suppose the wealthy don\u2019t need to.\n\nThe gym is small, and you still have to reserve pool times (covid), but you can find times when it isn\u2019t too crowded. \n\nDining services is laden with issues, especially since I\u2019m vegetarian and health-conscious (I\u2019m not going to eat pizza and fries every night). The food is mediocre and overpriced, and there is no buffet. That said, this is mostly due to covid/supply shortages/labor shortages, which are not choices made by dining services. I compensate by buying groceries+cooking or ordering out (usually once a week). Food is by far my biggest expense, but my campus-job more than covers it. \n\nThe libraries closing is also something that irritates me. However, it is due to staffing shortages, which is technically beyond the university\u2019s control. \n\n- People\n\nThis is my favorite thing about WashU - the people are generally nice. I have randomly reached out to strangers in my classes with questions or to form study groups, and they have been very receptive. You can walk into a public space and easily chat someone up about general classes. For the most part, professors have been pretty nice people, too. \n\n- Career Opportunities\n\nI\u2019m premed, and covid has staunched many clinical volunteering/shadowing opportunities. However, research here is fantastic. I reached out to a few labs last year, chose one, and have had a wonderful experience. Everyone is supportive and ready to help me understand things, and I get to do work that interests me. \n\nSorry for the essay. \n\ntl;dr:\n\nCons: \n\n- Lack of healthy, vegetarian options (COVID influenced)\n\n- Library hours are short (COVID influenced)\n\n- Expensive\n\n- Sometimes, St. Louis\n\nPros: \n\n- Nice people\n\n- Good opportunities\n\n- interesting and engaging classes\n\n- solid academic support system (for most classes, writing, presentations, and developing healthy study skills)\n\n- St. Louis, sometimes \n\nFeel free to DM if y\u2019all have any questions.",

If you aren't pre-med or business, the career connections won't come to you, rather you have to go to them.

You need a car or to know multiple people with one. Also the library thing is true, but due to the absurd way money is structured for our budget.\n\nOP also has some questionable complaints tbh, and this might be somewhat due to covid. The food is def better than average at a college. The gym is fine, it's just a public gym. And the education is really good (at least for my major in the engineering school). Sure it's missing some classes you would have at a bigger school, but you can easily meet your professors, engage in research and enjoy what you are learning, and it's not impossibly difficult (unless you want to do chem). I would take OPs comments seriously, but also look into them yourself. Everyone's experience differs.",

Keep in mind I am a junior currently at WashU so feel free to take my opinion with a grain of salt.\n\nThe school is NOT in the city and in the suburbs, yes you will need a car or uber to visit places, but a lot of main places like the mall or the city are accessible THROUGH THE METRO which we get for free.\n\nThe endowment is not only for the campus, which WashU is still trying to expand and goes to paying for student scholarships as well as multiple student programs (where do you think all the event and SU funding come from). As far as the gym goes, it's a bit more crowded this year because of COVID as well, my freshmen year the S40 gym was open so everyone was more dispersed. \n\nThe food opinion I agree with you, I dislike the meal point system and wish we had swipes because I blow all my meal points quickly, however I promise you the food was better in previous years + if everyone had swipes it wouldn't be fair to the students who just eat less but pay for the students who eat more, which is why WashU has different meal plans. \n\nSocial scene at WashU is literally fine. Not everyone is a fratbro nor will you miss out if you don't want to party, there are a lot of open people here and you just have to find the ones that you vibe with. There are always student events going on each week, and forrest park and the loop provide decent entertainment, there's also sporting events in the city, so I wouldn't stay there's nothing to do, keeping in mind that we're still students and work increases exponentially each year (at least for MechEs).\n\nOverall college is what you make of it. I wanted to transfer out because of social situations but I have never had anytbing against WashU because the education is amazing and the teachers genuinely care about your learning if you reach out. Also the Weston Career Center does a helluva job prepping you for interviews.\n\nPM if anyone wants more details, I try to be unbiased",

      "text": "Current WashU student - I disagree with most of this. One fair point is the price. It is very expensive for what you get, but besides that, I think the school is awesome.\n\nFor the people, sure, there are insincere people who I don't want to be around, but those people are everywhere, all around the world and at every school. I find the vast majority of my interactions with people from my classes to be enjoyable.\n\nI think it is easy to feel left out of things like ubering to the clubs and whatnot. However, when you actually get down to it and talk to most people on campus - most people, especially freshmen, don't engage in that kind of stuff. It's a smaller but very loud percentage who consistently do. Just like any other school, you can find plenty of people like yourself who do things that you like and that make you happy.\n\nThe food situation is tough right now, but that is largely due to COVID related stuff and labor shortage. While I definitely want better right now, I have been impressed with their responsiveness to student and parent complaints (albeit a little slowly) with implementations such as expanded dining hours and bringing food trucks to campus.\n\nAs for things you didn't mention, I have had a great academic experience. One thing that I have found that differentiates the experience from friends I have at state schools is the support structure and availability of classes. Just like any other school, there will be classes that are hard to get into but I have largely found that I can get a spot in most classes I want,  usually at a time that works for me. Almost all of my professors have been amazing , but all of them have been incredibly supportive and have a genuine interest in helping their students succeed. The same goes for my counselors - my 'assigned' counselors are available and helpful and I have found it easy to arrange meetings with counselors not assigned to me who specialize in different areas. It is pretty easy to get support on whatever I need. Another thing that I think is worth mentioning is the campus - it's absolutely beautiful :).\n\nOverall, as you pay more for school you definitely start to reach a point of diminishing returns, and, admittedly, I think WashU is a little past that point. This would surely be something important to consider for someone considering taking out a good amount of loans. However, I think the school itself is a wonderful environment that allows different students to thrive and enjoy their time.\n\nEdit: A few more things I forgot to mention after scrolling through a few comments:\n\n\\- St. Louis is dangerous, but not near campus. The majority of the dorms aren't even in St. Louis, they're in Clayton - a much more affluent area. \n\n\\- Public transportation exists and is decent (not NYC or Boston). There are metro stops (lightrail) right off of campus that can take you all over St. Louis. You do want to make sure to get off in time though, they will take you into the parts of St. Louis where you probably don't want to be. WashU also runs busses to a popular eating spot, around campus, and to other WashU locations nearby. There are public busses, but I haven't used those much. WashU students get free transportation on all those busses and the metro.\n\n\\- The dorms are mostly very nice. Even a pretty standard living situation puts you in a room with one roommate and then you share a bathroom with another two. The rooms are big enough where I have never felt cramped and have no problem storing all my stuff. We also get AC and heat control. One thing I will mention is there is a small percentage of the dorms that do not enjoy these same features.",
