  "text": "So for my personal statement I wanted to talk about \"tiger parenting\" and how Asian parents put insane amount of pressure on their children to achieve perfection in school. I have a similar story. I don't wanna come off as a bratty kid who doesn't respect her parents' efforts. But I wanna touch on the emotional aspect and how it shaped me as a person ?? Do you think this could be risky ?? Like I may sound like an ungrateful person ?? But I have actually had a sad childhood bc of my parents' ultra strict parenting style. Please help !!",

      "text": "I agree with the other comments; it's good advice.  \n\n\nLess than a very short paragraph on the problem.  You may want to write it all out so your thought process is complete but edit it out upon revision.   \n\n\nWriting is a creation \\[sic\\] process. It takes heart and effort to do it well and often you'll need to put the idea down to fully comprehend how it has affected you.   \n\n\nAs an older Asain dad, I get where you're coming from. Hope you break the cycle and be supportive you your kids if you ever have any.",
