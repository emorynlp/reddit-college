They understand that it\u2019s not everyone\u2019s vibe, just like it\u2019s not everyone\u2019s vibe to play an instrument or something. The category is mainly there for recruited athletes.",

I received a 1- for Personality and 2+ Overall from my Alumni Interviewer. My scores were actually pretty average and I think they ultimately weighted a lot of my file on my essays and interviews (I had a good 2 paragraphs about my essays and then both AOs mentioned wanting to see an alumni interview before making a final decision on my file).",
