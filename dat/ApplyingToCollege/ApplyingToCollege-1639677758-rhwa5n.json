  "text": "Right now, I\u2019m a Sophmore in High School. I finished my Freshman year with legit straight A\u2019s.  My GPA was a 4.2 and I earned 35 credits.\n\nThis year, I\u2019m taking an honors class for the first time but my grades aren\u2019t doing as well. My first marking period, I got a B, A+, A-, A-, A, A+ and for my honors algebra class, I got a C+. My second marking period, I have a B+, A+, A+, A+, A+, A+, and a B- in my Honors class. I also got a 1130 on my PSAT. I\u2019m not taking any extracurriculars, clubs, or sports but I\u2019m thinking about starting a club and my guidance counselor gave me the go-ahead already. I want to get into a good college but I\u2019m not exactly sure where to go from here. Any advice? Thank you in advance.",

Some good institutions are extremely pricey, and out of state can affect this too. Other places offer scholarships for merit or even just for getting in (looking at you olin) also, what are you passionate about",

They\u2019re strong colleges with really good help in the financial aid department, but not too high where you need 90 AP classes with a 4.3 unweighted or crazy stuff like that. They are heavily competitive though so make sure to let your passions shine through in what you do!",
