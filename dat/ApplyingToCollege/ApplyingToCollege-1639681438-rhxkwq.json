  "text": "Hey, I will be transferring to a university from my local college as an undergraduate transfer with an associate. Disappointing as it is I believe I failed one of my classes, I was planning on retaking it but they do not offer it during the winter or spring term and I\u2019ll be graduating this spring. Therefore I was wondering if I should just leave it like that or take some sort of other class that is similar to that specific one? Any help is appreciated.",
