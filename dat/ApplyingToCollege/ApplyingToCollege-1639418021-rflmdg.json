      "text": "Considering it has a minimum amount of $1k/yr, my *guess* is they give out small ones fairly regularly.  Sometimes *any* scholarship is enough to sway someone to attend even if the amount is small (makes them feel special).  Getting the full $11k/yr is probably much more difficult.",
