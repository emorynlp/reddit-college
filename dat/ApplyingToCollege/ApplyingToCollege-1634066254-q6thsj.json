  "title:": "should i get my associates and transfer or get my associates and start all over as a freshman?",
  "text": "im currently a sophomore in high school but next year ill be attending a school located at my local community college that's basically just dedicated to earning your associates in the last 2 yrs of hs. this is the best opportunity currently offered to me, as the area i live in has absolutely no useful extracurricular activities for my desired major atm so im willing to dedicate all my time w those studies for the time being. its also among the best in the country. but also i am not aiming towards staying in this state because i absolutely hate it here to the point i feel ill and ive been looking forward to studying out of state for years\n\nso my plan was that i got my associates and had impeccable grades and a shitton of research and volunteer hours + mock trial (to make up for my lack of eqs) and then to transfer to a good uni for my major but now that im reading about the acceptance rates for oos transfer students i feel really stressed out\n\nso do i just go w my current plan and transfer ? or do i get my associates degree in something related to my future career and then apply for a different major as a freshman to my dream unis  ? is having 2 aas counterproductive? or do i just try to not get my associates at all?",

              "text": "Oh sick! I used to live in MDC, went to the medical magnet school there haha\u2014I moved before I could start at SAS though:( definitely take advantage of those resources, it\u2019s a super awesome opportunity. ECs there are pretty hard to find, but check our Fairchild Garden for biotech opportunities (I know some Biotech students who did NASA internships, got to work with them!)\u2014also the big hospital in Homestead has internships as long as you\u2019re over 16. Not sure if you\u2019re interested in either of these things but just letting you know!\n\nAlso, it\u2019s pretty hard to transfer credits OOS (as far as I know)\u2014my original plan before I moved was to just grind at SAS and then go OOS for college and start from scratch as a freshman. Talk to your counselor about options though since I dunno how all that works or if it is actually hard to transfer credits and all that. Good luck!",
