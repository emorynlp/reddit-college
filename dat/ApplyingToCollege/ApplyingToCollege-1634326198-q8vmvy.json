  "text": "There are certain colleges that have not accepted from my school in like 10 years, even when applicants had perfect SAT/ACT.  To the extent that even college guidance just shrugs and does not seem supportive of applying to those colleges. Which then makes me wonder is it a personal issue that the college has with college guidance or vice versa. \n\nIf a College has not accepted from your high school in years, do you even bother applying?",
