  "title:": "I\u2019ve had a very extraordinary experience. Every single year of high school, plus covid have been me moving from school to even country.",
  "text": "The reason why I am bringing this up is because a typical student starts and ends in the same high school. This obviously has its advantages and I think I\u2019ve been at a disadvantage. I make this very clear in my PIQs and about my extraordinary high school career (if you\u2019d say).\n\nStats:\n4.1 GPA\n6 EXTRACURRICULARS in sports and important roles in many of them\nAnd this is where I ask: I got a national reward + scholarships in Latin America in 8th and I went back the following year in 9th (It was still considered middle school)\nCan I mention this in my EXTRACURRICULARS due to my past?\n\nOh yeah, I\u2019m proud for myPIQS and this is all to finally ask, do I have a shot of getting into one UC?",
