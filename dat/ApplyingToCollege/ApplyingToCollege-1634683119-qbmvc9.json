  "title:": "What is required of me to attend better universities than my GPA allows?",
  "text": "Hey y'all, basically my grades were pretty much A's through freshman year till the pandemic hit, then more shit happened that really ruined my GPA. Now in junior year I'm doing much better and I once again proved to myself this final quarter that I can get As to A-s. I always took APs and this year I'm taking 3. Next year I believe it possible to take 7. I did the math and I can achieve a 3.0 unweigthed GPA if I only get A-s in all classes for when regular aps are due. At the moment my plan is to develope a videogame, continue my masetery of italian and guitar, and continue getting 4s and 5s on my ap tests. If I keep this up and get an extremley good grade on SAT and ACT by how much can I increase the range of universities that would accept me?",
