  "text": "I've seen on the some of their transfer websites that transferring credits should be from courses that are on a similar level to the universities. I've also seen many people on here say that they dismiss their chances of acceptance because they are coming from a CC. Does transferring from a community college automatically disqualify you from acceptance into an Ivy league? More specifically, has anyone ever done it?",

      "text": "Yes, tons of students transfer from CC to Ivies.  Princeton even places an emphasis on CC students (generally with military backgrounds) in their transfer review process.\n\nThat said, most colleges use transfer students to fill in attrition - so when someone drops out, transfers out, defers enrollment, etc, they fill that slot with a transfer student.  Since the Ivies (and most other top colleges) have absurdly high retention rates, they simply don't have large incoming transfer classes each year.  So yes, it's possible, but it's quite challenging - many top colleges have sub-5% transfer acceptance rates, and some as low as 1%.",
