  "text": "For example, the buildings at Yale, Princeton, Fordham, Harvard, Wash U, Rice (?), Oxford, etc, all have a similar antique feel to them. Maybe it's just me and my fascination with history, but when colleges have this appearance, it's a HUGE plus. Especially for the older universities and just knowing that you're on a campus where hundreds of years of history have taken place, it's really cool. Okay, I'm done now \ud83d\ude05\n\n&#x200B;\n\np.s. I'm a prospective computer science major, but I love history.",

      "text": "Not a big fan of neo-gothic architecture tbh.\n\nThen again, both parents are in the architecture field, with one specializing in the historic restoration field. \n\nNeo-Gothicism is basically an attempt to imitate the gothic style with modern materials and methods (which results in a lot of structural difference, and basically only the fa\u00e7ade being reminiscent of gothic architecture). Most of the buildings are a lot younger than they appear, with most being 100-150 years old. As a fun fact, the oldest buildings are many times much less ornate than later buildings, these tend to be of the Georgian style, which focused primarily on function rather than form.\n\nThere are some really exceptionally interesting school architectural styles out there to consider in addition. For instance, Northland College uses a vernacular style of Georgian architecture which at first glance appears to be gothic, but differs significantly in the use of local brownstone. Similarly interesting is the University of Texas at El Paso, which uses a Tibetan Dzong architectural style which is probably *the* most architecturally unique university in the US.",
