  "text": "Guys I only focused on the UC\u2019s (I\u2019m from California)  and idk if I should try to apply to privates considering that their deadlines are close. Plus I feel like I\u2019m not going to get accepted \ud83d\udc80. Not to mention, I don\u2019t really know much about privates except for the ivys which Ik I won\u2019t get in lol. For reference some of my strong extra curriculars are Girls Who Code, American Heart Association STEM Goes Red, and GirlsBuild X Facebook. Also my GPA is a 3.8 on a 4.0 scale\u2026 Anyway any advice ???",

              "text": "I can't answer whether it's worth it to you to spend time applying to other schools, but I would caution against the idea that there are \"better\" and \"worse\" schools out there as you make decisions. \n\nYour application decisions should be based on what you think is important in a college, not where your think schools rank. The UCs, for example, are all very different from each other, some are more undergraduate focused, some are more research oriented. Some are urban, some rural. Some have sports cultures, some don't. Some are commuter schools and some are mostly residential. They're all excellent schools, and all are competitive with any selective private university.",

      "text": "I think this would require more research on your side. Figure out what type of college life you want. Do you want to leave your state? Or maybe experience a program at a specific school? Personally, as someone also applying from CA, I decided to only apply to reach schools that are out of state. My reasoning was that our UC system is already really good, and the only reason I would attend school out of state would be because I get accepted to a better school. Hope this helps!",
