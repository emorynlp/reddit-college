      "text": "The admissions committee are liars but they aren\u2019t sociopaths. They don\u2019t want to inflict pain on you, they are just doing their jobs. This is why they say obviously absurd things in the rejection letter. Of course a rejection reflects on you. They had a choice and they chose to leave you out. Of course it\u2019s a failure, and of course it hurts. I think we should be honest about this. Your emotions are valid, including the negative ones. Risk is part of the game if you ever want to reach your potential. Anxiety means you care about the outcome, and tears mean you know you were good enough but it just wasn\u2019t your day. So don\u2019t let them tell you not to feel your own emotions.",
