  "text": "I\u2019m not sad about getting rejected by 13 out of the 16 schools I applied to. I got in to some decent safeties so I\u2019ll be fine.\n\nWhat I\u2019m sad about is that I\u2019ll never be able to feel the emotion of getting accepted into the school I really wanted. Instead, when I look back on this part of my life, I\u2019ll only remember the boring, dull feeling of opening all 13 rejection letters.\n\nI wish I could have felt that emotion, opening up a decision letter, being surprised about the result, crying tears of joy, rushing to find my family and tell them \u201cI got in!!!\u201d. Instead, each time was me casually letting them know I got rejected from somewhere.",

Didn't get into my dream school but still went to a good university. A little bummed at the time as you described, but reading your post on my popular feed was such a weird feeling for me... like oh right, I used to place significant value in that. I don't think I've thought of the admissions process since I was in the admissions process. Life moves fast, be proud of what you have accomplished and live in the moment. This time of your life will be gone fast and it's better to enjoy it than worry about how you'll feel afterwards. Congratulations on your acceptance and good luck in the coming years :)",

Are they gonna do worse in life for going to a less prestigious school? No... because WHERE you go *does not matter*. WHO you are does. The only benefit to school \u201cprestige\u201d is help with landing your 1st job. After that it doesn\u2019t matter at all. I have a friend who is a consultant and whose coworkers are mainly Ivy League grads. If she and one of her coworkers were to quit and each apply for the same next job, will the coworker have an edge over her for graduating from an Ivy League? Nope. The choice is entirely dependent on how well they interview and what they were able to accomplish in their previous roles. Once again, who you are matters so much more than where you go. Hope this helps. ",

      "text": "I\u2019ll level with you, I applied to college 8ish years ago, but I still remember the struggle. I got rejections from every place except my number 1 (Johns Hopkins) and my safety state university. While I was excited to get that acceptance letter, I was crushed when I found that I would get practically zero financial aid or scholarships. My state school gave me an almost full ride. I almost begrudgingly went to my state school but it turned out to be one of the best decisions I ever made. I met the woman who would be my wife on my very first day there, and excelled in that environment. i was happy to graduate with a chemical engineering degree with practically zero debt.  I later got accepted to a damn fine medical school (Wake Forest) which I am just about to graduate from, and I recently matched into my number 1 program for emergency medicine, which was my ideal field. I had friends at my medical school who went to hopkins and told me about the cutthroat nature at Hopkins which actually made me glad I didnt go unto debt for my number 1. The point is, life is what you make of it, and things can certainly turn out better than you ever expect. The same is true of college. Sometimes it is can be better to make yourself a bigger fish in a smaller pond than to be lower-middle of the pack in a prestigious place. The value in many of the \u201cprestigious\u201d places is really just the connections you can make there, but that is not to say that you cannot make incredibly valuable connections where you are at. Wherever you go, or whatever you do, just make the best of it, and try to make as many connections as you can, and you may be pleasantly surprised what will happen. ",

That is, it's a measure of your school and life qualities to date - your current life/academic resume, if you wish.  \n  \nThe person that was rejected 13/16 times this cycle need not be the same person in the future.  I don't know about your location, but where I am, it's not uncommon for people to switch from one university to another or from a 2-year college to a university.  \n  \nIf you are willing to put time into improving your resume through studying hard and getting good grades at your first school, having an active community presence, etc.  you could still be accepted to one of the places you wanted to go.  \n  \nMight even be all the sweeter for knowing what it took to earn that spot.\n  \n",
