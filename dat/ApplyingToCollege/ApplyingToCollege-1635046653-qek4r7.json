  "title:": "Question about Robertson (UNC/Duke) Scholarship's \"extraordinary circumstances or qualifications\" prompt. (Idk if this is allowed, mods can remove if not).",
  "text": "# Additional Information:\n\n# If you wish to provide details of extraordinary circumstances or qualifications not reflected in other portions of your application, please reference them briefly below.\u00a0DO NOT use this space to add a resume or to write an additional essay. Those materials will not be considered.\n\nWhat exactly is it asking for in this section? I was planning to put a 250 word essay I had about COVID's effect on me, but I figured out that it's not asking for a response like that, but rather details about additional ECs or leadership positions or something. But then, it says not to put a resume or put an essay about ECs or said leadership position, so what in the world *can* we put in this place?",

      "text": "I'm thinking for extraordinary circumstances you couldn't fit in the additional info like...one of your parents died suddenly this year and your financial aid stuff doesn't reflect it, you got cancer and are on medical leave or have to defer your enrollment if admitted, etc. basically like grade A trauma\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor qualifications (which u usually would have in activities or honors) but I guess if you somehow couldn't fit it maybe you got a book published, got invited to a prestigious program or internship, etc.",
