  "text": "Basically (by my luck I guess lol) in junior year and senior year I wasn\u2019t able to take AP stats junior year and AP Calc senior year as my school often has course scheduling conflicts so I took AP Stats at a virtual high school and I\u2019m currently taking Calc at community college rn. Both classes are not on my high school transcript as my school doesn\u2019t allow courses taken outside to be on the hs transcript.\n\nCan I explain in the additional info section about the course scheduling difficulties? Also, will I be disadvantaged if I wasn\u2019t able to take it at my brick n mortar school versus a virtual high school/community college? \n\nThanks",

One more question; I\u2019m able to include the virtual high school and the course in the education section but for the community college on the common app i can\u2019t include the course bc there\u2019s no place to include it there, so just explaining the Calc community college class In the additional info section as well as sending in the transcript should be sufficient right? Thanks again",
