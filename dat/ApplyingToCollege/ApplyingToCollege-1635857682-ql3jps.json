  "text": "I didn't know how to put this into a title, but I really want to go to Northwestern. NU fits everything I need, except it doesn't have American Sign Language studies. During the summers of my time at NU, I plan to take ASL classes at another local college- Columbia College Chicago. I shouldn't include me taking another college's classes in my admissions essays, right? Part of my intentions is to combine Deaf Studies with my theatre Major and explore that in my studies.",
