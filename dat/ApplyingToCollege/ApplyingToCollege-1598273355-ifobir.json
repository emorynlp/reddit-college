  "text": "Edit: was rlly annoyed when I wrote this lol, but she\u2019s a Cornell \u201824 freshmen who has a tiktok (500k) about college, and she went to a party 2 days after arriving to Cornell, and told those who were complaining that \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t have been invited anyways\u201d. Basically I meant by the title that 1) don\u2019t make ur whole personality the school you got into and 2) don\u2019t go to parties during a pandemic. \n\nEdit 2: A big sorry to peteyMIT, I was under the impression that you two had personally talked due to a recent video of hers. Turns out she was just using advice from this sub\n\nEdit 3: She made an apology, saying that the post was taken out of context, but there\u2019s a lot of contradiction between what her classmates are saying and what she said in her video. I guess time will tell if anything happens\n\nWhich MIT AO on here hyped her up too much? Kinda kidding about that, but seriously, getting into an Ivy League (especially after getting rejected to the others) and basing your whole personality about that is not a good look.",

She also had really [bad takes](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJkV5cGa/) on AA. And she keeps encouraging people to do ecs just for college apps (like volunteer for a climate org to look good). \n\nI also noticed she just regurgitates advice from this sub and passes off as her own research. Like I thought she asked an MIT AO for admissions insight but then it turns out she found a thread from u/peteyMIT on this sub and made a video about it. On this premise any of us could do the same thing and get tiktok clout \n\n[@zhangarang\uff1aa verified member of the MIT admissions team on the Applying to College subreddit (2/2) \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc appreciate you asking respectfully](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJkN2aD8/)\n\nEdit: asdfgheklwa why is my most upvoted and only awarded comment about tiktok drama I can\u2019t \ud83d\udc80\n\nEdit 2: added a link!",

So it was under impression she talked to an AO from MIT or did some sort of research and is sharing these tips through her video.\n\nButtt in the comments someone asked what her qualifications were to give this advice.  She  commented she was qualified because she applied to 8 ivies and these tips were from a verified MIT AO on a2c...I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s you because idk any other verified MIT AO on this sub. She didn\u2019t even credit you for the advice! \n\nLike the advice in the post wasn\u2019t bad but she was being sketchy. Why not just give a link to one of your posts and give you credit?\n\nThe tiktok world of college admissions is pretty wack :/",

They\u2019re going to be testing us (all students at Cornell) twice a week starting next week, so ideally they\u2019ll be able to isolate most of the partygoers before they do too much damage. Failure to get surveillance tested means you can\u2019t attend classes because they deactivate your account. \n\nSo far, Cornell is doing alright. Most students are social distancing, respecting quarantines, and wearing masks. Last week we had an arrival test positivity rate of 0.5% - we need to stay under 4% for the model to work. The police have been breaking up fraternity parties as well.  \n\nJust in case you were curious, thought I\u2019d share!",

But at the same time she\u2019s a freshman in college, ivy or not, freshman are dumb as a rock. Like this whole thing is a mess. Why don\u2019t we all just cancel Cornell and every other school that is run by adults who want to reopen. Why is everyone shocked that young students accepted to college are socializing. College is literally the place to socialize. The actual problem isn\u2019t this girl or people partying. The problem stems from the fact that colleges are allowing students to be back on campus during a pandemic. So we have decades of students going to college for the first time and doing stupid shit and that is just suddenly supposed to stop because of a pandemic? Let\u2019s be realistic here ... the real problem is the college not the dumb freshman being a normal human being. I\u2019m not defending her but I am defending the immature freshman who is expected to live in isolation when put in a setting designed for social interaction... AKA college.",

I've seen some dumb as shit people get in to law school and pass the bar. Some have book smarts/street smarts but lack the other. \n\nIt's important for people like Ms. Zhang to understand that there are other students who aren't as fortunate as other in having access to resources like tutors, SAT prep classes, good school districts, good teachers, AP classes, etc. Not everyone has the luxury of coming home from school and having the time to do homework, some people have to go straight to their afterschool job to help their parents. Obviously, they won't get the same grades as others. That doesn't make them any less intelligent or worthy than people who are accepted into the ivy league.

          "text": "To give you a serious answer, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re quite a bit older than the average user on this sub. Students here like to hype up schools just because of their \u201cprestige\u201d (fancy word for acceptance rate). And acceptance rates across the board have dropped massively, to a point where Cornell accepts the same percentage of people that Harvard accepted 20 years ago. So naturally people follow the hype and disregard anything else. Cornell is a great school, but flouting it and trying to give people advice on how to get into any Ivy is pretty hilarious (which is what Jessica is doing). \n\nAnyways, go bears, fuck the trees",
