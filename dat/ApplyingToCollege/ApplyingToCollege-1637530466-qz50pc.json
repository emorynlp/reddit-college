  "title:": "Should I be worried about asset verification email?",
  "text": "I just got an email from one of my schools asking me to complete a parent asset verification form. Supposedly, there is an item that needs clarification. I'm terrified that I accidentally filled out wrong information on my FAFSA or CSS. The email doesnt say what needs clarification and the form wants me to restate everything that was previously filled out. Is this bad? Everything was filled out accurately and my moms tax person helped us fill out a lot of it. Does the school think I've committed fraud? I dont know what raised the red flag or if I should be worried. Has anyone else experienced this?",
