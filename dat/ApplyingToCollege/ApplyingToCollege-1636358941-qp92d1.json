  "title:": "I fucked up my Common App.",
  "text": "I submitted an ED for UPenn Wharton. Right now, it's like a week after I submitted it. I just took a look at the Activities section in the Common App that was submitted, and I left an activity list that I had put there since I created the CA in Junior year. It's titled \"Reader of Books\", and the description is \"Read nonfiction on economics, financial markets, human behavior, and entrepreneurship.\" It *is* an activity I've been doing for all of high school, but this makes me look like a fucking idiot by putting it on the CA, as if I'm fishing for an EC.\n\nI seriously don't know whether to laugh or cry. The whole situation is kind of hilarious, but also shit because I have an otherwise amazing application that I know they would love. I'm just pretty sad that I won't be able to go to my dream school after putting in so much work to get here. Talk about tripping at the finish line... I'm just ranting at this point, because there's no way in hell I'm telling anyone I know in real life. Hopefully someone who reads this will double-check their applications, and not end up making the same mistake that I made. Good luck to you all.",
