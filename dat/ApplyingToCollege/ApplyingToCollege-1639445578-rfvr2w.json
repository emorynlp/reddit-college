      "text": "the most important thing about your work in high school is that it'll establish a work ethic. the college you go to can only make or break your life path if you let it... even if you end up somewhere you think doesn't match up with the other places, staying strong will have you looking admirable to employers/investors/whoever you need to believe in your career, which is really the end goal anyways. i think a lot of students tend to forget that the second you're in the college, whether prestigious or not, there's still work to be done and the whole point is to cement the rest of ur life, dont stress it",
