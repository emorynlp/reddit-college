  "text": "guys im really confused about ed and aid. so im applying ed to northeastern which is really expensive and through fafsa I'm asking for aid. now if the school doesn't fullfill the fafsa requirements, am I still required to go? i'm not from a low income family, but having to pay the full tuition of uni will really hurt my family's financial situation esp since only my single mom is paying. please let me know asap.",

      "text": "To clarify, colleges use the FAFSA form to help calculate need. However, FAFSA EFC, by itself, does not tell students what they can expect to pay. It is not enough info. Many colleges require additional forms such as the CSS Profile or the college's own form, considering both income and assets and often noncustodial income and assets as well, and each college has its own level of available resources and uses its own unique formula in calculating need.\n\nSee whether you are eligible for any need-based financial aid. Run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply.\n\n*Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask*. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.\n\nFederal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow. Larger loans require a parent signature and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow.\n\n[https://npc.collegeboard.org/app/northeastern](https://npc.collegeboard.org/app/northeastern) Run the NPC for all the schools on your list and compare estimates.\n\nApply ED only if: (1) it's absolutely your first choice, (2) it's definitely affordable according to the NPC estimate, (3) you don't need to see financial aid or scholarship offers from other schools, and (4) you will be prepared to withdraw all other apps upon an acceptance from your ED college.",

              "text": "You can back out of ED if the package is not affordable. However, that can be a sticky situation, especially if you can see right now that it's not likely to be affordable. It's possible to appeal your aid package after you get it, but, definitely not ideal.\n\nYou can try calling the financial aid office on Monday to ask them some questions, but ED may not be a good idea if they don't tell you anything favorable.\n\nNortheastern also has ED2, if you are able to clarify the financial aid issue over the next couple of months.",
