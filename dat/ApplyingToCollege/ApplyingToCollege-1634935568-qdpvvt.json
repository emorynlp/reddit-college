  "text": "When is the deadline to submit the penn financial aid supplement and tax return (international students)? \n\nOnline it says that it can take up to 48 hours from the time you submit your app until you get your penn applicant portal. So is it ok for the financial aid stuff to get uploaded after November 1st or what\u2019s the deal? \n\nThanks in advance.",
