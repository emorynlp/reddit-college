  "text": "Y'all i've been lurking on A2C for about 5-6 months now but it was today I realized that UC Hicago and UChicago are TWO DIFFERENT COLLEGES. I used to see memes about UC Hicago being super selective on Shitpost Wednesdays and i would be like, \"Why is it funny? UChicago *is* super selective\"\n\nThen today i saw UC Hicago being competitive thing posted by u/fishy0404  and there was a comment that mentioned cali students being in-state and i was like ???? what????? Chicago is in California???? So i google UC Hicago AND IT WAS A DIFFERENT COLLEGE. I CANT BELIEVE I AM SO DUMB. lmao i deadass thought people were always spelling UChicago wrong whenever i saw UC Hicago\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nEdit: after reading everyone\u2019s comments i have come to the conclusion that UC Hicago does not, in fact, exist. Thank you to the person who showed me the origin of the joke, and i have come to the realisation that i might be the biggest dumbass on this sub. thanks for coming to my Ted Talk and goodnight yall",
