  "text": "Okay so tomorrow I\u2019m hanging out with my gf all day so I want to have my supplements done by tonight. I have 4 essays to write and i think you all should send me good vibes. I\u2019ll update this as the nights goes on\u2026\n\nEdit at 7:10 pm - Just got done one essay. Reviewing the rest of my application to make sure all the simple stuff is done and I\u2019m not missing anything. Maybe I should go into creative writing and not engineering lmao (not really tho) the stuff I\u2019m writing is good\n\nEdit at 8:26 pm - okay another essay done and this was the only essay topic I really didn\u2019t know what to write about. This essay is meh, I just couldn\u2019t think of anything else to write about. It\u2019s not bad just not as good as my other ones. Regardless I\u2019m still proud of it and I shall continue on\n\nEdit at 9:00 pm - Finished it all, really like my last essay it\u2019s really genuine. Time to review everything and submit. Thanks for the good vibes",
