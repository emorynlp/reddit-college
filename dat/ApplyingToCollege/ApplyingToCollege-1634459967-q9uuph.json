  "text": "right now i have a list of 30 or so colleges i would like to attend. obviously, im not going to apply for all 30 of them, so i gotta sort them into safety/match/reach categories first. that is where im not sure - should i categorize the colleges according to their average acceptance rate, or based on how my scores compare to those of the accepted students? (i know getting admitted takes more than just scores, but you never know until you ask, right?)\n\ne. g. the college has a 40% acceptance rate, but my SAT scores and GPA are higher than its students' score range. would that be a match school? or a safety school?",

      "text": "Assuming your grades are roughly inline with your test scores, I would start with a school's overall acceptance rate and then adjust for three things:\n\n1.  major you're applying to,\n2. your scores relative to the school's median score,\n3. if you're applying out-of-state to a public school.\n\nIt's impossible to make any of these adjustments \"precise\".  If you're applying to CS, Eng or maybe business, then adjust your expected admit rate downwards, especially at schools that is known to be strong in the area you're interested in.  UIUC would be the canonical example for CS and maybe Indiana for business.  If your scores are higher than the school's median then adjust the accept rate upwards.  The bigger the gap the bigger the adjustment.  Then, if you're applying out-of-state, drop it somewhat since schools are usually more selective with out-of-state applicants.\n\nFor the example you give, I'd call that a match.",
