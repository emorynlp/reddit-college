  "title:": "Harvard Intellectual Activity Essay",
  "text": "Literally no one seems to know how to write the Harvard intellectual activity essay. Help? \n\nIt's this one: \n\n>Your intellectual life may extend beyond the academic requirements of your particular school. Please use the space below to list additional intellectual activities that you have not mentioned or detailed elsewhere in your application. These could include, but are not limited to, supervised or self-directed projects not done as school work, training experiences, online courses not run by your school, or summer academic or research programs not described elsewhere. (150 words)\n\nIt says \"list\" but half the resources on the internet tell me to write a paragraph listing things I've done, another tells me to write bullet points, and another tells me to go into detail about a certain activity. I'm getting paranoid. Does anyone know what it's supposed to look like?",

      "text": "1.  There is no \"supposed to\" for this - you can tackle it however you want.  If they wanted to be prescriptive, they would have told you more explicitly in the prompt how they wanted you to do it.\n\n2.  It says \"activities\" so you are certainly free to discuss more than one thing.  I've had several Harvard admits in the last few years and they're probably 50/50 on whether they wrote about one thing or several.  Some listed things in bullets with a little explanation for each.  Some wrote an essay about one thing that was especially important to them.\n\n3.  Make sure you go beyond WHAT you did and delve into SO WHAT and WHY.  AOs care far more about those things anyway.  You want to show meaningful things about yourself - \"intellectual life\" - not just busyness or even engagement.  \n\n4.  It's just 150 words, so it's not likely to be the single thing that drives your final admission decision.  So don't panic if you don't have a 10/10 response for this.\n\n5.  Since it's really short, I recommend checking out the Answer->Evidence->Interpretation framework [I outline in this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/dfawfe/a_short_guide_to_short_essays/)  It tends to work really well for students and can be applied to most short essays.",
