  "text": "I will probably apply to Concordia university in Montreal. I was just wondering whether I should apply for accountancy or engineering. My family's budget is kinda tough since we are not from here so accountancy seems more reasonable but my parents wants me to major engineering anyway. I don't have a particular field that I want to learn so I want to know more about pros and cons of each field in the university.\n\nThanh you!",
