  "title:": "SAT scores not shown in Application PDF",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI just submitted my first few applications today. However, my SAT scores were not being displayed on the Common App application preview. Although, I selected the option that showed my consent to get my SAT scores considered for admission, the scores were not visible in the Application pdf. Is this normal? Should I mail the universities for this? (Self report was allowed at these universities)\n\nIt would be really great if you could help me.\n\nThank you very much!",
