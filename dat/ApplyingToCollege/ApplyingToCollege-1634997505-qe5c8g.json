  "text": "I was supposed to become a long-term volunteer at my local library and also participate in several small one-day volunteer things, but these cancelled due to COVID. Would it be worth mentioning these in the COVID section? I am hesitant because I'm sure most students lost EC opportunities during COVID and I'm afraid of sounding whiney. I feel like the COVID section should be reserved for more significant information such as family members getting sick or losing their job.",

      "text": "You certainly can.  The Covid section is there for you to explain your circumstances.  It's not there to be a competition to see who got crushed the most by the pandemic.  Just be brief and not overly dramatic.\n\nSo nothing like,\n\n\"Just as the kids' love of reading was beginning to blossom, it was washed away, drowned in their tears and mine.  Like a merciless, indiscriminate tsunami, the pandemic ripped away every opportunity I had lined up to help these sweet, but underprivileged children.  Crying only added to the waves, and neither the library nor I would ever be the same.\"",
