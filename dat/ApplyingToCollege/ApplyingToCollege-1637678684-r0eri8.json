  "text": "\nI am currently a senior in HS, and I plan to take AP Government and Politics, but my Principal has told me that I couldn\u2019t join anymore because AP courses are a two year long course. I asked if I can opt for a full load but she said I would have to wait for the next school year to take AP Gov and Politics.  \n\nFor further context, we have two semesters and I plan to take it next semester but cannot due to it being a 2 year long course. I\u2019m also not under the AP capstone program. \n\nAny advice on this? I really wanna take AP Government and Politics as this can serve as a great foundation for the degree I will be pursuing in university. \n\nThank you!",
