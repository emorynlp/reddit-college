      "text": "If the college superscores ACT, then submit the highest sections so the college can superscore. \n\nCheck each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll \u2013 Common App asks only for your highest section scores and highest ACT composite. \n\nOther colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission. If your colleges require official reports prior to admission, you would need to send all three test dates so that they can superscore for you.",
