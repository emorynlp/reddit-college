  "title:": "Should I Correct This Mistake After I Submitted My Application Through Common App?",
  "text": "On the Testing section of the Common App, it asks, \"Number of past SAT scores you wish to report.\" I thought that I obviously only wanted to report the highest one, so I only put \"1,\" even though I took 2 and was reporting the second score. Now when I look at the application in full it says \"Taken: 1\" under the SAT section of the application.\n\nIs this consequential enough to contact the college's admissions office to correct this mistake?",
