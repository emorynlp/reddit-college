It\u2019s a myth that CS and Engineering are so much harder to get into than other majors. At a few universities this is true. As a general rule, this is not true. If you have a strong background in math and science, you\u2019ll be a strong candidate for CS or Engineering at most colleges.\n\n2. If you enter college as a humanities major, you may not have access to all of the STEM courses that are appropriate for the major that you really want.\n\nAlso, you can be on the \u201cpre law\u201d track as a CS or Engineering major. Are you thinking about patent law? Very lucrative career from my understanding.",
