  "title:": "Changing jobs while in the college application process",
  "text": "Does anyone have any experience with changing or moving jobs during the college application process? \n\nI am considering leaving my job at a movie theater to work at a local chickfila. I already have all of my applications in, so I know that I will have to send an email to the admissions office to let them know of the change. The only thing that I am concerned about is that my current job related to one of my academic interests (film studies), I wrote about the job in my application essay and how it made me want to work in the film industry, and I am in a team leadership position.\n\nMy primary motivations for wanting to switch in the first place is that I'm kinda burnt out from the movie theater and I have a lot of friends working at the chickfila. It also has a higher starting pay than what I make right now after 2 raises, with less responsibilities (which I think will be better for my mental health). Both jobs have their pros and cons, but I just would like to know how this may affect my admissions. Would it seem contradictory to leave a place that made me want to work in the film industry, and that I wrote about being essential to in a supplemental essay? Would AOs see this as a big deal, even with my other great ECs? Any and all advice, anecdotes, or experiences would be greatly appreciated.",
