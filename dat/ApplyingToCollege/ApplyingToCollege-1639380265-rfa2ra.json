  "text": "Hey guys! I got a question. So I\u2019m currently a senior with a 4.2 weighted gpa and I applied to some UC\u2019s and CSU\u2019s. However, I think I will finished this semester with my first ever D, in a math class I did not need for my A-G requirements. If i get admitted to any universities, will they rescind my decision due to this?",

              "text": "I would think that as long as you can pass with credit (assuming it is Credit or No Credit), it would be fine. This way, it is also probably not calculated with your gpa since Credit/No Credit grades do not count for gpa. I\u2019m not sure if this is definitively true or not, but I believe as long as you can show **on your transcript or any official documents sent to UC outlining grades** that the grade is Pass or No Pass, you should be ok. I\u2019d ask a school counselor if one is available, if not, ask a school admin, and if not again, post again on A2C to get more thoughts on the matter. Good luck!!!",
