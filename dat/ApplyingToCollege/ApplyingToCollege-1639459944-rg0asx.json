  "text": "For context its Caltech. The exact message is *\"We will be releasing Early Action decisions via an update to your Caltech Applicant Portal on Saturday, December 18.\"* Does this mean I'm rejected?\n\nEdit: Yes I know what it means, but does this mean I'm an auto-reject cause they are giving my decision quite early?",
