  "title:": "Should I write a LOCI after being deferred from Cornell?",
  "text": "I got deferred from Cornell Engineering and I wasn't able to find anything on their website mentioning anything about a LOCI. Should I write one anyways and upload it to the supplemental information part of the portal? I've also seen some people say to write a few sentences in a email saying that you're still interested. Thoughts?",

      "text": "I recommend in Jan (early), you write your LOCI. It should include why Cornell is absolutely your first choice still. Ideally, you update them on any progress or improvements you\u2019ve made academically or new academic discovery from a class you took this semester, awards, etc. Thank them for their time. \n\nSend to admission off if you don\u2019t have a regional AO (Cornell does things by region, I think). Worst case, upload your PDF LOCI onto the portal.",
