  "title:": "Help - Not comfortable Letting my friend read my essays",
  "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI am a transfer student from a CC, and I and my friend are applying to the same schools, same major, same unique circumstances ( associates in one year). The only thing distinguishing us are our activities and our essays. She kept pressuring me to send her my activities list, which I did not, but now that the UC deadline is approaching, she is asking me to send her the \"why this major\" essay. I do not feel comfortable doing that whatsoever because it is such a unique essay and I would not want anyone to write theirs based on mine. I do not know how to say no to her and/or establish boundaries. I just thought she would be smarter than this and realize that her asking me for my material is putting me in an uncomfortable position. \n\nAm I being an a-hole for not wanting to share the essays that I have been working on since August while she waited for the absolute last minute? I do tell her I am ready to help her craft her own, but she keeps asking me to see mine because \"there are some details she does not know\". Please help, any suggestion will be appreciated :)",

Her GPA is lower and that makes her desperate(which she expressed to me), and I just dont want to risk it. I have offered her every single resource I have used since August until now that helped me craft my own essay, but she did not want that and disregarded them. I mean if it was just for inspo she could\u2019ve utilized the many online examples I\u2019ve sent her.",
