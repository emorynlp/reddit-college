  "title:": "Question About Financial Aid",
  "text": "Hi, I applied to Notre Dame for restrictive early action through common app, and I'm assuming the results are coming out some time this week. However, I realized that I never filled anything out for financial aid, like I haven't done my FAFSA yet. Was there a form or something I should have filled out when applying to request financial aid, or do I handle financial aid stuff after the results come out? I'm pretty confused on the whole process.\n\nEdit: I'm pretty sure I severely messed up, [this link](https://financialaid.nd.edu/) says I should have done the financial aid stuff November 15th. Is there any way I can fix this? ",

In the meanwhile, start filling up the forms and try to submit them anyway, because they could take a few days to process... Their IDOC deadline is December 15th, so there's a chance that it still might be okay.",
