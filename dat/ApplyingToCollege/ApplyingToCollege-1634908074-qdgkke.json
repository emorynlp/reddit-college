  "text": "Hi there I just dont know what to do and yeah I just need some advice. So I am basically done with all my applications due nov 1st, but harvard requires 2 recommenders, and if it requires 2 the other college im applying to might as well take the 2nd one too. I asked 2 teachers for recommendations in August, one of them finished in August, and the other one still isn't done. I emailed him on Monday and he said he would have it done soon, but its not done still and I don't wanna be a dick because he's genuinely a great person and teacher, but I just hate waiting to the last minute for applications and wanna get it done and over with. So what should I do?",
