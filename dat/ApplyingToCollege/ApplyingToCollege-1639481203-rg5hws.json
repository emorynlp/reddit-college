  "title:": "Help. One of my friends got into Dartmouth ED... by hiring essay writers!!!",
  "text": "One of my friends let his twin brother take his SAT for him and had a paid essay writer (a few thousand dollars) to help him get into Dartmouth. He showed me every single essay the person wrote for him and they were AMAZING essays... but it's clear plagiarism and ridiculous because I also applied there and I didn't get any help. He basically hired someone to fill out 90$ of his common app. I called the admissions office twice about (this under a pseudonym) and sent them proof by email 3x since August but they never responded back to me.   \n\n\nWhy?   \n\n\nMy friend is not well-connected, his family makes \\~50k a year, and he's not a legacy. He;s also not a donor. He also doesn't have any siblings that went to the Dartmouth. I just don't understand why the school never returned my calls or emails I sent before he got in..... it's almost like they DID NOT CARE if he cheated.   \n\n\n\\*I did not get into Dartmouth, which was also my ED school. But still. I thought this situation was riciduluous even before we knew decisions.\\*",

The school system is already pretty fucked since you can be born into a place of privilege and lie, cheat, and steal your way to the top so this is a drop in the bucket. Imo this kinda just sounds like you're jealous of your friend and are trying to bring them down with you.",

                          "text": "Basically when colleges admit students, it\u2019s not an exact number, and it doesn\u2019t go spot by spot. Every year, a college will identify what its needs are in terms of a new class in order to help the college stay functioning, but this number is based on a percentage that\u2019s based on other percentages that come down a funnel, if you will. \n\nSo let\u2019s say a college needs 100 freshmen. If they know they typically yield 20% of their admits, that means they\u2019ll need 500 admits. But let\u2019s go one level higher- if the college admits 50% of their applicants, then they know they\u2019ll need to bring in 1000 applications. And so on, and so forth. \n\nBut of course, numbers like these are never exact. Your school could have an unexpected scandal that causes applications to drop. Or a celebrity graduates from your institution which causes numbers to spike. How do you shift the admit rate? How will yield be projected?? And then, you have to account for students who might accept their offer but then over the summer, change their minds (we call this \u201csummer melt\u201d) so then maybe you admit a little more than you need. \n\nBasically, there are a lot of moving pieces that admissions offices have to account for to get a class size in line with institutional goals. But! These goals aren\u2019t set on individual students. \n\nI realized this was probably far more than you asked for but please let me know if I can clarify anything!",

This is when you start seeing injustice and unfairness among people around you, and it will just get worse and worse you have no choice but to get used to it.
