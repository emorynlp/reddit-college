  "title:": "Help. One of my friends got into Dartmouth ED... by hiring essay writers!!!",
  "text": "One of my friends let his twin brother take his SAT for him and had a paid essay writer (a few thousand dollars) to help him get into Dartmouth. He showed me every single essay the person wrote for him and they were AMAZING essays... but it's clear plagiarism and ridiculous because I also applied there and I didn't get any help. He basically hired someone to fill out 90$ of his common app. I called the admissions office twice about (this under a pseudonym) and sent them proof by email 3x since August but they never responded back to me.   \n\n\nWhy?   \n\n\nMy friend is not well-connected, his family makes \\~50k a year, and he's not a legacy. He;s also not a donor. He also doesn't have any siblings that went to the Dartmouth. I just don't understand why the school never returned my calls or emails I sent before he got in..... it's almost like they DID NOT CARE if he cheated.   \n\n\n\\*I did not get into Dartmouth, which was also my ED school. But still. I thought this situation was riciduluous even before we knew decisions.\\*",

Let\u2019s recind his friend right now! \u201d Like if that was the case I can email ur schools rn and say you cheated without proof and they should rescind you. See how that makes no sense ?",

The school system is already pretty fucked since you can be born into a place of privilege and lie, cheat, and steal your way to the top so this is a drop in the bucket. Imo this kinda just sounds like you're jealous of your friend and are trying to bring them down with you.",

                          "text": "Basically when colleges admit students, it\u2019s not an exact number, and it doesn\u2019t go spot by spot. Every year, a college will identify what its needs are in terms of a new class in order to help the college stay functioning, but this number is based on a percentage that\u2019s based on other percentages that come down a funnel, if you will. \n\nSo let\u2019s say a college needs 100 freshmen. If they know they typically yield 20% of their admits, that means they\u2019ll need 500 admits. But let\u2019s go one level higher- if the college admits 50% of their applicants, then they know they\u2019ll need to bring in 1000 applications. And so on, and so forth. \n\nBut of course, numbers like these are never exact. Your school could have an unexpected scandal that causes applications to drop. Or a celebrity graduates from your institution which causes numbers to spike. How do you shift the admit rate? How will yield be projected?? And then, you have to account for students who might accept their offer but then over the summer, change their minds (we call this \u201csummer melt\u201d) so then maybe you admit a little more than you need. \n\nBasically, there are a lot of moving pieces that admissions offices have to account for to get a class size in line with institutional goals. But! These goals aren\u2019t set on individual students. \n\nI realized this was probably far more than you asked for but please let me know if I can clarify anything!",

Probably a lot more work needed to do and higher work ethic is needed than non Ivy League schools. I personally would not want to go into an Ivy League even if I was accepted. \n\nLong explanation: This is more like a why I don't like Ivy League schools for what they are, and not much of why are they more difficult. \nSay you got into an Ivy League school but you have to okay the full price and whatever financial aid you get, but then you are also accepted into public university that's ranked very well in your state or the country and you get a full ride or free tuition for all years. The public university would be the best either way because it is way cheaper and you paid very little if not, nothing, and you'll be debt free unlike Ivy League universities. Although you might be starting out with a salary of 20k more than a public university, you're going to end up having the same salary in whatever study you do. Even if you make less after graduating from a public university, you won't be in the hundreds of thousands in debt after graduating from an Ivy League or even private college. These ways do depend on how much the student puts effort in. If they put the same hard work ethic into either university, they will succeed greatly either way. I'm just ranting here, but you get the point, hopefully.",

It reflects poorly on the college admissions process and Dartmouth itself in that you can essentially buy and cheat your way into a top school (as long as your trusted friend doesn't snitch on you)\n4. A very good portion of applicants are qualified enough to fit in anyways even though only a very small portion of them are actually accepted\n\nI don't disagree with what you're saying and the 'friend\" is scum for what he did, but I doubt anything will happen, and honestly as a whole I just hate the college admissions process.",

But I\u2019ve learnt that it\u2019s probably not good for us to be so idealistic. This is when you start seeing injustice and unfairness among people around you, and it will just get worse and worse you have no choice but to get used to it. So forget about your friend, just focus on your own apps. I believe in you!\n\nAlso it might be healthier to stop reading more of these comments\u2026 if I were myself a year ago right now I would definitely break reading these. My best wishes for you<3",

But I also can\u2019t say there was no time where I was super tempted to do it, out of irritation and desperation. So I understand where OP is coming from, even if it wasn\u2019t the best course of action. It just rubs me the wrong way that people are insulting OP or actively praising/defending the cheater when OP has a valid reason to be angry. Thanks for your reply!",

Maybe you would have gotten into Dartmouth if you put the same effort towards the SAT and essay writing that you are putting in to screw over your friend.\n\nIf you don't work on yourself as a person, you will never achieve any of your goals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I warned the members of the NOVA community about you.
