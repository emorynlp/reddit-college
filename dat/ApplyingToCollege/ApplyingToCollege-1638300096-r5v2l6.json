  "text": "I\u2019m an International Student currently studying A levels in the 11th grade I have finished my IGCSES and after completing 3 A levels and the SAT I\u2019m looking to study in America but the thing is my school offers no extracurriculars at ALL. No clubs nothing I\u2019m from the Middle East and how universities accepts people on the basis of entrance exams or high school grades itself. I don\u2019t know what I should do however I do have hobbies such as playing the piano and the guitar. Any help would be appreciated.",
