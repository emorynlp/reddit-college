  "text": "I just recently sent an email to NEU about an application inquiry, but accidentally used the wrong college name since I had this same question for a couple of other schools. I immediately sent an apology email, but I just feel super stupid and annoyed that I could make such a simple mistake. Can anyone offer any insight into this? Looking for some reassurance :))",
