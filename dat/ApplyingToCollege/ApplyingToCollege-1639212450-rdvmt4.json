  "text": "\\- **If you need to go in unreasonable debt it is NOT worth it.**\n\nI personally got into pretty decent schools the biggest being UC Irvine, UC Davis and Virginia Tech. All of which were out of state for me, I almost made the terrible decision to take out private loans of 20k a year to go to Virginia Tech. It wasn't until I joined a student loans subreddit in July of 2021 having already applied for housing and made friends that I realized it wasn't worth it. I ended up attending the college in my city  ( I got into 3 schools in my state but it had already been too late to receive scholarships I got for 2 of them so I went with the cheapest option) best decision I ever made, I only had to take out the direct loans from my financial aid package and so far had to pay 300 for the year. **I CANT STRESS THIS ENOUGH.** no school no matter the name I don't care if it's Harvard is worth tremendous debt especially private loan debt. You may think it doesn't matter and its a problem that can be put off till you graduate but loans especially private loans destroy lives. Why they even have it as an option for young and impressionable 18 year olds is beyond me but **DO NOT** think that just because it's an option that that means you should use it. Private loans should be a last resort. \n\n\\- **Name is nothing.**\n\nBeing where I am I've watched students transfer from huge schools or really selective schools , college is about more then name, if you are sacrificing your future financial stability, your mental health etc for the name of a school then it isn't for you. Yes networking and getting a job can be easier if you go to a more selective school but if you are not happy and have to go into immense debt it is NOT worth it. This might mean you have to do more networking but this is truly way easier when you are in a school you are comfortable in. A degree is a degree and in certain fields you can be working with people who have degrees from Harvard or small random colleges in the midwest. What matters  is your future and your happiness and that doesn't always come from big name colleges. \n\n**- This doesn't define you**\n\n You are not less than or stupid if you don't get into the college you want or if you can't afford the colleges you do get into. Make smart decisions for YOU, remember those who judge you will not have to face the consequences of the decisions you make RIGHT NOW. Be selfish in this decision, unless your parents are paying or taking out loans for you this is something that can determine the start of your adult life after college, take it seriously and be smart. Private loans are no joke, especially to my first gen students, if you are doing It on your own or you have parents trying to force you into decisions you aren't sure you wanna make stand your ground as much as you can and educate yourself as much as you can. These next few years are so important and you want to make sure these decisions are being made for no one else but you",
