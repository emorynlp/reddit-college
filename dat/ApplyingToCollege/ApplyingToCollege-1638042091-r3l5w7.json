  "title:": "The financial aid process is worse than applying to college",
  "text": "Title says it all. Getting into the universities I\u2019ve applied to has been breezy (obviously not a T20 applicant lol) but getting response back for financial aid has been insane. FAFSA was/is a trip, financial aid applications are tedious, and theres no expected date for when my aid packages will come in. I\u2019d write a thousand more essays on why i\u2019m fit for uni if i could get my dang financial aid package.",
