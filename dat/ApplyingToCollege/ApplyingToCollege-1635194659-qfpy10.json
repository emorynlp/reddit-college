      "text": "Pleaseee don't force a metaphor unless it's going to add something to the essay. A Metaphor that adds something: \"Hope is the thing with feathers / that perches in the soul / that sings the tune without the words / and never stops at all.\" By implying via metaphor that hope is a sort of bird, it's automatically imbued with a sense of lightness, beauty, grace, agility, etc. The metaphor here links two ideas without having to explain that hope is beautiful. It adds something to the idea of hope!\n\nAvoid [dead metaphors!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_metaphor) Not just the actual phrasing but imbuing your entire essay with a dead metaphor! A good metaphor is greater than the sum of its parts. If you are finding yourself having to contrive a good figure of speech to just add spice to your common app, chances are it will come across just like that--contrived--and probably a waste of words.",
