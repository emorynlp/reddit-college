Some people (looks at some former high school classmates) want to brag, but don't want to get called out and end up playing coy, which...is often worse. \n\nAnd even the non-braggy people can get some cognitive dissonance. The majority of people do work very, very hard in some way. When you haven't made it yet, it's easy to push yourself as a genuine person and hard worker who deserves success as much as the lucky kid who got into Stanford or wherever. But when you *are* that kid who got into HYPSM+, you eventually realize that there are many people who put in just as much work, but didn't get the same results (whether it's because of socioeconomic factors, intellect, luck, etc). Some people just shrug and go okay well, I'm thankful I'm here, but others like thinking of themselves are the hardworking everyman and don't take well to their new status.\n\nYou do make a good point, though. A lot of these kids probably do want to make sure others don't feel bad, but that takes a bit of finessing. Quite a few Harvard people start off saying, \"I go to school in Boston\" until they realize that draws more attention to their university than just \"I go to Harvard.\"",

Depending on who you ask, even being highly intelligent is also a privilege. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with taking these opportunities or doing well. But it's highly disingenuous to pretend that you're just a normal kid who still somehow got into a top school. These people would be much better received if they just stated their accomplishments instead of playing coy.  \n\nNow, of course people can have impostor syndrome and struggle with motivation, but it takes a special kind of self-unaware to talk 1% stats and creme de la creme internships and then in the next breath downplay it like it's nothing. Heck, I'd say that's less humble than just saying it outright. Sort of like \"I go to school in Boston\" versus \"I go to Harvard\". \n\n>Kiddo\n\n>jealous\n\nLOL",

There aren't many of them.\n\n * [I Viewed My College Admissions Files - University of Michigan Decision Reaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bki2hKMRIjk&list=PLFk4Q77MC8nd6jgqvsmzNBTfxkiwz-zOZ&index=9&t=1s) \n\n * [What I Learned from Viewing My Admissions File](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sy2Ow7ZSl8&list=PLFk4Q77MC8nd6jgqvsmzNBTfxkiwz-zOZ&index=10) (Dartmouth)\n\nThere are probably a half dozen more decent ones out there online. Those are two that I found gave me some insight into the actual process. Three nuggets I remember is that the first one, who was applying for business school, got dinged for not being socially conscious enough in his essays (but still got in), and that Dartmouth both decided some of her extracurriculars didn't count as separate extracurriculars (the second one, she filled in ten and they only counted seven, deleting National Honors Society and an activity she only did freshman year and, ironically, her YouTube channel) and that they made a specific note that she had the highest GPA they'd ever seen from her high school\u2014not just that year, but ever. It's also a good reminder of how schools tend to quantify academics and (ideally) put them in the context of a student's high school.\n\nSo basically, it's not what the students say that's interesting\u2014they don't have a ton more insight into ho decisions were made at the end of senior year than the beginning. What's useful is when they actual quote the admissions officers.",

I don\u2018t know but it sometimes sounds like they think that people who get rejected aren\u2018t qualified, but that\u2018s definetly not true. There are so many qualified people that don\u2018t get in simply because the school doesn\u2018t have enough spots. Just because you get rejected it doesn\u2018t mean you wouldn\u2018t fit into the student body of a university",
