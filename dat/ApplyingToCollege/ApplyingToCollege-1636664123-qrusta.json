      "text": "For merit scholarships, typically you won't be sure until you actually get the award. Big exception, automatic merit. Look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/; see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family.\n\nFor need-based aid. run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.)\n\nFederal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow. Larger loans require a parent signature and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow.",

      "text": ">How do you know how much each college will cost after aid, scholarships, grants etc?\n\nYou can't know, usually, until you get your acceptance (and often not even then; they may give you more money if you wait.)  In some cases schools will have guaranteed merit scholarships; if you meet the qualifications for those then you can bank on that money.  Can also use schools' Net Price Calculators.  Those usually give a pretty good estimate of how much financial aid you're likely to receive.",

      "text": "The financial aid package that the school sends is the only definite answer. \n\nFrom what I understand what you might also want to do is search online for a financial aid spreadsheet that helps clarify what kind of aid is a loan and what is money you don't have to pay back. There is no standard financial aid award letter and it can be challenging to determine what's free money and what's a loan.\n\nMaybe someone here has one they can share; I've seen them around but can't remember what websites had good ones.",
