  "text": "During high school, I decided to only do a sport and a small school club since I did not know better. I also do not have any volunteer hours. I have a 3.8 GPA and a 1350 SAT, so I would consider myself an average to below average student. How hard will it be for me to get into decent universities, if possible at all? Thanks for reading.",
