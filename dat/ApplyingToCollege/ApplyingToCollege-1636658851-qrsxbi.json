It\u2019s childish as hell, especially considering that we have one of the best Physics, hospitality, history, ornithology, math, vet, architecture, etc. programs. Each of the Ivys excel at certain things and everyone at these schools know that.\n\nNo offense, but are you just talking out of your ass? Do you go to any of these schools to actually have a sense of any of this? Also, I can almost guarantee you that no one at Columbia cares about \u201cHYPS\u201d lol. That\u2019s high school talk and people who go to Columbia love NYC and won\u2019t have it any other way.",
