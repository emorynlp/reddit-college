  "title:": "Is there any substitute for high school Maths course",
  "text": "Hello, I am applying to US colleges for fall 2022. My chosen major is Computer Science ( BS CS). Every university I am applying to requires atleast 3 years of Math in high school. However, I only have 2 years of Math. I have taken SAT-I and SAT-II. My scores are\nSAT-I : 1430, reading : 630, Math : 800\nSAT-II : 760/800\nIs it possible to use SAT scores as an alternate for high school math course?\nOr \nIs there any online high school where I could enroll and complete the course in a month?\nOr\nIf I take high school maths now( exams will be conducted in May 2022), will the university accept this option and conditionally admit me?\nOr\nCan I take an extra math course after enrolling in university just to satisfy the requirement?\n\nIf there is any other option you have, please inform me.\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!!!!!.",

A local community college class would work too.\n\nA high school class now would certainly work if available - you don't need to have it completed by the application date if you are currently taking the course.  You just need it done before you would start in the fall.",

Yes.\n\nThis is standard for domestic students  -- a not especially selective school like ASU still requires four years of english, four years math, etc.  You apply for college during your senior year, when the fourth year wouldn't have been completed at time of application.\n\nI haven't looked at the common app for a year (when one of my kids applied), so I don't know how they capture your current classes.",

The four years is just the default method to meet their core competency requirement, but your SAT score will meet it.\n\n[https://admission.asu.edu/first-year/competency-requirements](https://admission.asu.edu/first-year/competency-requirements)\n\nSimilarly, if you aren't taking a math class because you exhausted what was available through your school or something like that you are probably fine - just email the school's admissions office to confirm.",
