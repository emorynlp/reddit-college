      "text": "in terms of sheer writing quality my sister is self-admittedly \u201cnot the best writer,\u201d but she got into ucla (and 3 others) and waitlisted at berkeley. however, she showed a lot of passion and reflection in her essays, which definitely helped get her in, on top of strong grades and ECs.\n\nthe UC PIQs are not meant to test your writing abilities, but to give AOs insight into you as a person (hence \u201cPIQ\u201d). you don\u2019t have to be a stellar writer, but as long as you\u2019re reflecting thoughtfully you shouldn\u2019t have a lot to worry about.\n\ngood luck! hope we all get into our dream UCs! \ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc99",
