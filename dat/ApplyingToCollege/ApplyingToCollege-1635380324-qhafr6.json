  "text": "I'm a junior this year trying to figure out  what schools to apply to in the fall. I'm a female from PA looking to study computer engineering. Preferably a school with like 5,000-15,000 undergrads. 4.0 gpa, 1500+ SAT, solid EC's (president of multiple clubs, qualified for states in FBLA and TSA, national qualifier for FBLA). I just don't know what schools would be the best fit. Some I've looked at are CMU, RIT, and UPenn. What others should I consider?",

Finding fit can be hard, but those are all good to excellent programs around the size you are looking for.\n\nIt's a lot smaller, but I might throw in Harvey Mudd too - it's an excellent school and the Claremont colleges as a whole would be in the size range you are looking at.",

Also, some of our professors are offering sample classes for high school students this fall. Each one is just one hour on a particular weeknight about a particular topic. I recommend you check out the sample classes on Art of Algorithms and Computer Vision. There\u2019s also a session focused on celebrating opportunities for women in engineering. All details here: ecs.syr.edu/virtual\n\nAlso, are you Wawa part of PA or Sheetz part of PA??",
