  "text": "This university is not that good in the program I want to do, and I can go to much better colleges. (This college ranked at 105 on the field I want to do while I can go to some colleges ranked 50 in that field) They offered some scholarships and said I could do the research program and finish my MS in 4 years. \n\nAnd personally, I do not want to live with my parents during my college - that is, I want to leave the town. But this is that big a deal.\n\nI do not know what I should do. If the ED accepts me, I will definitely go to that college. But if not, I am not sure if I should stay local or not.",
