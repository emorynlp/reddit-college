      "text": "No, UMD does not require all scores. You are fine.\n\nWhen College Board \"sends\" a score, it deposits the score report in the college's account. Then, colleges download score reports from their account in batches on some regular schedule. There may be additional processing steps that need to occur on the college's end before the portal shows that the score was received. I would wait a few more days, at the very least, before asking UMD why your portal hasn't updated.",

However I just checked my portal this morning and it says that they received my scores and that my application is complete, so don\u2019t stress too much. They likely have already received them or will receive them very soon.",
