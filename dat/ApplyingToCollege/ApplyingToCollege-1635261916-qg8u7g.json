  "text": "Hi! Is WashU a good university to ED into?I wish to major in Physics (and probably a minor in Philosophy)\n\nAnd, by 'good', I don't mean to sound weird or anything. I know a college cannot be good or bad and all. I just want to hear some opinions and experiences of people.\n\nAnd, I heard that they are going need-blind for all the students, so I find that great as well.\n\n(remember --- physics major)\n\nAlso, please, don't mention ECs, grades and stuff. I don't want to talk about those, I just want to know about washu\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(And, I often receive mail from them that they want me to apply, is it common? it is I know, but...you know...)\n\n&#x200B;",

Since you will want to do grad-school you want to do research with faculty and should make sure that their physics/astronomy department is doing research in things that you are interested in. Schools that aren\u2019t particularly exceptional tend to focus on one or two particular areas to concentrate research.",
