      "text": "Major is super important to your CSU admission because they take all the applicants for each major and choose enough of the top students to fill all the spots for that major assuming normal acceptance rates. It\u2019s much harder to get in for CS or nursing than sociology. It generally works something like this: https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/freshmen-impaction-results/index.php\n\nYou can change majors after being accepted although it might require a lot of effort (good grades and hard classes) to prove you should be admitted to a very impacted major like CS or engineering. Switching from business management to sociology on the other hand is easy.\n\nOne great thing about CSU schools is they can help you develop in demand skill sets for jobs like accounting or HR or software engineering or teaching. You don\u2019t have to choose permanently now but be thinking about your career path. There\u2019s a great website that can help you look at expected demand, pay, and education needed for lots of jobs. It\u2019s www.onetonline.org",

              "text": "You can. I don\u2019t know what point total that would require though. You can also pick one of the majors with a lower required point total. I\u2019m betting that the relative difficulty of those different majors will be similar at other CSUs.\n\nIf you really don\u2019t know what you want maybe also consider figuring that out at a community college which is practically free here in Cali. That can cut the cost of college in half and set you up to go anywhere from Berkeley to CSUCI on the beach when you do decide what you want. And you can have guaranteed admission to a lot of universities through the UC TAG system and similar programs at the CSU. https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/transfer-requirements/uc-transfer-programs/transfer-admission-guarantee-tag.html",
