      "text": "> I'm afraid I am going to get rejected from my film school because I'm not good enough.\n\nI find it helps to remember that you don't get rejected because you aren't good enough, you get rejected due to a ton of other factors. \n\nHow many people applied this year? Did you know this year there are a lot of people who deferred last year because of COVID? That has nothing to do with you. \n\nWhat if this year they had a crazy strong applicant pool? \n\nWhat if you were asking for more financial aid than they'd prefer to give and someone else wants to pay full price? \n\n>If I do get accepted and I go for film, what happens after college?\n\nThat's entirely up to you. Granted, that can be scary, but it's also kind of exciting and liberating. Maybe you do your own thing, maybe you find a job, maybe you freelance for others. \n\n>What if I don't get a job in the industry bc there is an 80% chance that will happen, and then I'll be in debt\n\nI don't know what your university list is like, and I know not all debt is avoidable, but I would strive to work part-time while studying at a school that won't leave me in debt.\n\n>and wasted years\n\nOdds are you're going to live to 100. Four years of your life is nothing. And it's not a waste! You'll have lived and learned, gained experience and prepared yourself for future ventures. Even if you don't get the exact outcome you hoped for, it isn't a waste. It never is.\n\n> I don't think my parents have faith in me either.\n\nFuck em. Your parents' opinion ain't worth shit. There's no license to be a parent, no special test they had to take. They're as unqualified as you are in that regard. If you have faith in yourself, that's all that matters.",

Your life is never wasted, you are constantly learning and getting better as a human being and as life long learner. You will do incredible things within your life and you will remember these days in which you struggled to get where you are in the future. Never give up, give it everything you got, stress every limit to grab what you want and take it. The world is yours, if you are willing to stand up to it and take what you want.",
