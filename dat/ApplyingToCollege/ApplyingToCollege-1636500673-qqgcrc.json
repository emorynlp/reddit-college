  "text": "Ok this is a big request but I\u2019m looking for colleges that are OOS, that aren\u2019t super selective and give good financial aid either through need based aid or scholarships. I know with out of state students, public schools tend to just give merit scholarships and the financial aid isn\u2019t great. And private schools are better at finding need based aid. But i\u2019m in a weird spot cause I don\u2019t think I have amazing things in my application for me to go to a selective private school to get really good financial aid. But also, I do like public schools out of state but I know I won\u2019t get much money. Idk at this point. (From Maryland btw)",

They have a health science program with low OOS tuition and part of CUNY which means you can take courses at other CUNY campuses across NYC. \nIf you want to try apply or transfer to a private east coast uni try NYU. It\u2019s an awesome school and the financial aid is spectacular!",
