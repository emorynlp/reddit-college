  "text": "I'm a grade 12 student in Alberta, I'm currently applying to universities in British Columbia and Ontario. The application process on the websites and various common applications do not require me to upload any transcripts; I just don't understand how they will receive my grades. My guidance counselor doesn't know how to help me because I'm seeking universities outside of Alberta, and nothing on any website tells me what to do. Anyone have the answer?",

          "text": "First of all, I figured out how to send transcripts. There's a service called myPass and there's a service where I just tell Alberta Education to send the transcript directly to the university I am applying to. However, I still have two questions:\n\n1. How will the universities request my transcript? Via email, or what?\n2. When should I send my transcript, if the university does not request it?\n\nSide question since you were in my current situation: What university did you end up going to/what advice do you have for me?",

Or do I have to send it once now, once at the end of this semester, and another time at the end of the second?",

They usually hold off on accepting high schoolers until mid year grades are in. \n\nGood rule of thumb: don\u2019t send anything until they specifically ask you to, in the format they ask you to. Every school has a different process. Some will accept self reported grades, others want uploads or emailed copies or original trx mailed to them. You can end up wasting time and money if you rush and don\u2019t follow their instructions.",
