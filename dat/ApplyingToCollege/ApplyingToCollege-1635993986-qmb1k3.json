  "text": "I applied to Emory ED a few days ago. Without knowing, I submitted FAFSA thinking it is a different thing with \"Financial aid\" mentioned in the common app question(i put \"no\" for financial aid). After getting emails from the Office of Financial Aid for more paperwork. Searching around now, I discovered that FAFSA is also included in Financial aid. I heard that even tho it's a need-blind college, look if I'm applying to Financial aid or not. Since Emory is my reach school, I didn't want to apply for Financial aid that could disadvantage my admission. What should I do? is there any way to recall it? I was only planning to apply for government aid(FAFSA), thinking that college wouldn't know and affect my admission. Can anyone give some advice?",
