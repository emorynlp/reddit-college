  "text": "My friends and I were reminiscing our earlier years in high school the other day (you know, like good ol' seniors do) and I just realized how *happy* I am with how I spent my high school life. \n\nI was never the best in any of my classes but I did well enough that I never needed to stress over my grades. I joined organizations that I actually liked and got to do some pretty fun things with people that I legitimately enjoyed spending time with. I let myself fall in and out of love with some wonderful people who, despite breaking up with them, are still some of my closest friends.\n\nI've gone to my fair share of parties, done some pretty embarrassing things, and I've had loads of fun.\n\nI really only started remotely thinking about college last summer (the summer before my senior year). I was lucky enough to have an admissions counselor who helped me workshop my essays, build my college list, and figure out what I wanted to major in. \n\nGranted, there were a few times when I thought that *maybe* listing down all my extracurriculars earlier would have helped me make my resume, or *maybe* paying more attention to my experiences would have decreased the number of emotional breakthroughs I had to have while doing my personal statement but, overall, I have no regrets with how I've spent my high school days.\n\nEven if I don't get into my dream college (or any college for that matter), I'm still gonna be happy with what I've done. If that's not good enough for any of the schools I'm applying to, then maybe college just isn't meant for me.\n\nThis got a little rambly but, basically, just do what makes you happy and what you know you'll be proud of. Living your life with the sole purpose of filling up a CV may seem like the practical thing to do\u2014but you've gotta remember that life exists for you to actually live. So do what you want with it.",

I spent HS learning about myself and making connections with so many awesome folks within school and the community. I\u2019m really glad that I did it this way. \n\nGood luck to you on the admissions process, broski!",
