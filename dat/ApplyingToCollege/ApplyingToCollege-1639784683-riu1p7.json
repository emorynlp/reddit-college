      "text": "At first my parents wanted me to get into a t25 college and if I did that then they would pay for my college tuition. They wanted me to attend a college that was t25 for a certain major. For some time, I was just choosing schools for them and then eventually I started to look for schools for myself. What I mean is that I want to attend a t25 school. Like it took some time but now I want to do it for myself and not for them or the college tuition. I am gonna spend the next four years at a college so I should make sure I am happy to go there and they will give me some of the best education. So in a way I am doing it for my parents but mostly for myself.",
