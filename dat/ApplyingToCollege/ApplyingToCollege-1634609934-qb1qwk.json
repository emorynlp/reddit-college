  "text": "I attended an overnight camp this summer. Can I realistically say on my Common App that I spent 120 hours on it for 1 week during school break? I'm not really sure how to count the hours for that, since I was there for 5 or 6 days straight. It truly was 120+ hours but that just sounds like a lot.",
