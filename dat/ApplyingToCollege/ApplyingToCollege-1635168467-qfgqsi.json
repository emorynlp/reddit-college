My mental health plummeted, and with ADHD it made it so hard to focus at home. Do schools actually take Covid into account when considering who they accept?",

      "text": "Colleges know there was a pandemic and that some kids struggled more than others. Does that mean you'll get into Harvard with a 2.7? No, but many AOs will look at more than just your 11th grade GPA to see what you might be capable of. \n\nSome EA/ED schools might defer a decision until after your first semester senior grades, so do your best now that you're back in person.\n\nTry not to stress about it.",
