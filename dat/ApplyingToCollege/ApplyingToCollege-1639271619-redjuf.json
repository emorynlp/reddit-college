I think it's one of the most flexible in terms of requirements and this semester it's been pretty manageable. There are some courses that are harder than others, but a lot of that is my decision to take harder classes than I should have, which I was advised against. Most of the pressure was my own making, but I think if you talk to other people and your advisor you'd avoid having any real problems.",

If you get in I'm sure you'll like it here and find a community that works for you, but if not there are plenty of other schools that are just as good and can give you the same education and opportunities. Good luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: forgot the obligatory having to explain to people its not penn state",

I used this one to try and get away from academics and poli sci because I felt pretty much all the rest of my application focused on it.",
