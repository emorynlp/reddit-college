  "text": "When I joined this sub, I honestly started panicking. It seemed like everyone had published research or medaled in some sort of olympiad. My stats that once seemed like a great accomplishment seemed fairly average, and my ECs of a sport and involvement in a couple clubs seemed laughable. Well, today I got into a T10. I just wanted to say that I think the people that have these achievements are amazing, but the number of kids that have these accomplishments is very small. It is possible to be an average kid and get into your dream school :)\n\nedit: thanks for the awards!",

      "text": "A pet theory of mine is that this sub causes people to wildly overestimate what good ecs are. What AOs are really looking for is someone who takes full advantage of what's available to them. Many of the people on this sub go to super competitive highschools and/or live in well off areas, and naturally, have a lot of opportunities available to them as a result. If they don't capitalize on those resources, it can be a detriment to their application. This leads to the nonprofit/research rat race.\n\nOn the other hand, applicants from more \"normal\" areas who do \"normal\" things can end up doing very well in the admissions process if they made the best of the hand dealt them. But because this sub is self selecting for the competitive types, it creates the illusion that crazy ecs are needed to get into good schools.",

Admittedly, I fell off the deep end my junior year, but I worked hard my first semester senior year and studied for the SAT well enough to meet the standard for the school I applied to. Still, academically I could have done better, and given the fact that my high school has a 3/10 rating and one of the lowest in the state, things didn\u2019t look all that great for me. But I had 4 different leadership positions in two of my school\u2019s fine arts programs through the years, and produced 6 short films. I took advantage of the programs in my reach and ultimately, that ended up saving my butt",

This year I was talking to some seniors who just do 2-3 normal clubs (1-no leadership positions) and then a sport, and they were getting into pretty good schools. UNC out of state, Michigan, Northwestern ED, USC merit, Duke ED, etc. I was so surprised because being on this sub has kinda hardwired me in a way of thinking everyone had to have these crazy extracurriculars. \n\nThe people at my school were just normal kids and as we don\u2019t have a ton of opportunities they still got into amazing schools. I know some applied to ivies and I\u2019m not sure what will happen with that, but it seems to be working at much better than I would have predicted for them! Context is everything.",

I'm a second year college student (it's been so long since I've frequent this sub it's bittersweet) who got into a top private LAC with \"below average states\" relatively.

Compared to my big, texas public school friends I grew up with, my stats would sit me at a comfortable 70 percentile (top 30% percent?!)  in a class of like 1200 kids.\n\nI was the ONLY kid I knew in my whole district, my highschool and surrounding highschools, who knew about r/A2C. In fact, I rarely met anyone else during HS who even browsed reddit and admitted to it to other people. \n\nThis community is like the top of the top of the top. Don't sweat anything or doubt yourselves. If you're going to REDDIT for college advice, your already asking things the majority of high schoolers won't even know where to begin. Let's be honest, lots of (public) high schoolers would rarely even see their assigned guidance counselors senior year for whatever reasons.",

It was different at my small school, my counselor knew everyone by name and we bugged that person with everything; even asked to go to the bathroom and then just chill with them in their office. \n\nOn the contrast, my sister's big 3000+ student HS had like 10+ counselors spread across the grades and split up their assigned students by alphabetical order last name. Even then, my sister and so many of her friends say they don't even know who their counselor is not have talked to them. It's understandable with such large numbers that the bureaucratic organization gets all grey, but damn it's tough. Not only that, she said all the counselors only advise the local community college or state schools because it's convenient, no matter what a person's stats and potential is lol. I was told by her that no one was ever advised to go out of state, which is stupid",

I probably shouldn't have commented with my stats because they're not particularly relevant.

I don't mean to be blunt, I think you should take credit for your brilliance. But the only one really surprised by your acceptance might just have been you. If this were a chance me, I think you'd get rated pretty highly. and your not really a success story for average applicants, just hard work and dedication to get where you got.

      "text": "As a barely above average student, with basically no ECs, just a part-time attendee at one club and I ran Cross Country for one season (would have done more but I need to make money so I work most hours that I\u2019m not at school), I got into a T20, mostly thanks to a killer essay. Joining this sub made me feel like I was going to be unable to get anywhere, but that\u2019s just not true. The effort that you put into your work, including the hours you hold at a part-time job, is worth something. You don\u2019t need ten million clubs, or twenty  published papers to achieve and to get into a solid, great school.",
