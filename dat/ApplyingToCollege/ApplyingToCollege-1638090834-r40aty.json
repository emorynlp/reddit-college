  "text": "I applied Yale REA and got an interview offer from the regional interview manager this week, and I was informed that interviews would be offered up until December 8th. My actual interviewer has not yet reached out for a date and time for my interview.\n\nI heard that most colleges try to complete their admission decisions at least one or two weeks prior to decision releasing dates. I\u2019m probably reading too much into this, but does it mean this is just a throwaway interview that won\u2019t even be considered for my application since Yale decisions come out December 15th (just a week before the supposed deadline for my interview).\n\nThanks in advance and I hope everyone\u2019s admissions processes are going smoothly!",
