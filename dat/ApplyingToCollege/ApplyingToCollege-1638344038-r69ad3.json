  "text": "Hey,\n\nI am an Indian student studying in Grade 12 in a CBSE school. If someone could verify if the academic history part of my application (screenshots attached) to University of California is correct, it would be great.\n\nQuestions\n\n1. My main confusion is if the subject area/course category is filled correctly or not. For example, in Grade 12 is my course category for Maths Integrated Math 3 or Advanced Mathematics?\n2. In my high school transcripts, both number grades and letter grades are present. Which should I enter/ has higher preference?\n\nIn Grade 9 and 10, I took  \nEnglish,   \nMath,   \nScience - Theory, \n\nFrench, \n\nSocial Studies.\n\nIn Grade 11 and 12, I took\n\nEnglish Core, \n\nMath,   \nPhysics,   \nChemistry,   \nComputer Science.\n\nContext:\n\nI'm new to Reddit. I thought I was done with my UC apps but today while reviewing my counselor called and she said she ain't sure of the academic history part which she herself had said was right just a month ago.\n\nI attempted calling the number to UC but I have been waiting for nearly an hour for someone to pick up. The deadline for the application is Dec 1, 11:59PST.\n\n[Grade 12 \\(Predicted\\)](https://preview.redd.it/h1bw34dpwv281.jpg?width=762&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=561e8085c9d3f11d40527365713c298ee16d788f)\n\n[Grade 11](https://preview.redd.it/ii0404dpwv281.jpg?width=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f48532157cff7f07cce5ba8d2b35d354cd4a75e2)\n\n[Grade 10](https://preview.redd.it/p1j3zzcpwv281.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8bc214ed8be71942a0975f53567b7c5df3154706)\n\n[Grade 9](https://preview.redd.it/ko4as3dpwv281.jpg?width=733&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b2f26b1defdf7453e4bb2e55176557219866b6b1)",
