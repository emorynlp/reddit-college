  "title:": "Is it weird that I don't really want to share my acceptance with others?",
  "text": "I've always wondered if other people felt the same way, but wherever I get accepted, I don't really want to share it with anyone. Yeah, I'll tell my family, but it makes me internally cringe to wear college merch or plaster it on social media. I'm not knocking down other people who do this, but personally wearing a college sweater right after acceptance feels like you're wearing a target on your chest where people are invited to speculate how you got in and in which circumstances.\n\nDo other people feel like this? There's also another explanation where I don't want to give others the satisfaction of knowing what I've worked 5 plus years for. In some twisted way if I share my decision outside of my family it feels like I've done this whole thing for them. Maybe being raised in a hyper-competitive atmosphere has done this to me, but it also feels like if I externally share it, I've done this whole process for them, rather than myself.\n\nI've been having this kinda weird thought for a long time. Somehow it feels like pre-imposter syndrome where I'm scared others will label me a certain way. Dunno, thoughts?",

      "text": "I feel the same exact way. To be honest, I feel like it\u2019s because of the shame that I\u2019ll feel if I don\u2019t get into the top schools that others get into. And yes, I\u2019m aware that prestige doesn\u2019t mean everything. For some reason, I just can\u2019t let go of the fact that I might be seen as inferior if I don\u2019t get into certain schools. If I don\u2019t share acceptance information with others, I honestly don\u2019t think it would change much. I feel like people would just assume I don\u2019t want to share because I didn\u2019t get in. I just hate the overall culture around this type of stuff.",

It\u2019s the same when it comes to grades.. it\u2019s so frustrating when people ask for your grade and you don\u2019t want to reply so that you don\u2019t indulge their curiosity. But the culture just makes it seem like your silence has a negative connotation behind it. Like Silence = bad grade..",

      "text": "I\u2019ve heard this a lot honestly. For me it depended on the person. I was actually more comfortable telling less close friends about certain rejections / places I applied to because I feel like they wouldn\u2019t judge as much whereas my closer ones would have higher expectations. Also I didn\u2019t mention rejections to a lot of my relatives- I knew there would be some that would pretend to feel bad but in a condescending way, or there would be others that would be disappointed because they don\u2019t understand the app process and thought it\u2019d be easy to get in based on grades / scores alone.",
