She endures the same housing situation, deals with the same tsunami of homework assignments, and (from what I can tell) has a college experience that\u2019s indistinguishable from that of her peers.\n\nIf you were to meet her in class you\u2019d think that she was just another tired college student trying to make it through their day. \n\nDo professors treat her differently? I wouldn\u2019t know. But it seems like college is one of the few places where the playing field is even (or at least much more even than usual). And I\u2019d bet that professors have seen so many prodigies (and children of famous people) that they don\u2019t care about who she is in the slightest (as it should be).\n\nAfter a while you realize that people are people, regardless of how they grew up or where they come from. And I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like navigating college with the additional pressure/burden of being \u201cBill Gates\u2019s daughter...\u201d",
