  "text": "I\u2019m just curious, for your applications who did you let read your essay/supplements? Personally I only let my girlfriend and English teacher read them. My parents were begging to read them but I was like embarrassed to show them idk why. I guess it\u2019s because I mention them in my stuff so I just didn\u2019t want them to see it. Did anyone else not let their parents see even though they were persistent",
