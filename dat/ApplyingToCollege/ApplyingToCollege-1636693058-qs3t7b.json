  "text": "The common app adds this automatic spacing between paragraphs and I didn't know. So when it came to my pdf review, I saw these huge gaps between my paragraphs but I j thought that was standard and submitted it. Looking back it now, it really does disrupt the flow of the essay. Could I re-upload my essays (properly formatted) onto the application portal directly? Should I contact admissions before I do this?",
