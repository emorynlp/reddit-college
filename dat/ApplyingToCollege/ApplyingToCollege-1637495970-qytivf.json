  "text": "Hey guys\n\nI got a lil bit confused over the interviews options of URochester. They kinda have two options: \u201calumni interview\u201d and \u201cvirtual interview\u201d. The latter is with admission team representatives. \n\nWhich option do you think is better? Both are available at the moment so I am a bit confused with which one I am supposed to register to?\n\nThanks in advance :)",
