  "text": "lots of things I see on this sub are very unsettling to me as a normal, low middle class black guy applying to college among the lot of you. \n\nyou lot utilize black lives for your advantage by creating a BLM club after what has occurred in may/june for to \u201cuplift black voices\u201d at your private schools with a 2% black population. \n\nyou lot are putting that you\u2019re black in college applications for some \u201cadvantage\u201d but will never in your lives endure the ugly that comes with the black experience of life. all while shutting out REAL black students in the process. \n\nyou lot go about your day to day lives making a mockery and enabling what\u2019s ugly about the truth that is black life but will never acknowledge how you people use blackness as a stepping stool to your material successes. you people are no better than the performative capitalists that y\u2019all diss on this sub. \n\nplease. if you don\u2019t find yourself engaging with black people healthily without any selfish intention, stay out of black people\u2019s business. those of you who are actively behaving with such motives, life will come at you promptly. if you feel targeted by this then maybe you are the problem. \n\nthis morality goes beyond college admissions, if you didn\u2019t catch on. \n\ntldr: stop objectifying blackness for your personal gain.\n\nedit 1: thanks a ton for all of these awards! \n\nedit 2: when I say \u201cyou lot\u201d I don\u2019t mean the vast majority of the sub obviously! \u201cyou lot\u201d is as in \u201cy\u2019all that partake in this activity.\u201d a lot of people in this sub are intelligent to know what\u2019s right, but there always the few that are...yea. sorry if my dialect threw y\u2019all off hhhh.\n\nedit 3: I\u2019ve been getting a lot of touching private messages from black redditors in this sub and I want to emphasize that there is enough of us to find each other and relate to one another! it\u2019s sad hearing from some that this is the first time they feel so heard on a post in here. link up in the PMs or something!!! (ps the guy that sent me a de@th wish, ily \ud83d\ude18)",

This sentiment is pretty common in the district I attended HS in (demographics similar to this subreddit) and one girl who got into Stanford got flamed to hell and back for being URM. Like seriously, so what? Getting into Stanford is a pretty big achievement, fuck off and let her have the time of day regardless of what they believe about the inclusion of \\*\\*, these people flaming her I can say for sure weren't qualified to get in anyways having done basically no ECs and taken non-rigorous courseloads (all of which were lesser than her achievements); they got rejected because they're fuckin' bad LOL",

I have seen 0 people on here talking about a BLM club they started while not being black? most A2C members seem to stand heavily against anyone who fakes their race/background for admissions. feel free to prove me wrong I just haven't seen it personally",

      "text": "thank you for saying this. honestly, i would be more sympathetic to ORMs concerns more if the conversation didn\u2019t tend to imply that URMs are less qualified and that our ethnicity is our only redeeming quality in the college applications process \ud83d\ude10\n\nit\u2019s dehumanizing and gross. people with high stats get rejected over people with lower stats and vice versa *all the time!* yet the issue is exaggerated when a Black person or non-white Latino is involved???!!!??\n\nit\u2019s really annoying cause it\u2019s got people at my school really getting bold saying to my face that I\u2019m lucky I\u2019m Black cause I have a higher chance of getting into college (????) and how I don\u2019t have to get high scores (????).... and they also fail to acknowledge all my accomplishments in high school. To be honest that\u2019s not their fault cause I don\u2019t fw 97% of my class, but really?? You\u2019re going to brush over the fact that I\u2019m second in command of our JROTC battalion, a drill team commander, and I\u2019ve led our team to be T20 ranked nationally??? Really?? \n\nBut sure, I\u2019ll get into college because I\u2019m Black. This guy in my English class last year wholeheartedly gave a speech about how ** should be abolished and how as an Asian male, he\u2019s brutally discriminated in the college applications process, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s going to have a harder time getting into Harvard. Yes. It was just as tone deaf as it sounds. \n\nLike get out of here bruh.",

          "text": "honestly the whole \"you just got into a top university because you're Black\" feels like just another way to tear down Black accomplishments. It always sounds like it's implying that Black people wouldn't be able to get into college without their race/are less smart and it rubs me the wrong way. I've heard dozens of people voice this to me before. \n\nI'm so sorry that people at your school are saying that to you and thanks for bringing some of this up, I never noticed before how people would always claim that Black students at highly selective colleges only got in for diversity points. As if some of these colleges aren't so selective that they anyone who gets in has to be highly qualified in their right. And the lying about your race thing is fucking disgusting and it sucks that some people would do that in the college admissions process",
