  "text": "Hey there guys. I took my TOEFL on 21st and I\u2019m scared that it might not reach USC\u2019s admission officers by the deadline. If it doesn\u2019t reach, will my application not be considered? I\u2019m waiting for my TOEFL scores to arrive. As soon as it comes in, I\u2019ll self-report in common app and submit the application.",
