Look it up for the specific ones you are interested in applying to. \n\nPersonally, I can say that my college barely accepts any AP credit for actual courses, and pretty much only 5s are accepted for general credit (and using APs for general credit is also capped).",

A CS major at Columbia would still need to take the necessary credits to graduate, \n\nBut sure, there are probably some colleges which allow you to apply AP CS credits to the major.",
