Should I leave it as \"depression and suicidal thoughts\"? Should I not mention the scary S word at all, and keep it at depression?",

      "text": "First, I'm sorry you went through this, and I hope you are in a better headspace now. With that said, I am just a high school student, so take all of the following advice with a grain of salt. I think sticking to \"depression and suicidal thoughts\" is better than going into the details. Your words will be better saved to explain how this affected your academic performance and what you are doing differently now. I think the details are not necessary for the AO to understand the situation. Again, just my thoughts on this.",

I would stick with floating around the issue and maybe talk about struggling with your mental health. I recommend making it clear that this strongly impacted your state of mind and was a barrier to performing your best, but you have since found ways to bounce back and back that up with your senior year grades. To me, that shows you have faced challenges in your life, but you also know how to overcome them and therefore will be a resilient student in college.",
