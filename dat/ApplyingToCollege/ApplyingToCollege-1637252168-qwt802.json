USC\u2019s DPS is one of America\u2019s largest campus security system. They\u2019ve got really tight security on campus and they even have campus security for a 2 mile radius around campus too so your pretty safe within that area. But like most places, it\u2019s better to go outside of campus in a group and be aware of your surroundings.",

We have a ton of blue lights that extend well beyond campus and our PD is on every corner usually, even more so nowadays. We also have a  ton of shuttles that run all day around the neighborhood, and the university gives us 10 free lyfts per month which is more than enough usually. It isn\u2019t perfect, and obviously crime can be unpredictable (In general, robberies in broad daylight, even though security is less strict, are pretty unheard of around here), but I like to think the university does a decent enough job at protecting us and giving us tools to keep ourselves safe. That said it could definitely be better and I agree with all of the extra measures people here are calling for in light of what\u2019s happened. I\u2019ve been to USC to visit friends a ton and, through talking with them about what\u2019s going on, I\u2019d say what you have is pretty similar to what we have.",

Yes, you need to be careful with monitoring your personal property, but most crime is theft, rather than violence and they are predominantly crimes of opportunity. If you act responsible and aware of your surroundings, you will be perfectly safe 99.9% of the time. You can become a victim of violent crime in a frat house, dorm room, apartment, or anywhere else, since most violent crimes are committed against personal acquaintances.",
