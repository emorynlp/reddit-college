  "text": "So I was rereading my Princeton app that I submitted yesterday and realized that I confused concentrations and certificates. I accidentally said that I want to pursue a concentration in (a certificate program) in my why Princeton essay. \n\nWorth noting that Princeton calls its majors concentrations and that it asked to name what majors and certificates I\u2019m interested in the next question with a drop down menu and I did list everything correctly.",
