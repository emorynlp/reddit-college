  "text": "It\u2019s not the rejection that hurts. I was actually ok. But it\u2019s seeing other people get in and wondering where I wasn\u2019t enough. I mean\u2026people say that the application process is volatile, that your worth isn\u2019t defined by where you are admitted. But no one says that to people who are admitted. I say all the time self-worth is only defined by yourself, but it\u2019s hard when the only things in life that are quantifiable, measurable, are the things that can be put on paper. \n\nAll I can do right now is cry and write. People say that it's not the end of the world, that the sun will rise again tomorrow. But in a way, that's what hurts the most. \n\n(Yale for anyone wondering)",

      "text": "when i was rejected a couple of days ago,I was heart broken(still am) and my parents and siblings were like dw u have another chance etc, but tbh I didn't want to talk abt my rejection to anyone, it feels so bad, telling sb that I didn't get in. It hurts too  much to even explain but we have to move on cuz we have RD. Cry for a day or two but then get back to bussiness",

          "text": "Yeah :( Same. In a way, this gives me perspective. Tons of kids at my school got decisions before me, and for some of my friends that didn't get in, I was like your parents and siblings but I don't think I could truly get what they were feeling. If I was accepted I still wouldn't know and would probably only say things that hurt them more.\n\nYes! We got this. We got this. We got this.",
