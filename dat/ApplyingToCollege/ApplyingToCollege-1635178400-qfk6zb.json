  "text": "Title. I have absolutely no idea. \n\nFor the past few weeks (months?) I was confident in my choice of Washington University in St Louis (because of their program, minor in fashion design, wonderful campus - they have Ai Weiwei there!!!! - and even nicer food), but now I'm conflicted between Cornell and any other T20 school that has nice dorms, meets full need of internationals (!!!) and offers some form of design as a minor.\n\nBasically, from what I was able to understand from my counselor, my LORs are great. Outstanding even. I have no idea why, I didn't think they were going to be THAT positive, but fortunately, they are. Because of this, and the fact that my GPA is also relatively good, I'm wondering about choosing a more selective school as EDI, and then applying to WashU ED2, if I don't get into the previous one. \n\nBtw the main reason behind my dilemma is WashU's location - while I don't mind the campus being in the middle of nowhere, I'm not particularly fond of Missouri.\n\nI'm interested in majoring in Computer Science, preferably with a BA degree - I'm more into graphic design, web dev, and UX design rather than engineering. Also, I'm an international student applying for aid, so there's that.",

      "text": ">meets full need of internationals\n\nKeep in mind that this is really a bit of a red herring.\n\nWashU, Cornell, and every other US school except Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, and Amherst factor your need for aid into their decision of whether or not to admit you.\n\nPromising to meet 100% of an admitted international student\u2019s aid need is meaningless\u2026 if the school decides to not admit you because of the amount of aid you need.\n\nPS -  You need to look at WashU on a map.  The campus is absolutely NOT \u201cin the middle of nowhere.\u201d  St. Louis is a great, large, city. There are nearly 3 million people in the St Louis metro area.  (You\u2019ll never need to see the rest of Missouri.)",

Missouri is the main problem. Not only will I have to travel much further (and pay much more..) - it's also away from my only family in the US, and doesn't seem to have as many opportunities as the east coast does.",

      "text": "We\u2019ve messaged about this, but given your high level of need + international status, ED is super competitive at this tier of institution. Almost everyone gets deferred. So basically, anyone in your position getting in ED to Cornell would get in RD to Cornell or WashU. Anyone in your position getting in ED to WashU would also get in RD to Cornell or WashU. For this reason, I think you\u2019re probably better off going RD to your ED need aware options. \n\nIn terms of reasons to pick either. \n\n-Flying from your city to St Louis will require less time than flying to Ithaca. You can look it up, but your connections/layovers will be longer to Ithaca because it\u2019s a smaller airport. \n\n-Ithaca isn\u2019t New York and St Louis isnt Missouri. I wouldn\u2019t get hung up on state level politics of either. What happens in the rest of Missouri politically doesn\u2019t impact STL and what happens in downstate New York doesn\u2019t impact Ithaca either. \n\n-the AI Weiwei exhibition wasn\u2019t permanent. It lasted about a year. They do have other cool exhibitions that roll through though and you\u2019re also a ten minute walk from the much larger St Louis art museum.  FYI.\n\n-I would not worry about regional job placement at either school. CS at Cornell >>> CS at WashU because Cornell is on a short list of the very best anywhere. WashU is also quite strong, but it is not Cornell level. A CS major coming out of either school will be able to get jobs all over the country. And they do. \n\nQualitative differences:  \n-WashU is a bit more flexible on an interdisciplinary basis while Cornell has greater depth at the individual course of study. Each college\u2019s requirements at Cornell tend to vary more, so check that. \n\n-Bigger, more spread out campus at Cornell vs more compact WashU. Your preference will be just that: a preference. One advantage of compact is the ability to stack classes throughout the day more efficiently (shorter distances to/from). But spacious and more open Cornell is amazing if that suits you. \n\n-Ridiculously gorgeous natural beauty of Ithaca vs extremely underrated cultural amenities of St Louis. \n\n-Weather. If you stay over the summer, at some point you\u2019ll curse the heat and humidity of St Louis June-August. At some point Jan-February you\u2019re going to curse snowy and perpetually grey Ithaca. Which isn\u2019t to say St Louis doesn\u2019t have it\u2019s less pleasant winter days. But thats the deal you make to go to either school. \n\n-Food, dorm, creature comforts at WashU >>>. Cornell. Although Cornell is still very good overall in these areas. \n\n-Your net price at either will be almost identical. Unless you can also get a merit scholarship at WashU. I think you\u2019re being a bit modest re: your quals. You\u2019ve explained them to me and I think you\u2019re objectively a top 20% type WashU enrollee. I don\u2019t know I you\u2019re top 5% level because that is nearly impossible to know.  But you\u2019d at least be competitive for some merit aid. \n\n\nIt comes down to how you weigh things.  The quality of both CS and Fashion Design at Cornell is higher. For anyone trying to mix these two disciplines, Cornell and WashU are probably THE two schools to try this. Cornell is better at both (but WashU is very strong too). WashU has a bit of an advantage in terms of flexibility through combination of curriculum design and getting from a to b to schedule courses. The rest is down to preference. The people are almost the exact same. Cornell will be more diverse, but it\u2019s the same caliber of student at both universities. \n\nFWIW, I know of 4 grads who were torn between these two schools as their final matriculation choice over the last two admissions cycles. 2 picked Cornell. Mainly due to one very specific program of interest. 1 of the 2 was also a legacy. The other 2 picked WashU because they found it a bit more more flexible on the interdisciplinary side. You could easily pick one over the other. \n\nBut in your situation, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ED at all if I were you.",
