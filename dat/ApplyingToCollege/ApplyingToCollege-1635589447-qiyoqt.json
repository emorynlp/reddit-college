      "text": "my proofreading tip is to make sure you never skip words when reading. since you\u2019ve written the essay a bunch and are very used to it, it will become east to accidentally jump a word or two.\n\ni avoid any word skips by putting a little dot in pen underneath each word so i\u2019m forced to read them all.",

      "text": "As for proofreading tips, I don\u2019t have much except read your essay OUT LOUD and make sure you don\u2019t have any grammar/punctuation mistakes. Also, see if you can go through all of your verbs and make them more active/evocative (but make sure you know what each word means lol).\n\nFormatting doesn\u2019t really matter because when you paste your essays into the common app it just defaults into the same font/size/whatever. One thing that happened to me when I put them in though was that everything was automatically bold for some reason, so I just fixed that. Also, make sure to click on the \u201cpreview\u201d button to make sure all of the formatting is right because common app can be weird with pasting text and creates all these errors that weren\u2019t there before.",
