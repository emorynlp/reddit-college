      "text": "Think about it this way-\nThere are 168 hours in a week. You spend probably 6-8 hours a day in school, hopefully at least 6 hours sleeping on avg. per night, and a number of hours commuting, eating, spending time with family/friends etc. \nCalculate all that stuff for yourself and subtract it from 168, and then figure out how many hours you generally have left per week. If your avg. EC hours (taking account the number of weeks each you put down) are above that, it\u2019s too much (because there literally aren\u2019t enough hours in the week), and if you have, say, >20 hours left, you can add a few more to some ECs without it appearing too much.\n\nHope this helps!",
