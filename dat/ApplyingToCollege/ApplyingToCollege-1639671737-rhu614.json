  "text": "So basically, my country uses a 6.0 scale for GPA. 4.75 is suitable for formal acclamation at the end of the school year. My GPA in 9th grade was 5.2, 5.7 in 10th grade and 6.0 in 11th grade. This translates to a GPA of roughly 3.97 in the 4.0 scale, however the cummulative GPA itself is only 5.63. Will colleges know the context of my country's grading system etc.?",
