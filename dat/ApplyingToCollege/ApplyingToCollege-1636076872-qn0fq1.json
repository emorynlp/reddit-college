  "text": "Hey! So for my main EC which is a business, I chose to put profit (not revenue) on my currency because it is way too inaccurate to convert it to USD (even more cause the currency has a different value and maybe that amount of money in the US is not that much compared to here)\n\nI would like to hear some fresh advice. I already submitted like 8 early apps but I have 21 left and I could easily change it to USD currency. \n\nThank u\u00a1",
