I assume you've put a lot more time and effort into your grades, ECs, and essays than you have into your relationship. Still kind of a messed up thing to say though. \n\n>I would rather lose my car in an accident than get rejected at Cornell\n\nKinda weird, but ok I guess this kind of makes sense. It depends on your major, but the value of your car is probably less than the ROI you'll get on a Cornell education.\n\n>I would rather have the house on fire than get rejected at Cornell\n\nAre you insane? People live there. You'd rather risk the deaths of yourself and your family than be rejected from a school?\n\n>And I would rather sell all my friends than get rejected at Cornell\n\nI'm not sure exactly what you mean by selling your friends but wtf",
