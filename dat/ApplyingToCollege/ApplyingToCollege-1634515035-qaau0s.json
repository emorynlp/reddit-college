      "text": "I personally think it's a good idea and could serve as a good hook. As for a specific way that you need to cite, this isn't a bibliography and as such you can have freedom in how you cite the source. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, be warned that quotes are fairly common as hooks. If you're not using it for a hook then disregard this, but i've seen plenty of essays where quotes are the first sentence and serve as an introductory setting.",
