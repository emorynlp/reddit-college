  "text": "Hey y\u2019all, trying to stay optimistic for Thursday. I signed up for a Home Ec class next semester, but I want to drop it. \n\nThe teacher switched and isn\u2019t good, I\u2019d have to eat lunch at school (don\u2019t want to do that lol) and ultimately I\u2019d have less time for my internship which I really enjoy, the class is irrelevant to my major, plus it would be second semester senior year, live it up amirite. \n\nAnyways, assuming I got in, would UPenn see me as a lazy bum and rescind me if I dropped it? Could I ask them or do I just tough it out?",
