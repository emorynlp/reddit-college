  "text": "I'm applying to UPenn and I wanted to know if it's easier to get into **CAS** for Econ or **Wharton** for Finance. I'm currently assuming CAS is easier since Wharton is the number 1 b-school for Finance, but does anyone have any specific data/stats regarding this?\n\nI'm happy going to both btw.",
