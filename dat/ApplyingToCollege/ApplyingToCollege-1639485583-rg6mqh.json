          "text": "They vary.  Most merit based scholarships are a discount that isn't as much as the full cost of tuition, but they can be that large or even cover room + board too.\n\nNeed based aid depends on your assessed financial need.  At schools that meet full need, they would cover the difference between what they think you can reasonably pay and the full cost of attendance -- that aid could include a federal loan and work study.\n\nEvery school in the US that accepts federal aid is required to have a net price calculator you can use to get a need based aid estimate in advance. Sometimes they will also estimate merit aid, but there is no requirement for them to do so.",
