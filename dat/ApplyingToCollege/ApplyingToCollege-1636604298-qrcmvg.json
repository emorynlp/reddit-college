      "text": "Data Science is heavy stats (and programming). It\u2019s okay if you\u2019re bad, you can definitely improve. But at this point you have to ask yourself if you\u2019re going (and willing) to study more. \n\nIf it helps, I was super bad at AP Stats, and now I\u2019m good at it. I just had a terrible teacher who wouldn\u2019t bother explaining stuff (I was also chronically ill). But I also studied more. \n\nI also feel inclined to tell you that Data Science as a major is a double edged sword for two reasons: \n\n1. A lot of these schools just pump out Data Science as a new degree because it was popular, without taking the time to carefully design it. This would screw you over because then you won\u2019t have the skills necessary to do the job. When you apply, you put what skills you have in list format. \n\n2. You\u2019ll be stuck only applying to Data Analyst and Data Scientist positions because your major is Data Science. Data Science is extremely competitive, and mostly those with Master degrees get them. Unless you\u2019re good at making social connections or just bum lucky, it\u2019s gonna be hard for you. \n\nOther majors that are popular with Data Scientists: Economics, Statistics, other maths (Applied Math), Physics, and Computer Science. \n\nCS + a Statistics minor or CS+Stats double major is the most popular because Data Science, again requires programming (in Python or R) and statistics. \n\nFor the other majors, you\u2019ll need a CS minor or learn programming on your own. \n\nIf you really want Data Science as a major, then go for it. But it\u2019s not gonna give you a better chance than the other majors, especially with no Master\u2019s.\n\nETA: no one really cares what your major is, as long as you have the skills needed at the level desired. When you apply to jobs, you rarely put your major down. Instead, you put your skill list down. If your Data Science program doesn\u2019t teach you the skills, then you\u2019ll have to learn them by yourself or switch majors.",

      "text": "Not all schools even admit by major, so it might not matter depending on where you applied\n\nAt other schools, its ranges from very easy to effectively impossible to change majors, so it'll also depend on where you applied and what you want to switch into\n\nAs an aside, I would not let your performance in one HS class dictate what you chose to study for the next four years. You could very well just have a bad teacher/not be grasping the material and be giving up on a subject you might come to love",

I know that the majority of my class is struggling so I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s the teacher and that\u2019s what I\u2019m sticking with in my head.",

      "text": "The real questions should be: \n\n1. Do I like what we are doing with stats, while things will be different in college a decent amount of the fundamentals will stay the same so do you still like it?\n\n2. Are you just doing poorly with grades or are you also failing to understand the content? It is an important distinction to make.",
