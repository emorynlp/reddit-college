  "title:": "Got accepted into University of Portland, don\u2019t know if I should follow through with my admission",
  "text": "I got accepted to my first University so far! I also got a $110,000 UP President Scholarship, but I think it applies to all four years (so ~$13,000 per semester) I applied EA, though idk if this affected my results including getting the scholarship.\nNgl I don\u2019t really have a dream school or anything, and was just applying to colleges for the fun of it. Regardless, I want to go the most cost-effective way when it comes to going to college, so I was more-so invested in attending an in-state school (I live in Nevada). The only cut line of me going out of state was if I got a full ride somewhere. \nSince getting into UP and seeing I got a scholarship, I see that I should probably be putting more of my potential into more schools or scholarships. Should I follow through with my acceptance into UP and just work on trying to get grants/ scholarships? Or would it be wise to continue searching/ apply to more financially- compatible opportunities? \n\nFor those who may happen to be attending UP, how do you like it? Does it work well with you financially?\n\nAlso, Happy Thanksgiving to those who celebrate it!",

      "text": "Congrats!\n\nThere is no need to decide on UP this early in the game. If you applied EA, your commitment and deposit isn't due until May 1st, so you have plenty of time to apply for more scholarships there, or check out other schools and see if you can get better financial aid from somewhere else.",

          "text": "Hi! Thank you so much! I have a 3.8 GPA (unweighted) and a 5.1 GPA (weighted). I didn\u2019t submit my ACT/ SAT scores, but I got 25 on the ACT. As for extracurriculars, I included that I was editor in chief of my schools newspaper, was an officer of my schools keyclub (tech editor), and ran my own online crochet store for a little while (which I also based my personal statement on). I was also a member for other clubs (like DECA and student council) so I put those in as well. It seems pretty hefty, but through the course of 4 years it was manageable :) So no, no world hunger cure (unfortunately)",
