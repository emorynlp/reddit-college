  "title:": "Would withdrawing from a AP class that doesn\u2019t relate to my major look bad for collages?",
  "text": "Hi all, so am in senior year of high schools and I really want to withdraw from AP biology. It requires a lot of studying outside of school and it\u2019s hard to comprehend the Material. I feel unmotivated as am not doing anything related to biology when I get older and I already have my science credits, I don\u2019t really need the class. \n\nI\u2019ve been approved to withdraw but my counselor called my parents and told them it will effect my GPA and collage applications. Though I have a D in the class and I doubt a W will look worse. They want me to stay and get a C but I want to leave the class whether it\u2019s through a half day or Withdrawing",

      "text": "My school automatically put me in a AP Computer Science class (because of my past interest); I told my guidance counselor I wanted to switch that class at the beginning of the year but they kinda ignored me and also said they would not be changing schedules unless the classes were wrong. A few mins ago I went to their office and asked could I drop the class and they said no because it is a yearlong class!! I have a 93% right now but it is going to go down to a 87% because of missing work. I did not want that class and it is useless to me because I am going into Psychology :( idk what to do.",
