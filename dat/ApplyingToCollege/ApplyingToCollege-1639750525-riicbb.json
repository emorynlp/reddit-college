It\u2019s basically a form to submit new information/accomplishments. So practically everything that I\u2019d write in a LOCI minus the I LOVE YOUR SCHOOL part. From what I\u2019ve understood, I should be sending a LOCI saying I LOVE THE SCHOOL+ a briefing of the things I\u2019ve been up to since November 1 and then for the deferral form, I can use it to expand on these things. So send both in mid jan?",
