  "title:": "CollegeBoard National Recognition after finishing apps??",
  "text": "I was recently(today, lol) invited to apply for Collegeboard's national recognition programs for african americans and rural townspeople, and completed it. If I finished my apps already, is there any point? I read around and saw that there's scholarships offered for being recognized, so did I just miss out on a bunch because I got emailed about it late?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr maybe I could just email the colleges just to tell them I was (hypothetically, if they recognize me) recognized? I'm just generally confused on the whole thing.",

      "text": "You are probably still eligible for the scholarships at the schools that offer them.  If you applied to any schools that offer scholarships for it, I would definitely email them and let them know.\n\nYou might also want to apply to a few more schools if one of those big scholarship offer schools is preferable to the safer options you already applied to -- nothing wrong with deciding that an ASU, Fordham, etc. becomes more attractive when they offer a full tuition scholarship.",
