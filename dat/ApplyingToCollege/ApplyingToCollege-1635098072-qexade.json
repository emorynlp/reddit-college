  "text": "I am a trilingual and currently learning two more languages. Does learning languages or languages in general boost college application? (No, I won't study literature or linguistics)\n\nTo be honest, I am not good at anything except languages \ud83d\ude05 I translated a lot of stuff for my school. For exmaple, study guides for MUNs, speeches for programs, checked for errors in documents (for my friends and sometimes for my teachers since I am the best in this field), and translated a whole conversation with a sponsor for a grand activity in our school.\n\nDo I need to provide langauge proficiency exams? Would colleges actually ask for proofs if I mentioned what I have done as my school's interpreter? \n\nI don't have many ECs, but I will list them down.\n\nI play table tennis\n\nparticipated to 1 debate (and won it but it happened right 1 week before COVID's quarantine hit so we didn't have a ceremony)\n\nParticipated to 2 MUNs\n\nAnd did a little of volunteer work.\n\nDo colleges care about languages in the first place? \n\nIf needed,\nThe languages I am fluent at are Arabic, English and Turkish. \nThe languages I am learning are Japanese and Spanish.",
