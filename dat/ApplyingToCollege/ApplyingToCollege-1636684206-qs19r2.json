  "title:": "Will my ED 2 school take my first semester senior year grades into consideration?",
  "text": "My grades aren\u2019t exactly slipping, but I was just hoping to get straight A\u2019s since i\u2019m only taking 4 courses this semester (half courseload because I work in the mornings). I think I am not gonna be able to get my grade up in my two ap sciences and I will probably end with a B in both. I know B\u2019s are not bad at all but it is a slight downward trend from my previous years ? I know I am probably overreacting but my parents are worried and I guess it\u2019s worrying me a bit too\u2026. so I was wondering if my ED 2 school was going to look at my semester one grades and take that into account for admission. My school does not do quarter or mid semester grades, only semester grades. My semester ends late january and apparently decisions for early round 2 come out the first week of february. Will it be taken into account ?",
