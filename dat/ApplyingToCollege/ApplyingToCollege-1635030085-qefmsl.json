  "text": "I'm trying to list my courses and grades on common app (thanks a lot stanford), but I can't figure out how to list community college courses that aren't on my high school transcript. I've taken all of my language classes at the cc, but they weren't dual enrollment so I'm not allowed to put them on my high school transcript. Common App doesn't seem to have a way to upload a course from a college rather than a high school, and it says to only list high school courses that match my transcript . I listed the college in the appropriate place, but it only asks if I received a degree and didn't ask for a transcript or courses. Any advice would be appreciated!",
