  "text": "hi ! I was in the middle of filling out my common app and was wondering if its fine if I didnt put my SSN in? I am applying for financial aid, so I know I'll need to submit my SSN to the colleges, but dont I get a portal after I apply for each individual college? couldn't I just submit it through the individual portal instead? Or is that not recommended ?\n\nI hope that made sense, lol, and thanks so much in advance !",

Otherwise, you would need to call admissions after submitting the app to fix the mistake. (Common App states \"Social Security Number, required if applying for financial aid via FAFSA\")",
