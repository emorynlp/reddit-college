  "text": "I am applying EA to my state school and the deadline is Nov. 1. I am expecting to submit my school based SAT score that I took on October 13 (it will be released on November 3). \n\nThis school allows me to submit test scores by November 12, so I will send my scores directly from the CollegeBoard website once I receive them.\n\nHowever, in the testing section in the common app, if i say i want to self report my SAT scores, it requires me to list my specific scores, but i don\u2019t have them yet.\n\nShould I leave the self report section on the common app blank and then send my scores once i receive them? or will my college not accept my score because i didn\u2019t list it on the common app?",

      "text": "Look closely at the test optional rules to see if you can change from test optional to test submitting, or vice versa, after you submit the application - some colleges don't let you. If the college allows switching, then apply test optional and then see what the score is, since it will be available just a few days after the deadline. If the college does not allow switching, and you choose to report, then you are committing to reporting a score you haven't yet seen.\n\nThe testing section does allow you to indicate \"Number of future SAT sittings you expect\" and then the date Oct 2021. Though, this is not required in order to later report a score. It just helps them wait on reviewing an app if a score is expected.\n\nIf the college accepts self-reported scores, I would plan to self-report in the portal once you get them; an official report will take longer.\n\nIf the school is U Mich, be aware:\n\n>If I apply early action and answer \u201cNo\u201d to the question, can I change my mind and choose to later report an ACT/SAT score to U-M later for EA consideration?  \n>  \n>No, EA Candidates who respond \u201cNo\u201d to this question on the application will be evaluated without an ACT or SAT score during our early action period and if an ACT/SAT score is reported through Enrollment Connect after the submission of the application it will not be considered as a part of our EA decision. However, a student may self-report ACT/SAT scores prior to the Feb. 1, 2022 regular consideration deadline if they would like the test scores to be added to their file.  \n>  \n>If I am testing in the fall of my senior year can I still reply \u201cYes\u201d to this question and have my ACT/Score considered as part of my early action application?  \n>  \n>EA candidates who respond \"yes\" to this question on the application must self-report test scores on their application or through Enrollment Connect by Nov. 12. Those students who do not submit a test score by this date will be moved into the test flexible pool of candidates and reviewed without an ACT/SAT score during early action, if all other required materials have been received to complete their application for early action consideration.  \n>  \n>If I was reviewed as a test flexible candidate during early action and I was not admitted, can I change my mind and report an ACT/SAT score for consideration after being postponed into the RD pool?  \n>  \n>Any postponed EA applicant or applicants who are applying RD may self-report a new ACT and/or SAT score for consideration as their application is evaluated for a final decision as long as the score is reported prior to the Feb. 1 application deadline. This includes students who initially asked to be evaluated without the consideration of an ACT/SAT score. We would also encourage these applicants to submit first term senior year grades for consideration.",
