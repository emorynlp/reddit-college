  "text": "Hey, I am applying to harvard rea as an international student. Everything besides my test scores are stellar. I have a superscore of 1500 on the SAT (730 ebrw and 770 math). I am planning on taking the november 6th SAT to hopefully get a 800 on math. Is it worth applying with a 1500 in case I don\u2019t score higher or should I got test optional?",
