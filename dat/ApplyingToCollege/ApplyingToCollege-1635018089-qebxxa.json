  "text": "So long story short, I messed up freshman year and got a 3.00 GPA. Sophomore year I improved with a 3.33, and then my junior year improved again with a 3.67. (The above is per term and not cumulative). Anyway, my question is How Much Of A Factor Is Freshman Year In The College Application Process? I have a 3.31 cumulative gpa freshman year included. And a 3.5 GPA excluding freshman year. I know some universities such as the UC\u2019s only consider sophomore and junior year. Is this the procedure and other schools too?",
