  "text": "I self-reported my test scores for the SAT, ACT, and AP Tests on the common application. I submitted my application, and got access to my portal. On the portal itself, I can only see my ACT and SAT scores, and not my AP scores. Do I need to self-report this another way? I came here because I figured that someone on this subreddit must've had a similar issue / solution when they were applying. I couldn't find this information anywhere on Penn's website... Thanks!",
