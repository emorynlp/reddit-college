Then you have the soul-crushing, capricious \"holistic\" admissions process itself, and now kids are SKIPPING SCHOOL \ud83d\ude31 just to have time to apply to college! Man I'm glad I only had to apply to a handful of top schools because my targets and safeties were all in my own country. Oh yeah, and there's the whole concept of reaches and safeties and applying to 10 or 20 schools hoping to get in *somewhere* \n\nNgl I think if I were an American kid I would actually cry. (Full disclosure I am now attending an American college \ud83d\ude04 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8)",
