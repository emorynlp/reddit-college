Are you:\n\n1. expecting to get enough financial aid that the cost will be less than full price (in-state) at the average state flagship,\n2. not expecting any financial aid, but are so well off that full price doesn't faze you,\n3. expecting little enough aid that you'll end up paying \"significantly more\" than full price (in-state) at the average state flagship, but you're willing to do so because it's \"worth it\",\n4. in some category other than the above (explain).",
