      "text": "Have a lil fun with it. After reading hundreds of \"understanding, compassionate, passionate, caring, empathetic, driven\" and other generic adjectives, AOs will be bored out of their mind. Don't choose boring, typical adjectives, unless they are unique/different and TRULY describe a large part of who you are. Be unique, create your own adjectives, go crazy. Obviously you are ultimately the person that decides how YOU want to be represented, so choose what feels the best for you. Don't do it just because someone on the internet is telling you to do it, but because you actually want to.",
