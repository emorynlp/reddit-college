  "title:": "encouragement to ED/EA applications, from a current upenn student rejected from 10 colleges",
  "text": "around this time last year, i got deferred/rejected from all my early schools (ED brown, EA uchicago, northeastern, umich).  it was incredibly devastating and led to the most stressful 2 weeks of my life since i hadn't started my RD supplements.  a few months later i started getting RD rejections from schools i thought were targets (wesleyan, barnard).  i spent so many weeks feeling intense self hatred/self doubt: i felt like an idiot for thinking i could ever get into elite schools, until ivy day turned things around for me.  so i just wanted to say, don't let early rejections discourage you or let you lose hope.  you still absolutely have a shot at your dream schools in the RD round.  i KNOW it sucks to see everyone who is able to commit to a school this early, because of how much i was in love with brown.  but it is honestly such an unpredictable process, and every elite school isn't looking for the exact same thing.  if you haven't started your RD supplements, like i hadn't, remember that the hardest part is over: you've gotten the grades, done the extracurriculars, & written the main essay.  idk just my two cents.  hope this was helpful for someone & i'm manifesting happiness & dream school acceptances for you all <3",

These essays had elements that could answer any question related to my academic interests, a community that I'm a part of, an extracurricular I enjoy doing, or a way I got involved in my community. From there I would look at all the questions the schools had and looked for overlaps. For instance, one school asked me to write about my favorite word and one asked me to talk about something I was passionate about. I wrote the essay about what I was passionate about, then slightly edited it to revolve around a single word and used that as my favorite word essay. With a little planning you can make it a lot easier on yourself.",

I also knew I wanted to go into finance, which Dartmouth was the best at among here. I did get into Penn, but not Wharton, and I knew my chance of transferring in was low. I still think I would've taken Dartmouth over Wharton, but who knows what HS me would've actually done.\n\nI loved it. It was genuinely the best 4 years of my life and something I day-dream about fondly. Luckily, NYC has a huge Dartmouth contingent and all my friends work here.\n\nI'm a volunteer who helps local students with their college applications and I always emphasize culture fit, after you reach a certain number of relatively equivalent schools. Would you rather be miserable at Princeton or have a great time at Brown? Realistically, if inclined, students at both will quite easily end up at the same MBB consulting firm or whatever financial firm they want. Sure, you might get a bit more clout at your local hometown bar if you tell the locals you're from Princeton, instead of Brown, but that's the only difference.",
