Lit, at least, could place you out of those at many school.\n\nArt History may be less valuable. At Purdue, where my daughter just graduated, it gets \u201cGeneral\u201d credit, not for any specific requirement. So basically useless.   \n\n\nCheck with your specific schools - AP policies are almost always listed.",
