  "text": "that\u2019s what my school uses. Does that mean colleges think my GPA will be inflated, so they will have higher expectations? In that case I can\u2019t just get 4.0, and I would need to get A+ in everything then. \n\nOr, even if my transcript says 4.0 UW, will they actually treat it like a regular 4.0UW?",
