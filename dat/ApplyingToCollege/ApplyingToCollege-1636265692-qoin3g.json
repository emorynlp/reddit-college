  "text": "I\u2019ve been planning to send an application to most Ivies, those which I\u2019ve visited and liked. I\u2019m by no means the craziest student but, I have consistently high grades and okay ECs. As I begin working on the supplements for these schools I started wondering if it\u2019s actually worth sending these with the hope of getting in. I\u2019ve already accepted I likely won\u2019t get in but the thought of, on the off chance, getting in excites and motivates me. Figured i\u2019d see what y\u2019all thought or if anyone is doing the same.",

Its gonna be pretty lucky bc there are gonna b many applicants in the same boat(including me lol) so make sure your essays are decent and be prepared for whatever outcome.",
