  "text": "hello y'all!! feels weird to be posting on this sub again after so long lol\n\nanyway i got into stanford REA last year and i attribute a large part of why i got in to this sub\n\nsince i know a lot of you guys are waiting on your stanford decisions to come out tomorrow, i figured i would answer any questions that you guys have about my application, student life, etc.\n\nalso im bored and miss school so keep me occupied\n\ndisclaimer: i have not looked at my admission file so i don't know what helped/hurt me in the application process but i am willing to share anything that i put on my application (except for copies of my essays)",
