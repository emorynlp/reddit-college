  "title:": "Financial Aid Question",
  "text": "Hi guys, \n\nI am an international student and I filled out the CSS form and submitted it to Cornell a few days ago. However, I got to know that Cornell is need aware for international students which affects admission when asked for aid. I said that my family will only be able to pay 50% of the fee. This means that I am asking for nearly 50% aid. \n\n1) Will this negatively impact my ED admission to Cornell?\n\n2) Can I withdraw my CSS application for Cornell after sending it?\n\n3) Can I increase the contribution as my Dad is wiling to pay more for tuition? If yes, how can I do that?",

      "text": "The question is can\u2019t your family pay the full cost in absolutely no way or they just don\u2019t want to? Because there\u2019s a huge difference between the two. Cornell pretty much doesn\u2019t care how much your dad is willing to pay. If they decide your parents can afford the full cost, they won\u2019t give you any aid, regardless of how much you want to pay. Moreover, in that case, not only you wouldn\u2019t get any aid, but there\u2019s a chance you would be considered among the students that requested financial aid = less chances to get in.",

If they determine that you need a certain amount of aid, they will evaluate your application with that financial need in mind. If they determine that your family can afford to pay full price, they will evaluate your application on that assumption. That\u2019s a danger of ED-ing as an international student needing aid. That said, if Cornell\u2019s financial aid office determines that your family will need significant aid, it will negatively impact your application.",
