  "text": "I just saw a post about a friend lying about race and I\u2019m a little concerned. I have a very mixed background of Irish, Filipino, Spanish, and more. I mostly identify with being Filipino and Irish and celebrate those parts of my background. However, when signing up for virtual tours and things like that I put that I am Asian, Hispanic (other), and white. Is this wrong? Should I change it?",

Since I\u2019ve put this information into my virtual tours in the past, do you think it would be weird if I stopped putting Hispanic down all the sudden?",
