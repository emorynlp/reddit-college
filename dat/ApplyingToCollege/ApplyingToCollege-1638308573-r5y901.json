      "text": "That's really tough but not impossible. Here are some tips:\n\nTry to book all your classes on the same days, such as MWF, so you get a few days where you don't have to commute.\n\nPlan to drive down in the morning and spend the whole day there. The library or student center should be good places to hang out between classes. Always have an extra set of clothes and non perishable snacks in your car, in case of emergency. \n\nMake friends with dorm residents. Maybe they'll let you snooze on their couch occasionally.\n\nGet audio books of some of your textbooks, if available. You can listen to them in the car.",
