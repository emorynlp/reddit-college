  "title:": "How to convince your counselor to switch a teacher URGENT",
  "text": "- Don\u2019t want to read my reasoning? TLDR: How did any of you convince your counselor to switch your teacher? Did you go to a principal? Did your parents contact?\n- So. I suck at math. Like, I\u2019ve gotten D\u2019s and C\u2019s in it. Yeah. I\u2019ve felt SO stupid because of it. \n- However, this term I have a 98 in the class (and it\u2019s HONORS). Because I understand it. The teacher I have has a teaching style that matches my learning style and the way she teaches things makes a million times more sense in my brain\n- I\u2019ve been assigned a different teacher for next term. I don\u2019t want to fail math again because I\u2019m too stupid to understand how some teachers teach, and because I LOVE math and want to get a good foundation of it before I move on to studying it in college. I\u2019ve done a bunch of searching and figured out that it works out perfectly to change me back to the original teacher \n- How did any of you convince your counselor to switch your teacher? Did you go to a principal? Did your parents contact?\n- Thanks, from someone who is genuinely trying to learn. This isn\u2019t me wanting to switch classes because I don\u2019t have friends in my class or something. I just want to understand math.\n- I know this isn\u2019t necessarily A2C but I literally need y\u2019all\u2019s help because I know you guys are good at finessing things at school",

      "text": "Get your parents to contact your counselor repeatedly, and if your counselor doesn't grant your request, try the next higher person in admin (for example, my school has a Assistant Principal of Instruction that's in charge of classes). At least at my school, the counselors just have too many students so they just kind of ignore requests put in by just students. Good luck! :)",
