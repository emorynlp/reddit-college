  "text": "So, I am applying to Arizona State and I currently have a 32.  I never thought this would be an issue, but I was talking with one of my friends and she said that I should really try to get a higher score.  I don\u2019t know why this would be an issue because it\u2019s only in one class and it\u2019s an AP class on top of that.  Do you think this will hurt my chances of admission?",
