  "text": " I was thinking my college essay topic would focus on how I overcame my anxiety due to eczema (wearing hoodies every day etc). Every since my fathered commuted suicide I\u2019ve had pretty severe eczema. Throughout school I was bullied or \u201ctalked\u201d about as having zombie skin. Do you think talking about how I overcame this anxiety by embracing my own skin (and myself) would be a good overcoming a challenge essay?\n\nAnother idea would be how since my father passed early on in my life I only really acknowledge the Asian side of my heritage. Throughout school I would hear lots of antisemitism, but never really realized I was Jewish until I took a DNA test. I would talk about how discovering this about myself led me to learn it\u2019s important to stand up for what\u2019s right even if it may not apply to yourself and how this information allowed me to discover the other half of my heritage (sounds kinda clich\u00e9).\n\nWhich if any do you think would be a good topic?",

      "text": "I really like your second idea. It's actually less clich\u00e9 and you should pursue that one. Plus, never abandon an idea just cuz you think it's clich\u00e9. First one is also nice but I like the second one better. Also, make sure that you don't portray yourself as having mental health issues. That's a red flag.",

      "text": "i had a pretty similar topic -- cystic acne and homophobia, not eczema and dead dad -- and I think you could make the first topic work. my suggestion would be to try and focus on how exactly you overcame your zombie skin. I focused my essay on debate and community through debate changing the way I looked at myself more than the nitty gritty of acne troubles. its the growth that really counts.",
