  "text": "My sophomore year second semester, my school gave some teachers the option to do pass/fail instead of letter grades cause of the pandemic so I have a couple of P\u2019s on my transcript. Do admission officers know this, or should I email each school and let them know that the P\u2019s were out of my control? Cause I got all A\u2019s, it\u2019s just the pandemic that kind of messed everything up",
