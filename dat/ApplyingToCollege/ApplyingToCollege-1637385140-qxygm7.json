  "text": "I'm an International student from India and had applied for the Spring intake. Got into both of them for CS and am really confused as to which one to go to. UW is slightly higher ranked but I know that it's close enough that it doesn't matter at all. Purdue is cheaper and has more International students (Indian internationals to be specific) afaik which is cool but it is in the middle of nowhere. The nearest Walmart is a 45 min bus ride iirc. I plan on pursuing postgraduate studies too btw. So what would you guys recommend? Any input is greatly appreciated :)",
