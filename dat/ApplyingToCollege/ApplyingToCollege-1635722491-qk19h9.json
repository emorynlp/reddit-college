  "text": "i was about to submit my application for one of my top schools through common app when i saw they provided me a pdf of all of my information i put on their application. there, i saw that it lists all of the pronouns i use (any pronouns). i never put my parents\u2019 emails or phone numbers anywhere on the common app or that school\u2019s application, but i\u2019m still really paranoid about them finding out about this or common app contacting them for some reason? my gender identity matters a lot to me, which is why i specified my pronouns, but i\u2019m really scared that my parents will find out. will common app contact them somehow? am i just overthinking this? should i remove my pronouns? do i keep them? this process got way more nerve wracking.",
