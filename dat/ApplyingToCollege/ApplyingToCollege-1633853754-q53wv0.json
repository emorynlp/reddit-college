      "text": "What is defined as substantial amount of debt? If it is 20-30k of debt, then yeah, you can probably pay them off, but 100-200k is another story.\n\nThis also depends a lot of major. I say, even with a CS major, coming out of college with a 6 figure salary, you quickly realize how little even 200k salary means in Silicon Valley after taxes, housing, etc. \n\nLastly, is graduating with debt really that bad, it depends on the alternative. Is 200k debt bad if you went to schools like Harvard? If you are aiming for med school (additional 200k debt), then yes. it is terrible. If your alternative is a flagship state school, yes. Terrible idea. If your alternative is to be homeless, then yes but hard to imagine someone of caliber of Harvard to fall in this category.",

Money used to pay the loan can\u2019t go to rent, car, food, clothing, savings or anything else.\n\nWithout a well-paying job, this may mean living with parents, low quality food, or other reductions to the quality of life.\n\nAnd interest on the loan keeps accumulating. If you lose your job, you have no income and still have to pay the loan. There goes your savings.\n\nLoans aren\u2019t necessarily bad if it leads to a job that pays well enough that you\u2019re better off after making loan payments than you would have been without the loan/degree. But too many people make bad decisions, taking out too many loans for the benefits they get from the education it pays for.\n\nIf you make poor decisions, yes, it can be that bad.",
