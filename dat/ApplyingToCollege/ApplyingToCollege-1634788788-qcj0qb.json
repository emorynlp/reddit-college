  "title:": "Global minorities vs American minorities",
  "text": "Not to undermine the talent that American minorities hold, the academic potential they have might be, in some cases even better. But in the same context, applying to college is tougher for global minority groups, than for someone who is considered a minority in the U.S. Even if international applicants who belong to what is considered a minority in context with their country or globally, work their asses off, they still have lower chances compared to someone in the U.S, probably from the same community but hold American citizenship. Idk when will unis stop expecting intl' students to be the top of the creme but then being misers when it comes to aid.",

      "text": "Need to reframe. It is not that they set expectations too high. It's not as if there are a bunch of empty seats available because international applicants couldn't meet the bar. What you are complaining about is that it's too competitive, that there are fewer seats allotted for international applicants vs number of internationals applying than for domestic students at top schools. The rule of thumb is that acceptance rates for internationals to top US schools tend to be around half the overall rate.\n\nThere are 3000 colleges in the US. Internationals needing a lot of aid might look to less-selective schools that offer big merit scholarships for high stats (and by high, that doesn't necessarily mean phenomenally high). Often that means low *tuition*, but the student would still need to figure out how to pay for their own *living expenses* during college.",
