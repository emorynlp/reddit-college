      "text": "There isn't too much content online regarding MIT essays and such in my opinion. When you wrote your essays, were they really flamboyant and intricately detailed, or straight to the point? What is your take on the \"quirky\" MIT admissions trope?\n\nAlso, what are the profiles or your MIT classmates? Are like 5% ISEF / Olympiad Campers / Olympiad T50 geniuses, or is it greater? Does an above average high school senior who has done clubs and won some awards, but nothing truly CRAZY, even stand a chance in terms of admissions?\n\nAlso, what is it like at MIT? I've heard its horrible for mental health, but is the community there truly the \"hacker culture\" and \"doing and building\" that everyone associates with MIT?\n\nSorry for the all the questions LOL, I guess I'm just compensating cause I got rejected CMU SCS today lol. Also MIT is my dream school so I really do want to know anything a college freshmen would pick up about the admissions process. Thanks, I really appreciate it.",

          "text": "Essays: i think the \u201cquirky\u201d trope is more of a way of saying that you aren\u2019t going to get in with a generic essay. there has to be something that makes your essay stand out. for me, i think i wrote essays that weren\u2019t particularly flamboyant but approached stories in a non-standard way. i think i wrote pretty normal stories but with memorable twists/ways of telling them, if that makes sense. \n\n\nClassmates: i don\u2019t think i know anyone who won isef or olympiads? i know a lot of people who went to robotics world championships (i never did though). i think everyone is smart, but most of the time they don\u2019t seem like geniuses. i\u2019d say that it feels like everyone\u2019s minds run at more similar speeds. the \u201cgenius\u201d part comes in when you talk to someone about the niche thing they are interested in and know a ton about and you think \u201cwow i will never know this much about that\u201d but it\u2019s their passion and so they have really learned a lot about it. lots of people here did normal clubs in high school, didn\u2019t win awards or didn\u2019t win any big ones. i didn\u2019t do anything truly crazy, and while i do know people who have insane accomplishments, the majority of people i know do not fall into that category.\n\n\nMental health: yes, mental health bad. culture of overcommiting and the extreme pressure and rigor. however, when you find your group, you are really happy. there are many bad moments, but friends help you through it and the good moments outshine the bad ones. surprisingly, despite all the intensity and impostor syndrome and everything, i am the happiest i\u2019ve ever been.\n\nHacking/building: i think it depends on the group you are in and what you are interested in. those communities do exist (as evidence by the alchemist picture in this blog post https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/mmmm-wikipedia/) but not everyone is into that. so to a degree those stereotypes are true, but they definitely do not describe all mit students.",

The MD-PhD acceptance rate is like 94% or something crazy high like that and the MD acceptance rate is 70something percent. For reference the national acceptance rate is somewhere around 45%. And they have advisors and what not to keep you on track. I\u2019ve also spoken with a med school admissions officer who said that because MIT students are like unicorns in the med school Pool that as long as test scores and GPA aren\u2019t abysmally low, they tend to make it past the first round of cuts. From that point, what matters most are letters of rec and extracurriculars (research, volunteering, leadership, etc.). They work very hard to help anyone who is premed and the average accepted GPA does tend to be a bit lower than say a state school. So it\u2019s not a bad match. \n\nAlso the grade deflation thing is over exaggerated. The classes are hard but it\u2019s not like the grade on a curve or artificially lower your grade or anything",
