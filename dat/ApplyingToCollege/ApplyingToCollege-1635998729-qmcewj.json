  "text": "I'm trying to major in performance at some rather competitive schools, many of which are in the UC system. However, I am concerned that regardless how good my audition is, I may still fall short due to a lack of a good GPA. My weighted GPA is a 3.92 while my unweighted is a 3.48. Is this GPA too low regardless of my audition?",

I will say \u201cyes\u201d with quotes - some music departments will fight tooth and nail for their talented students while others have no choice but to waitlist or even reject the students they want badly due to poor test scores / GPA. It really depends on the school here and usually the more renowned the music school (conservatory or not), the more they care about grades weirdly enough. It\u2019s why you have schools like Interlochen that specialize in producing performing high schoolers that have SAT training courses.",

Substitute Rice/Shepherd if you want, or USC/Thornton.  For undergrad.  My understanding is that you're somewhat like an athlete.  You don't get into the program if your audition isn't strong, but even for those with strong auditions there's still a higher standard for music undergrads (relative to less selective schools) at those that are extremely selective.",

If you go the conservatory route, then it really doesn\u2019t matter (unless it\u2019s NEC, for some reason they care about your SAT scores).\n\nFor masters, grades mean absolutely nothing! LOL! You just need good enough grades in your undergrad to maintain your scholarship, if you (hopefully) care about that",
