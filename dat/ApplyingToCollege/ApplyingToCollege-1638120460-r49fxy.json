      "text": "Application season tends to suck only if you buy into the notion that you have a \u201cdream school\u201dand if that dream school is a T25.  My sons, now college seniors, ended up at an in-state T25 but I had them apply to several strong public research universities with rolling admissions so that early on they would know they had been admitted to a strong state flagship university. So by November 1, they had acceptances from four T60 schools with great campuses, D1 sports, highly-regarded honors colleges, and strong alumni communities.  And significant scholarship offers from two of those schools.  Had my sons ended up attending one of those universities, we would have been able to assist them with grad school, study abroad, alternative spring break, and other terrific but costly college experiences.   We took the same approach with my youngest, now a high school senior, who currently has acceptances from Penn State, Pitt, Rutgers, Delaware, and The University of Arizona and several merit scholarship offers. So we\u2019re pretty mellow as we wait on her outstanding applications.  But with schools as diverse as Harvard, Penn State, Cornell, UVA, and Arizona in our immediate family, we know that every school has its pros and cons, so no one is stressing out about getting into a \u201cdream school.\u201d",
