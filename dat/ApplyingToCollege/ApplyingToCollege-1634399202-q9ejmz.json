  "text": "I'm from Sweden, and I am currently applying to NYU through common app. I'm mainly having problems filling out the activities section, and I feel like the concept of \"activities\" is very american overall. For the most part we don't have clubs, honors, internships or school-linked sports teams in Sweden, so all I can think of listing are my leisure hobbies outside of school as well as paid work positions. Should I write about what I've got and pray that the admissioners understand the cultural differences of America and Sweden regarding this? Or how much will it damage my application if I exclude activities all together?",
