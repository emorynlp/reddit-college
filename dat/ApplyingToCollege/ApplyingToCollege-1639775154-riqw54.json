  "text": "I was riding high with nearly all As through my junior year with 9 APs so far. (One B+ early on in a non-AP.) I'm taking almost all APs again this year, but my grades are in a tailspin. With 1 month left in the semester I've got 2 As, 1 B+, 2 Bs, and 2 B-s. And 1 of the Bs and 1 of the B-s are pretty directly related to my major. My best guess is that if everything goes amazingly well I can maybe bring it up to 4 As, 2 B+s, and 1 B. Stanford won't hold that against me, will they?\n\nEdit: And not just Stanford. I've got a bunch of T20s I was planning on applying to. Am I out of the running for all of them?",
