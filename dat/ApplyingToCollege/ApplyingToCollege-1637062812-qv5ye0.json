  "title:": "Does Hopkins take dual enrollment credits?",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently taking Calculus II first semester and Calculus III second semester at a local university, and I was wondering if Hopkins accepts these credits to let me just skip the Calc track entirely in Freshman Year. I\u2019m not dual enrolled at a community college, it\u2019s actually bit selective private school offering a strong program for biochemistry in my area. But again, it\u2019s pretty local and I don\u2019t think many outside of my region even know it exists. So, do you think Hopkins would accept these credits? Also, even if they do accept, do you think it\u2019s a good idea for me to take those classes anyway? A Calculus course at a T10 is bound to be a lot more enriching than one at a small university.",
