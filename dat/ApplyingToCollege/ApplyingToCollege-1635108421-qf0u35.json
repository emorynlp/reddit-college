  "title:": "I want to be an engineer, but I only have philosophy ECs",
  "text": "tl;dr Is trying to get into selective tech schools as a philosophy major, because I don't have ECs in engineering, but I do in philosophy, a good idea?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a rigorous student with a 4.3 weighted GPA, and I've been averaging about a 1450 on my practice SATs (real one is Nov 6). ^((which leads to another discussion of whether or not to submit a comparatively low score to selective schools like that, as I've received some pretty conflicting advice))\n\nI'm a bit polymathic in that I love learning about all subjects, especially via youtube or podcast. However, in school I've always gravitated toward STEM, especially physics and math. Because of that, I think I'd really enjoy engineering, so I'm applying to schools like Caltech, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, etc.\n\nMy problem, however, is that I'm sorely lacking in any kind of ECs demonstrating that interest. My parents didn't have money for camps, we don't have a robotics club at my school, our engineering club sucks, I never taught myself how to code, etc. The best I can manage is a volunteering experience teaching kids STEM at a camp for two weeks over the summer.\n\nWhat I can really prove my interest in, however, is philosophy. I've done camps, a monthly seminar for about a year, and youtube lectures learning about psychology and philosophy in my own time. I love it. But I don't think I want to make it a career.\n\nSo, I was thinking of rewriting my \"why\" essay for MIT ^((applying EA MIT & Caltech)) to instead reflect my interest in philosophy, and get in as a philosophy major, perhaps mentioning an interest in the intersection between tech and ethics. Then, probably switching my major. I think doing so for Stanford, Harvard, Princeton, etc. when I apply regular decision would also be a good idea, because it would just seem more compelling. I also think the philosophy program may be less impacted than engineering, so maybe an easier time getting in?\n\nAm I making the right decision? EA is due in just over a week, and I could really use some advice.",

      "text": "It looks like all the other comments tell you to put engineering. For schools like Stanford Harvard Princeton, definitely put philosophy. It's not \"hacking the system\" - there's absolutely nothing wrong with changing your mind after you get in. (At those schools there's actually the expectation that you'll walk out with a major different from your original intended.)\n\nEx: one of Yale's supplemental prompts:\n\n>Students at Yale have time to explore their academic interests before committing to one or more major fields of study. Many students either modify their original academic direction or change their minds entirely. As of this moment, what academic areas seem to fit your interests or goals most comfortably? Please indicate up to three from the list provided.\n\nAlternatively, you could angle yourself as someone who wants to apply philosophy to engineering. All of these colleges love applicants who have an interdisciplinary approach to things. To them it means you'll take advantage of not just the resources available to the philosophy department, but also engineering and quite possibly the entire school.\n\nI would also pitch yourself as philosophy/engineering for engineering programs + MIT/Caltech. Very few people applying to these schools will have that sort of profile, and admissions officers are searching for applicants who bring a fresh perspective to the class.\n\nWhile demonstrated interest in a major is by no means necessary to get into college, it'll definitely make your case more compelling. Here's an anecdote straight out of Emory admissions office ([from Jeff Selingo](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-secrets-of-elite-college-admissions-11598626784))\n\n>Someone else in the room pulled up the applicant\u2019s midyear grades. They were all As. But while the student listed neuroscience as a major, \u201cthere is no example of neuro in the file\u201d in terms of activities or in the essays, the admissions officer said. She suggested that they move the applicant to the wait list, which would be \u201ca softer landing\u201d than an outright denial.",

          "text": "It may just be confirmation bias, but this is the reply I was looking for.\n\nWith some reflection and a bit of investigation, I think I'll apply for engineering at schools like MIT and Caltech, while making sure to mention the philosophy part to stand out. Because while they do offer humanities programs, they seem to basically just be options for minors or double majors. e.g. the MIT philosophy program graduated only *7* undergrads last year. \n\nBut what you say about the more balanced schools (Stanford, Harvard, Princeton) seems to make much more sense, and is why I asked the question in the first place. I don't really understand why I should declare engineering, when it's not going to give me a leg up, and I'm not even certain I want to pursue it (although it's currently my best bet).",

      "text": "NO!!! If you want to apply for engineering apply engineering if you think you can hack the system it will probably backfire on you. More importantly mention the interest in combining ethics with tech in developing yourself as a future engineer. Think about it this way, how many applicants for MechE does MIT that are head of the robotics club? A thousand, how many are philosophers-engineers who want to explore the world through abstracts and physics? Around 10. In the why MIT essay you could mention how MIT would let you explore both areas maybe even a dual degree.",

For most colleges, you don\u2019t need ECs related to engineering to be a strong candidate for admission. All of the colleges you mentioned have extremely high rejection rates. You need to apply to additional colleges which have acceptance rates closer to 50+% where you\u2019ll be a strong candidate for admission and perhaps also merit scholarships. You can search for colleges with ABET-accredited engineering programs via the ABET website. Based on what you shared here, I think engineering will be a great fit for you! \n\nhttps://www.abet.org",

Engineering requires math, and you might enjoy math and physics, but that doesn't necessarily mean you'd enjoy working as an engineer.",

However, I can't tell if it's because it's the last period of the day, because the teacher is quite incompetent, or that I genuinely don't enjoy it, the class is a real drag. From my very minimal experience with engineering, we did a small project with gears in which the design process was a ton of fun and super creative, but actually building our contraption was frustrating and boring. So maybe I'm not cut out for engineering, or what I think is more likely, is that if I do go into it, I'll do something more design oriented.",
