Those people surely aren\u2019t in any position to sit down on their ass, and write essays about why they are a good fit for a $60,000 private school. It sounds arrogant when so many people complain about doing their college apps. If the college you\u2019re trying to get into consists of your entire personality, you need some serious help.

Her priority was low cost of attendance.  \n\n> You can go to somewhere that's not ridiculously expensive that is still far away.  \n\nThose places do exist. Completely agree. When I posted my comment, /u/elkrange 's comment was at like -6 karma, suggesting your peers did not appreciate the wisdom of his comment. My comment (sarcastic though it may have been) is dedicated to them.  \n\n\n> I don't get the inclination to party, but it's probably better to get that out of your system in college than have a mid-life crisis later on.  \n\nA mid-life crisis is usually considerably less expensive than a $100k increase in cost of attendance.",

I like that I know I\u2019d get an amazing education there, and I think the rigor would be really good preparation for whatever I choose to do after college (med school is the idea right now). Oh, and the campus is gorgeous. \n\nI do have concerns about some rumors I\u2019ve heard, though. I think the \u201cstress culture\u201d is probably exaggerated, but I\u2019ve heard bad things about the relatively small endowment/lack of funding (i think this is a problem for the equestrian team), and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d want to live in Williamsburg. \n\nThough I have a feeling some of those concerns aren\u2019t actually real problems, I am going to do more research and hopefully get to talk to students about social life and the majors/programs i\u2019m interested in! (i\u2019m a junior, so i have a long time to do research lol). But overall, W&M seems like a really great place.",

      "text": "I was in the same boat, ended up at UGA. It's been just fine (other than the school's annoying propensity to say \"fuck all y'all it's football weekend, park in hell you dumb nerdy bastards!\" Serves me right for living on campus). \n\nAnd hey I have grad school to worry about going to a better school... Or not. Outside of A2C-like circles you start to realize no one really cares where you went to college, except to pause the conversation for the customary fanning of your ego if you mention you went to a big name school like Harvard or something haha. \n\nIf you're insecure about it you can mention that you just went to [state school] for money reasons if you really need to. But honestly your undergrad won't really be worth mentioning after you go to grad/med school, except to make connections: \"Oh, you went to [school]? No way, that's where I went to college!\"\n\nReally don't worry about it. It'll all turn out fine. In my experience a lot of the push for T10 schools is born out of poorly-veiled elitism anyways. You can get a good education at a state school. You can have a good experience at a state school. In some ways, for pre-grad/med school students, finding a smaller school where you can start research your freshman year will mean you are better prepared for grad school than you would be from a T10 school. I personally didn't apply to any schools that couldn't give me the opportunity to start research my freshman year, mostly because I started research in high school and didn't want to go a semester without it. \n\nIn high school, college is the next stage of your life so of course it seems important to go to a big name school, but honestly in college I feel a lot more grounded in the sense that I have a clear path for what I want to do and how to get there, and none of it requires a T10 school.\n\ntl;dr take a deep breath, you'll be fine. Yes there's a gap between having enough money that you don't qualify for aid and having enough money to afford school, but if you end up at a state school, you'll do just fine for yourself.",

      "text": "I was definitely in this situation when I was in college. I ultimately went to community college, state school, then a top school for grad. Here are a few things I learned:\n\n1. If you are accepted into a top school but it's crazy expensive, something to really consider is the social capital from the school. Are alumni in top tier career positions, and if so how strong is the connection between the school and alumni? You are paying for both your degree and what the name of your school means to your potential job network. Grad school cost 2x as much as my undergrad degree for a fraction of the time, but graduating from a top school opened WAAAAAYYY more doors for me.\n\n2. Be honest about the earning potential of your degree after undergrad (or whether or not you care about earning potential). If you are going into CS (cliche), then that $50k/year tuition can probably be paid off rather easily after graduating. If you are going into biology for research, then ask yourself if paying student debt for a long time is worth it or would going to a significantly cheaper state school would be better for you.\n\n3. Fun fact, few people give a shit about your undergrad degree major in the workforce. I was in social sciences, I have friends who studied Russian history and literature. Now we work in tech, sales, hr, etc..\n\n4. Also state school and community college is AWESOME! I didn't know what I wanted to do until much later and didn't pay $50k/year to figure it out. You can always go to that top tier school for grad school-- which in my opinion is much more impactful.\n\n5. At the end of the day, having previous work experience is a lot more important than good grades and a top named school. Okay, you decided to not go to Harvard and go to your local state school instead. Best believe the state school kid who did an internship every summer is going to have a much easier time getting their first career job than the Harvard kid focused on a 4.0 and no work experience.",
