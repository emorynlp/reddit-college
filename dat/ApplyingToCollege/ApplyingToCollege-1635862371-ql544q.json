  "text": "I said that I wanted my SAT score to be considered for Harvard, and I self reported my SAT score in the common app and I sent it to them through the college board. When I go onto the commonApp, though, and click on the PDF of my application, it says that in the testing section that \u201cThere are no test scores to report\u201d. Is this the same for anyone else who REAd to Harvard? Is this a bug or should I contact them?",
