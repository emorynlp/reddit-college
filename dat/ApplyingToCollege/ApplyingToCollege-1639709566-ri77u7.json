      "text": "it's not dumb, but youll need to be careful about the detail you use and how you ratio the different layers of your essay. try writing yourself an outline, going paragraph by paragraph on what you'll talk about in each. I think this essay example does a good job of discussing heavy topics in a way that wouldn't come across as either too graphic and uncomfy for the AO or too \"please pity me and let me in\": [link](https://www.collegeessayguy.com/cwiab-student-17-narrative-structure-sample-essay)",

      "text": "Be very careful about how you represent your parents in this essay. The AOs will NOT like it if you bash your parents in the essay. It will paint you in a negative light. Remember, a lot of these AOs are adults and, specifically, parents. If you write about it in the wrong way, you could easily look like a brat. \n\nIf you decide to write about your relationship with your parents, shy away from trying to paint them as toxic. Show how, for instance, disagreements on perspectives have made your relationship sometimes difficult, but it also sparked your passion for reading. Another thing to consider is potentially painting yourself as anti-social or closed-minded. Colleges will not like this. College is a place of differing opinions, and they want their students to get involved and create impact. \n\nNOTE: I do not want to make it seem like this is how I think you will write about this. I just want to provide some cautionary things to stay away from.",
