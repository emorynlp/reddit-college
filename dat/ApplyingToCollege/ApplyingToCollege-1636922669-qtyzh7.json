  "text": "By definition, I am not classified as poor: my mom makes like $135,000 a year with $12,000 in child support. However, every time I ask her to pay for something (ex: application fees, css profile, cap and gown, dual credit tuition), she acts as if we have no money and we are poor and she can\u2019t afford it. At this point I will have to move two of my early action schools to regular decision and have to no longer apply to one bs md program (even tho my essay was fantastic) and No longer apply to 2 other schools. I know it doesn\u2019t really matter Bc at the end of the day I\u2019m privileged to even be going to school in the first place but it just feels weird to have to give up so much for something that\u2019s out of my control. I guess that\u2019s adulting for you",
