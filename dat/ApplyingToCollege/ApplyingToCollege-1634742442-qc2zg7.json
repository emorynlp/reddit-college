  "text": "So I am a second year who is considering transferring from my current college to a few other options. My high school gpa wasn\u2019t great, but so far in college my gpa has been relatively high. The college I currently go to also has a good rep and is known for being a good school, it\u2019s just not a great fit for me personally. I was wondering, if I have a gpa that is .1-.2 below the average to my target schools, but this gpa comes from a good college, so is this weighted more in the application compared to someone getting a good gpa out of high school? What I mean by this is if I have a 3.6-3.7 in college, does this look better in an application compared to students coming out of high school with the same gpa, or are the viewed equally?",

They will ask for secondary school information but are most concerned about academic success in college. If your school is competitive, you should feel good about applying in that range.",
