  "title:": "My mom is treating my application process like her application process",
  "text": "I love my mom and I appreciate her and all that she's done for me. I really do. But I'm just so frustrated because she keeps on pushing me to apply to colleges that I don't want to apply to.\n\nFirst it was with Yale; I wanted to ED1 UChicago because as a school and as a whole, it's my top choice, but she told me I wasn't aiming high enough and that my future would be ruined if I didn't give any of HYPSM a chance. I went to my counselor asking for support but instead he ganged up with my mom (she was also there), telling me that I should \"give it a shot\" and that I never know and that I might like it there \ud83d\udc80. I have high scores but literally nothing else on top of that so I can see where they're coming from but at the same time, I just didn't want to apply. They kept on asking me, \"Well, why specifically don't you want to apply?\" and I had to keep explaining to them that I don't know specifically why, but I just didn't want to - are my own feelings about the schools I'm applying to not good enough? But they kept on pushing and pushing, and eventually I gave in just to get it over with. We (my mom and I) had four days of arguments about that and I spent two of those crying myself to sleep because of how scathingly she was speaking of me, basically telling me I was a disappointment for not being ambitious enough. I've already submitted my REA app and I personally still don't think I have a chance (happy to help pad their low acceptance rate ig...) but whatever!\n\nAnyway, that's done now and she and my counselor helped me a ton throughout the process, so I'm super grateful to the both of them for that! I thought I could get through the rest of my apps in peace now that I've applied to that one big name (I'm applying to UChi ED2!!). But then yesterday afternoon, after she came back from grocery shopping, she sat me down and told me \"I think we should try applying to Harvard\". Yes, she used \"we\", not \"you\" but \"we\". I told her that I was wary and I still didn't want to apply, but she said, \"but we've never had a chance. This might be the only time I can do this. I couldn't apply when I was young and there's no hope for your brother. Why can't you just do it?\" She specifically related it all to herself, and she isn't ashamed that she's trying to live through me, who does not want to do this. I really wanted to tell her that this is ***my*** application process and not hers, but I also don't want a repeat of all the arguments we had over Yale because I'm tired and busy enough as it is and I don't want more stress on top of that. We ended that conversation after I said okay and I thought I wouldn't have to think about it for a little longer, but as soon as she came home from work today, she sat me down again and said, \"So I was doing some research into the application process and this is what I found,\" and then proceeded to tell me that she signed me up for an information session (without my knowledge), added me to their mailing list, found their admissions criteria page, and told me to get to work. I'm going to ask my counselor to see if he can back me up and help talk her down from this, but given his track record I'm not too sure. So I guess I'm applying RD to H\\*rv\\*rd...\n\nAnd a side note about my mom and the H-word: this has been her dream since God knows how long. She's been telling her colleagues ever since I was in kindergarten that I'm going to get into there, and once I was old enough to understand exactly how hard it is to get into there, I've been telling her that that's unrealistic. I'm a good student, but I'm quiet, slow on the uptake, and I don't work particularly hard outside of class. I haven't done an internship or a job, nor have I done any outside research or made a portfolio or whatever. I just checked their website, and I haven't even fulfilled the recommended high school coursework (I did 3 years of 2 different languages instead of 4 of 1 language, and I only have 2 years of social studies). If I were ever to apply, I would be an automatic reject because this is the H-word we're talking about. But my mom keeps on telling me that it wasn't fair that she didn't have this opportunity when she was younger and growing up in an underdeveloped country. She tells me that I were her, I would be fighting tooth and nail to get in because of how much it means. She tells me that if Harvard's graduate school had a better program for her profession, she absolutely would have applied there instead of the school she went to (one of the top for molecular science but, in her words, \"only\" T50). Basically, for as long as I can remember, she's been putting me into the stereotypical \"but it's not my dream, mom, it's yours\" situation except for college. I don't know how to tell her no without her getting super mad at me again, and I can't just not apply in secret or purposefully half-ass my application because she reads over all my applications like 5 times before they're sent and she works closely with my counselor to make sure that everything is going the way she wants it.\n\nI know that it's my fault since most of my issue comes from my complacency in this process and how truly unqualified I am despite my mom's high hopes, but I still feel annoyed.",

Show her the stats of who is admitted there and show her yours. Applying there is a waste of time and money if you're nowhere near their typical admittance criteria.\n\n4. If she wants to go to Harvard - or just see if she could get accepted there - she can apply herself. It's not too late for her.\n\n5. Roll your eyes and apply anyway and make her write all the essays since it's HER application.\n\n6. Get her to read some books about parents' role in college admissions and learn how admissions officers don't like it when parents make their kids apply to schools they don't wish to attend.\n\n7. Have her listen to some podcasts about number 6. I think the Georgia Tech Admissions team has a good episode that addresses this topic.\n\n8. Just say no. Again and again and again.",

Few months ago my mom had tried pushing me to Stanford even though I explained so many times that a freakin sat score is far from enough...Luckily my counselor was on my side. I understand that this is super annoying and really gives you tons of unnecessary stress :(  \nI think if you just hated the idea of applying to H you can consider completing your H application the last and spend more time perfecting essays for other rd schools that you actually wanna go to.",

Also apply to what you want though. There\u2019s nothing wrong with applying to Harvard and other impossible schools and getting rejected. She\u2019ll end up proud wherever you do get in, which will be somewhere good if your counselor agreed with ED to Yale.",

OP clearly does value education, too. For fuck's sake, they carefully did their research and chose a school for ED that's not only incredibly prestigious and academically excellent, but a school that they love in general.\n\n>There\u2019s nothing wrong with applying to Harvard and other impossible schools and getting rejected.\n\nThird, this is not the point. The point is that OP clearly really, really wants to go to UChicago, and their mother isn't even letting them make it a serious option because of a virtually nonexistent difference in something as intangible as pReStIGe. \n\nFourth, there may be nothing wrong with applying RD to an impossible school, but applying SCEA to Yale took away OP's chance to apply ED to UChicago or any other school OP really wanted to apply early to.\n\nLastly, let's assume for a second that OP does get into Yale or Harvard. Based on this post, do you really think for a second that their mother would let them go to another school (even one as prestigious as UChicago) over one of those schools? I don't think so. And while there's nothing wrong with shooting your shot, there absolutely is something wrong being forced to commit four years of your life to a school you don't want to go to.",

Not sure why you assumed I think otherwise.\n\n2. I\u2019m saying her mom values education..not that she doesn\u2019t. Most parents don\u2019t care where their kids go to college and let them take out student debt to pay for it. So instead of assuming I\u2019m being condescending, maybe just only go by what I wrote. \n\n3/4. Yeah, that\u2019s why I said it\u2019s frustrating and not an ideal situation. But there are plenty of great schools. Uchicago isn\u2019t special compared to any other similarly ranked school. And she might get into uchicago anyway. Parents like this are a part of life, but they mean well. \n\n5. If OP gets into Yale or Harvard, which is unlikely based on what she\u2019s saying, she should go. They\u2019re great schools and the people who go there don\u2019t regret it. I\u2019ve never met somebody who picked uchicago over yale/harcadd  . I\u2019m sure that person exists, but it\u2019s rare.",
