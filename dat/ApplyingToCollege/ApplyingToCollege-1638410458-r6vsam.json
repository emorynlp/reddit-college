  "text": "So I applied to EA November 1st and I was gonna start working on my other applications when I noticed that I put my activities hours all wrong. Idk why but my brain malfunctioned and I put stuff I did as hours per day instead. Like I wrote 3 hours instead of 21. Should I even bother messaging to fix the problem cause it\u2019s been over a month?",
