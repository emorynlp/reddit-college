  "text": "so for one of the questions section for a specific college there is a question that reads \u201cwhat is your family\u2019s gross income range?\u201d and one below it that reads \u201cdo you live in a single parent/guardian household\u201d\n\nmy parents are in the process of getting a divorce and they do not live together. i have lived with my mother for the last 7 years and my father doesn\u2019t live with us or contribute much to food/bills/education/etc. \n\ni checked off yes for the single parent household but i\u2019m not sure if i should include my fathers income since it is higher than my mom\u2019s? he will send me money if i ask but it\u2019s not like he contributes with child support or anything \n\nthank you\n\nedit: i called up the office of admissions and they told me to only list my mother\u2019s income",
