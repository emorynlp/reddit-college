There will be some mandatory fees on top of that - maybe $1000, plus books/supplies.  Specific requirements would be a little different depending on what field you go into, but that's the ballpark figure before aid.\n\nFill out a FAFSA though with your parents - depending on your family income you might qualify for aid from the school, your state, or the federal government. About half the students there qualified for Pell Grants from the federal government that cover a lot of that cost.",
