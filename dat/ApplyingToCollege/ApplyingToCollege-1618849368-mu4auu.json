      "text": "For real, community college was a very formative, useful experience for me. You get the same (or better, since *all* your professors are there to *teach* instead of *research*) quality of education, you save a shit ton of money, and you get a lot more like, actual adulting experience. Going straight to a four-year is a very streamlined process: you do well in highschool, then you get grouped together with a bunch of people your same age, then you go straight into another educational setting where an institution eases you into living on your own. In a lot of ways, it's just high school+. Community college is not only cheaper, I'd argue it's actually a good way to get some more actual life experience: it's a practice in actually *choosing* education over a billion other concerns that'll try latching onto you while you're living partially in school, but also a whole lot out of it. Then, you have to actively apply again for colleges when you transfer, and it's a very different experience. You get time to actually figure out what you want, explore a bunch of majors, be in class with people who come from a *ton* of different backgrounds/age groups, and then make a commitment to a four-year with a more informed and experienced mindset. Transfer admissions are also *way* easier than freshman admission, unless we're talking Ivy League (most of which, tbh, are pretty overrated). When I graduated highschool, I got into Humboldt State and Northern Arizona University, and that was it. A turn in the military and two years at a community college later, and now I'm living in Berkeley, going to Cal. It was time I really needed to grow up and sort shit out that I'm just not sure I would have done the right way if I'd gone to a 'real college' right away. I still feel older and better prepared than people my age who went to a four-year: their education, their pathway, their choices in life were a lot more straightforward than my or my other transfer friends were. I also know plenty of people who went to a four-year, and ended up back in our hometown a year or two later: they wasted a whole lot of money to figure out that they weren't ready for college, or even that college just entirely wasn't for them. Going to a 2-year isn't a consolation prize, it's a very beneficial, strategic life move.",

Part of growing up is *making your own choices, even if your parents don't agree*. Like, they've also probably experienced a lot, so take their advice under advisement, but ultimately it's your choice. If you aren't ready for a four year- that's completely ok. A CC will serve you just fine, if that's what you think you need. Do some real intensive research, and talk to your dad about it. Another part of growing up is making calm, measured decisions, and explaining them to your family even if that choice goes against what they want for you. You're your own person, it's your life: no one else can live it for you. You need to be an active manager in this process, even if it's scary going off your own instincts for (possibly) the first time. It sounds like your dad loves you, and wants the best for you. Take the time to figure out what \"what's best for you\" means to you, and talk to him honestly. He'll understand.",

I got into a four year school and basically dropped out because of depression and trauma after my first semester.  I went to culinary school and became a pretty good pastry chef but ultimately went on to leave my career and focus on my dreams of becoming a lawyer.  I left a cushy job and went to community college and had the most amazing and honestly found myself.  I hustled my aaaaass off and graduated with honors and was accepted to two Ivies and all UC's but my heart was set on UC Berkeley when I realized that the Columbia debt wasn't worth it for my undergrad.\n\nJust about to graduate and I'm taking time off for internships before law school.  Please please please never forget that community college is an amazing asset and the stigma is so unfounded.  Find your purpose, discover your path in life, regardless of how much time it takes to achieve your dream anything is possible.  Love you all and I wish you all SO SO much success.\n\nIf anyone ever needs advice or just have some questions on the transfer process y'all are always welcome to send me a DM.",
