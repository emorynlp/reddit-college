Generally, they already have a good idea of how many intl and US citizen students they're going to admit who ask for aid. They just defer ED intl applicants to compare them with every applicant (because chances are that an intl student asking for aid is going to get that aid in maybe 1-2 schools at best, they don't have many options, so colleges don't worry about enrollment%).",

A guy who graduated from my school in 2019 got into an Ivy full ride with a 1400~ SAT. Good academics (around top 10% but coming from the most competitive HS in the country), fairly good ECs but nothing exceptional by A2C standards, and a tear-jerker of an essay (quite literally, it'd be a crime if any school rejected him by his essay. I'm not even joking having read tons of essays).",
