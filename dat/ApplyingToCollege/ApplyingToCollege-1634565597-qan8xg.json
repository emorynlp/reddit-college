      "text": "It depends on what they're asking for. Go to their info sessions for specifically their architecture program, and ask what they expect in the portfolio--you might get something specific, you might get the generalized \"show us your creativity\" type of answer. \n\nFor my portfolio I included hand drawn drawings, observational pieces, collages, and some photographs. If the school is lenient you can get in with anything you find, but I would recommend getting associated with this thing called National Portfolio Day to get feedback on a \"finished\" or a wip portoflio from any school.",
