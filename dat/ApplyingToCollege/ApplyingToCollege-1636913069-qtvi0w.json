  "text": "Just curious because there are several reasons for applying to college that the city/suburban kids will never be able to relate to:\n\n* Getting more options than the same 4 mediocre fast food chains\n* Finally trying this \"boba\" thing that everyone and their mom on A2C keeps talking about\n* Having more than 10 prospective friend groups to choose from\n* Being able to game with a sub 200 ping\n* Not having to see a \"*Trump 2020*\" flag/sign every 6 houses (not trying to get political but the election was a year ago people!)",
