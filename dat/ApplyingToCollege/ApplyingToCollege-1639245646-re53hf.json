  "text": "I GOT INTO MY ED-BINDING!!!!\n\nI got into a top, top, top-level program and I simply cannot believe it. This feels like a prank, omg.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnto the practical stuff: My acceptance letter says \"  Because you have been accepted to \\_\\_\\_\\_ under the early decision plan, you should make plans to withdraw applications from other colleges or universities.  \"\n\nI thought the college system had an automatic application withdrawal system, I did not know I had to manually withdraw from every school I applied to.\n\nCan someone clear this up for me?",

Once you are sure that the ED college is affordable for your family (after reviewing your financial aid package, if you applied for financial aid), then you should contact every other college where you applied to withdraw your applications. For some colleges, you can do this within their portal but for some you may have to contact the main admissions email address.",
