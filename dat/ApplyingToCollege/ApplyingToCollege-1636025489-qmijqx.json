Initially all the required documents were shown as \"received\" but today when I checked the portal, I saw that my \"Self Reported ACT Score\" was \"waived\". Does it mean that my test scores will not be considered? Am i worrying for now reason or should I email admissions office?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!",
