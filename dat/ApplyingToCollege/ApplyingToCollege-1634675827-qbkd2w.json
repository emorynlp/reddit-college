  "title:": "Activities session: impact vs hours",
  "text": "Hey guys, so I was filling out the activities session on the CommonApp about volunteer experiences and ended up stuck.\n\nSo, I've watched hundreds of videos stating that you should always quantify your activities, so I did this. But, at the same time, everyone is always talking about how it's amazing to put how many hours you spent on community service. The problem is: there isn't enough space for both (why the 150 characters limit CommonApp? why???).\n\nI want your opinion: do you think I should erase my impact and leave out just my hours or should I leave just my impact, as I already stated how many hours/week and how many weeks & years I spent on it?\n\nThank you so much for your input!",
