  "text": "I never got the guys phone number when he was interviewing me, but I needed a new laptop so I was looking around craigslist and this guy was selling his old macbook pro for $1500 so I texted him and we just met up at Starbucks.\n\nWe instantly recognized each other and laughed at the fact that I was the one trying to buy it, end of the day he gave me a $150 discount and let my use his company credentials to download Microsoft office and creative cloud for free!!!",
