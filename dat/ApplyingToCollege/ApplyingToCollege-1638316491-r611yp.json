  "title:": "Can I Begin Filling Out Forms in Junior Year of HS?",
  "text": "Title \\^\n\nSpecifically, can I begin filling out my Common and Coalition Apps? I've already made an account for each, and was just wondering if I could start filling out some of the general information right now? Like, I know I can physically start filling out general information, which I've done somewhat but would it just like, get reset or something by next year?\n\nAlso for the FAFSA app, while I've made an account, I can't actually fill out the form till the 2023-2024 form comes out right? I'm a Junior rn (HS Class of 2023) and plan on attending college right after highschool.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTy in advance",
