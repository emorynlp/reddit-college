  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI was accepted into a certain finance program with the opportunity to work with employees at a certain bank and put it down on my activities list. After one of the orientations for the program, it was learned that the program is more towards research rather than an internship. Unfortunately, I had put down internship rather than research on my common app activities list and put a position of being an intern rather than researcher and with the application already submitted to three schools for EA/ED before this orientation happened. \n\nI am planning to email them about the issue, but would this put me in a bad light or make me look careless? \n\nWould they consider my correction, or is this even a big deal at all and I'm being paranoid because it's the early round?\n\nOne last thing, should I have put the number of people I was going against in my honors/activities? For example, I put 2nd place national debate at a certain tournament placement and 3rd place SLC for DECA without saying how many people were in the competition pool since there was little room in the textbox. Would they know how competitive these events are if I put (regional, state, etc.)?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!",
