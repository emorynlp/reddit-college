  "text": "I was under the impression that decisions released on the 15th, but apparently they tend to come out on the first or second friday of December. I was wondering if anyone has a list of all the dates decision day landed on in the previous years so I could see how often it's on the first friday vs the second friday.",

It's always on a Friday, historically, and they've never done it before the 5th (and the 17th is too late). There was some buzz last year as to whether it would be the 11th or the 4th, but it was the 11th, so the 3rd is almost certainly too early. So probably the 10. Best of luck!",
