  "text": "I have been thinking of submitting an arts supplement since it is one of my significant ECs (my intended major has nothing to do with it though).\n\nHowever, since the pandemic, a lot of programs and events were canceled, and I wanted to submit a video of me performing on stage. I did perform a few times in the pandemic but unfortunately was unable to record it. So, I have one from 2019. Is a performance video from 2019 okay to submit? To be honest, my skills since then have improved just a bit, but no dramatic change overall. \n\nAlso, this is kind of silly, but anyway. I plan on submitting another video, which was filmed a few days ago in my house. I gained weight in the pandemic so I look chubbier in the latest performance compared to the one in 2019, will that be a problem?",
