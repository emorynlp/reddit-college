  "text": "I\u2019ve been working on the UC application lately, especially the activities and awards section. I was wondering if the activities (i.e. extracurriculars) have to be just from high school. I have several community service and extracurricular opportunities I have taken that started in middle school, but continued to take in high school. Would those count, and if so, should I mention I started them in middle school in the description?",
