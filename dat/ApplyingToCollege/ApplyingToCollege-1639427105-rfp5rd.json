  "title:": "Second Yale interview schedules after REA decision release time",
  "text": "Two weeks ago, I had a Yale interview with a current senior student. Then last week, I got an email from a Yale alumni asking for another, suggesting a couple of few different possible dates (the latest suggested date was the 13th). I replied immediately with the best date for me plus an explanation that I already received an interview from a senior student (and that I am still very excited for the interview with her), but she ghosted me. So last Friday, I sent her another email just to make sure she hadn't completely forgotten about it and today, she suddenly sent me a zoom invitation for 6-7pm CT on the 15th.\n\nIf I'm correct wouldn't this be around an hour after or possibly even JUST AS MY YALE REA DECISION COMES OUT????? What does this mean?? It clearly won't be taken into consideration for my early action results so have the AOs already decided to defer me and they just need more info about me for RD? Like imagine having a Yale alumni interview while crying or having a mental breakdown right after getting rejected \ud83d\udc80",
