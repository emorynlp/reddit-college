  "text": "Is anyone else literally gripped by the inability to do school work? For so long I've been going home and doing nothing. I know I have work to do and I know I need to get things done but it's like I can't. I'm literally failing a class because I have an essay that is a month overdue. I know I have to get it done. I have a 46%. And its not just this it's so many classes it's every class. I sit in front of my laptop and stare at the screen and I can't work. I'm so behind on college apps like its honestly quite laughable I've done one app and it's my ED app. I'm so behind and it keeps piling up and I know the answer is to just get to work, and I want to but some part of me feels unable to work. I'm tired and I'm behind. I'm not sure what to do to help myself at this point. I don't know how to break the cycle. I don't know if I want to keep going. I don't know how to break this.  \n\n\nPart of me thinks its laziness, but I don't know if it's me being lazy because I know I want to do the work. I know I need to do the work. But I just feel like I can't and I'm not even sure what to do or how to improve my work ethic. Part of me thinks I need a break but even after a break I have this like mental block.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know a lot of this is redundant but is anyone else dealing with this",
