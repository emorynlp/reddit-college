  "text": "For context, im currently a freshman, about to be rising sophomore? And I've been looking for summer programs, internships any other research program kinda things for a long time but cant find anything that is eligible for my age. I was very excited about TASP but turns out I have to wait another year to apply. Any ideas for what I can do this summer? (June-July)  \nPS: I'm not a stem person either, my passion right now is international relations/politics/history",

              "text": "Yeah the eligibility is 16 years. You could try getting an internship or doing some research. If you are interested in taking some pre college courses in politics/history etc you could check out Stanford's pre collegiate studies or some good summer school. I suggest that you cold email and find an internship related to your interest or start a passion project like a blog or something as these have more impact than cash cow summer programs. But if you wanna get the exposure to a subject definitely try for some precollege high school programs. And happy cake day",

I am really interested in languages tho. I can speak 2 to fluency. I\u2019m learning one in school since the last three years and i am also self learning 2 languages. Do you think i could i continue that as well if i don\u2019t find internships?",
