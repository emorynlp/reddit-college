  "text": "Since I am within the top 9% of my class in California I have ELC status which entails an acceptance into atleast 1 UC which is in all likelihood UC Merced so that\u2019s my guaranteed safety. I\u2019m planning to major in CS but idk if Merced is any good for that. If I donne get into any of my colleges though and UC Merced is my last option I probably will just go to a CC instead but I want to learn more about Merced before I totally throw it away as an option",
