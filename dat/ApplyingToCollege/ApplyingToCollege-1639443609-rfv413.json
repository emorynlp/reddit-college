      "text": "Ah I just got in ED so here are some of my favorite things!\n\nLocation: Cleveland is such a nice city with lots of life! Arts, sports, etc...very fun city!\n\nFlexibility: when I toured, every tour guide was either double majoring or had a minor. Seems like students are really encouraged to explore all their interests, even if they aren't related.\n\nSocial sciences/humanities: Case has a reputation as a STEM school, but it really is more than that. The social sciences/humanities departments are smaller, but (I've heard) that allows for more connection with professors and within departments. I was hesitant about this bc I'm planning to major in poli sci, but I think it'll be a good experience to be in a more intimate department.\n\nRequired courses: I feel like it's good for a school to have some required courses so students are forced to step out of their comfort zones, but not so much that it's overwhelming. I was between Case and Tufts ED, but one of the reasons I chose Case was bc it has less required courses.\n\nThe people: seems like people are nice. It's not a party school (and I wasn't looking at a party school), but people seemed friendly amd nerdy in a way that I can relate to.\n\nObviously, it's not like I'm going to school there rn, but these are a few reasons why I applied ED. Also, it was relatively close to home for me, so that definitely played a role in my decision.",
