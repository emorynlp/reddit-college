      "text": "Have you done an alumni interview yet? It's very casual, and it's easier since it's virtual. Alumni interviews can only have a positive effect on your application, and the fact that it's a choice allows you to show interest as well. \n\nBut it depends on how bad your social skills are. Are you just nervous? Or can you literally not think or talk when meeting someone new? Alumni interviews are intended to be very low pressure, and you can ask them whatever you want to know about their college experience or the school itself. Good luck with whatever you choose. But it wouldn't really come across that well if you literally can't get your ideas out of your mouth. You can always start the interview by saying that you're nervous, and they'll be more understanding. They want the best for you, it's not a test.",

At least for my interview, they wanted to share more of their experience than they wanted to hear from me. It legitimately cannot hurt unless you don't know how to interact with people and your social skills are actually terrible.\n\nIf you know how to talk to a teacher 1-on-1, then you can do an interview.",
