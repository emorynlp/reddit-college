ECs just got an email asking to sign up to interview Overflow students.  \n\nWhat I'm saying is that this is in no way a sign about your application.  Most likely, you will get an interview anyway.  At most, it means your interviewer is more likely to be from another state or even country.  But it's all on zoom anyway.",
