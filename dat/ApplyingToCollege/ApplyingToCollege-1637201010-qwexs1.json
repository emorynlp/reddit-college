  "text": "I\u2019m currently a junior in high school and I really want to go to Georgia tech to major in biomedical engineering, but something recently came up. While I was looking at a college admissions blog, it stated that 95% of Georgia tech applicants have taken AP Calculus or an equivalent course. Unfortunately for me, I do not believe it would be possible for me to take it by my senior year, as I am taking pre calc next semester and taking honors calc my senior year. I currently have a 4.0 GPA(unweighted) and am taking the SAT for the first time, in the coming weeks. I do believe I will be able to get around a 1410, the average score of admitted applicants, as I plan on taking the SAT atleast 3 times. I also love science and am taking AP Bio and AP environmental science this year. In addition hope to take AP chem next year and I am doing almost all of the honors science electives I can at my school. In short, would I have a shoot at making it to Georgia Tech or should I consider elsewhere?",
