  "text": "Merry Christmas everyone! I just discovered this subreddit last night and was just absolutely fascinated by the content on this subreddit. I see a tremendous amount of good information, bad information, and misinformation. I just wanted to share with you all what it\u2019s like going to college since I\u2019ve just graduated and what that admissions process looked like for me.\n\nAs a senior in high school in 2014-2015, I had a ton of the same aspirations as the rest of the people on this subreddit. I had 4.0 GPA out of 4.0 (5th in my class) and 2120 on my SAT when it was out of 2400 (1460 composite with Math and English). To digress slightly, I just also want to tell everyone you can absolutely improve your SAT/ACT if you work hard enough, my PSAT was an 1080 Math and English composite. I forgot what I got on my two SAT II\u2019s but both were in the 760+ range. All 5\u2019s on my half-dozen AP tests in a variety of subjects. I was a varsity level soccer player, an Eagle Scout, and the President of the Literary Magazine. However, I was also a white, middle-class Long Islander who went to a Catholic high school. I knew that I wouldn\u2019t be getting any extra bumps on my applications but I was certain I would be able to stand out.\n\nI don\u2019t blame my college guidance counselor for setting me up for anything, but she motivated me to apply to a lot of top programs on the East Coast and led me to believe that I can get into any of them, barring maybe one or two universities. \n\nI had a ton of high hopes. I applied to 18 colleges (something I totally discourage anyone from doing, it really should be 8-12 tops). It required a tremendous amount of effort, it was expensive, and if you\u2019re a good student like I was, it can totally cripple your ability to make a decision come time. I sacrificed every waking moment that I wasn\u2019t in school or doing something else for extracurriculars applying to colleges. \n\nThe process was extremely tedious, frustrating, and aggravating. However, once those January deadlines hit, all I had to do was wait. \n\nIn the meantime, my school had even nominated me for the Jefferson Scholarship at the University of Virginia. I then went through their own tedious application process. Thankfully, I was asked to interview and was then later told I was a finalist for the NYC area and would likely be invited to the final interview/selection process at UVA. I was elated. I truly thought I was going anywhere I wanted and my unstoppable work ethic (which I now realize was unhealthy) had finally payed off. My parents had assured me that I could go anywhere as well, depending on if they were good enough. I had a college fund, but I also have two siblings so it wasn\u2019t substantial.\n\nWhen everything began to come back, it started off extremely well. On a whim I had applied to Creighton (I love Big East basketball) and was shocked to find a package that included a full-ride offer and a handwritten letter from the Head of Admissions practically begging me to attend. There was also an offer to pay for my flight and accommodations to Omaha considering I hadn\u2019t visited the campus. Everything was going great. Early action admissions came back and all of them included near or total scholarships, as well as acceptance into their honors programs. My life felt like a film about great success and overcoming hardship. I was happy about these admissions results, but none of the really top programs had gotten back to me yet at this point and of course I wasn\u2019t going to attend any of these *peon* schools (if you couldn\u2019t tell, I was becoming arrogant). \n\nThen February and March arrived. On the same day, I was deferred from UVA and denied from the Jefferson Scholarship, denied from Columbia, and waitlisted at Williams College. I was later denied from Georgetown (a school I legitimately thought was a safety for me, but I later learned they hadn\u2019t accepted a student from my high school in 10+ years) and received no money from Boston College or Notre Dame. Schools I thought would give me more money ended up giving me none or not enough. I was also later denied from UVA and Williams College altogether.\n\nDevastation doesn\u2019t begin to describe what I felt. It\u2019s normal to be upset about these types of things, but it\u2019s not normal to refuse to eat for multiple days and either be crying or on the verge of tears at all waking hours. When I told my college guidance counselor about the results, all she could do was say she was sorry. I think she realized what she might\u2019ve done and apologized to my parents for setting me up with these types of expectations. My parents told me how proud of me they were everyday but it didn\u2019t matter. I genuinely felt worthless and stupid. I wanted to kill myself.\n\nThe worst part of this whole experience was that I also began to resent people who I considered my friends. I had a friend who was being *sued* by Columbia because she applied early decision only for her to be accepted into MIT and she pulled out. Multiple people I knew with worse SAT\u2019s, extracurriculars, and GPA were all getting money from and/or into the schools I wanted to attend. Every word of reassurance became white noise. I didn\u2019t know what to do and felt like my life was over. \n\nIt is now the end of April and my parents are begging me to decide on what college to attend. I just start listing off the schools in terms of their rankings.\n\n\u201cNotre Dame\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too expensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoston College\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too expensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cFordham\u201d\n\n\u201cYour scholarship isn\u2019t big enough.\u201d\n\nWe then get to the schools that I can feasibly attend at their price range.  The thing is I didn\u2019t want to attend any of them; they were beneath me and the work I had accomplished. I was completely obstinate to the reality of the situation. They said \u201cyou can basically attend these 4-5 colleges,\u201d but they were really hoping I picked the one that multiple people in my town had attended and reportedly loved. However, I had hated my tour of the place and simply did not want to go there. The school did though offer me a 60% scholarship and entrance into their Honors Program. They even told me that a family friend\u2019s daughter, who had been accepted into UVA, chose to attend this school and loved it. I was really upset and tried to stop myself from crying through the whole process, but I ultimately trusted their judgement. \n\nI can say with definite certainty that I tried to like the place I attended. I joined clubs, tried to meet people in the dorms, went to sporting events, etc. It just wasn\u2019t working. I was so lonely and sad and angry about everything that I shut down. I still attended class and finished my first semester with a 4.0 having taken 19 credits, but it all felt hollow. I was dead-set on transferring out of there and was certain with my performance in college thus far, anywhere would be accessible. Someone had even told me transferring is the way to get into some of these programs. \n\nNot only was I rejected from all the top schools I had applied to the previous year, but I was rejected from some schools that had previously offered me scholarships! I was also beginning to hear from my friends who were a year younger than me getting into these programs I had wanted to attend, which hurt me further. With limited options, I realized I would have to graduate from my current college. I would be stuck there for four years. \n\nI\u2019ve used the word devastation before, but it doesn\u2019t really encapsulate the absolute darkness that encompassed me. I began to think I was an alien (not like a space alien). I felt like I had been lied to and that the world was for other people and not for me. \n\nAt this point in time, I now recognize in hindsight that I was in the process of developing serious undiagnosed depression. I began to sleep for 16 hours a day and felt tired while I was awake. I would only eat when I felt I was about to faint from exhaustion/malnutrition. I kept trying to make friends and make the most out of my experience, but nothing was working. By the end of the year, I had been denied from the two clubs on campus that had the closest thing to a family bond/fraternity vibe to them.\n\nEvery day I thought about killing myself (I even took up smoking as a nonviolent way of slowly killing myself). I thought about the girl at Brown down the road who didn\u2019t deserve her spot there while I lived in the closest thing to Hell on earth. I would pray to God every night begging him to tell me where I went wrong. \n\nI returned for my sophomore year in an even worse condition. I was eating less and sleeping even more. I was sleeping so much I was going to bed at 6PM and having trouble getting up for 8:30AM lectures. I looked awful. I had hair down to my back (I\u2019m a guy), didn\u2019t shower, and smoked half-a-pack of cigarettes a day. I couldn\u2019t even do my work anymore, the one thing I valued myself on through my entire life. It was long process that will make a long story even longer, but this all culminated in me medically withdrawing from school in the Fall of my Junior Year. \n\nIt took 9 months of therapy, medication, and love, but I willed myself back to that campus determined to just basically finish and get out of there.\n\nI don\u2019t know what it was, but a paradigm shift in my perspective occurred. I would like to state that I always thought my professors there were brilliant, I was just unhappy about the prestige of the school and my abysmal social life. But I began to realize that that these people are here because they (1) got offered a job in an extremely competitive field, and (2) because they themselves are extremely qualified. I don\u2019t know why it took me so long, but the \u201cesoteric knowledge\u201d of the books I was reading was not limited to the faculty and resources in the schools I had wanted to attend. This made me feel substantially better about the education I was receiving. I also began to make genuine steps towards making friends. I was able to join one of the clubs I had been denied from in my freshman year. Funny enough, one of their responsibilities was giving tours! I was happy for the first time in a while.\n\nNevertheless, it was still difficult. My depression robbed me of much of the work ethic I once possessed. It took much more effort to do the same activities I could do with ease as a senior in high school or as a freshman. This means I did not graduate with a 4.0 (3.6, barely cum laude). However, I grew to love my school. It was a long and complex time, and I graduated a semester late, but I\u2019m happy I went there. Apparently, I\u2019m poised to win the top English prize for my senior thesis and am presenting at the Senior Symposium. Just to have the opportunity to thank my school and my professors for their help and guidance would be an incredible opportunity. \n\nI wrote this down as a way of expressing to others the obscene damage that the expectations you put on yourself can do to you. To be fair, I think I always predisposed to depression considering my fragile emotional state and this might\u2019ve developed later in life but that\u2019s beside the point. The catalyst for this all was my college applications. Hell, it mattered so much to me that when my dad told me that a family friend\u2019s son had gotten into Yale a few days ago, I nearly cried and I\u2019m already out of college. It\u2019s fucking pathetic (but I recognize it\u2019s fucked up and I\u2019m still working on fixing myself).\n\nBut I\u2019m not like most people. I was an elitist who wanted to join elitist institutions. I still do to an extent. I\u2019m looking at all these scores on these tests that you guys post about and there\u2019s tinges of envy popping up inside of me. Some of you might even think I was delusional for ever thinking I could go to those top programs in the first place, but hey, I and no one here will ever know why things turned out the way they did. But I also recognize now that for me to have been this upset about college admissions when I knew how things would turn out, I have no idea why I was so upset.\n\nThe thing is though, opportunity has found its way into every facet of my life. When God shut doors, he always opened windows whether I knew it or not. I\u2019ve learned so much at college about my majors and myself it\u2019s hard to think I could\u2019ve wanted it any other way. I just want people to know that I know how rough and disappointing it can be. It\u2019s not fair. But it\u2019s also not designed to be fair. Don\u2019t let these things stop you from becoming the person you are meant to be. I should\u2019ve been able to see the overwhelming amount of positivity I received earlier in the process and realized just how much these schools were wrong about me. You will be accomplished anywhere you go. Don\u2019t let *anyone* tell you that you\u2019re not good enough. What some admissions officer thinks about your application is not indicative of who you are as a human being. It is not the total indictment of character and intelligence that I thought it was. \n\nI know this is so long and I genuinely respect anyone who\u2019s read to the end of this, but if I have only one piece of advice for anyone here, it\u2019s be kind to yourself. I was so profoundly unkind to myself for so long that my brain stopped working correctly. \n\nThis will not define you. This goes both ways. Going to a \u201clesser\u201d college means nothing of your intelligence. One of the biggest losers I know went to Columbia and he\u2019s still a fucking loser a year after he graduated. It\u2019s what you make of it. \n\nEnjoy your senior year of high school. Meet people. Have sex. Make mistakes. Drink too much. Discover what you love. Find out who you are. That\u2019s what college is for and nearly any place will give you this opportunity.",

Don't know which one came first - doesn't really matter. I struggled *immensely* towards the end of high school. I've dealt with a lot of bad shit since then, but I have never suffered as much as when my own mind turned toxic against me as a teenager. \n\nAnd to be completely honest, the treatment was rough for a really long time. The medication made me dopey and the counselling wasn't curing me, but it kept me alive. Took me a few years of treatment and introspection to figure out what my biggest problem was: sunlight. I get Seasonal Affective Disorder. I've always lived at quite high latitudes, meaning short days and little sunlight in the winter. \n\nMy depression was at its worst at 17 and 18. I'm 23 now and it's only now that I feel I have it under control. I've gone through two winters in a row (moving house between hemispheres) without issue. So it can take a long time, sometimes years, to see strong results from treatment, but it's very important that you start on that road.",

Seeing OP's 2120 (although outdated now), was an initial red flag in my opinion. 2150+ for non-URMs is the entry point for top 25's in my opinion.\n\nGeorgetown also looks for emphasis on a single EC that demonstrates your passion - not a mashup of different activities that shows you were just doing them to check off another box on the application. The admission letter even specifically highlights what 'passion' they gleamed from your application. Mine was community service.\n\nSo you need to do a good job of showing why you're passionate about something besides adding a bunch of hours next to the activity.\n\nEDIT: Also, as good/bad as it sounds, a lot of students at Georgetown were the waitlists/eventual rejects from a lot of top Ivy's.",

At the time I was applying to schools, there was a huge emphasis on \u201cholistic review\u201d which made me kinda believe that I had a better chance than my scores initially indicated. I now kinda realize that this was mostly PR and schools still only care about standardized tests basically. Applying to grad schools taught me that again with the GRE. I did think the whole Williams College waitlist thing did point that I had a good resume, but ultimately it wasn\u2019t where it needed to be. \n\nAlso speaking to your comment, I guess being totally clueless about what I was gonna do in college or life in general didn\u2019t help my application lol. I don\u2019t remember the question but I trust you that it was probably the one about \u201cpassion.\u201d\n\nI do want to emphasize that, according to the college guidance counselors in my high school, that a student from our school hadn\u2019t been admitted to Georgetown in like 15 years. Apparently, when accepting applications from Catholic schools, they very much prefer taking kids from Jesuit high schools. My high school was Marist. And I do remember three people getting into pretty good Ivy\u2019s and not getting into Georgetown. There is definitely a chance that my evidence is purely anecdotal, but that was how I remember it. \n\nI also went to Providence by the way, which I\u2019m not afraid to tell anyone anymore primarily because I did not want the conversation in the thread to be about that school at all considering I loved it there eventually. Only bringing it up now because it\u2019s all love for the Big East!",

The high-strung people on this sub could always use a reminder that it's not the end of the world if you don't get into your \"dream school\" (god, I hate that term).\n\nReminds me of something someone said at a conference of sorts at my high school (seems a bit \"thathappened\" but this actually did occur). It was an event where seniors were invited to talk to parents of other students about college. Since this was a private high school, all of the parents were intensely focused on getting their kids into \"top\" schools. One of them asked how to get into Harvard, and one of the seniors, instead of answering the question, asked something along the lines of, \"How many of you went to a T20 school?\" Not many of them raised their hands. He then asked, \"And how many of you are happy with your lives?\" Almost all the parents put their hands up.\n\nThe name of the college on your diploma matters less than most people think it does.",

      "text": "You just described my greatest fears for how my life may turn out. I hear everyone being frustrated by the expectations placed on them by their parents and their teachers but my belief is that most of us on this sub have the good grades and whatever because *we* strive to do better. And when that reaches our extreme, we pressure ourselves to do better. And with that pressure comes expectation. Failing to live up to your own expectations is far more disappointing than it is to live up to others' expectations. The latter you can brush off because who the fuck cares what other people think but when you see yourself as less than in your own eyes, something fractures deep inside you. And that crack breeds jealousy and resentment and bitterness and of course, depression. \n\nWe're our own worst enemies. We \"achieve\" but at what cost? I cry almost everyday because I'm so terrified of what's coming. I'm terrified of disappointing myself. I've only faced one rejection from my #2 school and it nearly broke me. I've been spiralling ever since and I see constant reminders of my failure everywhere around me. My sibling goes to this school and I keep agonizing over why I wasn't good enough. I keep comparing myself to people on this sub and destroying myself over not being even close to good enough for the places I want to go to. I'm desperately trying to keep myself afloat because I don't know if I'll have the strength to get back up if I go under.\n\nI wish you the very best with everything. Thank you for writing this wonderful post. It reminded me of what lies at the end of the path I'm dangerously close to walking down.",

They are designed to quantify each one of us. Every single student is boiled down to their test scores, grades, extracurriculars, etc. Moreover, we find ourselves in this vast competition, in which every person around us becomes a competitor that we must out-compete. However, when we engage in this we forget what makes humans special. Humans are so innately special because every single one of us is special. We all bring something to the table that no one else brings. Yet, in this rat race of admissions it seems like there is some sort of linear path that we need to follow in order to win the race, and because of that we lose sight of what makes each one of us unique. \n\nI myself am a senior applying to big name colleges in hopes of acceptances, however I have also come to terms with the fact that no matter where I end up, my personality and character will always be a part of me that no one will ever be able to strip away from me.

I could only describe my feelings as numb.  I only got into 3 of those 7 schools and eventually picked Cal Poly Pomona (which was referred to as \"the other Cal Poly\").  Luckily, I was in a very supportive environment (my physics teacher, who went to SLO, was upset at first but eventually said that Pomona had one of the top aerospace programs in the world).  For my first semester, I seriously considered transferring, but I did my absolute best to make it work, and I did.  I am happy to say that I'm a proud Bronco now, and would not trade my college experience thus far for anything.",

How are we supposed to feel happy that well prepared people can get rejected from schools that are in their capacities? Holistic admissions could matter but if these are the results then its probably causing more harm than good. \n\nAnd hell yeah, T50 is not the only shit ever existing, but it's kind of worrying that the current system doesn't know who deserves elite education (hard-workers? good students? low-income? \"good personalities\"?). It is striking me because this is like the 5th time I see an overqualified student posting their rejection experience while I see hundreds of people, less qualified, getting into great schools. What did they have? Maybe you had the worst essays existing, maybe a particular bad detail that got you rejected; but you see, one can only give so many \"maybe's\". And even if we consider the fact that a student, in the same situation, *shown* (*seems* is not the same as *is*) a better personality through its essays, is it worth considering that over hard-work? To what extent should we consider that?\n\nMaybe I'm just bitter because I feel kind of hopeless, but I cannot get over my head how, the more I read about this particular subject, the more I grow disappointed.",

Other colleges like San Jose State are the biggest feeders for Silicon Valley jobs, not T20 universities. Definitely consider your career goals and who recruits from which university when applying. It\u2019s not the end of the world if you don\u2019t get into your dream college. There\u2019s more than one way of getting to your goal. (Although as cautious reminder, you might change your mind about what you want to do)",

There\u2019s such a stress culture to continually compete with your classmates in every way - grades, restrictive clubs, summer internships - that you almost feel like you\u2019re still in the high school rat race.

I go to a catholic school surrounded by elitists but I am not one. I haven\u2019t tried super hard in school, only doing enough to get a 3.3 and not really bothering to do act prep. Most schools I applied to were reach schools and I got into them all. I have not really had my heart set on any school and I\u2019m pretty open to going a lot of places. I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s just me. May or may not be a good thing, but everyone around me is applying to Ivy\u2019s and putting their hearts into it but I\u2019ve done a pretty good job at avoiding it.",

      "text": "Thank you for posting the details of such a painful and emotional journey. I am glad you are feeling better and life is moving forward on an upward track again. \n\nI think guidance counselors, especially at private schools, are in a challenging position; they can't tell kids not to apply to the tippy-top schools because most parents, after investing for years, believe their kid's school will open doors to the better universities. Unfortunately, the kids don't realize how competitive the T 75 schools are, especially if you are applying for financial aid. Did you have Naviance at your school? It would have provided some realistic metrics, instead of wishful thinking, allowing you to realize that all top schools are \"Reach\" schools even if you are the valedictorian. \n\nIt's very unfortunate that your parents did not set clear dollar boundaries so you would not feel as if you won the lottery by getting into Notre Dame/BC/Georgetown and not let you go because they did not offer you scholarships. Had they run the net price calculators, you would have received an excellent estimate on your cost of attendance and maybe not even applied--so shame on them!  I sense that you went to Providence College or Fairfield - very nice schools, but no, not in the same league as ND or BC. Catholic high schools many years ago were strong feeders to Catholic colleges, but not for a long time now. Fairfield, Providence, Regis, Merrimack, Saint Anselm, and Stonehill are the only safeties they can count on for 85% of students, but they are also expensive, so state schools are a better investment for most families.\n\nI am so sorry you had to endure so much disappointment. College admissions season in high school is like a popularity contest and the prettiest, fanciest name is the winner....totally unfair competition and most kids and their parents don't even know the rules of the game. Fortunately, many, many students will read your story and will brace themselves for more than a few rejection letters after reading your post.  You have helped so many students today, you just don't know it yet. I wish you many easier days and years ahead!",

I\u2019ve seen the reality of going to T20 and doing what you did. And look, congratulations, I really mean that. You\u2019re making a good financial decision.\n\nI\u2019m really trying hard not to personally attack you, but you really upset me. Dude, you have no idea how stupid I feel every single day. I\u2019ve never once been confident in my own intelligence, I even struggle right now. From what I can tell, you\u2019re not a troll. You\u2019re actually sincere. And there\u2019s real value in telling people the truth. But I can also tell you\u2019re a cynic and a kid, one who\u2019s pissed that other people can\u2019t see the world as \u201cclearly\u201d as you can. \n\nYou asked me to look at my own post and I did. You\u2019re right, this can totally look self-centered and congratulatory. But return the favor and look at your own comments. You called me dumb, a loser, and belittled me, all because I shared a tough story about myself. Dude, can\u2019t you be the guy \u201cwho tells like it is\u201d without being a complete scumbag? I knew people like you. Guys who had everything figured out and everyone else were idiots. I even empathize with that because I thought that way too sometimes when I was your age. I don\u2019t know what to say dude, I just hope this side of you is only apparent on Reddit. I actually think you\u2019re trying to help people but in reality, you aren\u2019t received well because genuine care comes from a place of concern, not bewilderment and anger.",

Read what you wrote; YOU\u2019RE the one who thinks they\u2019ve \u201cgot it all figured out.\u201d\n\n> But I don\u2019t know dude, explain to me how this is bullshit. I looked at this sub for an hour and saw the obscenely high expectations people put on themselves. I offered my own experience on how I screwed up everything with my own arrogance and shortsightedness. I just wanted to express to people it\u2019s not the end of the world like I thought it was. I seriously damaged my own mental health at the expense of this process and I felt awful for everyone that had to suffer through it like I did.\n\nPoint proven. Read that bullshit paragraph that contains what YOU think is a good life-lesson. You\u2019re telling people to lower their expectations because YOU personally couldn\u2019t handle being rejected. Not everyone is so emotionally unstable that a rejection sends them into a downward spiral for the rest of their life like it did to you. High expectations foster hard work which fosters success. It\u2019s too bad that it didn\u2019t work out for you, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have the right to tell everyone else what they should do because you fucked up. People who are more intelligent than you *will* achieve their expectations, maybe even exceed their expectations. \n\nThe fact is that you shouldn\u2019t have gone to a prestigious university in the first place because you don\u2019t have the mentality that creates success. So don\u2019t come on here with a bullshit, horrible life-lesson on a sub full of impressionable teenagers looking to quash their drives to succeed. Only an idiot reads this post and thinks, \u201cDamn, he\u2019s right.\u201d You failed, and now you\u2019re attempting to stop people from even trying. Bullshit. But people in this sub upvote it because it sounds good. It\u2019s the type of lesson someone teaches you to make you feel better yet the type that isn\u2019t grounded in reality.",

I was just telling a story about how high expectations don\u2019t meet reality it can be tough to move on, just like I did. People seemed to care so much about diversity on their apps here I thought I\u2019d share mine.\n\nI don\u2019t get it dude, I go over this shit in my post about me being arrogant and not getting shit. \n\nThe difference between me and you, I\u2019m gonna guess, is I didn\u2019t deserve anything I wanted and instead got exactly what I deserved. I knew much smarter people at my high school than me that had similar stories to myself who didn\u2019t have the same advantages I did but what do I know.\n\nI saw your post history and noticed you\u2019re going to Yale. Congratulations, but this also confirmed exactly what I thought when I read your comment. You\u2019re a kid whose dreams are coming true and you probably know guys like me who wanted something like that but you know for a fact that you did everything better than them or you deserve it. You were on the opposite side of that resentment towards my friends that I felt in high school. \n\nI also think you completely missed the point of the story. I probably didn\u2019t even deserve to go to some of these schools, something I 100% acknowledge.\n\nI wrote this whole thing and then realized I\u2019m probably not gonna get through to you. You probably have seen a few times people like me moan about unfairness and stuff and now that the pendulum swung your way, you think it\u2019s nonsense and they\u2019re just delusional. I wasn\u2019t delusional, I could\u2019ve been better informed, but I also overcame a lot in college and that\u2019s the whole fucking point of the story.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a pity party, I just wanted kids (like you) to know that life isn\u2019t over. You\u2019re still special and intelligent and worthy despite your applications\u2019 shortcomings. This is extremely evident from the fact that the top 25% of my graduating class at college is in T20 grad schools, law schools, and Ph.D programs. They didn\u2019t let where they went stop them from reaching high afterwards.\n\nAnd considering you said I \u201cgot mine.\u201d That\u2019s pretty cruel but it\u2019s something I expect from a 17 year old who hasn\u2019t gone through anything yet. I didn\u2019t realize the permanent damage to my psyche and well-being was something I deserved for thinking I could go to UVA. Just think about that for a second.\n\nI was gonna say something about college knocking you down a peg, but that\u2019s also probably gonna fall on deaf ears. I think you just read parts of my post and think I\u2019m another one of these \u201cwhy does the white man have to suffer\u201d martyrs when it\u2019s really only a small part of a story about applications, transferring, success, and relativity.",
