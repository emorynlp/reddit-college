I'd be fine with an in-person interview in a public space (and would probably even prefer it over a virtual one), but the MIT website says that all interviews will be virtual...\n\nWill it be an issue if I take the in-person option?",

So i\u2019d say just go with what you feel most comfortable with & the environment you feel like you can thrive the most (but don\u2019t stress bc there\u2019s not too much weight on interviews it can only help)",
