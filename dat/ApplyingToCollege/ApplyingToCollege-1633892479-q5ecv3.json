There wasn\u2019t that much difference between need aware, 100% domestic demonstrated need met (and no loans to meet that need for some income groups) WashU vs need blind schools with the same demonstrated need support. \n\nWashU had 41% of all FT undergrads receiving schollies/grants in their aid packages vs about 45% for similar need support need blind schools. The actual aid per recipient at WashU was higher though. \n\nThe take here is that all else equal, 10 applicants with need getting into a need blind WashU, 9 still probably got in with a need aware WashU. And if you do get in, your aid will be better. That\u2019s the trade off they were making by remaking need aware for so long. \n\nAt 41% getting aid and 42% getting in ED, they must be pulling pretty good aid numbers in ED too. If only 30% of ED was getting need based grant/scholly aid, that would mean that RD is roughly 50/50. I can\u2019t see the difference being that big. Otherwise they\u2019d be missing out on a bunch of full pay kids who had their sights set on T10s in the EA/ED rounds.",
