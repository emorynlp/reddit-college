I'm at or above the 75th percentile for EBRW at all my schools, and while my math score is pretty good too, at my ED it's only 10 points above the 25th percentile, and at a few schools my math score is below the 25th percentile. I'm applying for a STEM major too.\n\nNot too worried about it though. If I was, then I would've taken the SAT more than once to try to improve my score. Test scores are becoming so decreasingly relevant that a slightly low math SAT most certainly won't be the reason I don't get in. I probably won't get in anyway, but that won't be the reason why.",
