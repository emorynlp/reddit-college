      "text": "Their logo isn\u2019t even centered correctly which is a red flag given it\u2019s one of the best schools in world. If they can\u2019t do that right, can they really be trusted at all?\n\nAlso, how hard is it to make a different official abbreviation than the state school you\u2019re already going to be confused with. Why not \u201cUPenn\u201d on the sweaters instead of just \u201cPenn.\u201d GOSH!\n\nThey also have a very bad rep when it comes to legacy and rich people admissions. Not to mention being one of the first on \u201chighest depression rates\u201d of ALL SCHOOLS IN THE US. It\u2019s also like they just overlook the blatant racism within their community. Like GEEZ, GET IT TOGETHER. \n\nThere\u2019s a million more reasons to hate Penn, but these were just a few. I got rejected too. We hate Penn now.",

      "text": "No disrespect to Penn. however, I have heard many students say the social scene is very stiff, it can be harder there than many other schools to form genuine relationships beyond surface-level connection making. I imagine that would be very wearisome after 4 years, and almost dehumanizing. \n\nCollege is comprised of so many factors, and broadening your worldview and educating yourself in emotional intelligence by forming deep, reciprocal relationships is suuuch a huge aspect of the equation. So don\u2019t worry! You may have dodged a soggy social life! Rejection is a part of life, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge how great of an institution Penn is, but getting rejected is no reflection on you. You\u2019ll do well. Brush the dirt off from this fall and get back up. You\u2019ve got this!",
