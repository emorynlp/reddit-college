  "title:": "A2C Color Change Idea",
  "text": "What if we changed A2C's color from the current pale, sickly mint to \"***Common App Green***?\" The current color just seems a little depressing, and I feel like sprucing the sub up with a brighter green would make it livelier (also, green = good luck for March decisions). Just a thought!\n\nHere's an example draft, with a side-by-side comparison:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/aul5iHw](https://imgur.com/a/aul5iHw)\n\n*Note: \"Common App Green\" is the color you get from successfully submitting an application.*\n\nEDIT: The icon is just an example with the color, not a complete draft. ALSO, the color will look different whether you're viewing on mobile or desktop. If you're on mobile, you have to actually click the imgur link to see the color (it's darker than what it shows on the Reddit app), although the resolution will be lower. Optimal viewing on desktop.",

The problem is that these lines are the busiest in the system, and often very crusty as a result.
