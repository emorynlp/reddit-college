They mostly did business and from what I know they all got good jobs. A lot of them work in Atlanta now for banks and stuff. I know another person who went to auburn and is working a very similar job.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019d matter just see which you\u2019d enjoy going to more (look at shit like social scene or dorms or if there\u2019s some classes only offered at one school, etc)",
