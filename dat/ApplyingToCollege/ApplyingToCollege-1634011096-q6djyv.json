      "text": "at this point not too much you could do, but stay in the class anyways because understanding precalculus will pay dividends for your mathematical reasoning abilities going forward in life\n\nfuck them if they want to shit on you lol, >60% of the time ppl are in these advanced math classes because they grew up privileged and got fed opportunities to move ahead early in life, not because they're actually smarter or more hard working. some kids i knew in calc bc junior year couldn't figure out how to escape a cardboard box even if a box cutter was stuck inside with them. on the other hand i knew multiple people who took pre calculus as seniors in HS who are quite sharp and doing just fine for themselves in college.\n\nof course there's people who take calc bc early and are smart and people in pre calc who are dumb, that's not the point i'm making, more that the math class you're in is a terrible indicator of your intelligence and using it against anyone is stupid af. academic bullying is really something else",
