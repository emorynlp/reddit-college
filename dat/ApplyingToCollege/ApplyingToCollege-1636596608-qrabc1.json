  "text": "I have been using the CommonApp, and have already submitted 3 applications to colleges. However, I just noticed a typo in my activities section. I listed that I had \"competed in marathon in fall 2022\" when really it was in 2020.\n\nI'm hoping this mistake is obvious, but there's always the chance that they think I've signed up for a fall 2022 marathon without actually doing it and I'm trying to run some grift. Should I reach out to an admissions office for this? What should I say?",
