Then actually going there and realizing the culture there is toxic af and not enjoyable whatsoever. This is why it is really important to reach out to any students you might know there or ones you know online to ask before you commit to that school.",

Sure, classes can be stressful, but it seems like the \"culture\" is actually encouraging hanging out over studying most of the time - the opposite of stress culture. I can't speak on JHU, but Columbia definitely doesn't have a uniquely noticeable stress culture (especially for humanities) given that my friends at other Ivies tend to complain a lot more about that sort of thing (@ Harvard).",
