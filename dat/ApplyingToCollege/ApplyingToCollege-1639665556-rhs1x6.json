  "title:": "Update 2: Penny flipping failed me; I got rejected from Stanford. Time to slander!",
  "text": "Dear r/a2c,\n\nBoohoo. Even the universe--the fucking UNIVERSE--giving me a likely letter wasn't enough to get me admitted (see previous posts for details lol). After all, we only know with 95% confidence that the universe even exists (thanks, *p* = 0.05), but Stanford has a 96% rejection rate! I struggled with the rejection for a bit, but you know what? I got over it. How, you ask? I got mad. Really mad.\n\nTime to start the great St. Anford Smear Campaign!\n\nSo what, I didn't get into ~~Stanford~~ a fake school that doesn't exist? Here are the reasons I'm currently mad and not at all disappointed:\n\n1. ...it's all fake, it's all a pyramid scheme, and they stole my $90. But let's ignore this fact for a moment and move on with the rest of the list.\n2. I won't have to watch innocent, adorable, fluffy animals get impaled brutally on a spike in the middle of a fountain every year. Nor will I have to watch the fountain run red with the poor animals' blood. I *feel* for the teddy bears. What have they ever done to those Stanford monsters to deserve such treatment?\n3. \"*Stanford is a Harvard WaNnAbE. It'll never be as great!*\" \\~Big Bird and Abraham Lincoln in a joint statement to the Cat Fanciers Association, circa 2001\n4. I didn't blow $6 million on the \"u/whenisthisdue Center for Oddly Specific and Irrelevant Social Sciences,\" only to have my VIP application rescinded after Aunt Becky fucked up.\n5. I won't be forced to pretend that I know computer science, just to bluff my way to the front of the Stern taco line while talking to every student along the way about some obscure-ass coding language named after a gemstone.\n6. I'll get to experience temperature variation! There must be some weird sci-fi shit going on at Stanford. Like, how do you get a daily average temperature that's 66+/-10 degrees F year-round? Must've been some meteorology project gone wrong.\n7. I won't have to go to some stupid-idiot Berkeley reject school.\n8. St. Anford was probably some vile, raucous asshole who butchered children and started pandemics.\n9. I won't be faced with ridiculous medical costs after running into people at full biking speed on the Circle of Death, not to mention being forced to pay $30 for takeout that looks like boiled, coagulated shit when I'm bedridden (thanks to /u/federalkitten for bringing this transgression of human rights to our notice).\n\nWhat a truly awful place to be, let alone spend 4 years developing into the person you will be for the rest of your life. Add your reasons to hate this fake school in the comments, and I'll try to update this list as much as possible! Vive le Smear Campaign!\n\nYours truly,\n\n/u/whenisthisdue\n\n\n\nP.S. Stanford was my dream for many years, and getting rejected sucks. :(",
