  "text": "So I just finished my Alevels and have received offers of admission from unis in Canada and the UK. I'm confused about where to go and was wondering if anyone had any advice. I feel like the UK would be a better choice as I don't plan on staying there after I graduate and the university ranks higher than the one in Canada. However, Canada would be cheaper and I would have a more comfortable life there as I have close family there. \n\nAlso I would be studying economics, politics and international relations in the UK and just history and politics in Canada. So, in terms of job prospects I feel like the former would be better. \n\nI'm looking for any advice or recommendations. I've asked several people and have gotten mixed reactions. \n\nTia",

      "text": "Montreal is beautiful and Concordia is a great school, but it kind of lives in the shadow of McGill University, which is right next door. It's not terrible, just annoying when people first assume that you're a McGill student.\n\nSame deal with Ryerson, which is in the shadow of UofT. Ryerson has it worst because everyone makes fun of them.\n\nHave you made a pros/cons list?\n\nTry flipping a coin for Canada vs UK, and see if the result scares you or excites you. It's a silly thing but sometimes it works.",
