  "text": "**I'm so sorry you were rejected.**\n\nAnd no matter what you're feeling right now, I hope you know it's **completely okay** to feel upset, angry, frustrated, conflicted, or a mix of all those emotions at once.  You're not selfish for wishing it were different.  You're not entitled for wishing you could be going to that school.  You had a future imagined for yourself, and it felt very real to you, and it's okay if it takes time to process it won't happen.  The thing about thoughts are that thoughts dance around our head when they don't have the chance to sing, so it's okay to let them sing.  They can feel really consuming, and **they're so, so, so, so hard**, especially when you are rejected from a school you have been imagining yourself at for a while.\n\nI've noticed that a lot of people have been talking about how rejections don't define people, and how you'll find a great place for you someday.  While a lot of these comments have great intentions, and it is completely true that rejections don't define you in the very long run, I think that it can feel invalidating because they do have a place in our thoughts, and right now, it does feel like this rejection defines you.  And that's completely understandable.\n\nYou have the complete right to feel conflicted because you've devoted so much time and energy into creating your application, spending countless nights studying for tests and working on projects, devoting a lot of your free time for all the work you needed to do outside of class, going through rough times in your past life and hoping that college will make up for it, being vulnerable in your applications, and usually, you did these things even when there was something else you truly wanted to do.  The things you gave up can even feel like they were in vain because you wonder what could happened if you did x instead of y.  You may be questioning a lot of things right now, and so, it's totally understandable it feels like it defines you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I also realize that words fail, and everything I said may mean nothing right now.  I know **they can never ever** unfortunately illuminate how hurtful it is to be going through such a brutal process, but I still want to say that I am so sorry this is happening to you because it's totally valid to wish it wasn't, and getting rejected anywhere, but especially from one of your favorite schools, is a lot to have to deal with.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**And P.S. for everyone who was deferred from one of their top choices**, I hope you all know it's okay to feel down from that too!  It's definitely tough to be put in a position where there's so much uncertainty, and I hope you all know all your feelings are very valid as well.\n\nI'm wishing you all the best with your other decisions and applications!  I'm rooting for you all.\n\nHave a nice day!",
