  "title:": "Should I be a Semester Page?",
  "text": "So I applied to be a summer page. The senators office recently emailed me and asked if I would like to instead go to the Spring session and basically offered to sponsor me for that session.\n\nI am conflicted as to wether or not it is worth it. I am involved in a lot of organizations so going for a semester would disrupt a lot of that work. Also, academics would get interrupted and I would go second semester into classes where everyone is at a different difficulty level.\n\nWhat should I do? I am very passionate about politics and think its a great opportunity but am conflicted about leaving my EC commitments more than anything else.\n\nIs the school super hard? Don\u2019t really want ruin my GPA here (current uw 4). From an AO perspective, **would going for a semester seem much more meaningful and impressive than going for 3/4 weeks in the summe**r. Do they care?\n\nKind of wanted to do other programs so that would open that up\u2026\n\nVery conflicted. Could use any and all advice.",
