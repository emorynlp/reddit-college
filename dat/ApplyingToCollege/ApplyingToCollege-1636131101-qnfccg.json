  "title:": "How to Write a College Essay in 15 Days",
  "text": "## Summary\n\n* Write an outline first: the outline should be made up of the details of the overall format and points you want to include in your essay.\n* Set mini-deadlines: what needs to be done each day to finish the essay on time? Refer to our step-by-step guide above!\n* Don\u2019t get multiple feedback from numerous people \u2014 stick to a select few to receive feedback.\n* Don\u2019t change your topic multiple times: believe in yourself and commit to one topic after you\u2019ve decided!\n\n## Step by Step Guide: 15 Days\n\nThis is a step-by-step guide to finishing an essay when you have 15 days left before the deadline. You can use this guide as mini-guidelines as well \u2014 the subtitles next to each day can be used as deadlines for yourself!\n\n**Day 1\\~3: Write 5 Possible Ideas**\n\nThe first three days should be used to brainstorm ideas for the essay. Pick out keywords from the essay prompt and think of specific experiences in your life that can be related to the keyword. For example, if the prompt asks you to write about community engagement, think of all the experiences you\u2019ve had volunteering or giving back to the communities you\u2019re part of. Even the most trivial experiences can be excellent topics. Use our app, USSIST if you\u2019re having trouble with this process! Use up to 3 days for brainstorming, and you should write down at least 5 possible ideas for the essay.\n\n**Day 4: Write an Outline**\n\nDay 4 is where you write the outline for the essay. Choose the idea that best conveys your values and who you are to admissions officers. If you\u2019re having difficulties choosing topics, write outlines for both to see which is better. When writing the outline, remember what we said above in part 2 of this article. Jot down the details of the experience and what you learned from it. Afterward, structure the details into the workings of an essay \u2014 what details will go in the beginning, middle, and end?\n\n**Day 5\\~6: Write the First Draft of your Essay**\n\nDay 5 and 6 should be used to write the first draft of your essay. Don\u2019t think about the word limit- refer to the outline while writing everything you think should be part of the essay.\n\n**Day 7: Cut Down**\n\nThis is when you cut down on what you wrote. Are there details that don\u2019t contribute to the overall theme of the essay? Any unnecessary adjectives and adverbs? Try to look for sentences that disrupt the flow of the essay, or ones that simply repeat what\u2019s already been said. Use this day to trim the essay down to the word limit that\u2019s been given to you.\n\n**Day 8: Ask for Feedback**\n\nNow is the time to ask for feedback! We recommend going to a teacher that knows you well and has experience with college admissions. Or, it can be a college student that\u2019s been accepted to the college you\u2019re applying to with this essay. Ask him or her politely if you can receive feedback! Remember, you\u2019re under a time crunch, so don\u2019t ask for feedback from as many people as possible and choose a select few.\n\n**Day 9: Edit the Essay**\n\nCompile the feedback that\u2019s been given to you and look for a common theme. Is there a problem everyone\u2019s noticing? That will be the biggest problem area of your essay, and the area you should focus most on when editing the essay. Afterward, look through the feedback again and edit it accordingly to what others have written.\n\n**Day 10: Take a Break**\n\nThis might be the last thing you expected to hear from us! But taking a break is important to get a more objective look into your essay. You\u2019ve worked on it non-stop for the last week, and this is often when it gets extremely difficult to find problems with the essay. So, take a break and don\u2019t feel guilty about it. It\u2019s all part of the writing process!\n\n**Day 11 \\~12: Restructure the essay**\n\nYou\u2019ve taken a break, and now it\u2019s time to come back to the essay with a fresher perspective. Read the essay again, and focus on restructuring. This means looking for points you made that don\u2019t contribute to the overall message you\u2019re trying to convey. It also means moving around sentences and paragraphs to improve the overall flow of the essay. Right now, it\u2019s okay to make big changes that affect the overall structure!\n\n**Day 13: Edit, edit, edit**\n\nSpend your whole day with the essay and focus on editing. However, this is not when you make big changes. Focus on minor edits, and don\u2019t be too harsh on yourself. You can record yourself reading the essay out loud and listen to it again. Are there sentences that don\u2019t go well together? Or, are there better word choices for what you want to express?\n\n**Day 14: Proofread**\n\nThis is when you proofread your essay to make sure it doesn\u2019t contain any major spelling or grammatical errors. We recommend you use \u201cGrammarly\u201d (grammarly.com). You can also read your essay out loud, or print the essay to look for mistakes on paper.\n\n**Day 15: Last-minute edits**\n\nRead the essay one last time, and make some last-minute edits. Lastly, submit the essay on time!",

      "text": "Great advice!\n\n  \nIf you are reading this and you don't have 15 days (or if you have 30 essays to write by December), don't panic!  You can also condense the OP's advice into a shorter time frame (2-3 hours).\n\n(1) Brainstorm ideas -- come up with 2 or 3 along with an idea of what your thesis will be for each.  Rank your ideas. (15 minutes).\n\n(2) Start writing!  Don't worry too much about specific details or word count, just get something down on your screen.  If you get stuck after a few sentences, start again with your #2 choice above and see if that works better (30 minutes).\n\n(3) Edit and refine.  Reorganize.  This is the step that will involve feedback from others (friends, family) if you have them.  (30 minutes)\n\n(4) Fine tune.  How's the flow?  Read it out loud to identify awkwardness, meandering thoughts, or grammar errors.  Edit accordingly. (15 minutes)\n\n(5) Let it sit.  Do something else for 30 minutes to 1 hour.  Preferably something relaxing to clear your mind. (This is actually an important step).\n\n(6) Come back to it and repeat Step 4.  You'll be surprised at the fresh take you'll have.  Edit once more. (15 minutes)\n\n(7) Check for format and visual aesthetics. Submit. (5 minutes)\n\nNot ideal, but sometimes you'll be up against a time crunch.  You can do this -- don't feel paralyzed by a desire for perfection -- JUST TYPE and see what you get.  You'll likely come up with something pretty darned good.",
