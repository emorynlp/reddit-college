  "text": "hi everyone! i went through the application process last year and in honor of passing 1 year since dec 15 aka stanford decision date, I thought I would share some of my experiences and wisdom (?) with a bit of hindsight. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ni was deferred stanford rea last year, then rejected. that really hurt. and the deferral I thought was a great sign, that I would get into almost every school I wanted and stanford too.  when decisions came out and I was rejected from Harvard, yale, upenn,  Berkeley, and stanford, I was crushed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHOWEVER it has been a year now. i am a current first year at UCLA aka the best college in the nation and I couldn't be happier. not to say that UCLA wasn't one of my top choices because it was, but I do want people out there to know that there is life after deferral or rejection or waitlists. as bts says, life goes on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nit's been a year and I've made great friends at college, had tons of experiences, gotten to live somewhere away from home and be independent, and I love my professors. what more could I ask for? well, after ivy day and stanford rejection, I was wondering what I worked so hard for all four years of high school. what was the point? the point, my friends, is that we do the best we can. and sometimes things just don't go our way. i have no regrets about how I chose to spend my time in high school, but I will be and am doing things differently in college. isn't that the nice thing about life - that we can reinvent ourselves at any time?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbeing on this sub and at my extremely competitive and toxic high school, it was easy to forget that some people don't go to college and have no interest whatsoever. and those people are worth just as much as those who get into every ivy. it's not all about the name, it's not all about the school. the truth is, it's what you make of it. you could be miserable at Harvard and thriving at a community college, or the other way around. (from moana, you must find happiness right where you are LOL)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou'll be okay. i promise!! i hope this helped provide at least a bit of comfort, pls feel free to reach out if u have questions or wanna talk! :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n<3 kay",
