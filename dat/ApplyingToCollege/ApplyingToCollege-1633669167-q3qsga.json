  "text": "To all of my seniors applying to college, you have got this. I was exactly in your shoes one year ago and it was one of the worst times of my life. I was so filled with the anxiety of getting rejected from my top school and felt like I would not get anywhere in life. I visited this sub so much and felt so little in comparison one here to everyone else in here. Applying to college was so difficult for  me and every step of it terrified me so much. I got into all of my schools (besides Stanford smh) and while I got into my dream school, I didn\u2019t go to it because I got little to no financial rewards. I now am laying in my bed, as happy as I can be in one of my last choice schools. I\u2019m really loving it. The people. Everything about it. If you\u2019re struggling like I was, please know that it is going to be okay. I challenge you all to think about where you will be a year from now. You may not know it, i know I definitely didn\u2019t. But that\u2019s okay, and I hope you know that it is okay to feel that way. So many amazing things are coming for each and every one of you. I believe in all of you so much. Please believe in yourself too. Sincerely, a college freshman",

      "text": "Alright, kids, gather round for Mama-Millennial to tell you a story.\n\nI jest. 27F chiming in. Went to private school in Europe for 1st-12th grade. Pressure was *absolutely* *extraordinary*. Anything below a 3.8 GPA was considered bad. Anything other than an Ivy school was looked down upon. If you didn't get into an Ivy, or weren't projected to make it into an Ivy, you were treated like scum. They would imply that you'd be homeless if you didn't make it into an Ivy, and that your life would amount to *nothing*, if an Ivy wasn't your next chapter. \n\nWell, as a teenager with an autoimmune disease that had me absent and in the hospital a *lot*, my grades suffered. *Badly*. A smattering of C's and one or two D's. My college counselors made it sound like I wouldn't even get into community college. They made me feel as though my life had been a complete waste up until then, that nothing I did was worth anything, and that all my hard work meant nothing. I truly thought my life was over, and I was barely 18 at the time. \n\nI worked my ass off to prove everyone wrong, from teachers to my college counselors to my parents, etc. The person I surprised the most? Myself. \n\nI ended up graduating with mostly B's, and one or two A's. Got recognized with honors during the graduation ceremony. I was so paranoid about college that I applied to *17* colleges. Yes, you read that right. 5-6 dream schools, 5-6 likely matches, and 4-5 safety schools. All were still decent schools, regardless of what I had chosen. I thought *maybe* I'd get into 1-2 of them. So, imagine my surprise when I got into *14* of them. I remember exactly where I was when I received my first acceptance; past 5PM, on a Friday afternoon, still at school. I literally did cartwheels down the hallway.\n\nI'm now 27. After university, I got hired at one of the world's largest tech companies. I'll let you guess. HQ is in Seattle, WA. They make computers, tablets, etc. I performed very well there, and was incredibly successful in my role, and even managed my own team. Three years ago, I got poached by a different employer, and I now work at one of the world's largest and most respected financial institutions in the world. I make six figures, I'm a homeowner, etc. \n\nAnd you know what? *NOT* *ONE* of my employers after university *ever* asked for my grades or transcripts. By and large, all employers care about is that you got *a* degree, doesn't matter which university. I went to a run-of-the-mill state school that had campuses all over their state. \n\nWith the exception of certain professions, such as medicine or law, *where* you got your degree, *what* grades you got, *what* you majored in, and more, doesn't matter. Once you're 3-5 years out of school, nobody is going to give two hoots about where you went to college, what your degree is in, what grades you got, or anything to do with your academic life. \n\nI had zero intentions of working in IT; I fell into it unintentionally by way of my foreign language expertise. I'm talking couldn't-even-do-pivot-tables type of IT knowledge, and I *still* got hired at a tech giant. I had/have zero finance knowledge, and still got hired at a huge financial firm. One of my coworkers? She's a software engineer, but her degree was in frigging *music*. So if my *coworker* and *I* can survive total academic and career shifts with *zero* formal training or experience, then I *know* you guys can do it! \n\nYou guys are technical whizzes, far smarter and technically-inclined than I ever was or will be, so I *know* you guys will survive and thrive. You *WILL* survive this period, and you will get through this. Keep your chin up. It's okay to cry or feel defeated, just remember to keep putting one foot in front of the other, and take everything one day at a time. Tomorrow is a new day.",

So inspiring to know that if my major isn\u2019t a perfect fit (even though I love it right now), I can still do something else. Thank you so much \u2764\ufe0f",
