  "title:": "I\u2019m going to be graduating from high school in a few months, and here are my regrets and mistakes you should avoid in high school\u2026",
  "text": "1. Make friends, genuine friends, and remember, quality comes over quantity: Perhaps one of the most important tips I\u2019d love to give to high school students is to make friends, because that\u2019s something I\u2019ve never put effort into. Hence, I\u2019m technically going to graduate with almost no friends, and those who I have friendships with are the type of friendships that aren\u2019t long lasting and formal. Remember, try to keep your social circle small, having a few friends who are loyal beyond limits is vastly superior than having innumerable friends who are also enemies under disguise and will stab you in the back whenever they fulfill the benefits of befriending you. The relationships you\u2019re going to build during high school are going to be eternal; They will last forever. Therefore, don\u2019t sell yourself short like I did and MAKE SOME FRIENDS. \n\n2.  Take care of your mental health: If you\u2019re as ambitious as I am, chances are that you\u2019ll suffer during high school and depression is going to INVADE you. Hence, unlike me, do take care of your mental health and seek help from teachers and peers whenever you feel demotivated. I always strived for the highest marks possible because I am a competitive person, but that is something I regret, because it effected my mental health tremendously. The question that may come in your mind is that did I actually get the marks I worked hard and sacrificed my mental health and social life for? The answer is NO. That is because there is a fine line of differentiation between working hard and working smart, there are numerous high school students who will be graduating with grades immensely higher than mine without the need of sacrificing their social lives and mental health. Thus, don\u2019t be stupid like your older Brother here who committed every type of blunder while in high school. \n\n3. Failing a test isn\u2019t the end of the world: I can\u2019t stress enough on this point.. do you know that whatever your marks are when you graduate, as long as you graduate, you\u2019re guaranteed a place at a university in whatever major you want (except Medicine) in many European countries? That is because getting lower marks than expected or failing a test isn\u2019t the end of the world, by this, I don\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t work smart and hard, please work hard and smart, but if you get lower/sub-par marks, that\u2019s not an issue! Worst case scenario, you\u2019ll repeat the year but if you\u2019ve read this article up to this point, that means that you\u2019re a great student who cares about school  and you\u2019ll do more than excellent during high school, just make sure that you have the right mentality and work ethic, again, unlike your stupid older brother Musa who completely screwed up when it came to the work ethic. I didn\u2019t get the marks that I worked hard for, but I\u2019m still thriving and doing well and I also got accepted at some of the top 50 colleges in the world! \n\n4. You are a HUMAN, not a ROBOT: Don\u2019t spend nights and days cramming for an upcoming exam because you\u2019ll burnout and lose the will and passion to study, please take breaks, hangout with your friends, parents and Family, or go for a walk! For 4 years that I spent in high school, what I basically did was to cram for tests and it Screwed me up real good. I would almost always end up with unsatisfactory marks. We\u2019re humans, we\u2019re not perfect, and most importantly, we are equipped with HEARTS. So, don\u2019t be a robot and enjoy life, even in the most stressful times of your journey in high school. If you know what you want to do after graduation and you\u2019re set on a career, try, for example, joining clubs or initiatives related to that field and enjoy yourself! Don\u2019t be like me, MARKS ARE NOT EVERYTHING. \n\n5. Don\u2019t be over sensitive: Friends and teachers are going to make fun of you, girls are going to laugh at you for no reason (it happened with me) and you\u2019ll get ghosted by many friends who won\u2019t invite you to parties, study sessions and hangouts. This happened UNCOUNTABLE times with me, but I slowly learnt that that\u2019s how life is, nobody can be trusted, not even you\u2019re closest friend, trust me when I say that (the irony lol). If one of those things happens to you, just try to avoid that person or people and stop seeing them, because they\u2019re toxic people who strive to ruin your life. \n\nFinal advice: Enjoy school and make the best out of it, these are tips I would give to my younger self, and I promised myself to never repeat these mistakes in College. Trust me when I say it, you\u2019ll miss high school when it ends, and this is coming from a senior who has not graduated yet, there are a lot of mistakes that I wish to travel in a time machine to fix, but unfortunately, that is not an option. I am looking forward to what the future holds for me and I believe that if I avoid these mistakes during college, I\u2019m going to live the best days of my life these. Sure, I\u2019ve had some great memories and moments from high school, but they weren\u2019t as much as to dwell in the ocean of my memory for an eternity. Dear self, I promise to not let you down during and after college, and I am deeply apologetic for all the bad days we went through, but I guess that\u2019s life, isn\u2019t it? We learn through trial and error and we NEVER repeat mistakes we once committed\u2026",
