  "title:": "ive forgotten that its not about how many schools accept me",
  "text": "ive become so obsessed with this application process that i keep adding new schools to my list and comparing each school to another. ive become obsessed with trying to collect college acceptances like pokemon cards that my intentions behind applying have become skewed. i find myself considering applying to schools not because i wanna go there but because i wanna see if i have what it takes to get in. i forget that after all of this im gonna study at one of them and the end goal isnt just getting into as many colleges as i can. this process has driven me a little insane but i cant stop.",

There are friends, family members, tasty foods, movies, novels, concerts, sporting events, hikes, lonely pets, Netflix programs, and holiday movies that all require your attention.  Once you\u2019re in college, you\u2019ll likely have less access to some of these items and less time for still others. Get some joy.",
