She had this cool blog where she encouraged readers to write to her and I did (can't remember exactly what, but it was mostly expressing how she was an inspiration and asking her how she got involved in research in high school)\n\nShe replied like a year later with advertising for 30 min $15 calls about college advice relating to MIT, which was obviously why she decided to respond to my message lol\n\nAnyways... glad I got out of that mindset where I would put prestigious colleges and their students on a special pedestal",

Also her prices are not that expensive, and I live in Argentina where 1 dollar equals 150 Argentinian pesos soo yeah.",

For example, I had a transfer student this year who was applying to T10s in his field with a ~3.7 GPA and an F on his transcript.  Grammarly and \"have a spike\" would be worthless in this case.  We did a ton of work on his essays and strategized around his weaknesses.  He got into 3 T10s and is attending his top choice (EECS at Berkeley, which has a ~5% admit rate).  Situations like that are simply not going to happen for a \"consultant\" who just got into a top school and then hung out a digital shingle shilling their \"admissions expertise.\"  This was not easy and took hours of one-on-one work to make it happen.  A huge part of this was carefully crafting specific messages into his application in ways that the reviewer would find compelling.  That is art, not science and is also not easy.  I share a TON of free information about admissions here on A2C and I've heard students say things like \"Why would you pay to work with him when you can get all of his advice for free?\"  The problem is that crafting a top application isn't a predefined process.  There's no formula that makes it easy.  There's no set of rules to follow or things to do/say that will work.  Finding the very best way to present each individual student is really complex, and that can't be done by running an essay through Grammarly or giving vague and generic advice.  It's why I get many clients who have already read everything I've posted - they want that expertise working for them.\n\nBut here's the other thing - my students get in, and that's why about half of my work comes from repeat customers and referrals. 2020 was the worst year on record for admit rates at top schools and it was my best.  I think a lot of this is due to essays mattering more than they ever have before.  I can give you more stats if you want them, but I'm not trying to flex - I'm trying to help you understand why a qualified professional with actual experience both as a reviewer and as a successful consultant would be better than an 18 year old who has never done it before.  A student might know what worked for them, but they have no idea what will work for anyone else, especially people who are very different from them.",

Does your essay vibe well with your particular region\u2019s admission officer(s)? Did you strike your interviewer particularly well? Maybe your ecs hit home just perfectly.\n\nYou do need to be good in some way, but the *most* anyone can tell you is: \u201cGet good grades. Get good test scores, get good portfolio, write gud m9\u201d. The only resource I can even barely recommend is someone who can connect you to other people. I\u2019d be willing to pay for a counselor who can tell me interesting programs, direct me to excellent classes and amazing people. I\u2019d pay someone for any of those 3 and you can be sure that some broke college student trying to scam high school seniors has none of those.",

I'm not taking anything away from students' in-depth research on colleges or on the hard work on their own application.  That's meaningful.  That doesn't mean it's monetizable in terms of being a credible admissions consultant.\n\nEven if you get on campus and see your own file, you will not necessarily have the broad perspective that will be sufficiently helpful to other candidates to be worth charging money for it.",

They had a lot of connections to their main extracurriculars through their mom - that\u2019s how they got a lot of what they did, still impressive sure but it\u2019s not like they did it 100% themselves. They got a low 1500s SAT, which isn\u2019t bad at all but isn\u2019t really an \u201celite\u201d score for top schools, maybe average or a tiny bit below. Immediately after they got in, they made a \u201ccollege consulting\u201d thing and advertised it for like $50/hour as \u201cconsulting for one of the nation\u2019s most elite students\u201d. Dude stg that shit made me so angry lol\n\nEdit: also, I did get into a T10 and will be attending it myself. I am more than open for any questions, especially to FG/LI people who lack resources and connections like the person I described above. That said, I am in no way an expert and can\u2019t claim to know what got me in at all.",
