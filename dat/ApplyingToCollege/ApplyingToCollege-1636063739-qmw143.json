  "text": "I have a fee waiver so I just wanna shotgun some in state schools for safeties and for the fun of it. I also wanna shotgun some top schools that have optional supplements like Harvard even though I am not interested (wouldn\u2019t have applied unless I had a fee waiver). How much will you think me not doing their supplements affect me? I feel like for the high acceptance rate in state schools I will just get auto admitted from my stats alone and for top schools I will just screw up any chance I have but a 1% chance is better than a 0% chance (not applying) am I right????",
