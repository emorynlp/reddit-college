  "title:": "hard work can only go so far, rejected from college because of the need for financial aid.",
  "text": "International student from South Asia. \n\nI applied to a college for EA and got my decision today.  I was rejected and the reason they don't want to offer me a place at that college is my financial need for aid. They stated that they do not have enough scholarships to cover the level of financial assistance I need, and also said \"If your financial situation improves, I encourage you to let us know.\"\n\nIn that case, what should I do? This is my first college result, and I'm scared that my financial position will prevent me from fulfilling my dream of going to college even to the others I applied to. I am feeling hopeless now. It is making me even more sad that they didn't reject me because of my application. AAAAAAAAAAAAAA...\n\nDoes anyone know how much of an increase in EFC would get me into that college, as they mentioned?",

My whole application was great and my stats were way above the average for that university. My counsellor advised me to show at least $20-25k contribution to have the slightest chance and be safe but of course I couldn't. It sucks tho, international students are and will always be at a huge disadvantage despite our intellectual capabilities. I really wish the whole applying to college process wasn't this hard for us. We deserve better.",
