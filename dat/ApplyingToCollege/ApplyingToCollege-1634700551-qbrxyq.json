  "text": "Hey, guys, I've got an odd situation. Because the shitty Christian school I was attending lost some teachers, they had a lack of classes for my senior year, and I ultimately had to leave the school. I'm now technically a homeschooler, but I am taking all of my classes at my local community college. There are some issues I'm having.\n\n1: Should I submit transcripts from my previous high school and my current community college, or should I develop a homeschool transcript and send that in?\n\n2: Can I have whichever transcript I use be simply submitted to the Common App and given to schools that way, or will I have to have it individually submitted to each college I apply to?\n\n3: Who should I put down as a counselor? If I use a homeschool transcript, I imagine it'll be a parent, but if I go with the other transcripts, who should I put? My old high school doesn't even have a counselor.\n\nI'm sorry for all of these questions, as I'm having a tough time getting answers, and I really don't wanna mess this up.",

      "text": "Who is going to issue/certify your high school graduation? The Christian school or the homeschool? You\u2019ll probably need to submit the transcript from the Christian school and your parent will need to create a homeschool transcript. Note that some colleges have different or additional requirements for homeschool students so be sure to research this for each college that you\u2019re applying to.",

          "text": "My graduation will be issued by the homeschool. If this is the case, should I have my parents create a homeschool transcript, submit that one through the common app, and have the Christian School and Community College send their transcripts to the individual universities? Also, should my parents fill out all of the counselor info on the common app? Thank you for the help, btw.",
