College Station is not a very walkable town and A&M is way too massive for my preferences, but one of my older cousins goes to A&M, majors in Business, and he's in the ROTC program. He loves it.\n\nI do like Dartmouth; the town is nice and the surrounding area is beautiful, but they don't have my major so I didn't list it.\n\nAnd I listed like 20 schools; it doesn't mean that I don't like other schools, it just means that I happen to like those 20 schools.",
