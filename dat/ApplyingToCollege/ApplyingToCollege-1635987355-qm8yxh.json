I'm now trying to figure out how to get to the Eminence Fellowship part so I can submit my stuff, but I can't find it on BuckeyeLink. Any advice?\n\nAlso, it says my app is incomplete and that my transcript is missing, but it also says that materials received in the last 10 days may not be processed/on that page yet. Should I email or just wait a day or two?",
