  "text": "I\u2019m one of the tiger parents (not really, maybe just a little ocd..). My daughter just had her Stanford interview and it couldn\u2019t have gone any better.  At the end her interviewer told her she was perfect for Stanford and she hopes my daughter gets in. She also offered to answer questions if my daughter gets in etc.  I know it\u2019s nebulous how this relates to admissions, but it\u2019s a relief that it\u2019s over.",
