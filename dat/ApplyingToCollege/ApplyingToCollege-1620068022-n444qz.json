  "title:": "Chloe from Oregon here- Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself!!",
  "text": "I had never used Reddit before until earlier this year when everything blew up with me on this page. Since then, I have read many of your posts about the college decision process, and many of your posts break my heart!! A lot of you are so hard on yourself. \n\nLet me tell you something: I didn\u2019t take a single AP class in high school. I had a mediocre GPA. I didn\u2019t apply to any UC\u2019s because there was no way I\u2019d get in. Despite all this, college has been the most amazing 4 years of my life. And now I\u2019m attending an incredible graduate program next year to finally get credentialed for my dream job: teaching high school special education. Since college decision day just happened, I know a lot of you didn\u2019t commit to your #1 schools for whatever the reason is. Maybe you weren\u2019t admitted, maybe the scholarship was not as big as it needed to be, etc. but I wanted to come on head and wish you all the best in your higher Ed journey. \n\nAt the end of the day, the label of the school or the minuscule acceptance rate of prestigious colleges mean absolutely nothing. Students in community college may go really far in life, and Harvard students may go nowhere. It really doesn\u2019t matter where you go. It\u2019s about what you do with your time spent at that place. Congratulate yourself for committing to school at all and continuing your education journey, don\u2019t dwell on what could\u2019ve been. \n\nI hope this is helpful, feel free to reach out to me if have any questions. Congratulations everyone! \u2764\ufe0f",

      "text": "I love this place already!\n\nI didn't take AP classes in High School/Junior High and GPA was good  (made student honor roll once) but SAT scores were shit. How do I get into a (possible) science major when math skills are not there either?! Advice would be cool. xD\n\nDamn this is inspiring! On a more serious note, at a CC and about to go to university (that while CC/CE/EE/etc. or science related stuff isn't the best in the nation (or so it seems), just for the state of FL) I really do love both art/science and wanted to do a science major, if not for the goddamn high 'elite/higher math wall' that blocks my path. So I choose art. But the science...calls to me in the twilight!!\n\nOh, you guys have a discord server. I'll meander over there. I don't even know who Chloe is and I like her already. :D",
