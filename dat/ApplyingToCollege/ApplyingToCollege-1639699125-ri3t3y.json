  "text": "Hi I actually just finished my first Bachelor's a couple months ago but want to go back to get an additional business MIS degree to go with my pharmaceutical sciences one I have rn. I noticed the admissions website they'll take SAT scores in addition to ETS (for foreign students who didn't take the SAT).\n\nThe last time I took the SAT was like... 5 years ago? I got a 1490/1600... will they still accept a score from that long ago? I'm REALLY not interested in taking another exam. Thanks!",

          "text": "I'm actually applying to a couple PhD programs, but I'm having severe anxiety. When you're doing a PhD, you get paid while doing research. When doing a Master's, you pay out of your own pocket. Here's a little back story...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring my final semester of my major, my program director told our class of... 20 (so small lmao - our entire major year was only 20 people haha) that we'd be lucky to land a job with 45k. I didn't quite believe him bc glass door and other employment sites were saying different. Well... all of us went job hunting and it wasn't pretty!\n\nThe most basic positions was like a tech for 17/hr (\\~33k/year). Those required high school diplomas... The next step up was for Associate Scientist I or something similar... which took Bachelor's but you had to have 10 years exp, Master's for 2 years, or a PhD... like... bruh...\n\nMeanwhile, my roommate who's graduating with a BS in Management Inforation System isn't going for anything less than $70k/year.... Rn I'm less into passion and more into $$",
