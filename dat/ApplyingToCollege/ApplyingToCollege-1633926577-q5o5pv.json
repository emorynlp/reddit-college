  "text": " I know this would depend on which schools, but I currently don\u2019t have  any in particular in mind. Would you say in general it would help if  admission offices saw honors courses on my transcript (with good grades  of course) and knowing I\u2019m in the program? I\u2019m at Bunker Hill Community  College, and here\u2019s the honors program in case you\u2019re curious: [Commonwealth Honors Program - Bunker Hill Community College](https://www.bhcc.edu/honors/) (I don\u2019t mean the UMass schools, I would just use MassTransfer).",
