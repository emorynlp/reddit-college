  "text": "Anyone has a fee waiver for the Duolingo English Profiency Test?\n\nUIUC sucks(I'm an American citizen living in India and have taken English classes for 4 years in High School.) They're the only school asking me for it.\n\nI don't want to pay 49 bucks to prove to one College AO that I know English.",
