If things don't seem to work out in your freshman year, you've plenty of time to think about your options.\n\nFor the 2020-2021 cycle, there were 62,443 applicants and 22,666 matriculants. Only 36.3% of applicants got in ... that's 36% of premeds who get to the application stage. Applying to medical school is not like applying to colleges in the sense that more than 80% of all colleges accept more than half of their applicants, and most applicants receive at least one offer of admission, usually a lot more. In contrast, the acceptance rates to individual medical schools range from about 1% to 10% or so. A lot of applicants don't even get a single interview invite.",
