      "text": "Not just Computer Science, but most majors look for students who are relatively sure that they would like to study that particular major. How are you expected to be sure about studying Computer Science without any knowledge at all of the discipline? In when schools don't admit by major, they end up getting students who think Computer Science is all about programming, not realising the excessive amount of advanced Math involved in the program, and they end up dropping out of the major soon enough.",

That's what I'm talking about.",

It is much easier to succeed in something you enjoy doing rather than robotically doing everything do think is good for college admissions.",
