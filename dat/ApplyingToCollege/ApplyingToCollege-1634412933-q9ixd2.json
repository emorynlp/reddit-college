  "text": "Back in 2019 (class 9 for me), I had a bad case of dengue just before my final exams, and this got 89%. I\u2019m in an Indian student. How do I cover for this? When seeing marks, will college boards see the reason behind the low marks? Do I need to ask my school to mention somewhere that this is the reason why I got such marks? \nPlease let me know, thank you!",
