      "text": "If you are good at math and stuff, BC wasn't really hard for the people around me, but make sure you are prepared for AP Lang cause last year even having decent English skills the workload is kind of overwhelming. Depends on how much time and effort you need for Physics and Calc cause I am personally bad at math but I survived with AP BIO LANG and Calc BC in my junior year",
