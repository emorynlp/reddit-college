  "text": "Hello, to all of you out there, I was rejected by all my privates (CMU, John Hopkins, Yale, Brown, Stanford and USC), out of state publics like University of Michigan Ann Arbor(a public, forgot to add this the first time) and even by UC Berkley, UC Santa Barbara and UC San Diego, but I am currently in UCLA(number 1 public in the USA).\n\nJust because a school rejects you, it doesn't mean all those with a lower acceptance will reject you...remeber the whole thing is a crapshoot. I wish I knew this last year...and oh by the way at a top school it isn't insanely competitve, I've been making so many friends, because everyone knows the struggle to get there. It gets so much easier, I had the weekends free, and had fun with my friend groups.\n\nJust remeber application is the hardest, and getting rejected is not the end...I could not be happier here!! Good Luck to you all!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

I sure hope you have a good luck with college, with your enviornment should do quite well",

I did have a 4.3 GPA, did volunteer with local thing, and most importantly I started my own club(one of the only clubs at my school, the second club)....Probably see the trend, my school had practically nothing(no AP's, sports, labs, gym, etc, and like 100 people). I did all I could with what was offered(and a bit more). I hope this helps, and good luck, the hardest part is over, the rest is all good!",
