  "text": "hi everyone! as the admission season slowly comes to its end, I am wondering what do you all write about in your Harvard supplement? Their questions are extremely open-ended and I\u2019m not sure whether we should treat it as the second Common App essay or simply recycle some other shorter essay from different supplement. What would you suggest to do? \nThanks!",

Overall, I liked it as it felt like it was really true to me as a person. Originally, it was supposed to be a supplement for one of my safeties, but it turned out well enough that I thought it was good enough for Harvard. \n\nIn terms of what to write for the Harvard sup, anything goes. If you want to recycle an essay or rewrite one, just do it. The prompts are really open so just write whatever resonates with you. I wish you all the best!",

      "text": "for the \"optional\" essay (you should do it regardless lol since it's not really optional even tho they say it is) i wrote like as if it was a second common app essay. I talked abt an experience of being homeless for a period of my life and how i took a twist on a phrase that is generally used negatively that i now use to get by struggles in my life and to appreciate the good moments.\n\nas for the other essays (the extracurricular + intellectual curiosity), i just worded them like how id word a supplement, where i gave a narrative in the beginning and then explained the EC or why i did the programs i did to fuel the intellectual curiosity :)\n\ni applied rea so idk if this is even the right approach since i havent gotten results yet, but just a few ideas if youre applying RD",
