  "text": "I know when a school says a supplemental essay is optional it really isn't optional, but I was wondering if it is the same when it says the personal statement is optional.\n\nFor example, all of the advertisements I get from Minnesota say no essays required, but on the CommonApp it says the personal statement is optional. I really want to submit my Minnesota application right now, but I don't want to be penalized for not sending in this essay. What do you think I should do?",

      "text": "UMN is pretty heavily stats focused in admissions. Normally I would say always write the optional essay, but in this case I think it depends. If you're applying to CBS, CSE or Carlson, write the essay. These schools are significantly more competitive than the university as a whole, so it's best not to waste an opportunity to sell yourself. Otherwise, you really can skip it if your stats are in range.",
