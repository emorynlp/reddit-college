  "text": "I am currently studying in last year of my Computer Engineering Bachelor. I wanna apply to Germany from India but it's kinda confusing because I need someone who's done it so that I can ask him some questions about financial expenditure and all. I have average CGPA of 9.6 btw hoping to increase it this year too. Thanks.",
