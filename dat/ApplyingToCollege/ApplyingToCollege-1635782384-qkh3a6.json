  "text": "Title! This is my very first alumni interview, and I think it went well. I think I could've prepared better by remembering the names of signature opportunities at Georgetown. I DID explain my interest in some opportunities but I couldn't remember their names. Do you think that's a negative point against me? It also only lasted 30 minutes; is that a bad sign?",

          "text": "Georgetown doesn't use the Common App\u2014they have their own app, like MIT. Thier process is different too. So essentially, you submit an initial application in which you fill out your personal information, and once you submit that, they set up an applicant's portal for you. In it, there's the supplement application. In this one, they just ask additional information in addition to the four essays. Oh, and in terms of the alumni interview, it's mandatory. So, they match you with an alumni from your region as soon as you submit the initial app.",
