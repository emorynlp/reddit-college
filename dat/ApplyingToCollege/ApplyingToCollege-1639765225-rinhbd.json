      "text": "If they say they accept self-reported scores in the app or portal, then they do not require official reports prior to admission. This info can typically be found in the application checklist or on a page discussing the school's testing policy.\n\nExamples, Fordham explicitly tells you that they do not require official reports:\n\n>We accept self-reported scores for admission consideration. You may only self-report scores using the form in your applicant portal.\n\n[https://www.fordham.edu/undergraduate-admission/apply/what-were-looking-for/testing-policy/](https://www.fordham.edu/undergraduate-admission/apply/what-were-looking-for/testing-policy/)\n\nStony Brook explicitly tells you that they do require official score reports:\n\n>Official scores from the SAT, ACT or both must be sent directly from the testing agency. SAT Code: 2548, ACT Code: 2952.\n\n[https://www.stonybrook.edu/undergraduate-admissions/apply/first-year.php](https://www.stonybrook.edu/undergraduate-admissions/apply/first-year.php)\n\nIf the website does not say anything about accepting self-reported scores vs official reports, then go ahead and assume that they require an official report.\n\nIf there is a school that you can't figure it out for, please ask rather than giving your whole list. (The two schools above were not hard to find this info for.)\n\nPrinceton requires official reports.",
