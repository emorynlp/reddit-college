Take down your notes quickly in class and its okay if they're messy as long as they're understandable. this is so you have more time to understand what's being explained.\n\n4. Copy down the notes on another book cleanly and try to memorize and understand what you're copying down. (this really helps me understand and memorize personally).\n\n3. Whenever you don't understand something, don't procrastinate or hesitate to ask the teacher.\n\n5. solve a lot of questions/ exams/ examples/ etc\nand go to the teacher for help or a friend whenever you can't understand something.\n\nRepeat from 4 if you still don't feel confident enough.\n\nI guarantee you 100% you will do amazing in everything with this technique as long as you do it properly. good luck! :) .",
