  "text": "I am currently waiting for my October SAT result, it was the last one I\u2019ll be able to take before my ED. I need to do good on it or I\u2019ll essentially have no chance at my ED school.  I feel like it\u2019s such a poor representation of a student, I am terrible under pressure and I feel like it is going to prevent me from getting into my dream school. I know it isn\u2019t everything but I feel like when my ED school sees it I will be so much less likely to get in.",
