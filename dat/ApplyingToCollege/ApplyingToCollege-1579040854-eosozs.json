He saw I did really well in math but my score fluctuated a lot so he tested me on basic maths and then asked me to prove the geometric series formula. Also I worked in a lab and he grilled me on my research. I was able to respond well and explain why I didn\u2019t do what he thought was a good idea.\n\nOverall interview was excellent and I got in somehow. (Got rejected from usc, vandy, Washu, and northwestern. Waitlist from Pomona, Duke, Cornell, penn).\n\nDefinitely don\u2019t get your hopes up, but know that you set yourself up for the best chance you could :)",

Truth is, schools often don't have the resources to actually make use of these individual snapshots of character when they have such a large magnitude of applicants without it being basically meaningless. Either you go in depth, which would make the process take far longer and introduce more bias, or it becomes so cursory as to be a futile effort. It should be overhauled.\n\nWhat we *should* have is something akin to UChicago (where I'm going next year!!!!!). Instead of offering interviews, which they know won't be as meaningful, they let people do optional video profiles which is directly considered by your admissions officer, so they directly get a view of who you are rather than something filtered through an alumni who may not be reputable. It's easier on the student, more useful to AOs and far less unwieldy logistically. I want more schools to get rid of alumni interviews and instead switch to something like this.",

Also, aim to get there a little early so you don't have to stress about parking/running late.\n\nto all 3 of my interviews that I've had so far, I've brought a resume. the harvard interviewer was the only one take it. however, it was nice to be able to pull it out at the end when they asked if there was anything else I meant to discuss/add (I didn't really miss anything during the course of the conversation but it felt good to have proof that I didn't).",

I try to ask the interviewer at least what they majored in to cater to their interests and connect a bit as well. prepare a few questions (tell me abt urself, why ___, struggle you\u2019ve overcome) so you have a idea of what u want to include when then ask those.",

                      "text": "I don\u2019t think it is. One of the major pieces of feedback I\u2019ve seen from interviewers is to remember that it\u2019s a conversation, not a speech. The purpose of an interview isn\u2019t for you to read off ur essays, it\u2019s for another human to get to know you and measure skills which may be otherwise unaccounted for. They want to know that you\u2019re socially adept or empathetic and generally can be a part of their community. Interviews also give you a contact in the school, to be able to get information about real life and understand aspects not listed on a website. That means getting to know your interviewer or at least their experiences. For example, if you\u2019re doing premed and you find out your interviewer studied medicine there, they can tell you exactly what the competition is like to get into med school and whether students are supportive. They\u2019re meant to help you, but they\u2019re human too and reaching out makes them comfortable and they have a better impression of you as well.",
