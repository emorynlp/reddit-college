  "text": "Just thinking out loud here. \n\nWhat if someone plagiarizes my essay and sends it to the same college I'm applying to? Will it be an instant reject or will I at least have some chance to prove that I did indeed write my essay and that it was plagiarized?",

In my experience, the decisions on the two parties depended on how each responded when they were asked about the situation.

I definitely worry when I see people here say they're going to DM their essay to someone else.",
