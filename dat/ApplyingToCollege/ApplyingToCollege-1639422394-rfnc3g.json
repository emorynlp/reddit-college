Maybe it won't be today that you can go to college, but if that is really what you want, don't give up and soon you'll be a legal adult to do whatever the f\\*\\*k you want.\n\nAlso, if you apply abroad most universities won't require a counselor rec, so with an official transcript you will have just about everything you need for applications. Some universities even have great scholarship and financial aid programs.\n\nBest of luck in whatever you pursue in life, and don't let anyone else but yourself dictate what your life is going to look like.",
