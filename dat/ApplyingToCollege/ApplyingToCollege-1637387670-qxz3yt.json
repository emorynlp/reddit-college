  "title:": "Huge Mistake on UC App",
  "text": "Ok, so this is pretty bad. I submitted my Uc Apps earlier today thinking that I should be proactive and get this application out of the way. Then after I looked over my application again after submitting, I realized I made a grave mistake on the activities section. I served on the \u201cYouth\u201d Board of Directors at this non profit, but I simply stated Board of Directors. I forgot to put \u201cyouth\u201d which is probably the most important 5 letter word in this. I did mention this activity as being \u201cyouth\u201d later in the essay, but I am afraid they might accuse me of misrepresenting myself on the application. I contacted the application center, but all they told me was that you can\u2019t make corrections to the activities section of the UC app. UC Campuses don\u2019t even allow me to individually contact them to let them know about this mistake. I don\u2019t know what to do. I really put a lot of work into the UC app and now I am afraid they might even come after me for misrepresenting myself. What should I do? This is so stressful.",

      "text": "You seem to be afraid that they\u2019re going to \u201ccome after\u201d you for it. First of all, this might sound backhanded, but these people really don\u2019t have the time to come after you. Especially, since you corrected yourself further down the line, and emailed them trying to correct your mistake. For the most part, the mistake is not giant. Like a referenced earlier, most of these admissions staff do not have the time, so it is typical of them skim through essays before reading it in-depth. Therefore, they should understand that it is the youth board of directors before actually fully reading it.",

My primary concern was them thinking I was fabricating my application. And me getting rejected because of some stupid error in my activities list. Worse, they might contact the organization.",
