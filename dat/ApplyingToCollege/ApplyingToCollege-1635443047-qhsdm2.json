For IELTS, the recommended minimum overall band score is 7. Some programs may have more rigorous language proficiency standards; applicants with questions should contact programs directly. These exams should be taken early enough to allow the scores to reach the Graduate School by your program's deadline. Performance on the tests is one of many factors considered in making admission decisions. \n\nSo it\u2019s okay :)",
