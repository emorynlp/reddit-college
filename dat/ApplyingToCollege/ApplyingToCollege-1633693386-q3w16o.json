      "text": "Hi! \n\nAs an alternative to \"I took a deep breath\", you could use a phrase like \"I paused and gathered myself\", \"I took a second to calm myself\", \"I took a second to regain control of myself / my breathing\", \"I paused, breathed in, and prepared myself.\". Any of these simple adjustments should do the trick or even inspire you to think of other alternatives. \n\nHope this helped!",
