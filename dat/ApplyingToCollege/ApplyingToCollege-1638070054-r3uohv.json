  "text": "My family makes 75k a year and I\u2019m curious how schools specifically top schools look at that number considering they want to expand economic diversity due to how people with more affluent backgrounds represent a larger body. It\u2019s obviously not low income but definitely nowhere near what the average household income is at these top schools.",

      "text": "It really depends on the school, but you will probably get a fairly large amount of aid with it (so it probably counts as economic diversity for them). For example, you would get a full-tuition scholarship at Rice ([https://financialaid.rice.edu/rice-investment](https://financialaid.rice.edu/rice-investment)), for Harvard you would probably have a contribution from $0 - $7.5 for tuition ([https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/why-harvard/affordability](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/why-harvard/affordability)), etc. The best gauge of this will probably be to run net-price calculators.",
