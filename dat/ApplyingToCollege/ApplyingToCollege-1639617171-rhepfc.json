  "text": "I'm happy that a lot of my friends are getting into their top choices but I'm also super sad at the same time. \n\nI got rejected from my ED, not even deferred, and I know that if I got rejected ED from a top school getting in RD is going to be super hard. Is there even a chance? Chances with ED are already slim, getting in RD to a top school seems basically impossible.",
