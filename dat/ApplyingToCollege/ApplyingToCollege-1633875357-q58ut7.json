  "text": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI realised the last 5 to 6 years of my life that I am extremely interested in Psychology/Psychiatry as a field, i only realised now that this is my dream career and I truly believe that I can have some real impact unfortunately I am an immigrant to the US , I was born and raised in a different country and I have a master degree in management.\n\nAnyhow, I understand that Psychiatry is different, because I will actually need to enroll in a medical school first, can anyone who went through the process break it down to me please?\n\nWhat about my master degree, does it help in any way, how can I find out the equivalent value ?\n\nPlease help me in any way possible,  I dont want to give up on my dream.",

      "text": "This subreddit is focused on undergrad admissions. Try r/premed. You should be googling how to apply to med school. This will involve taking required premed courses at a university. Check a local university to see if they have a premed page on their website. Then you would need to take the MCAT. Keep in mind that med school admission rates are low, med school is four years and is very very expensive.\n\nPhysician Assistants and Nurse Practitioners are very common in the field, though these would also involve getting a nursing degree (I think - google that), which is also a rigorous program of study, 4+ years.\n\nA masters in management will not help you become a psychologist or psychiatrist.\n\nYou might consider other ways you could work in the field (e.g. manage a medical office?) rather than becoming a psychologist or psychiatrist.",
