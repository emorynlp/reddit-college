  "title:": "i made my grandmother cry",
  "text": "recently, i was on a family WhatsApp call with my grandma and some of my aunts who all live outside the USA in Latin America. \n\ni was lucky this year in that i got a good amount of acceptances, namely one from my dream school, JHU. we were all talking about my college plans in this call when my grandmother starts tearing up.\n\nnow, my family overseas doesn\u2019t know many US schools, only the loose handful of T20s often featured in films and headlines. JHU, however, they are very familiar with bc of COVID reports. my grandma, hearing about my college future started full on crying. \n\ni\u2019m one of her oldest grandkids (and the oldest girl) in my family, and i think she was just immensely proud in that moment. the two cousins i have that are older than me dropped out of college, and my grandpa, her husband, never went to college. my grandmother, on the other hand, did go to college and worked as a schoolteacher briefly, so she has always valued education.\n\ni know it\u2019s never great to see family crying, but in that moment i felt like i\u2019d made it. i\u2019d brought pride and honor to my family and accomplished something i barely thought i could. i know there are lots of feelings of imposter syndrome tied to getting into a T10, but in that second i forgot all of that. i felt like i was enough. \n\nthis sub sees sm negativity, so i rly just wanted to share this moment bc it made me so happy! wishing everyone here good feelings about acceptances, too!! :)\n\nedit: tysm to everyone in the replies!! y\u2019all are so sweet you\u2019re gonna make me cry, too! i\u2019m proud of everyone here, too, for making it through this insane year no matter what :))",
