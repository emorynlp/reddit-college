  "text": "Before the checklist got removed, do y\u2019all remember if there was a line on your checklist for the supplementary rec letter? I had one for my required teacher recs and counselor, but not my optional/supplement one. When I went to the \u201ctrack recommendations\u201d it said \u201dsubmitted on \\*date\\*\u201d next to the name of my supplementary recommender so I assumed MIT received it, but it never showed up on my actual checklist. Want to know if this is the same with others by chance? Specially those who submitted the supplement rec via MITs portal, not through slideroom.",
