      "text": "Welcome, Im from class 2022. My advice to you is don't hesitate to apply to reachable schools. Don't waste time with early action, make sure you plan out schools you want to apply to in early action. Create a list of safety schools just in case. Also, make sure you attend virtual sessions if you live far away from the college you're going for. Reach out to admission counselors if you have questions. Don't stress over essays and stuff, give yourself a break when it's needed to.",
