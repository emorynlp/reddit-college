He didnt say that OP was the only person that could have traits of toxic masculinity. He didnt say that males were the only people that could participate in toxic masculinity. I think what he said was in attempt to lighten the mood for OP personally, who appears to be someone who was assigned male at birth.  If he said something like \"the only way to crush toxic masculinity\" or something along those lines maybe your point may have more power behind it, but honestly I don't see how this could be transphobic. All he was saying was that the comment that OP slipped up on was funny and he was saying that he is going to be okay - in a matter of words.\n\nTL;DR I completely support trans people, women etc, but saying this needs a trigger warning is a bit of a reach. All genders of all people can have toxic masculinity but it is most commonly attributed to cis males. All u/Harvard_simp_lord was saying is that OP is okay, and perhaps u/Harvard_simp_lord found it funny that OP said that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease let us know your thoughts in a more clear way if you believe u/Harvard_simp_lord is still in the wrong but I failed to see how he is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nu/tRexArms4 u/smlt_101 u/prof_cuthbert_calc Let me know if you guys agree or disagree as well",
