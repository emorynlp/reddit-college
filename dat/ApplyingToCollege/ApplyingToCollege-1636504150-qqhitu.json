  "title:": "Chose to Stop Doing an Activity Senior Year, What do I Tell an Interviewer?",
  "text": "So my fencing club shut down this July after I had already lost interest in the sport for many reasons before then, recruiting among them, and after the club shut down I just quit entirely. There is a club slightly further away from my old one, but I don't want to go there. I haven't filled my time with any extra activity either. How should I respond to an interview question about this? I put that I did it in grade 12 but did not plan to continue in college on common app and don't know how to respond to a question about why I don't want to continue  either.",
