  "text": "Hello everyone! \n\nToday I received my scores and I got 107 (R 28, L 30, S 25 and W 24).  I meet the requirements for some degrees, but I don't know if I would be able to apply to CMU. The thing is that they state that there's a minimum score of 100, but it says (25 on all or above), requirement which I clearly do not meet on writing. \n\nAnd I want to know if I my application would be discarded because of that point, or if I'm fine, and the 25 points on each is only recommended?\n\nThank you!",
