  "text": "Hello, I am applying to college the 2022-2023 school year. I would love to know if there is anyone willing to be a mentor or if there is someone else applying the same year.  It would be nice to go through the whole process with someone else. our school guidance  isn't very helpful and, my parents didn;t go to school in the U.S so i am basically alone in this process",
