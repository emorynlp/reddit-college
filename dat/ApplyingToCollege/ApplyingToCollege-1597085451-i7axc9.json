I really relate to what you\u2019re feeling right now, especially the part about other people having high expectations of me. I think it\u2019s part of being surrounded by \u201csmart people\u201d? It\u2019s really rewarding but also be toxic af. I think this sub has really helped me in coming to terms with my own expectations and how to deal with others\u2019 expectation. I\u2019ve learned that regardless of anyone\u2019s expectations of you, you are going to be harder on yourself about it than they are and, honestly screw other people if they\u2019re judging your choices. It\u2019s college apps seasons and we are not here for drama! I\u2019m still struggling with this process of learning to put myself first but I like to remind myself that I have nothing to prove to anyone else except myself and I can\u2019t control everything in life. \n\nP.S. Really really sorry if this post came off aggressive or really high and mighty, I felt like I was talking to myself a few months ago and lecturing myself is not always a calming process ahaha...
