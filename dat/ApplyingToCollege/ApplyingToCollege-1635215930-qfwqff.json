  "text": "i'm so scared i'm going to end up having to go to college in my hometown. if i get into a certain program into one of the colleges i was lowkey forced to apply to by my parents that's literally <20 minutes away from my house, i'd have to live at home, which terrifies me bc the only motivation i've had at all for the last 6-7 years in school stemmed from the idea that i can get the fuck away from my highkey verbally/physically abusive parents. \n\nlast night, my dad threatened to not let me apply to college bc i spent too long on one of my supplements + my mom talks abt college apps too often with me and it annoyed him ??? not just that, but it escalated into death threats, him guilt tripping me by telling him how much he suffers at work and how i don't care abt him or the rest of the family at all and only myself, and him telling me how i'm a shit daughter for getting shitty grades (even though i have a 3.7 uw, and although ik i could've done better if i actually applied myself, this is what i have and i'm okay with that) and wishing for my parents to \"be in pain and suffer in life\".\n\ni've been dealing with the same shit for years and i've been counting down the months until i can finally leave, but as i've been applying to colleges, i realized that there's a really really good chance that i'll have to stay in state and near my parents. the process of applying to college is stressful enough lmao i wish i didn't have to worry abt this :,)\n\nON THE BRIGHT SIDE THOUGH i am so so excited to finally get to be myself in college. there are so many things i couldn't do in high school that i'll finally get to experience, so many parts of myself that i can share with others without worrying abt whether my parents would find out. i can be a lesbian in peace lmao \ud83d\ude0e\u270c  hoping i get into a school far, far away from here <3",

There is one university most kids from my high school will go that is 12 minutes from where I live, a distance that my parents will almost assuredly make me stay at home for. My main motivation is getting to leave and have some semblance of independence.\n\ngood luck i hope you get in to a school as far away from home as possible!",

Best of luck in getting into your favorite school(s) and getting the hell away from there + into a space where you can be yourself outwardly. \n\ni'm sure you already know this but don't listen to a single. damn. word. that you mentioned your dad said in your post. you have worked your ass off and endured more than your fair share; you deserve to do something for yourself!! as for not allowing you to apply, at the end of the day, all you need from them is their financial info for finaid apps. as long as that's out of the way, don't feel obligated to allow them to know too much about your app process. and if they force you to tell them everything, you might still be able to add/drop schools on a whim while you're away from then (think: at school, at a library, etc.) \n\ni hope everything works out for you. \\*hugs\\*",
