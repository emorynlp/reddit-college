  "text": "Title basically but some more info:\n\nI already decided to go to community college for two years, my grades are excellent, I\u2019m taking four other college courses this year not including the one I\u2019m considering dropping, I\u2019ve taken around 6 college courses since ninth grade 4 of which were AP. The course I want to drop is AP Calculus AB. Thinking about going to Virginia Tech for CS major after community college. This isn\u2019t a required course it\u2019s basically an extra math course. My entire schedule is extra course I could\u2019ve graduated in my junior year actually. Does dropping in second quarter look bad?",
