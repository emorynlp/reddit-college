      "text": "Thanks for your interest! Our packages depend on your school year, your college goals, and your current academic and extracurricular profile. That\u2019s why we have a consultation process - to learn about your what your goals and interests are so we can make a recommendation about our packages as well as match you to your best-fit counselor.\n\nHowever, without knowing more about your situation, we can say that our packages range from $1500 to $2000 or more. Since we **do not** do 1 hour standalone sessions, the pricing for our packages will cover the number of allotted sessions. We would be more than happy to talk to you! Please feel free to reach out - our consults are 30-min, and totally free! \ud83d\ude0a",
