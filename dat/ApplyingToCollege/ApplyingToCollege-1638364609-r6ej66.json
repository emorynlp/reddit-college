  "text": "What is the deadline to pay the enrollment fees at USF? I asked an AO and she said it's Dec 01. But I haven't received my official offer letter yet, how can I enroll by dec 01 then? Also, according to their website, I'm eligible for their gold award, but they haven't respoded about the award yet. Is it normal for USF to send the offer letter and award letter later?",
