      "text": "You should realize that even the absolute *worst* case scenario of not going to college at all, isn't the end of the world. There are many courses you can take in life to get to wherever you want to be, college is just one of them, and if it doesn't work out then you try something else. Fortunately, given you're applying to some safety schools, there is a very high probability that you will go to college, and even if you don't end up liking it, you can transfer two years later, or you can go somewhere else for grad school/higher education. I know how easy it is to get consumed by the college admissions process and feel like that's all there is, but don't be so short-sighted. In the grand scheme of things, its impact on your life will be marginal. Just try your best for the time being and leave it at that.",

          "text": "I appreciate your advice, but it isnt even abt the unis im applying to. Its my parents. They\u2019re way too involved in this process and they keep adding unis to my list that i don\u2019t even plan on attending. I argue with them every single day abt it but im still being forced to apply to these unis. I cant hang out with my friends anymore, play videogames with my cousins, or even visit my extended family. Its overwhelming, and the only reason why im doing it is to make my parents proud. \n\nBut thank you rly for ur comment. It was comforting to know that everything will be done soon.",
