  "text": "I'm very confused on the penn state supplementary, it's optional and it says: \n\n\" **Personal Statement (Optional)**  \n\n\nPlease tell us something about yourself, your experiences, or activities that you believe would reflect positively on your ability to succeed at Penn State. This is your opportunity to tell us something about yourself that is not already reflected in your application or academic records. We suggest a limit of 500 words or fewer. \"\n\nCan I just copy and paste my common app essay while trimming it down? Or do they want a completely new and different personal statement?\n\nAdditionally, I'm applying to engineering and my total SAT is 1300, but my math score is only 580. Should I just send it or go test optional with a 3.83 UW and 4 AP's (another 3 this senior year but they don't count for EA gpa) and 9 Honors classes.",
