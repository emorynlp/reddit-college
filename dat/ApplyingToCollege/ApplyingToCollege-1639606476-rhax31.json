  "text": "Just got rejected from my dream school. \n\nIve devoted the past year and a half to getting into NYU. I applied for Music Business and had good ecs, a solid 1420 and a weighted gpa of 4.2. Im devastated. I dont know what else I want to do with my life. I also applied to cornell, northeastern, bu, and bc but now I doubt I have a chance at those schools. I dont know where to go from here.\nWhere should I ED II to? I really have no preference, I just wanted to go to NYU. Should I do cornell, northeastern or BU?",
