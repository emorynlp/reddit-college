      "text": "This is a ridiculous statement. Cornell is one of the few schools still testing its students who are all vaccinated btw. I\u2019m not sure what Cornell is doing wrong other than making students take their exams in person as at this point it\u2019s impossible not to. No one has been hospitalized. At all of my state schools it is one big shit show w no masks, no required vaccines, no testing. Let\u2019s stop the Cornell bashing over having positive tests bc they are testing asymptomatic vaccinated people and we have yet another variant. Not sure what you all expect of this university. Cancel our exams? Move them all online bc trust me people will bitch about that too. Let\u2019s hear  how you think they should be handling things differently. The one thing Cornell does have is the whiniest subreddit.",
