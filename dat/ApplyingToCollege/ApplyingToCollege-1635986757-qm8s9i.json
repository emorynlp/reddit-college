Should I email AO\u2019s saying I dont plan for financial aid, or should I just not fill out CSS? I heard applying for financial aid might lower your chances and i know i dont qualify for aid",

      "text": "Isnt it worded as a maybe? Like, the question is \"are you pursuing financial aid?\", or something similar?  So even if you dont qualify,  you still were attempting to get financial aid. So its all good. As well as, dont you have to fill out the financial aid application for any type of aid, even through the school? So I'm sure there is something you qualify for that you would need to apply anyway for...\n\nHope that helps!",

      "text": "AOs have nothing to do with the financial qid process. You should email the financial aid office to take care of that. But if you already put the forms in and ypu know you wont get any aid, why bother going out of your way to get rid of that. Also at many colleges, they require financial aid forms like the FAFSA and CSS for merit scholarships. In your situation applying for aid wont hurt your applicant anyway even if the school is need aware since that designation only hurts students who need significant aid. A school can only have so many full need students, but since you presumably wont get aid anyway, that doesn't affect you.",
