  "text": "My aunt went to Harvard for her MD. I was wondering if her letter of rec would mean anything for me if I apply as an undergrad to major in biochemistry.\n\nI\u2019m going to apply to Harvard and say that I am alumini. I have a semi-decent chance to get in without her.\n\nI\u2019m also going to shadow under her for 10 full-length days in about a month.",

              "text": "While that's a good thing to do, you still won't have a professional relationship with her. Letters of recommendation need to come from people who do not have a conflict of interest. \n\nTypically letters are also best from people who have written them often. While an MD is certainly an accomplishment, your family member is unlikely to have experience writing letters often and is not likely to write a compelling letter - no matter how well intentioned she might be.",

                      "text": "Harvard will likely ask you about your relatives who have attended, and if that information matches your letter writer's information, that will work strongly against you. \n\nI can't recommend strongly enough that you have someone with a solely professional relationship write on your behalf. Harvard has enough applicants that they look for reasons to reject students, and a conflict of interest in a letter writer is a strong reason for them to reject you.\n\nA Harvard MD is also not relevant from a legacy perspective, if that is motivating your question. What your aunt can do for you is connect you with other people to work with/shadow/etc. They can write you a letter, though, as I mentioned, people who don't write these often don't usually do a good job.",
