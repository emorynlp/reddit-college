You get to spend a few hours helping, struggling, talking, learning about each other and you can form some great relationships.  I also love playing hockey and being on a team of 20 players.  You feel like everyone there has your back and you are all working towards a common goal.  You want to help each other and cover for each other when needed.\n\nI love living in a mid-sized college town because you really feel like part of the community.  Walking down main street with the 2-3 story buildings feels great and you never feel too small.  I get to make friends with owners, servers, bartenders, at stores and restaurants I frequent.  I also love living in a huge city and always having something new to try or experience.  Being able to meet people from around the world and experience a small part of their culture is fantastic!  I love having 100+ different bars to try within a 25-minute walk of my apartment.\n\nI loved living in LA and having the sun and warmth almost every day.  I loved being close to the beach and never having to wear more than a sweater.  I also loved living in Wisconsin and wearing a winter parka from November through March.  I loved having snow and frozen lakes to skate on.  I loved feeling snuggly sitting by the fireplace with a blanket and a cup of hot cocoa.\n\nYou can love the small tight-knit community of 1 place and love the large community of another.",
