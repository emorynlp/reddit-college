  "title:": "How to write your own letter of rec? (ASAP please \ud83d\ude2d)",
  "text": "I\u2019m applying for a program where I need a recommendation letter from a teacher. However, when I brought it up, he told me that he typically has a TA write them for him because he has a disability (and ofc we didn\u2019t have a TA this semester \ud83d\ude2d)\n\nSo instead he told me to write a rough copy of what I\u2019ve done in his class so he can just modify it. But\u2026 I have no clue how to start \ud83e\udd27\n\nWhat sorts of activities should I be emphasizing? What sorts of qualities should I be focusing on? (And perhaps most importantly, how do I make sure it doesn\u2019t sound like my voice?)\n\nSorry for sounding frantic\u2014I just found out that the program deadline was two weeks earlier than I expected and I\u2019m freaking out because the deadline for rec letters is this week",
