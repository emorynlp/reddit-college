(Or maybe that's just me being a simp for Vandy \ud83d\ude29)\n\nI was just about to say that Furman had the worst website I've seen so far because their header took about 50% of my PC screen and I couldn't even minimize it, but I just checked and it looks like they finally fixed it. The way they redid the menu is weird and certainly not good, but it got better compared to the last time I visited the site.",
