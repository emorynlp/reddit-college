I came up with most of my ideas either while playing billiards, Table Tennis, or working out. Just do something you enjoy, and let your mind wander in the general direction you want. \n\nStudies have shown beneficial effects from this, and I personally found it helpful. After you have one of these \"free thinking\" sessions, you can list out your ideas. What I did was I listed out what I want to convey, and then wrote my essay based on that",

                  "text": "Don't worry about getting it right the first try. Once you have an idea in your head, make notes about that topic, about why you want to write about it, about what AOs would learn about you from reading that essay, about what elements you believe are key to the essay/story, and about other things you want to include, maybe even spur-of-the-moment lines and wordplay that comes into your head. And do not be one of those people that are like \"I will remember it, and write it after I do this first\". I can't tell you how many times I've forgotten what I wanted to write while trying to do that. Remember, there's no such thing as too much notes. \n\nOnce you think you're covered everything about that topic, get to writing. Start your essay right in the middle of the action. No general introduction is required, and is likely to bore the reader anyway. Try to weave everything in your notes while writing, deleting bullet points that you've covered on the way. By the time you delete the last bullet point, you might be double the word limit, and that is PERFECT. Freewriting based on your notes is good for getting all those ideas down into sentences and paragraphs. Now you cut the boring/irrelevant/unnecessary parts and combine sentences to pack more meaning and impact into your words. Soon, you'll be at 650 words, with only the most important words, sentences, and ideas in your essay. You'll know you made the best essay and worded everything correctly because every single word would have been examined through the cutting process, and every idea would have been scrutinized. \n\nWake up tomorrow and have a new idea? Create a new page/document and start writing notes. Sometimes you may even have 4 separate essay ideas, each with notes, before you start writing. That's good. You may have 2-3 essay drafts. That's also good. A CommonApp idea that you decide not to use could be the perfect supplemental essay.",

Have your parents, college counselor, and/or friends look over it and make suggestions for tomorrow.\n\n Day 4 . Rewrite it. Completely retype it word-for-word even if your outside opinions loved passage 1, retype it. You might think of something better that you didn't do beforehand, and incorporate the suggestions unless you don't agree with them. Then go through a condensed version of days two and three, send it to parents/counselors/friends, keep rereading it and plugging it through Grammarly, etc.\n\nDay 5 you should be good to go, or be making the finishing touches.
