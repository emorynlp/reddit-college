  "text": "Hi! I absolutely love playing the Sims 4, but not just for gaming; I love using the build feature to make thoughtful interior design decisions. I imagine that a real family is going to live in the homes I design, so I strategically make them secured, functional, and pleasing to look at. I take everything into account, from the sizes of each room to the spacing between furniture. I also share my builds on my public Instagram account. \n\nI believe this might be a good way to demonstrate my attention to detail and strategic thinking on my college application. Although it's not directly related to the major I want, I want to sell myself as a person that thinks critically and finds creative solutions to problems. I also think it'll be a nice art-related activity.\n\nI have other activities to fill in my 10 slots if this doesn't make the cut, but I just want some opinions on this. Any comments are appreciated! Thank you!",
