  "text": "Is that the deadline for merit aid?? \n\nI\u2019m from a poor family (in NorCal) and will definitely need lots of aid (merit and need-based). The December deadline obviously has passed, and I won\u2019t be applying till January. Should I just not apply to Vanderbilt at all at this point? Or can I still get good aid?",
