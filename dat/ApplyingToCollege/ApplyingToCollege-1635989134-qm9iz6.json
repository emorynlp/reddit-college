  "text": "Maybe my brain just isn't understanding this, but I'm so confused by the course length explanation in SRAR. My life would be easier if they'd just say stuff in simple english lol\n\nSRAR's explanation is \"if your school provides one final grade at the end of the school year, select full year when reporting grades. If your school lists two final grades, pick semester\"\n\nIf my transcript shows grades for both semesters (S1 AND S2) and the year grade (Y1), what do I do? Do I put them as semester courses or year-long courses, and then how do I do classes that are only a semester long? I tried watching tutorials but none of the ones I found went over this, and I'm thoroughly confused.",
