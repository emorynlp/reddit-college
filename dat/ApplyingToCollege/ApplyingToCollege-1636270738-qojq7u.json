  "text": "I\u2019m a current junior (class of 2023), and i\u2019m considering cancelling my December SAT that I already signed up for since most colleges I\u2019m interested in are test optional, but I\u2019m also worried about the colleges that still require SAT for class of 2023. How likely are they to extend the test optional policy to class of 2023?",

      "text": "Caltech is not just test optional - they're test blind as of now... But generally speaking, many of the currently test optional schools will continue being so next year too... However, I wouldn't rely on this estimate, since some schools may stop being test optional if the pandemic stops being the reason for test cancellations in the next few months - if you can take the test, I would go ahead with it and then decide if you want to submit your scores.",

Their reasoning was not the same as others.\n\nI certainly wouldn\u2019t cancel plans to take the SAT, betting that all schools in which you might be interested will be test-blind. Even this year, a high test score will benefit your application at most schools. Outside of CA, most are optional, not blind.",
