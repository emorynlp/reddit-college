  "text": "Does anybody know if Michigan tracks demonstrated interest? Their website says they don\u2019t, but the common data says considered, and I feel like some schools says that but they still take note of it and it sometimes is a factor. Main reason I\u2019m asking is because for some reason nobody from my HS can get into Michigan. There\u2019s usually 450-550 people in each graduating class and nobody\u2019s gotten in in 5 years. Probably some weird out-of-state thing but the valedictorian my freshman year is currently going to harvard but she didn\u2019t get into Michigan. I also have a letter of rec from somebody at the church i volunteer at and hes also an alumni and retired principal. Will this help give me an advantage?",
