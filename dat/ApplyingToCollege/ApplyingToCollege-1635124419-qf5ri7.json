  "title:": "UVA Favorite Word Essay",
  "text": "So I wrote out my favorite word essay and was pretty happy with it... until I realized that I wrote about \"y'all\", which sorta sits on a fuzzy line between being one word and two words. Would anyone know if that'd be an OK word to write about (the prompt specifically asks about your favorite word, singular)? It'd really suck if I had to go back to the drawing board with this question.",
