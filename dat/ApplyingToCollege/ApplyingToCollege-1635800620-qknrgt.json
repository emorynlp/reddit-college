  "text": "For some reason I can\u2019t find a place to pay my application fee for Georgetown. I don\u2019t qualify for a fee waiver so there\u2019s no reason I shouldn\u2019t pay. I submitted my application, and it gave me all green check marks and said I had no missing information, but I literally cannot find where to pay. Please help!!!!!!",
