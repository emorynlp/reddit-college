  "text": "I'm sorry if this is repetitive but I'm honestly so scared. I was doing \\*really well\\* during quarantine because teachers just graded everything for completion. But senior year is hell. I'm trying so hard in every class but my grades are dropping like flies. Ik colleges will see this negatively, but how much will drops in senior year grades impact their decision: admissions and scholarships...?\n\nFor context, I had like a 98 last year and now I'll probably have a 94..... if I'm lucky (but this grade matches my previous grades before quarantine)  \n\n\nwait just an edit: same courses from last year and this year. IB sucks. ",
