  "text": "This is sort of just a vent/question. I applied to Purdue and put CS/Game Dev. as my top majors. I'm now leaning towards epidemiology (Health Science BS) because I'm actually interested in it, unlike CS. Because Purdue is so competitive about CS, I really think I screwed myself now. \n\nWill they flat out reject me if I don't meet CS standards for them or let me in Exploratory Studies?",

But it would be better to indicate interest.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in adding a second option, or changing your first option, contact them.",
