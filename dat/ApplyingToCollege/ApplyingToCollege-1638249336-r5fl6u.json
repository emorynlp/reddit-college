  "text": "My high school uses Naviance, but I am applying to all music schools so I need a combination of both school teachers and music teachers outside of school. Should I include all of them in the Recommenders section on the applications or should I only include the music teachers outside of my school?",

At my school we use scoir and when we select recommenders in the recommender thing it sends nothing but it\u2019s like a placeholder ig?\n\n\nTldr \nShouldn\u2019t matter too much so long as they get all the LORS",
