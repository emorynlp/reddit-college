  "title:": "Do I retake the SAT? (1220)",
  "text": "Hi!\n\nI took the October 2nd SAT and got my results, a 1220. Not a terrible score, (an awesome improvement for myself\u2013I received a 90 point jump!) but not within the average of my number one college I\u2019m applying to, William and Mary, which is 1320-1520. 670 on the Reading section, and 550 on the Math.\n\nMy question is, do I take the SAT again in November? I plan to do early decision, and the deadline for that is November 1st. Another conflicting question is whether I should even send the score or not. If anyone has any advice or tips, I\u2019d really appreciate it! \n\nFor context, I have a 4.4 weighted GPA, am an instructor at a karate school, serve a leadership position in our school\u2019s literary magazine, participate in a school club as an outreach officer, and serve as a peer tutor. I\u2019d like to say I\u2019m qualified for W&M, it\u2019s my dream school, but I have no clue. My high school counselor is conflicted as well, and I plan to reach out to my W&M admissions officer as well.\n\nIf anyone has any advice, it would be GREATLY appreciated! :)",

      "text": "Colleges publish admission data on their websites in the class profile or the Common Data Set, and at [https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/](https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/).\n\nIf you are applying to a test-optional school, the rule of thumb would be to not report a score below a certain threshold. Different people have different opinions on where that threshold is. My opinion would be to not report a score if it's below the college's published 25th percentile. Others say 50th.\n\nWilliam and Mary's middle 50 percentile range for the enrolled class of 2024 was 1300-1490.
