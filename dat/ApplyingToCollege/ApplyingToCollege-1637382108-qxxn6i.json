  "text": "Hi! I\u2019m currently a freshman in high school and I was wondering when I should start doing research and looking for mentors. I\u2019ve read articles on how to find a mentor, but I don\u2019t know generally what age/year in high school I\u2019ll have the adequate knowledge and experience to start research. Should I be doing it next summer before sophomore year?",

But you don't have to actually publish anything to do research, even something simple like helping a college professor analyze data is technically a research assistant position.",
