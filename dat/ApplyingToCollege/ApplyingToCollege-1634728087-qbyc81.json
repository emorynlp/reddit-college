  "text": "[repost because I *really* need opinions]\n\nHey, A2C. Need some advice here.\n\nI engaged in two research projects throughout high school. One for the national physicists' tournament, for two long years, with my high school teacher who has a PhD, and one in a summer program, with a post-doc researcher.\n\nThe first is one of my main recommenders, closest friends and one of the people I can trust the most on the admissions process. The second is simply a professor I interacted with for two weeks and am in no way close to.\n\nMany schools, including Columbia, say they \"welcome\" LORs from your research mentors. I'm already sending a LOR from the first mentor I've mentioned, and while the second agreed with and was happy when I asked him if I could add our project on college apps, I don't want to ask him for a LOR because he doesn't know me well enough to write it. Besides, I am sending an extra recommendation from my scouter, besides the ones written by my teacher/research mentor, my language teacher, and my counselor. 4 LORs total.\n\nAm I doing the right thing by not asking my 2nd mentor for a LOR? Will colleges see this as a bad sign/red flag? What do you think?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "text": "It's fine. To be honest, the postdoc probably wouldn't have written you the kind of letter you need. You do need a very particular *kind* of LOR for university admission, and it isn't the same kind that they might be used to reading/writing for the academic world. Their letter would most likely be pretty lukewarm. It's always a risk asking someone who doesn't have any experience writing for high schoolers. And they're a post-doc, so they almost certainly cannot have any experience writing letters since they're barely out of being a student.",
