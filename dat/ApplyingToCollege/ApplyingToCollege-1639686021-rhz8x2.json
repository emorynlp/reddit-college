      "text": "Barnard, Macalaster and Kenyon come to mind. Most LACs will have good physics programs, although they won't be \"well known\" for their STEM programs (compared to Top 20 universities).   \n\n\nGenerally speaking, the highest ranking LACs will have the most generous aid for international students. If your grades/scores are good, I would reccomend looking into Top 10-20 research universities more.",

          "text": "Speaking from experience, the physics programs at the well known LACs are viewed as on par with any program at a research university. They are also likely to give you smaller class sizes and more impactful research opportunities. \n\nAs someone else mentioned, rankings/prestige has a lot to do with endowment size, and a large endowment often means larger financial aid packages. Of course, large endowments are also supported by higher overall cost of attendance, so it's not a simple question of ranking/size on the financial aid side.",

          "text": "Also, if you're looking for good financial aid, you should be eyeing the school's ranking, not whether it is a LAC or a research university.   \n\n\nRanking (Forbes, US News and World) will be a much better proxy to determine financial aid. Additionally, some schools have dedicated webpages to explain how their aid process works for international students. You should keep an eye out for that too.",
