  "text": "Literally so many other seniors I know have gotten a million college acceptances already and some have even committed. Meanwhile I\u2019m over here with my one acceptance feeling bad because I only got into my safety so far. I know it\u2019s my fault for only applying to one rolling admission college (lol) but I still feel behind. \n\nThe worst part is I\u2019ve always been the one looking forward to college and saying I can\u2019t wait to go.\n\nAlso, I applied to Penn State EA and still haven\u2019t gotten my decision yet while I see so many people on here have \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80. \n\nI hope I\u2019m not the only one feeling this way.",
