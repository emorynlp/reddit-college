  "text": "On assist.org it only shows that California colleges can fulfill the transferable courses if I am not mistaken? Will a dual enrollment class taken at an out of state college fulfill the AG requirements or no?\n\nIt also says this on their website \n\u201cSome other distinctions that you should keep in mind as an out-of-state applicant:\n\nThere is no pre-approved course list for schools outside of California. Referring to the A-G course list site (a database of UC-certified course lists in California schools) and the 15 college-preparatory course categories can provide guidance on the types of courses that have been UC-approved.\u201d\n\n\nAhhh idk is it even worth it to apply if my DE courses don\u2019t count",

If there is a similarly titled course on assist.org, it should transfer. General Chemistry I is basically the same across the country. You will likely only have an issue if it is a very niche course.",

      "text": "Are your duel enrollment credits fulfilling part of your A-G requirements, or are they electives? That would change the ease substantially. \n\nRegardless, there is typically a process for approving a course. The list for California colleges\u2019 applicable transferable courses you are looking at exists because of the sheer amount of California CC transfers. There\u2019s still a process for transferring from a non-CA CC though. You would just have to work with the admissions office to make sure your application is clear and satisfies all requirements.",

I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything extra you\u2019d have to do during the application process itself. But I\u2019d send an email to the admissions department",
