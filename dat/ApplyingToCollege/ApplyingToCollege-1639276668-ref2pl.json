  "text": "college apps are getting to my head cause i was scrolling and all i could think ab is that people who consistently get hundreds of upvotes here on opinion/story type posts would write good college essays\n\nlike they know the human heart well enough to write in a way that gets hundreds of strangers to agree with them, and to hook people in so that they don\u2019t get bored and scroll away\n\nthey write hooks all the time in the form of post titles\n\nthey have practice being concise to avoid the wall of text and know how to tell a story that grips the reader and/or makes them react emotionally\n\nAND they\u2019re on a2c so they have access to resources on how to write good college essays, it all comes together",

The only difference imo is that on Reddit, upvotes are largely dependant on the time of arrival at the post - earlier comments are seen by more people and thus recieved more upvotes.
