      "text": "1.  They get tens of thousands of applications and they pay their reviewers (usually a few dozen) to read and analyze them.  \n\n2.  App fees encourage some self-selection.  People are less likely to YOLO a completely unqualified app to Harvard if it costs them $100.  They don't want to waste their time.\n\n3.  Most colleges are non profit, but they still face budget constraints and have to manage cash flow.  App fees are a large source of revenue, so why give that up if you don't have to?  \n\n4.  They can charge app fees and still give fee waivers to people who need them (and often even people who simply ask).  If the fees are a burden for you or even if they might cause you to not apply, reach out to the college and ask about a fee waiver.  If you qualified for one from College Board, or if you're on free/reduced lunch programs, you usually automatically qualify.  Even if you don't technically qualify, they still give them out relatively freely to people who need them.",
