  "text": "1.  To meet most 2 year language recommendations, can I take French 1 for junior and French 2 for senior year?  Will I be able to apply to colleges while in the middle of my French 2 senior year and still meet the recommendations? \n\n2.  Will colleges look at if you have taken previous languages into consideration? I completed Spanish 1 for my freshman year, but did not take Spanish 2 because it was online and I felt like I didn\u2019t know enough from Spanish 1 to move on. That being said, will they consider me doing 1 Spanish and 2 French or will they only consider me doing 2 French?",
