          "text": "There's nothing wrong with LACs.  For me though, LACs tend to not have as strong/diverse STEM programs as I would prefer, particularly the QB partners I have looked at so far.  Harvey Mudd is also not a QB partner and if I am going to California I would prefer shooting my shot at Berkeley.  Also MIT is my dream school and is one of only the few schools that have EECS for undergrad.  Plus I daydream to much about it lol.  Out of genuine curiosity, Why do you say Harvey Mudd has a better career outlook?",

              "text": "There are actually lots of different kinds of jobs at NASA that might argue for different kinds of preparation in terms of what you study at university.  I like to use LinkedIn for this kind of thing.  Navigate to an employer, choose a job function (\"Engineering\"), then see what people majored in and/or where they went to school.  You need to have an account, but here's an example link:\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/company/nasa/people/?facetCurrentFunction=13%2C8&facetGeoRegion=us%3A0](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nasa/people/?facetCurrentFunction=13%2C8&facetGeoRegion=us%3A0)\n\nLooks like the most popular majors of NASA employees living in the U.S. and whose job function is \"Engineering\" or \"Information Technology\" are Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Computer Science, \"Computational Science\", Physics, Math, and Computer Engineering.  However, if you specifically want to *write software* at NASA, then I'd recommend studying Computer Science or Computer Engineering.  In terms of where to study, it might be worth targeting a university that has an internship pipeline to NASA.  But, then again, if you can't afford it you can't afford it.  Depending on the LAC, you could still study CS and Physics.  Some also have 3/2 programs where you do 2 years of engineering classes at another school.\n\nRegardless of where you land, make a point of figuring out what NASA expects from its internship applications and make sure you're doing as many of those things as possible.\n\nbtw, if you take that link above and further limit the search to NASA employees who studied CS, some interesting schools pop up in the top list.  UCF, for example.",

Can you include some of them on the QB list?\n\nIf you decide not to move forward with QB, search the ABET site for accredited engineering programs. If you are from a low-income family, you could receive a lot of financial aid. The FAFSA is required by every college and some also require the CSS Profile. \n\nhttps://www.abet.org",
