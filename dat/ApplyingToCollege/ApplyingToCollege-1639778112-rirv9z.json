  "text": "I just got accepted to Northwestern currently losing my mind. I literally got rejected from a less selective school yesterday and thought I had absolutely no chance. How concrete is the scholarship/financial aid offer? I never thought I would be able to afford Northwestern even if I got accepted but they gave me HUGE scholarships/financial aid and I'm wondering if it's actually accurate? Like it's hard to believe any of this is happening rn \ud83d\ude2d",
