  "text": "All my peers are getting into amazing schools. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m happy for them. But also just kinda disappointed. I worked myself into a shit ton of depression, anxiety, and mental health issues. All because my dream was to get an amazing education at a top school. And now it feels like I\u2019m just watching everyone else live my dream while I watch from the sidelines :(\n\nI still can apply ED2 to my dream school, Pomona. The problem with that is they probably won\u2019t give me any aid and going there means like $200K in debt. It\u2019s my dream, but\u2026 it\u2019s hard to be okay with being in that much debt and potentially sabotaging my financial freedom. Especially since I want to go to graduate school\n\nLogically, going to my state flagship is probably the best idea. It\u2019s a solid school with good programs for what im interested in and will save me a lot of money. But Pomona is where I feel like I\u2019ll be happiest, and to be quite honest I feel like I need some happiness where I\u2019m at in my life right now\n\nAnyone have any advice?",

There are MANY more than one college where you would be happy and successful. \n\nWhy are you already thinking about grad school? What\u2019s your major going to be?",

          "text": "I can\u2019t really comprehend what $200K looks like. I have told my parents this many times, but they don\u2019t seem to know how to communicate it to me. I have had jobs before and exposure to money, but I still don\u2019t know what it actually looks like to be in debt, pay bills, to be self-sufficient in general, all my exposure to money is through the lens of my parents paying the bills/essentials.\n\nI am worried that I have an essentially zero chance of getting into Pomona if I don\u2019t ED2. And I worry that I would be throwing away my chance at being happy by not applying. It\u2019s the only place I\u2019ve looked at that actually feels like I belong there. I\u2019ve worked so hard and I want my efforts to be worth something, I want to go somewhere where I can feel like it all paid off. \n\nI\u2019m thinking about grad school because it\u2019s essential to nearly all of my goals, personal and professional. I want to be an astronomer, and am going to major in physics/astronomy. I know that where you go to graduate school ultimately matters more than your undergrad, so I want to choose a school so that I will be in a good position to pursue graduate work.",

              "text": "Let\u2019s use round numbers and say that after grad school, you\u2019ll pay $500/month on student loans. That will take you more than 33 years to pay off that debt. (I\u2019m not sure if you factored in interest. If you didn\u2019t, it will take a lot longer.) You might want to buy a home or a car at some point, right? \n\nI did a quick search that shows Pomona\u2019s ED admit rate is 15% and RD is 7%. You could say that\u2019s double or you could say that 85% are rejected.\n\nWhether one particular college accepts or rejects your application does not validate or invalidate your academic, extracurricular, and life experiences.\n\nThere are many colleges where you would be happy and successful. Maybe you haven\u2019t done enough research yet. Look for other LACs with more reasonable acceptance rates. \n\nI\u2019m assuming you have a very strong academic record. Apply to some colleges which admit 50%+ of their applicants where you will be a strong candidate for admission and merit scholarships. \n\nThere is a belief that admit rate correlates in some way to \u201cquality.\u201d That is \ud83d\udcaf a myth. Please don\u2019t buy into that.",

      "text": "Based on the rule of thumb that you pay back $100/month for every $10,000 you borrow, $200,000 in loans means that you would be paying approximately $2,000 back every month for 10 years - think about how that would constrain your life choices and what a crippling burden that would be. \n\nTo get another sense of $200,000 - my daughter worked for 6 weeks full time over this summer and only netted $2,000 after taxes at minimum wage. So it would take her 50 full summers (Jun-Aug) to earn $200,000 at minimum wage. And that doesn\u2019t even include the huge interest expense to be paid on this amount, just the principal.\n\nAstronomers aren\u2019t high earners. You\u2019re talking basic middle class here. It makes no sense at all to go to an insanely overpriced undergrad for it (which almost all \u201cselective\u201d private schools are these days - insanely overpriced for those who don\u2019t get need-based aid).\n\nCollege costs have skyrocketed over the past 30 years, especially so in the past 10. Like exponentially over the actual inflation rate. This is in large part because people have had access to loans like this without any assessment of their ability to pay them back - and since student loans can\u2019t be discharged in bankruptcy, private colleges/universities have exploited this opportunity to jack up their sticker prices beyond all reason. It\u2019s a uniquely American disaster.\n\nA quick Google search about the student debt crisis would be worthwhile to you. The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times run pieces a few times a year about student borrowers or their parents who borrowed for them and what impact it\u2019s had on their lives. Btw, did you know that the system has changed so that the student can only borrow $27,000 in total over the 4 years ($5,500, 6,500, 7,500 and 7,500) so that the parents have to co-sign the loans needed above those amounts? And parents can\u2019t borrow for their retirements if they find they don\u2019t have enough to get by.",
