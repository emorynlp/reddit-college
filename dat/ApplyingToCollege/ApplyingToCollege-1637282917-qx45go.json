  "title:": "Do I have to take honors community college courses to transfer to a UC?",
  "text": "At my CC I was advised that taking 15 units of honors courses will give me a better chance at applying to the UC of my choice. Choosing between UCSD and Irvine. I wouldn't have a problem doing this, however, I would really like to finish all my major requirements by the end of this spring and transfer by fall, and I'm not seeing any room in my schedule to fit any honors courses in without petitioning for extra units and overwhelming myself.",

      "text": "Second the other comment, for more competitive majors it could be helpful but it really matters us that you finish your pre reqs with good grades. Transferring is a whole different game than freshman apps. Colleges understand that as a transfer student you have responsibilities outside school that high schoolers don't (remember work IS an extracurricular). Definitely don't feel that you need to overwhelm yourself with honors to get in because there are plenty of people who get in and don't. I definitely reccomend getting in touch with the admissions counselors of the schools you want to apply to. They'll likely have much more targeted advice than what your CC can give.",

      "text": "What major are you considering? If CS/Eng, then do everything you can do to boost your app. However, if you\u2019re not CS/Eng, I believe UCI participates in TAG, which is a transfer guarantee program; if you complete a checklist of classes & meet a GPA requirement, you\u2019re in. Guaranteed. UCSD doesn\u2019t participate in TAG, so if you prefer that, again beefing up your app might help \u2014 but not at the risk of your GPA suffering a big decline because of course overload.",
