  "text": "Hi!\n\nI submitted my application for UPenn earlier and I noticed how my AP scores and SAT scores didn't show up through the common app portal. I know their test optional feature made it so that they didn't show my scores on common app. Do do I have to send my AP scores through CollegeBoard or did they actually receive my self-reported scores?",

(You might give the computer system a few days to update.) Most portals do not say anything about receiving AP scores, unfortunately. You do not need to send AP scores via College Board.",
