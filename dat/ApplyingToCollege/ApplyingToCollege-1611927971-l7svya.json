  "text": "**I wish someone told me that I was going to go to college if I just applied.** So many schools have high acceptance rates, and they are good schools too. People told me that a B would make it so I couldn\u2019t go to college, and that\u2019s not true at all. By just going to college, you\u2019re already in the minority of the country. Who cares where? You got a higher education, that\u2019s what matters. \n\n**I wish my parents didn\u2019t tell me that I was ruining my life choices if I got lower than an A** Maybe I wouldn\u2019t have felt so much pressure, and it wasn\u2019t even true. I am on track to do exactly what I want to do and be successful. \n\n**I wish I spent more time on things that made me happy** I spent so much time worrying about everything in my life and about college and my career that I let my highschool years slip away from me. I\u2019m in my second semester now, and I\u2019ve never been to prom, I only went to homecoming once, I didn\u2019t do things that a highschool experience is really about. \n\n**I wish someone told me that it\u2019s about doing your best** The focus on grades was so harmful to me and gave me so much stress and pressure. \n\n**I wish I stood up to my parents** I took the language that THEY wanted me to take, I wanted to take another one. I spent 4 years in a class I hated, and I struggled with it because I just didn\u2019t want to do it. I wish I told them that a B+ in Geometry Honors in 8th grade was good, and that I shouldn\u2019t retake the entire class in 9th (where my teacher legit told me he graded my final lower than everyone else\u2019s bc i took the class before and I ended with a B+ then too) \n\n**I wish I was more vocal** I didn\u2019t start advocating for myself until this year, and it did so much good. I was too scared.\n\n**I wish I told my parents about the stress** I didn\u2019t tell them about how I was feeling and that I was reaching my breaking point. Once I got there, it was so much harder to explain to them. I wish I had done it sooner, and been open, and communicated. \n\n**I wish I didn\u2019t let my teachers completely ignore my accommodations** I have ADHD and I have some accommodations since I struggle with timed tests and remembering assignments. I let them walk all over me, and never asked for my accommodations. When I finally did, they didn\u2019t let me use them or were super harsh (this is literally illegal btw i could sue but i won\u2019t)\n\n**I wish I didn\u2019t let my childhood slip away** I\u2019m almost an adult now. I\u2019m turning 18 soon. I spent so much time worrying about college and my future that I didn\u2019t realize I was growing up. I started this whole thing when I was 11 and took algebra in 7th grade. I went from 11 to 18 and I didn\u2019t notice that I became an adult. I\u2019m not a child anymore. The time where I should have been the least stressed, because I didn\u2019t have a job or taxes or income to worry about, it\u2019s gone. I missed it, I missed the rest of my carefree life in the present because I was so preoccupied with the future. \n\n\nThis has become kinda long, but it is things I wish I knew. Now i\u2019m off to college soon, and I regret so much about how I spent the last 7 years of my childhood.\n\nIf you\u2019re a junior, sophomore, or freshman in high school: Remember to live your life to the fullest. Don\u2019t let the unknown future dictate your present. Do your best in school, work your hardest, but remember that it is okay to take some breaks and have fun. Go to that party, kiss that boy/girl/person, hang out with your friends, be a teenager and enjoy it. Life is too short to spend every moment of your present life working on your future. You have to live in the moment and do what YOU want to do. If that means studying every minute of the day? Sure, do it! If that means working hard and doing your work in school but taking time to have some fun? Do that! Don\u2019t let other people control how you are gonna spend your life.\n\n**I wish I knew that you only live once, don\u2019t waste it on something you hate doing.**",

      "text": "Don\u2019t get too hung up, I don\u2019t want to categorize your emotions... but this sounds like regret shifting to an existential crisis. You\u2019re always a child at heart. You\u2019re 18 not 85! You haven\u2019t even made a dent in your book yet... you\u2019re just getting to the first chapter. Highschool is such a small part of your identity, and it is normal to have these feelings around the senior year of highschool. Hopefully you enjoy college and don\u2019t regret the time you spent in the past. Look back on the good times, learn from the feelings you have now. There are many people who never recognize the present moment. Hopefully you do well in college and beyond. No regrets",

      "text": "From a 35 year old, here's what I've learned: You'll always have something you regret \\*\\*NOT\\*\\* doing. Forever. \n\nFor every person who regrets not having spent more time \"letting their childhood slip away\", there's a kid who wishes they spent more time studying and getting better grades.\n\nYou know why? Because you don't know what MIGHT have happened, so you'll always imagine it as being the ideal. It's not even \"the grass is greener on the other side\", it's \"the grass is greener where I might have watered it\". Maybe in an alternate universe you DID go to those parties and looked back and wonder \"all I did was drink because my friends expected me to--  why didn't I push myself to work harder back then so I don't have to stress now?\"\n\nThe truth is, you'll never know. You know that poem \"The Road \u00a0Not Taken\" by Robert Frost? That poem wasn't about being intrepid or doing what others won't, it was that NO ONE KNOWS where that other path leads, so we either overinflated our decision as being good OR BAD: \"I shall be telling this with a sigh / Somewhere ages and ages hence\". Btw, note that he said \"and that has made all the difference\" without saying what KIND of difference.\n\nThere are some lessons, like some of the ones you listed, that could only be learned from experience and not reading. Learning to stand up to your parents and communicate your needs to teachers isn't new as a concept, but it's hard to do until you experienced it. \n\nThis is going to sound a bit overgeneralized but most people I know really don't feel like they \"became an adult\" until they were 26-27... and not FULLY so until I was like 32! So you've got a good decade ahead to do all those things still.\n\nYOLO is a lie. You don't live once. You live endlessly, every morning you wake up. Don't spend so much time worrying about the roads you could have walked down that you miss the roads you're on now.",

      "text": "I feel like it should have been fairly obvious that a B isn\u2019t the end of the world as most people in school get Bs and Cs in lower level classes and at the same time most people expect to go to college. I guess that\u2019s just what brainwashing does to people. \n\nIn terms of grades, I think it should all be dependent on who you are as a person. Don\u2019t push yourself to get straight As unless you like doing that to yourself and see it as a motivation to learn. Go for those straight As if you want to, in the future, make a name for yourself or want to join strongly academic and skill based fields. Put in as much effort into school as you would want to when you get a job. If you want to just go with the flow then a few Bs and Cs are fine. You won\u2019t end up with a bad job or an unhappy life. \n\nTl;dr study and get good grades if you find it fun and want to do stuff like that all your life. If you don\u2019t find it fun and it makes you want to die, then don\u2019t push yourself over your limit. Settle for a few mediocre grades.\n\nEdit: I wasn\u2019t really clear in my comment but this is my general opinion on it. It isn\u2019t directed at OP since they are already done with high school.",

The amount of money and success you end up with is NOT dependent on where you go nor is it really dependent on what you study, it depends on the decisions you make after college. College is just a stepping stone to get you into the wider and more general market. You also say \"it could have been better\" when again happiness comes from what you find makes you happy, sure if you have a shit ton of money and investments you can travel to all the best hotels in the world, and thats great --- if it makes you happy. If you just want to live a life with a SO, and a typical home of your own, and the odd vacation then that's also very attainable.\n\nTL;DR: Money is NOT a measure of happiness unless your whole personality is $$$.",

It's a fine line and hardly anyone does it right but with some practice, you can get closer to it. There's also the whole deal of if you're studying right, I ended high school salutatorian, stressed, and barely getting enough sleep. Now in college, I've changed my study habits so I can enjoy myself more and still get good grades (even if there a couple of B's)",

The reason being is that the school you go to is really your only impression of the college experience, so the grass is always greener on the other side.\n\nFor example, one of my school's valedictorians from a previous class always wanted to go to Georgetown yet for financial reasons had to attend a local private university. Despite being one of the smartest and kindest people I know who DESERVED to go to a t20, she ended up falling in love with her safety school and spends most of her time convincing us seniors to attend that place instead haha",

Lower grades reduce the number of schools you will be admitted to and reduce the number of choices you can make and opportunities to be happier. \n\nMaybe you misunderstood me: I wasn't trying to say Bs are bad, just that As are better. If there was no advantage to getting better grades, then a grade system wouldn't exist. Are you saying people shouldn't try their best in school?

They are so much more likely to give you the benefit of the doubt. I stressed out so much, until I realized that my health comes first always. Many colleges are seeing drops in grades over the pandemic, so it\u2019s not as extremely harmful to your chances as you may think. It is going to be okay, because I was in the same boat and I turned out okay. I\u2019ve seen firsthand that there\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel, and it\u2019s there for you too!\n\nIf you\u2019re having some problems with mental health (specifically anxiety or severe depression) and you\u2019re undiagnosed... GET DIAGNOSED! you may be eligible for a 504 plan, which can get you accommodations. Getting diagnosed with anxiety or depression is as simple as seeing your usual doctor for a physical. Accommodations for anxiety can include extra time on assignments and tests, and even exempt you from missed work that was missed because of your mental health if it is making you feel worse. i don\u2019t know if this is what you are talking about when you say mental health problems, but i think it is important for people to know that there are options out there for that. schools hate having to give them, but if you are eligible it might help",

      "text": "Thank you for this post. I\u2019m a sophomore and I\u2019ve been really worried about my future and wondering if I\u2019ve done enough and if I need to do more.. I\u2019ve asked a few people for advice on how to get into a good college and the majority of them agree with what you said. All my friends are stressing over their extracurriculars and grades that I got caught up in it too.. I think I\u2019ll just try my best from now on, since my best is actually pretty great :)",
