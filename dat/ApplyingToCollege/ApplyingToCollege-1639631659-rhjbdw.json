  "text": "I got accepted to NYU for Early Decision, but I did not have enough financial aid for my parents to afford to send me there and my twin who got into NYU Shanghai. Can I back out of the ED binding contract? If I do back out of my ED, will it look back on my part. Will other colleges reject me because I broke the ED Contract? I am scared",

You\u2019ll have to contact the admissions office and explain, they may want to work with you do see if they can provide more.\n\nED agreements aren\u2019t legally binding, and I don\u2019t see how/why any other college will know if NYU releases you. Just contact them ASAP. Good luck!",

Or update your aid package.\n\nIf you received the aid expected/promised and only now decide you just don\u2019t want to spend that much, that could be a problem.",
