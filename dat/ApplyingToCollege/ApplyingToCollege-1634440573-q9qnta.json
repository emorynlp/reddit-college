  "text": "\"In the past 3 to 4 years, what experience(s) have you had (inside or outside of the classroom) related to your selected first-choice major or academic interest? (150 words)\"\n\n**My main concern comes from the fact that the word limit restricts me to 2 paragraphs at most.**\n\nIf it matters, my first-choice major is Statistics and Computer Science.\n\nI don't know if I should go big on storytelling, like how I had a lot of fun in APCSP in my freshman year and why that developed my interests, or if I should essentially regurgitate my resume. Any advice?",
