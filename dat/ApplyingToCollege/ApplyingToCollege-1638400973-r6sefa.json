  "title:": "Missed Score Report Deadline. Freaking Out and idk what to do",
  "text": "Basically, I applied early action to a bunch of schools, and for 3 of them I indicated that I was going to submit my SAT score. Over Thanksgiving break I mostly forgot about college stuff for a while, but when I came back I discovered that my applications were incomplete and the deadline for submitting scores were all in mid-November. I emailed my counselor and explained the situation, but she didn\u2019t respond yet and basically I\u2019m freaking out and I have no idea what to do. Am I screwed? Will my applications not be considered because of this, and will I have to withdraw and resubmit? Please help.",
