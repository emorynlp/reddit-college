  "title:": "Former admissions officers opinions on Risky College essays would be appreciated!!!",
  "text": "Ok, so what even qualifies as a \"risky essay\" these days. I have read so many posts online of people (like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nv671n/do_not_write_about_mental_health_or_any_of_the/) by Matty), including private admissions consultants, writing about how to avoid a set list of \"risky essays\" that could potentially get your entire application insta-rejected. Now, I didn't think that mine fell under one of these categories, but am now seriously doubting myself on it after I got flat out rejected from Cornell ED. \n\nI wrote mine about the insecurity around my short height and how I have grown to embrace and love it, with emphasis on the change rather than making it a sob-story, but do you think that I could potentially be seen as a liability by AOs in the future? I know that people write about Gay/les identity as essay topics, so I don't understand why this would be any different in that sense. \n\nI'm seriously considering rewriting my essay, but with a bit more than 2 weeks left and a whole bunch of supps I also need to write, idk if it's a good idea. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: PM me for the essay / more details.",

      "text": "I don't think you're likely to find an admissions reader willing to give feedback. Your essay sounds fine in principle. \n\nA general comment is to not read too much into your acceptances or rejections. A substantial majority of people are rejected by highly selective schools every year, and most of them are qualified and would be successful at all of them.",
