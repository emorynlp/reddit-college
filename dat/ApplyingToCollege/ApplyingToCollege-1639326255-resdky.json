      "text": "There are tons of summer programs. Basically any college that has STEM degrees will have STEM summer programs for high school students. There is also a directory of programs on the Teen Life website.\n\nhttps://www.teenlife.com\n\nPlease note that doing a summer program at College X does not increase your chances of being admitted as an undergraduate to College X. So the reason to do a summer program is for personal growth and experience in a field, not for undergraduate admissions purposes at that college.",
