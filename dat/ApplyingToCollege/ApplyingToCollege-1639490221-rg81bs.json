  "text": "Here's my list (in no particular order):\n\nSkidmore, Bowdoin, Hamilton, Williams, Colgate, Hamline (safety school) \n\nJust for some background knowledge I live in NY so some of these are out of state. I'm going for political science/public policy analysis. I prefer smaller faculty ratios because I come from a small highschool so I want that environment to be replicated somewhat so I'm not dejected from feeling isolated from my teachers. Also I know most of these are extremely selective, any thoughts on that I accept as well. \n\nTell me any of your guy's thoughts positive or negative.",

      "text": "Skidmore is in Saratoga, which is an awesome town! Colgate is in Hamilton, and there is VERY little to do in that town. Same with Hamilton (which is in Clinton). I am not sure if that factors into your decision. Same goes for Williams - very small town. I would say Hamilton and Colgate and Skidmore are much easier to get into than Williams and Bowdoin.",
