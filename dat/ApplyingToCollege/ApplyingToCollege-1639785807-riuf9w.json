The mental health issues are really publicized because of the nature of the gorges. However, that isn\u2019t to say that Cornell is doing great; we do only have one or two psychiatrists for the whole university, which makes it difficult to get help. However, the community at Cornell is AMAZING, and there are so kind and supportive people if you look in the right places. There\u2019s many organizations and clubs (some dedicated to mental health) that are great for finding your community, and have helped me a lot with relieving my stress.",

I\u2019ve also found that the amount of work really fluctuates, so if you spend more time studying during prelim weeks, you can spend more time doing things your enjoy and relaxing the week after.",
