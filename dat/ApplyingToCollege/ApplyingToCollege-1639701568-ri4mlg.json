  "text": "Alright, so this may be a bit rant-y, but here\u2019s my attempt so far at grappling with a dad who takes college admissions and rankings much more seriously than I do. \n\nSo I got denied from a T50 ED but accepted into a very nice school in the exact area I want to be in EA. In all honesty, the latter may be a better fit for me irrespective of the decisions themselves.\n\nAnyway, once I applied to both schools, my dad, who doesn\u2019t live with me, was notified and promptly sent me the schools\u2019 rankings and his interpretation of them (that the T50 was \u201caverage\u201d and the EA was \u201cpretty bad\u201d). I obviously know my dad and know that this response is just him continuing his neurotic and exacting behavior, so logically these digs (if you can call them that) shouldn\u2019t hurt me.\n\nEmotionally, however, you can most likely picture my response. Upon receiving my EA acceptance - a decision I\u2019ve been anticipating for months - I was pretty stoked. Immediately following my acceptance, though, I started to feel his initial remark about the school loom over me. I think about it all day, and it even reached a high enough extent for me to send a very mean text to him.\n\nNot quite sure what the point of this post is, but I\u2019d like some advice to soothe this feeling of invalidation based on arbitrary college rankings. I\u2019m lucky enough to have all my other family members congratulate me (and I\u2019m lucky enough to get into a college I love), but I can\u2019t get my head off of this one response.",

      "text": "Sorry that you have to go through this. We parents need to understand that the college application is a matching process. The best school in the US does not mean that it\u2019s a good match or good fit for your kids. We picked the school, not looking at the ranking, but rather if it will fit my son and he will thrived in this school. I know that you all hate the \u201cwhy me\u201d supplementary essay. But it\u2019s really through this that you can see if you are a good fit for the school.",
