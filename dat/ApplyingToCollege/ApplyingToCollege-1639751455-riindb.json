              "text": "It's a meme that every other state hates NJ above any other state except their direct rival. There's some truth to the fact that NJites are boisterous and proud of being from NJ and it can be abrasive, but a lot of the hate comes from people who have never actually experienced it beyond the trivial non-representative ways:\n\n* people from NYC and Philadelphia are too busy staring up their own buttholes to ever leave their precious vibrant urban cores, so their entire concept of NJ is \"oh, those trashy poor downtrodden satellite cities near our unassailable metropolis\", ignoring the rest of the state.\n* relatedly, people who couldn't imagine not living in major megalopolises berate NJ for having few or no \"actual\" cities; but people who come from rural areas experience NJ as too crowded because it's the most densely populated state.\n* many on the rest of the east coast think only of the couple of big highways that act as a key thoroughfare through the mid atlantic region to the northeast, but ignore that the vast majority of the state is not the industrial sprawl that has built up around those highways. (There's an old George Carlin joke \"NJ calls itself the Garden State. What are they growing, fucking smokestacks?\" that is a perfect example of this misconception, despite being one of the states with the highest percentage of its land dedicated to state and national parks.)\n* many recall a trashy TV show \"The Jersey Shore\" and treat that as though all NJ people are excessively tanned, shallow idiots. But this ignores that just about all the people on that show were from Staten Island, not NJ, to say nothing of the general aspect that television exaggerates everything.\n* people associate it with stereotypical early-to-mid 20th century Italian American culture and treat the state as though its culture were some sort of a motion picture Mafia monolith, despite that it really no longer is dominated by Italian American culture and instead has one of the largest percentages of immigrants from around the world (e.g. there's a town near P that's literally nicknamed West WIndia!)\n* people hate the \"Joisey accent\" that like 5% of NJ people, tops, have.",
