  "title:": "Would it be okay to write a personal statement about organizing a protest?",
  "text": "Hey all! \n\nI immigrated to the US 3 years ago, and naturally, I'm really involved in all types of social justice but specifically that related to issues of immigrants. Last summer, I organized a protest/rally about immigrant issues; it wasn't a super political abolish ICE type thing, more about the accessibility of adults to ESL classes in the area, jobs, etc., and I thought it would be a good theme for my personal statement. \n\nWould this be a bad topic to write an essay about since it's still a bit political? I would in the end make it more about my culture and stuff, less about politics but still enough to take an obvious stand\n\nThanks!",
