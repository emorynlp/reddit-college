  "title:": "Need Help Ranking UCSD Colleges",
  "text": "Done with my UC Apps but unsure about UCSD Rankings. I checked every UCSD college ranking discussion but most of them are STEM or econ focused kids so I'm not sure if I should go with the advice stated in their comments.... also I'm unable to post on the r/UCSD directly bcoz this is a new account :(\n\nI'm an international student applying undeclared (humanities/social sciences) and will probably major in gender studies.\n\nHere's my tentative rankings- ERC, Muir, Marshall, Revelle, Sixth, Warren, Seventh\n\nDo you think these seem appropriate? If u have any inputs please let me know.... I'll be super grateful for any suggestions.\n\nps- ERC first bcoz I like their global perspectives focus...seventh last bcoz I actually liked the official info n GE reqs but the complaints against seventh on r/ UCSD really made me question my choices lol.",
