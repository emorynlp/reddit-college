  "text": "What is the LOR status supposed to look like on the common app? \n\nI'm applying to common app schools as well as MIT. Today, both my teachers submitted the MIT LOR, and I got an email notifying me of that, so I know they submitted it. My math teacher said he submitted the common app LOR last week. However, the common app shows his teacher evaluation as \"not started.\" It says the same for my counselor and English teacher. What is it supposed to look like? Should I be concerned that there's something wrong? Did I do something wrong when I invited my teachers?",

My best guess is that it took a few hours to process(?) or that they for some reason both submitted it like 4 hours after the MIT LOR. And maybe when my math teacher said he'd done the common app LOR he actually just meant that he'd written it, not submitted it. Anyway, thanks!",
