Tbh though it\u2019s easier for a student to schedule a Zoom appointment with me so it\u2019s on both our calendars as opposed to playing phone tag. But absolutely you should feel free to call! \n\nAlso, make sure you have a professional voice mail greeting. So if I call you, your voice mail message should say something like:\n\n\u201cHi! This is (name). I\u2019m sorry I missed your call but please leave me a message and I\u2019ll call you back as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nOnce in a while, I call a student and they have a voice mail message that is designed to trick you into thinking that they actually answered. Know those? Those make me really upset and leave a terrible impression.",

If you call, you should have a question or two. But If you meet with an AO in person or on Zoom, you should absolutely discuss your interests, experiences, and activities.",
