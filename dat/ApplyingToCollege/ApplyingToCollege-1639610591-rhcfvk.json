Not bc I\u2019m upset about UPenn but because I\u2019m extremely aware of the fact that I will have to wait like another 3/4 months before I get another decision and that\u2019s like a third of a year or something (more like 1/4)? Not getting into UPenn or unc essentially means that in the eyes of my parents I\u2019ve set the family back and that\u2019s the last thing I ever wanted to do so grieving the pride they won\u2019t have for me is hard",
