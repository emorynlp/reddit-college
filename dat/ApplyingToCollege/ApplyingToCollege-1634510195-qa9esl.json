  "text": "hi! I have a (fairly) common question, but what should I do when one of my recommenders tells me to draft a letter and then they'll revise and review it? I'd assume that it's because my recommender isn't very good at common English and is quite busy right now since she's a research professor.\n\nMy biggest worry is that the letter will sound too much like my voice and the AO will catch on so I don't know how to address this. And also like most people, I don't want to come off as bragging or self conceited when I send my recommender the draft.\n\nI'd appreciate any advice!",

      "text": "Okay so sometimes the recommender is lazy/doesn\u2019t want to write it out so they ask the person asking to write a draft. Most of them will then use your draft as basically their outline and only add or take out things they don\u2019t want included and conclude it with their signature. You can either submit an old rec letter you might have or write a rec letter putting your self in the recommenders shoes. If they were your math teacher, you could write something along the lines of \u201c everytime y/n submits their class work/ tests I find it challenging to find any mistakes or errors. This is due to y/n\u2019s resilience and enthusiasm to learn math every morning, she is an outstanding example for every student that enters my classroom\u2026..\u201d\nIk it sounds weird to brag abt yourself but that\u2019s literally what rec letters are for. For someone ( your recommender) to talk abt all of your hard work showing and what a great addition you are in every room. Hope this helps!",
