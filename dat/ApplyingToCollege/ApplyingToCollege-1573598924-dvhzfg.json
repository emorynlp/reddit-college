  "text": "I have made a horrible, horrible mistake.\n\nAs I sit here, my college-app experience drawing to a close, I look back on my experience in high school and I now fathom how hard I\u2019ve fucked up. \n\nI have no social life. I have very few friends, none of whom I ever see after school, I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend, never been invited to parties, I\u2019m horribly depressed, which only continues this terrible cycle. All because I needed to do homework and ECs.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be the diligent scholar anymore. I want to go party, I want to hang out with friends, I want to get a girl, I want to have fun. For once. And here I am, so horribly alone, as friends tear up thinking about their end of year-celebration, I do the same for my own lack of such an experience. If this is what Caltech wants, if this is what a \u201cgood student\u201d is supposed to end up as,\n\nGod help us all.\n\nEDIT: damn this blew up. It\u2019s disheartening yet nice to see that I am not alone. I\u2019m gonna stop replying to comments but I am both glad and saddened so many people empathize with this post.",

Theres nothing wrong with not going to a T20.\n\nI realized this a bit later than you did. Went to school freshman year and transferred to a T30 because the old school wasnt right for me. I know this school is a better fit, but damn i really should have realized earlier there is more to life than grinding schoolwork. \n\nNow im here with almost no free time, and im barely passing classes because im trying to make some sort of social life here.\n\nGo with your gut on this one. Best of luck",

I don't really think the works all that harder (depending on major, of course). It's up to you to find a balance, and you can still get good grades and be a great student while maintaining a social life.\n\nLearn to balance that before college.",

But sophomore year versus freshman year? Oh my god. Freshman year, I literally never knew what was going on, I didn\u2019t keep a planner, I didn\u2019t know how to study or take notes, and I generally wasn\u2019t able to function. Sophomore year? I thrived, through my first AP class, through honors classes and got straight A\u2019s (and one B+ second semester) for the first time in 5 years. Freshman year is literally the worst year for so many people. Also, improving is a good thing! Look at the trends!",

Well, I accomplished all of those in short order and... it gets old. \n\nYou\u2019ll quickly find that none of that stuff matters unless you find a way to balance it all out with your education. Think long term: do you really want to look back at your undergraduate days as you slave away behind a tiny desk, doing tiny things with your life, wondering \u201cwhat if I had applied myself?\u201d \n\nI came to that realization after my second year of premed, and made some changes. I switched over to a philosophy major with an emphasis on medical ethics (the stuff I was actually interested in); started hitting the gym hard; hung out with my close friends frequently, but distanced myself from the kids that were there purely to get shitfaced (don\u2019t burn bridges though, those types are still fun to be around when you have time to party); focused on getting all of my schoolwork done before any leisure activities; stopped chasing girls and let them fall into my life when it suited me. \n\nBalancing everything out helped to keep me stable; the fuller your days are, the less time you have to think negatively. You\u2019ll find yourself living a much happier life when all your ducks are in a row. Who doesn\u2019t want to be the guy who\u2019s greeted with cheers and hugs when they walk into a party, while also being in the top 10% of their class? I\u2019m now attending a highly ranked law school on a juicy scholarship, and the skills I picked up in undergrad have enabled me to make a ton of friends there as well. If I had continued the unchecked party lifestyle I lived for my first two years of undergrad, there\u2019s no chance I\u2019d be where I am now as far as my career, and certainly not as happy with my life. \n\nGo to classes, pay attention, study hard, talk to people, hit the gym, and, of course, party on the weekends. The girlfriend situation will sort itself out if you\u2019re doing all these things right. You got this man!",

You can focus on who you want to become.  You will find that making friends in college is orders of magnitude easier than high school because you all live in the same place.  You can hang out with friends ~14+ hours per day.  You can make new friends every single week.  If you want a girlfriend, you can almost certainly find one.  If you look at yourself in the mirror and don't like the man you see, guess what?  You can change him.  It's not going to happen overnight, but college is one of the most formative experiences of your whole life.  You can 100% change who you are and what you don't like about yourself in college.  You can also have fun doing it.\n\nIf you're feeling depressed, [you should read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a7c5rp/stressed_anxious_overwhelmed_depressed_this_is/).  I wrote it for you and all the other insanely gifted overachievers who have a hard time feeling good about themselves, getting past their mistakes, or just getting their brain chemicals to suck less.  Good luck!",

You are going to make friends, go to parties, meet girls, all the works. This will pass. Hang in there man!\n\nHOWEVER, in the meantime, you should schedule plans with the friends you do have and try something spontaneous! Go on a little trip to a nearby city or try a restaurant you haven't been to before or maybe do some fun holiday stuff. \n\nI promise it gets better, but try to make a little change to your high school career.

      "text": "This sounds very familiar.\n\n\nTake you now and me from a year ago and compare us. We are the exact same person.\n\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve fought alcoholism, substance severe manipulation from a girlfriend, and 6 near-suicide attempts, just to name a few.\n\n\nI understand where you are. I\u2019ve been there myself. I understand your mentality about going to parties and getting fucked up.\n\n\nHell, just last night, me and some other people had to call the university police on someone who took over 10 milligrams of Xanax. They found them driving their car.\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard. It\u2019s very hard. I\u2019ve been there myself.\n\n\nI\u2019m not denouncing drugs or alcohol. In my opinion though, it is important to do those with a good mindset, meaning to take care of your mental issues before you do anything.\n\n\nI dropped acid a month ago, while terribly depressed. It was one of the worst nights of my life.\n\n\nDrugs and alcohol must be done with a good mindset. When you go to college, don\u2019t stay away from them, if you want to do them. But don\u2019t rely on them as a crutch, or self medicate.\n\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to tell you is to not get too caught up into the negativity you\u2019re feeling. Life changes. Life changes fast.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard of the rice purity test. It\u2019s a joke test people take to assess how pure they are. I took it my senior year with my very little friends and got a 98. Now, one year later, I\u2019m at a 47.\n\n\nLife changes fast.\n\n\nI haven\u2019t had an easy life, and I don\u2019t pretend to. Truthfully, it has been much harder for me to get to where I am than it is for most people to get to a lower level.\n\n\nA fact of life: life is suffering. Life. Is. Suffering.\n\n\nThe only thing that makes life worth it is how you transcend that suffering. People have to know how to take the reins of their life and find their own destiny. I believe everybody has a destiny. I think that you aren\u2019t guaranteed it, however. I think you have to find the right path that will take you there.\n\n\nMy advice to you is to look into mental health resources. I\u2019ve started seeing counseling through my college, and it\u2019s changed my life. I\u2019m sober, back to the gym, prescribed medication, and actually doing my work, to name a few.\n\n\nPlease, get help. It\u2019s important. It\u2019s very important. Though at times it may seem like no one cares, there is at least one person. And I can guarantee you that.\n\n\nIf you won\u2019t do it for yourself, do it for them.\n\n\nEDIT:\nIf you ever need anything, PM me.",

      "text": "Hey!\n\nI figured I'd share my two cents because I was in a similar position to you two years ago (I'm a senior rn, so sophomore year). I took stupid hard classes, tried so hard to focus on ECs and sports, and wore myself thin, to the point that I was probably teetering towards depression. I thought that college was the most important thing, and that it was Ivy or Die(vy) I couldn't take it anymore.\n\nSo, I stopped. I took different classes in my junior year, lightened up on my course load, and choose what I cared about for classes.\n\nI love language, so I started taking Chinese. Opened doors for me. Now, I have a far better chance at acceptance to one of those top schools than if I had just stuck to the boring stuff I hated. Do what you care about. Do it passionately, fervently, and with love. Do it without worrying if others are doing the same. No one else at my school took Chinese; I took it online. Simply put, do you. Otherwise, you're just another kid with good ECs and scores, and not a genuine version of yourself. Check this out if you have the time, and you still care about getting in to a top school: [https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/stanford-university/2126488-how-to-get-into-stanford-by-someone-who-didnt.html](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/stanford-university/2126488-how-to-get-into-stanford-by-someone-who-didnt.html)",

Senior in a foreign country, never been to a proper party, had only like 10 -13 people i could call a friend at school(some of them werent even in my grade), nor had i ever had a girlfriend before and was freakin out about college. \n\n From my experience ive learnes as a freshmen it is so important to put yourself out of your comfort zone and talk to people in the first couple of months because once the first semester is over people will probably already have groups and not  be as welcoming to new people as they were in the first semester. \n\nAnyway my point is just be yourself and try and experience new things that intrest you. People will be bound to invite you to go woth them to places. Just say yes and enjoy it. You may even meet your future bestfriend or girlfriend while your out. One more thing keep up with your grades while your in college its a lot cooler to stay in and graduate to become the nex Jeff bezoz than to be another college dropout and dissapoint your parents. Anyway thats the end of my rant. Enjoy your next 3-4 years of college my dude.\n\nP.s. - Holy shit im high as fuck. anyone got any pancakes?",

Go out every weekend, get drunk (safely), stay out too late, hookup (if that's what you are into), live your fucking life. If your parents are super strict start to wear them down. Explain your side, push up your curfew, learn to stand up for yourself--it goes a long way. There's no reason to stop yourself anymore, your grades are in, your sat/act is done, and I promise to you, you are going to go to college. It might seem incredibly important, but the college you go to doesn't fucking matter. College as an institution is degrading at a rapid pace. In 10 years, the weight of the degree you receive will be lighter than the paper it's written on. So stop fucking stressing.",

Having been in the working world for almost 30 years now, and having interviewed quite a few people, I find that grades in college don't really matter as much as the college you went to....so once you're on campus there's no need to work 24/7 to be first in class. Get good grades in college.....but also enjoy the college experience. As a side note....my wife and I currently hang out mostly with our neighbors, co-workers, and the parents of our kids friends.....so there are many phases of friends throughout life.",

Work some shit job, eat some garbage food that barely sustains you, spend your time making friends, and find joy in life. Do not go to college unless it is what you know you are ready for. College is not what everyone makes it out to be. It is true there are jobs that require a degree, Education for example, but plenty don't. And the ones that don't often pay just as well without you ending up in debt after wasting your twenties not living. I encourage everyone I know to take a break from school after high school. Now is not the time to be spending working until your dead, now is the time for life. Go out there and struggle, and when your ready (if that happens) you can always get back into  the education game. Live life, live while you still have knees that work and energy to do so.",

      "text": "Work on yourself more - nobody at your school cares how much time you put into school/studying.  If youre not getting invited to social gatherings, theres more to it than just time spent studying. I know lots of people at parties that take AP and IB classes along with their ECs and still find time to have fun. As long as you can show people that your fun and not an awkward kid that only talks about school, you will get invited to parties. Also, dont think that you have to be invited to every party, there are lots of parties that arent invite only. Many parties just have an instagram account you must follow (some dont at all) and pay a few $ at the door to get in - take advantage of this. And let people know you want to get invited places and go to parties. Sure you would hope people (even your closest friends) automatically think of you when inviting people, but if they dont, just ask - the worst they can say is no.\n\nStart telling your at school friends you want to do something after class, or the weekend of. Dont wait for people to hit you up. Most people will forget that you exist out of school unless you show them that you do.\n\nIf youre having trouble talking to girls, it helps to think of them as a guy. Say whatever you would say to a guy and make your self as comfortable as possible (relax yourself). Dont approach a girl expecting for the conversation to end with them giving you their number for a date, unless you already know that they like you.",

When I bring up my grades I know I'm just after attention (thats my best way yo put it). The kids at my school all associtate me with this tryhard academic youre describing, but more than that they think i see myself as better than them. so i guess ive grown to dislike people who flex their grades and get away with it, bc i try so hard to mask that.\n\nThat probably made no sense but basically Im sorry I was disputatious.",
