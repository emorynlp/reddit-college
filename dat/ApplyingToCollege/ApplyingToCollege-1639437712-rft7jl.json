  "text": "basically, i'm planning on going into psych. my word count for this school is 150, so i have to keep things brief. i decided to talk a little about their psych program and a specific professor i liked and then a little about a club i'm interested in. this professor does research in mental disorders and treatment, which is a specific point of interest for me. i mentioned that, but i also saw some people saying that it's good to mention research that personally affects you. would it be weird to mention that his research affects me as someone who struggles with mental illness? my main concern is that it might sound guilt-trippy or something. honestly, i just think it's cool that his research has real effects on my life. i wanted to make a point about that, but i'm not sure if it will come off that way.\n\n(if you have any more general advice, that's cool too lol)",

      "text": "Ok so your essay sounds super good so far, but I would say maybe don't mention yourself specifically. If u do have room u could say there are people (u could say family or friends, even if youre the only person you know with it) that you know that would be personally affected by it. I don't think you should say the research personally affects u because some schools (sadly) might take that negatively (even if it's generally an accepting school) especially if it's about more stigmatized illnesses but I think making it seem personal (but not too personal\ud83d\ude2d) could be a good touch. I'd say though if it seems too hard or annoying to figure out, you'll have a strong essay without it too.",
