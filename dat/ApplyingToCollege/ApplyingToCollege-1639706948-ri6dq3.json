  "text": "I was just rejected from my dream school a few days ago, and am shattered. I saw myself so immensely in that school, I loved everything about it, and am so so sad to have been rejected. My family is comforting me by saying it wasn't meant to be, but it feels so wrong, I feel like that was where I was supposed to be and I just screwed up my shot. I know that there are plenty of other schools I could be happy at, but I am more wondering if you think that everything happens for a reason, that I wasn't meant to go to that school, or if I just messed up and missed the opportunity to go to a school I would've loved. Thanks. \n\n(I acknowledge the very dramatic tone of this post, sorry, I'm still reeling from this rejection that hit me hard)",

      "text": "I don\u2019t. But that doesn\u2019t mean you messed up either. Sometimes you can do every single thing right and still not get what you wanted. So much in life, including college admissions, is not fully in our control. There are other people making decisions that impact us, environmental factors nobody could have changed, etc. The best we can do is to make the best of what we get. There have been things and people I\u2019ve lost I\u2019ll never get back and I don\u2019t see a single reason why that should be \u201cmeant to be.\u201d But if I just despair over that, I\u2019ll never get anywhere, right? And I have other places I want to go and things I want to do, and I\u2019m sure you do too. As painful as it is, I need to get back up and find or make those precious things in other parts of my life. Process your rejection and take your time. But you\u2019ll be able to bounce back from this and find things you love in other places as well, I promise. Maybe it won\u2019t be quite the same as your dream school, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s necessarily worse either. I hope this helps you feel a bit better, OP. Take some time off, talk with family about non-admissions things, and enjoy break. We\u2019ve all earned it.",

It\u2019s hard, but I\u2019m trying to tell myself that there is a reason\u2026maybe a different college will give me access to my dream job or maybe I\u2019ll meet my future husband there. One thing that has helped is that I asked a current student to tell me all the things she dislikes about my Ed school, and whenever I find myself thinking about it I remind myself of those things (for example there are lots of bugs and I have a phobia of them)",
