  "title:": "What is 'significant' research? (for Amherst Essay)",
  "text": "So I came across Amherst's optional research essay, and I was wondering if any of the following applies to the prompt:\n\n1. I worked at an organization and conducted a survey research project on the impact of the pandemic on university students' mental health. We made correlations with variables such as type of institution attended, gender, age, etc., and the effect of the lockdown on a student's mental health. Did a lot of data analysis and sht, and the highlights of the report were featured in over 70 news channels. Also did a press conference with reporters (I might have to delete this post, people related to this project will immediately know lol)\n2. I am in an engineering club in my school and in a group project, we made a fire alarm with Arduino. It detects smoke, rings the buzzer and sends alerts to ambulance and fire services. This project was optional and not a part of the curriculum but it was under the school anyway.\n\nThe second one relates more to my intended major but it was in grade 9. Also, the prompt says it should be 'outside high school curriculum' so idk if the 2nd one's even applicable. The first one's more original than the 2nd one too. So, I am confused as to which project I should choose or if I should respond to the prompt at all.",

      "text": "I think both of these would qualify and both would be fantastic options.  The first feels more \"significant\" in nature because of the impact.  \n\n\"Independently of your high school curriculum\" means that your research was not for a class at school.  If it was related to a club or other EC, then it's fine, as both of yours are.  If it was for a class, for credit, or for something that shows up on your transcript, then you may need to look for something else.",

          "text": "Ah thank you so much! I'll go with the first one then. I'm pretty sure my rec from my CS teacher will talk about the second project anyway. But I couldn't properly describe the first one in the activities section so this will prolly also be a great chance to elaborate on it even if it's not related to my intended major\n\nOnce again, thank you!!",
