  "text": "A few days ago I sent out my early application to one of the Ivy League colleges. The whole ordeal was pretty complicated since I am an international student and none of my friends/family members are attending an US college. I tried my best to stay on top of all the admission and financial aid forms. I filled out my css profile on time and sent it out alongside my application. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t know that this particular college required IDOC forms after filling out the css profile (to be fair I didnt know that such a thing existed) and I have missed the deadline for failing them. Can I still be awarded financial aid?",
