  "text": "I don't know if I should ask someone from my school to be my counselor ( I'm in a Moroccan high school) even though they don't know anything about college admissions and stuff or I just choose a counselor from the center that's 'helping' me with the application journey. I heard that having a counselor from my school is better but what if they screw up?? Another thing that is my center is the counselor or many other students applying this year, is that gonna lower my chances of getting accepted into good schools? I honestly don't know what to do pls help.",

      "text": "So for US college admissions, usually there's a high school counselor who represents your school, and submits 1. a school report (how many graduate, how many take advanced classes, how your school is set up, basically), 2. your transcript, and 3. your Counselor Recommendation (they often ask you to fill out a questionnaire about yourself, because, for example, our high school has 2 counselors for 650 students, and they won't be able to get to know all the kids).  \n\nThen, some kids have private admissions counselors that help them with the application journey, as you put it.  These counselors do NOT write letters or do anything directly with the colleges.  \n\nUS kids don't really have a choice.  The one who represents the school is the one who submits the info.  If you're talking about the private counselor, then it's totally up to you, and I'd go with the one who will help you the most, but again, they're not writing anything for you that gets submitted to colleges.",
