  "text": "So basically I have a good gpa imo (3.88 uw and 4.44w)  but the reason it is not 4.0 is because of some extenuating circumstances I have explained on my app. These grades were received during the first semester of my sophomore year of high school and I am worried they will significantly decrease my chances at some of the schools I want to go to. I have since gotten all A's in my classes including this year where I am taking 5 ap classes. The rest of my app is really strong (my resume impressed a T5 professor so much he is now writing me a letter to the dean of admissions at his university advocating for my acceptance). Any idea how T20's will look at this? Hooks are first gen, hispanic, and low income if that helps?",
