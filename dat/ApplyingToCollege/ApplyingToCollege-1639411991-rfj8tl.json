  "text": "I'm an international, and I didn't know how important those activities are till I had to set up my common app last year. Do they hold the same value? I have read somewhere here on this reddit that it might raise a red flag since this might indirectly tell AOs that im doing all of this for the sake of college apps. I would like to know your perspective on this?",
