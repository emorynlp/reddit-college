  "text": "edit: alright bet y\u2019all I\u2019m doing this tomorrow\n\nedit 2: alright people I don\u2019t know how to post proof so I\u2019m just typing what I said lol the email was sent at 8:22 pm EST to the Georgia Tech Office of Admissions email address. Thank you guys for the inspiration :) the letter reads as follows:\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nThank you for your letter regarding my admission decision. Unfortunately after reviewing the letter I regret to inform you that I will not be able to offer you a spot on my list of rejections this year. I wish a different decision had been possible but I hope this knowledge will be beneficial to your plans for the future. Through this excruciating process, I worked hard to holistically review the credentials of each college. While I wish it were possible to offer this coveted position to every college, I\u2019m faced with the necessity of choosing only a select few. I offer my sincerest apologies for informing you of this.\n\nI appreciate your continued interest of me as a student and wish you the best success in your future endeavors\n\nWarmly,\nme :)\nRejected Georgia Tech Applicant",

Therefore, please accept this letter as official notification that I will be attending GA Tech, starting in the Fall 2020 semester.  In light of this, I kindly ask that you create an admitted student account for me and credit it with the equivalent amount of funds given to your top scholarship recipients.\n\nShould you have any questions about this matter, please feel free to contact me via this (leave link) reddit post.\n\nSigned, \nThe Student You Rejected that Refuses to Take No For An Answer",
