  "text": "Broke my streak today, after five lucky acceptances I got deferred from Fordham. I'm not really that interested in the school and I mainly applied because of the fee waiver. Anyways it says I need to complete a deferral form by a certain date. If I don't really care about Fordham that much do I NEED to complete this form? If I don't, will I just not be considered for the regular decision round or is there more to it?\n\nEdit: lol nvm I can't read I can just withdraw if I want to I think, but does anyone know if I have to pay the application fee if I want to be considered again?",
