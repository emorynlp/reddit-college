If it's your counselor then trust what they say. If it's your teacher then trust them but take the advice with a little bit of salt. If it's your parents then unless they point out minor mistakes then you should ignore them. If it's your friends or classmates, then ignore them completely and stop sharing your essays.",

The admissions officers are gonna be adults in the same demographic as your teachers and parents, so their opinions are worth more than your friends and classmates. Also parents can fix technical/grammatical mistakes but usually don't know what they're talking about and are always biased.",
