  "title:": "Through highschool, I never really thought about college apps when choosing classes, activities, and extracurriculars.",
  "text": "I absolutely refuse to regret that, no matter what happens with my college apps. \n\nI might not have done my absolute best in every class, but I worked damn hard, and I'm still proud of my effort and achievement. I just finished the last show of my last fall play, I refuse to regret doing play instead of robotics team or something more \"relevant\" to my major. I absolutely love being a part of theater and the people I acted with. I play bass and guitar, but I'm not that good. I'm not in a band or anything. I don't care. I've grown in my abilities so much over the past few years, and I love playing at church. I love listening to music and playing video games, and even though I can't put that on an app, those things are still valuable to me. \n\nI want to get into Carnegie Mellon. I love that campus and that school's atmosphere. Even if I don't get in, I refuse to beat myself up over not being the perfect student. I made the choices I made, and I know I'll have a great time in college even if I end up going Pitt. \n\n",

She'd rather make art, play guitar, and swim... and that's okay.\n\nBe yourself.  And, as yourself, be enough.",

I have no special knowledge about colleges or life.\n\nb) I think the bottom line is that, for the most part, assuming that you're a bright, motivated kid who has a vague idea of what you want, and how the world works: You should live your life for you, not to please some adult in a college admissions office.\n\nObviously, if you want to apply to selective colleges, you have to take try to take college prep classes, even if you're not thrilled with taking math or English.\n\nYou probably ought to make an effort to do something outside of school other than watching TV, staring at your celing and posting on Reddit.\n\nBut, in my opinion: You're absolutely right. At some point, you have to live your life for you. You have no idea how much time you have on earth. You have no real idea what the right path is for you to have a fulfilling life.\n\nYou have no idea what kinds of kids will be easy or hard for Carnegie Mellon to find.\n\nSome people will get rich by taking IT and accounting courses and doing everything by the book.\n\nSome people will get rich, or, at least, have satisfying lives by doing bizarre things such as majoring in English, starting garage bands or trying to make short films.\n\nIf you loved being in your school play: That was certainly the right choice for you. Try not to let the boneheads in admissions offices psyche you out. Carnegie Mellon is great, but, if you have any hope there, you can probably get into a fine state flagship university, and you'll do fine if you go there, too, and you probably won't have to put your soul in a blind trust to get in there.",
