      "text": "What do you want to study?\n\nNothing really wrong with sticking to the UCs and Cal State options if you like them and at least one is both safe admissions wise for you in the field you want to study and a school you would be happy to attend.  \n\nIf you are going for a major that's capped everywhere you are looking at, I'd probably include at least one out of state option - with your grades you would probably get merit aid or WUE discounts to make an out of state safety cost competitive.\n\nIf the net price calculators look ok for selective private schools that interest you, and you would prefer them to the UCs, go ahead and take a couple of shots.  Compared to the cost of attending college, the application fees aren't that bad.",

If you don't prefer those schools to your favorite couple of UCs, that's fine too.",
