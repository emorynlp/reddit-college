  "title:": "Sending FAFSA after first 10 colleges",
  "text": "I filled out the FAFSA for 10 colleges before October ended, which were my ED/EA and some RD colleges. I realized I didn\u2019t switch out the colleges for the few RD ones I have left. Will I get less financial aid for not sending it sooner for those last few RD colleges? Should I send it now? Their deadlines for FAFSA are kind of far away, but will I get the same amount of financial aid if I submitted the FAFSA early-ish just not to those specific RD colleges?",
