  "text": "so...my why major & why rice essays are already heavily humanities/culture-related. AND I'm a east Asian kid who doesn't do cultural activities like traditional music/dance etc...does anyone know how to approach this essay from a non-cultural perspective?\n\n*Rice is lauded for creating a collaborative atmosphere that enhances the quality of life for all members of our campus community. The Residential College System and undergraduate life is heavily influenced by the unique life experiences and cultural tradition each student brings. What life perspectives would you contribute to the Rice community? (500 word limit)*",

      "text": "Talk about \"unique life experiences\" in your essay. That's the other option outside of cultural traditions/activities in the prompt. Is there a part of your upbringing/life that could potentially contribute to the Rice community? Another way to answer it is to look at Rice's values of collaborativeness, friendliness and stuff that has to do with the residential college system. In what ways have you exhibited these qualities? What experiences made you able to see value in Rice's community and how would this help you contribute to it?",
