So check that. And if you can't. Maybe have someone look over it and see what you can edit out. Use contractions to save word count as well.",

They're not gonna reject you because you said \"don't\" instead of \"do not.\" \n\nCut away fluff if you can. Details are important but if they contribute nothing to the message you are trying to convey, get rid of it.",
