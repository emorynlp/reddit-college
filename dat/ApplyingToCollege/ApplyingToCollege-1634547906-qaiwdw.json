  "text": "I'm applying to as an Industrial/product design major. I created a small bookshelf that I have been using in my room for about 2 years. I wanted to include it in my application portfolio as it should demonstrate that I have knowledge and skills in woodworking, even it if is just a very simple design. I have a bunch of books, folders, and other things on it, and it actually looks pretty cluttered. Should I have a picture of these things on the bookshelf? I don't know if it would be good to show the product in use because, it's pretty obvious how to use the product, it's just a shelf. On the other hand, it might show that the product has been successful, as it has been able to sustain the weight of somewhere around 50-60 pounds (rough estimate) of weight for 2 years. Should I just have pictures of the bookshelf by itself, without anything on it?",
