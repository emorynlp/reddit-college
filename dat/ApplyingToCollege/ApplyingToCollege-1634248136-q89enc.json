  "text": "Okay so I already applied to 3 different colleges. I\u2019m in a dual enrollment program but the college won\u2019t let me sign up for second semester classes until December. Because of this I had placeholder classes for second semester (I explained this in my app). I met with my counselor yesterday and she removed the placeholder classes from my schedule (which she sends to the schools along with my transcript), as well as swapped one class for another in the second quarter (both are elective classes). Should I contact the colleges I already applied to and tell them about this? If so how should I contact them?",
