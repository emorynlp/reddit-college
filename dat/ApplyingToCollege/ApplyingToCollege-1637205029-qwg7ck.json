  "title:": "Feeling lost and unimpressive as an Ivy hopeful sophomore - what to do?",
  "text": "Sorry if this is overly personal, the wrong place, or both. I could just use some guidance and, if I'm being honest, reassurance. I hope you guys enjoy reading this.  \n\n\nI'm currently a sophomore in High School. I was homeschooled until the 8th grade, when I started attending a public school somewhere ambiguously in New England. I've always wanted to attend an elite school, especially Harvard, where I have incredibly legacy having at least 6 immediate family members having attended.  I understand that this post may be filled with extreme \"first world problems,\" but please understand that I'm trying my best to do my best in terms of maximizing my college chances while not cutting corners like starting disingenuous charitable organizations or starting fake clubs. I'm reasonably confident that wherever I go, I'd like to major in finance.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, I started off extremely clumsy and very far behind in some basic areas, especially social interaction and work ethic as I'd never worked with others my age or done serious academic work. As a result, I did relatively poorly in my one grade of middle school, where I was depressed due to feeling like an outsider and being seen as such  by the \"smart kids\" I wanted to be like. Thanks to COVID bringing me back to a more comfortable  social and academic environment, I did very well in my freshman year of high school, at least academically, getting mostly A+'s and a few scattered A's. Unfortunately, I had almost no extracuricular activities of note during that year. I ran on the track team, which I loved but was terrible at, being among the slowest on the entire team. I submitted to some writing competitions, but I didn't win any. \n\nMy drive to excel in school has definitely increased since then, especially due to the confidence the good grades gave me in my freshman year. My grades have stayed very strong, even though I worried that taking more difficult classes (I'm taking 4 APs this year, and I took 0 my freshman year), would hurt me. My social life has also improved significantly, making me much more motivated. I also took the SAT early this year, scoring a 1550. I was obviously very happy with this, especially an incredible reading score of 790, but I scored a math section of 760, 30 points lower than any I'd scored in practice on this exam, so I plan to retake at least once in my Junior year to improve my score. I'm confident that I can increase it to near-perfect.   \n\n\nOne concern I do have though is my foreign language. In my homeschooling, I only took 2 years of Spanish when I was roughly 8 years old. I've forgotten most things, and I'm essentially starting from nothing. I wasn't allowed to take Spanish in 8th grade as they didn't have any basic classes. In 9th grade, there were no spaces for me in any Spanish classes, the only language I was really interested in learning. Unfortunately, in my \\*infinite\\* wisdom, I didn't study Spanish during this time. I was put in a Spanish 1 class this year, but it was essentially a special education class and I'd retained enough to be placed out of it. I opted to independent study Spanish with some courses. I'm currently half way through a Spanish 2 course after a few weeks and trying to get through as much as possible, but I'm really not sure I'll be able to catch up to my peers who have a massive head start and are taking native-level classes by the end of high school.  \n\nI've also worked extremely hard in running and gotten to a place where I've moved from eighteenth fastest on my mediocre track team to fourth or fifth (approximately fiftieth in the state). While this progress is good, I'm under no illusions that this is in any way impressive, especially to colleges. I'm much more talented in another sport, squash, but its elitism, exclusivity, and talent-based nature don't really appeal to me. If possible, I'd love to become good enough at running through sheer hard work alone, but I'm clearly not exceptionally talented. I've been dealing with a light injury recently due to training stress, which has only made it more clear to me that it is very likely that I may try my hardest for the remaining 2 years I have in high school without achieving anything impressive or significant in running.   \nI've tried my best to diversify my extracurricular activities, but I'm somewhat lost. My strongest academic quality is probably my writing, so I've entered a few writing competitions. I'm attempting to enter more (I've only entered 5), but I'm yet to win anything of significance. I'm confident that if I keep writing, I have the chops to win something, but I'm still 0/5 or so, which is psyching me out as I continue to pursue it. I've always been good at academic math, so I figured I'd be good at math competitions, but it turns out I'm pretty unexceptional in that. I'm sure I'd be better if I tried, and I do intend to study it enough to improve as I very much enjoy math, but I doubt that I'll become good enough for it to matter.  \n\n    \n    In terms of clubs, I'm in the chess club. I'm reasonably decent (1900 FIDE, if you know what that means), but nothing special. I'm currently starting a health and wellness club, as through running I've really come to enjoy fitness and think it would be useful to have a place at my school for kids who don't play sports to engage in and discuss fitness and healthy eating. I'm not really doing this for college, but it would be nice if this could help. \n    \n    Apologies for the ramblings, here are my questions. Essentially, I'm feeling that while my grades, standardized test scores, and essay writing abiliteis are good enough for any school, my extracurriculars clearly aren't\n    \n    - Should I be joining more clubs to \"pad my resume\"? I play sports year round and can't attend them regularly, so I can't really regularly attend any. \n    - What should I do regarding Spanish? Any tips on how to obtain fluency and academic proficiency faster would be much appreciated. I'm willing to put in the time required.\n    - In your opinion, should I pursue running competitively, which I'm not very talented in, hoping I can avoid injury and become good enough to be impressive. Or should I play the sport I'm talented in, squash, which I don't really like and dedicate myself to that to get into college. Or should I balance both?\n    - What opportunities are there that I might not know about regarding writing competitions? \n    \n    I would really appreciate answers to any of these questions, or any other help or advice you can offer. Thanks so much!",

      "text": "I think you're in enough activities so you don't need to join another club unless it's a writing club or something geared to your chosen activities. You should also look into summer writing programs (Iowa), because just getting into some of those are as competitive as winning a National contest. You just have to keep trying for the writing competitions, and hopefully you'll win one. Can you also publish? There are many journals geared towards publishing young writers. \nI'm not sure what to do about Spanish, except that some colleges accept the equivalent of AP Spanish as '4 years' so you could consider self-studying for that. For the sport, as a parent, I would totally recommend that you do squash. If you're talented in it, could you make the top 100 girls in your age group? You could get recruited, and even if not, winning some competitions would be considered an accomplishment.  The issue is that you'd have to travel unless you're already in the NYC/Philly area, and your junior year you would have to handle academics as well as the competition schedule. I believe it's a lot of chasing points in the beginning, until you get up to the high levels. Running is great, but it doesn't sound like you'll be winning any time soon. \nYou do have a great start, but you now just have to commit to some activities and go with it. Good luck!",

I'll continue to try my best. The summer programs sound really interesting. In all honesty, they weren't on my radar at all. \n\nI can try to study for AP Spanish, but I'm nowhere even close to that level as of right now. I mean, I'm at something like 4/18 tenses learned, let alone conversational fluency. I I'd love to get there, but I just have no clue whether it's possible for me. \n\nFWIW, I'm not a girl, maybe the angst led you to believe I was.... but yes I could make the top 100 for my age and yes  I suspect higher. Luckily, I am in one of those metro areas. Only trouble is I don't really want to play unless I need to, though I'd be willing to if I thought it would really help. I really hate playing, and pretty much only did it because my father encouraged me to. Though I understand that it's important to do things you're good at as well as those you love, well beyond college",

That's not me saying you should do less or work less hard, just that I doubt the feelings you have are due to actually being unimpressive as a candidate.\n\n\\-I don't think more random clubs will add much, especially if you don't have a specific vision as to what to do in them.\n\n\\-The level of Spanish you have seems entirely normal for most U.S. high school students, and it's really hard to improve fluency without an immersion-style program or class. You could try full-time self-studying if you really want, or taking an AP test or the test for the state seal of bi-literacy. You could also try studying abroad in a language immersion program like ciee or Dream Volunteers or maybe a program in something else you're interested in (I picked up some Italian as part of a classical music study abroad trip), but keep in mind that \"studying abroad\" is actually an extremely common extracurricular and learning more Spanish will almost certainly be entirely for your own benefit rather than something to impress colleges.\n\n\\-I don't have advice on the sports given that I didn't pursue them, but 50th in the state sounds pretty impressive. Sticking with what you know how to do well seems safer than picking something up entirely new.\n\n\\-With writing-based awards or publication opportunities, quantity is as important as quality.
