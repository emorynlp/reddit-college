              "text": "Well if you're really worried about that, there's a few things you can do. Wear headphones whenever you listen to videos or music (I'd recommend senheiser), if you need to stay up later than your roommate goes to sleep, do it outside in the common room, don't try overly hard to make friends with them, let everything happen naturally. If you've done all that, then you really don't have to worry about yourself being the bad roommate, because at that point the shoe is on the other foot and it's their responsibility to be a better roommate. The best course of action frankly is to room with someone that's not your best friend, but you know pretty well. Preferably someone with similar tastes in entertainment media, so that you can both listen to the same music, shows, hang up posters etc.\n\nAlso, don't worry about becoming friends with your first roommate, sure its great if you do, but most likely you will be two completely different people, so just try to make the best of it, and don't worry about them too much. Do instead, try to find a good set of friends that you can rent a suite (if you have that option) or an apartment with in your later years at college.\n\nAlso buy a longboard. They really go a long ways to help.",

Then you can't get gullwing sidewinders and really learn to carve through crowds.\n\nIn all reality, it's mainly just a way to get to and from class faster, and it's really fun too.
