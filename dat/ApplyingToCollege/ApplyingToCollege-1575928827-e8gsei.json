I go to UC Davis and we're like number one in the world for Animal science and number one in the country for agriculture (Cornell is our academic competitor at these), so it can depend on the degree. Computer Science is a tough degree to get in. Also if you're a community college transfer you can greatly increase your chances. We have a thing called TAG (transfer admission guaranteed) for CC transfers. I myself did horrible in HS but very well in CC and got accepted even without filing for the TAG.",
