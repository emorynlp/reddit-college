      "text": "Hi localramenconsumer:\n\nYes, it is okay to put down athletic awards under the honors / awards section in common app. It is noted from the common app that sport awards are technically considered academic awards (along with other ones like music, stem, etc.). The only type of awards not academic are usually volunteer or leadership awards.\n\nHope this helps!",

You can simply google regarding this topic and see that many are in consensus with what I have stated (and I have been helping students with college apps for around a decade at this point). Most recently, I have a student recruited for athletics at Yale (received a likely letter) and a few of his slots were filled with athletic awards.",
