Did you ask for it or did he take it upon himself to reach out and offer it? How did it change your life (or at least your experience of calculus)? Put yourself in the reader's shoes--what makes you want more info out of this tale?",

      "text": "Here\u2019s my copy pasta about the personal essay: \n\nHere\u2019s the deal about the personal essay. It has to be just that \u2014 super, incredibly, deeply personal. The essay needs to be about inner you \u2014 the you they can\u2019t get to know anywhere else in your application. The mechanism you use to get that message across the page isn\u2019t that important. So before you try to figure out how you want to tell your story figure out what the reader needs to learn about you. What\u2019s the essence of youness that they need to understand to feel like the they\u2019ve been sitting and hanging out with you!? \n\nYour job is to build a connection between you and the reader. You do that by allowing them in to your head and showing some vulnerability. So, you have to peel off your onion layers, find your inner Shrek, dig in super deep, and get to know yourself like you\u2019ve never done before. It\u2019s not easy. Ask yourself some really personal questions like: \n\nWhat do I believe? \n\nWhat do I think?\n\nWhat do I value?\n\nWhat keeps me up at night?\n\nWhat do I get excited about?\n\nWhat comforts me?\n\nWhat worries me?\n\nWhat\u2019s important to me?\n\nWho are my super heroes?\n\nWhat\u2019s my super power?\n\nWhat\u2019s my special sauce?\n\nWhat reminds me of home?\n\nJust play with these.  And learn a lot. Become the expert on you because you are really the only person who can be the expert on you. Then, you\u2019ll be ready to teach the lesson about who you are and what you believe and value to the application readers.  The vehicle you use to get your message across really isn\u2019t as important as what you\u2019re saying about yourself. This doesn\u2019t have to be (and, in my opinion) shouldn\u2019t be a complete narrative. You want to worry more about sticking with the reader than standing out, so I think the essays need to be more reflection and analysis than story. Those are the essays that stick with me after reading a few thousand of them.  You want the reader to feel bonded with you so they\u2019ll want to go fight for you in the admissions committee. \n\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t use a story. Use one if that\u2019s what feels right for you. Just remember the story is only the vehicle for getting the message of who you are across the page. \n\nIf you\u2019d like to go into more depth, I  recently posted about the personal essay with my step by step guide and links to some of my fave resources: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ppetbb/hi_seniors_you_do_have_an_amazing_essay_inside/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",
