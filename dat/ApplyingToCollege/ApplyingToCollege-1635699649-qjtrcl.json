      "text": "As long as theyre listed and it was started, it should be ok. But don't quote me because I'm using the coalition application.... on here, I had sorta the same issue. One of my recommendations started but didn't finish. So I panicked and just sent it to make it before the deadline. And wouldn't you know my luck... she finished it that night(I was just ever so POed lol). But because I added it, and it just wasn't finished.  It still added it after the fact when she did. On the coalition app, you can add recommendations after you click send but you can't remove them. I think its because  they probably just send the schools a \"ticket\" with generic info about you, then the schools use that to eventually pull your full application from the website....\n\nYet again  don't quote me lol",
