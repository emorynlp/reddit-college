  "text": "this weekend i toured wash u and vanderbilt and i reallyyyyy liked both, and i\u2019m pretty sure i wanna apply ed2 to one of them if i don\u2019t get into my first choice. my only problem is that tours, especially during covid, aren\u2019t the most informative and i feel like i don\u2019t have enough info to make a decision. i feel like i had a better feeling at vanderbilt, but i\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because the weather was much better for that tour (made it more enjoyable) and that i actually knew someone who was able to show me around when i had none of that at wash u. i want to major in bio on the premed track, and i have heard that wash u is amazing for this and that the ppl there are super nice and down-to-earth, which is something important to me since i am not very outgoing and want to be able to make friends easily wherever i end up. also, i am aware that it\u2019s not the best idea to ed if you aren\u2019t 100% sure, but i loved both schools and would be happy to attend either one. i also think that ed would be the only way for me to get in, since i consider myself generally qualified, but i\u2019m nothing special compared to some of the other ppl i\u2019ve seen on here. if anyone has any advice or any personal experiences at either of these schools that might help make my decision easier please help me out",

Spend that time talking to current students and doing research about both schools, and I'm sure you'll have a clear favorite by January 15th.
