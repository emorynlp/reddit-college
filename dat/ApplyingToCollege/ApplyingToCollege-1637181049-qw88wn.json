  "text": "There is something that's been bothering me. So I have pretty decent extracurriculars, grades, essays, etc but I have seen applications better than mine, and like I keep on regretting as to why I didn't like try to develop my extracurriculars more, but the thing is that I couldn't develop it because my mental state was really bad last year and like this year and I couldn't focus on anything. \n\nU Penn has been my dream school from the start and if I don't get in ill try to make my application better and try to transfer, but again I feel like transferring will ruin my college experience, and ugh it's just soo hard. I seriously don't know what to do at this point.",
