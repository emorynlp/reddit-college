How should I go about telling the colleges about my current situation if they've accept me? Should I even tell them? Should I wait until they reach out after getting my final school report asking about the suspension? IDK how I should go about this. I need help\ud83d\ude1f",

You\u2019re so close to college decisions and something so recent like a ten day suspension might play a role in the admissions process, even if you explain your side of the story very well. \n\nIf truly, you just found it and gave it to the principal, you shouldn\u2019t be suspended. Let alone 10 DAYS. It\u2019s not only unjust, but also flat out wrong. Especially if you didn\u2019t show it to any students on campus and went straight to the principal.",
