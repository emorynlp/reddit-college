  "text": "For some context, I\u2019m a high school freshman who wishes to one day attend top colleges. As I am somewhat active on this subreddit, I am aware of the enormous importance of the college essay when it comes to acceptance into these top institutions. What resources can I use to practice writing and honing my skills? Thanks in advance.",

      "text": "Read a lot, both fiction and nonfiction. Nonfiction for helping you become more clear and succinct while presenting information in an engaging way, and fiction for developing a prose style and familiarizing yourself with the ways emotions and lessons and such can be implied through words. \n\nThen practice your own writing. Write poetry, journal entries, etc. Just something other than the high school English class 5 paragraph essay, because those are useless. Ideally try to write more personal things and dig into who you are as an individual. Keep those ideas and writings in an organized place somewhere so you can come back to them senior year.",

I\u2019ve (sadly) greatly reduced how much I read from my middle school days (used to frequently read novels, now it\u2019s been over a year since I read a non-mandatory novel, and I currently exclusively read news articles and manga). I\u2019m definitely going to change that, though.\n\nI\u2019ll try to write a journal entry each day.",

              "text": "I also read much less in my last three years of high school than I did throughout middle school and freshman year (I didn\u2019t even know what the SAT was in freshman year, it was pretty chill). But even just reading the assigned novels in English class while other people use sparknotes helps, imo. News articles are good. I\u2019d also recommend reading famous pieces of personal writings, such as autobiographies, letters, etc. I recently read MLK\u2019s Letter from Birmingham Jail and thought it was a fantastic piece of writing (although its purpose is quite different from a college essay). Even just doing a bit of that stuff consistently will get you far ahead of many others, both during the app process and at college.",
