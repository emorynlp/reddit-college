  "text": "Might be a unpopular opinion, but whatever.\n\nI just came up with this thought the other day, thinking I can probably share with you.\n\nWhen a college rejects you, it's not mainly because you're bad, your ECs sucks, or your GPA sucks. It's more of thinking you're not prepared enough to handle the courses, the stress, or the overall surroundings of the college.\n\nIn another words, the AOs are potentially helping you. \n\nI watched a TEDx last month, the presenter is a genius asian kid who got straight As in high school and hell lot of brilliant leadership experience and competitions. He got admitted to Harvard, but the entire speech isn't about how nice the school is. Instead, he mainly talked about how frustrated he was in the environment, due to academic performance, and peer pressure.\n\nThere, the AOs are preventing you from getting into this kind of situation.\n\nThe situation that you got into your dream school, but you're so stressed out and get so frustrated that you have to stop the school or other results.\n\nJust my humble opinion, for those who are receiving the results in recent time.\n\n(Discussion and opposite opinions are welcomed)",

      "text": "My quibble with this outlook is the assumption that rejection means you were not sufficiently prepared for the school. Very often that is NOT the case. Top schools have something like 5x more the number of qualified applicants than they can accept.\n\nWhere I agree with you is that, ultimately, some students will find their best success in an environment that is less intense, whether academically, socially, etc. This is the silver lining of being rejected from reaches. Some college freshmen begin to realize this as they return home for the holidays and get together with old high school friends who attend colleges at a variety of selectivity levels.",

          "text": "All of this.  Except it's closer to 10-15x.  Yale estimates 75% of applicants are qualified to succeed there, but they admit ~5%.\n\nPeople mostly aren't getting rejected because they aren't good enough.  They're getting rejected because there are only a few hundred spots and tens of thousands of applicants.\n\nMy wholesome take on this question is 1) you can only go to one college anyway, so most of your acceptances are going to be irrelevant - rejections just simplify the decision.  And 2) where you go to college just doesn't matter that much.  It matters WAY more what you do there, what skills you cultivate, what kind of network you build, etc.",

When you are qualified to handle everything the college throws at you, including but not limited to courses, college life and the mental pressure, you still get rejected because colleges can't provide you with aid. This is the story of lots of internationals who would have thrived equally well, if not more, in the atmosphere of the college like other domestic applicants.",

So they are willing to take the risk and \"invest\" on intls.\n\nWe don't really have much space to argue.",

If you do your best and someone doesn't want you (whether it be a university or an employer) then that's probably not somewhere you wanted to work anyway.  And this isn't just sour grapes.\n\nWhere it breaks down is when you feel your performance doesn't correctly communicate your ability.  For instance, if I make some foolish misstep in a job interview and don't get a job.  In that situation it might be reasonable for me to conclude that I could have been successful in that role, had it been offered to me, but my dumb mistake took that off the table.",

And for people interested in getting a PhD or going to med school, reflection is going to be an important step as well.
