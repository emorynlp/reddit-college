  "text": "So, our counselor uses a template which lists what we all did, so I told him that writing a letter like that was not colleges are looking for and he told that I could get another reference from another staff of school, which he will be using instead of his letter as the \u201ccounselor recommendation.\u201d \n\nThe thing is, the counselor will say \u201coh this is not my reference its person X\u2019s\u201d\n\nDo you guys think I should settle for the counselor letter or get a good letter from staff of school?",
