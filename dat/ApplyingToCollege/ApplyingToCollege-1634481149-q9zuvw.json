  "text": "Hi guys! I am currently conflicted between doing Brown ED or Yale EA. I love Brown's open curriculum but also like that Yale is strong with humanities. I plan on doing something along the lines of public health but at the same time I feel like I have no clue because I went to a underfunded high school where we didn't get to explore a lot--so in college I want to be able to explore as much as I can before picking a major. I really enjoy learning about the humanities and I think I might do double major or minor in something along its lines. I really love Brown (been obsessed with it since Sophomore year) But I don't know if I am ready to do ED because I kinda want to apply to other schools doing regular and see where things go.  I also haven't toured either school (COVID) but Brown seems kinda dry from the online posts where as Yale seems more up beat.\n\nAlso, I was never attracted to Yale because I always thought Yale students were cut throat but I started watching videos from current students and everyone says that its very collaborative (thoughts?) \n\nOh also for context, I want to go to a school that lets me explore majors (lets me make my own), has a collaborative environment, has presence of (non toxic) south asians and has diversity, somewhat presence of school spirit, large on job placement after college, and somewhere I wouldn't be too depressed. I know these are both IVYs so... depression and impostor syndrome, but idk. I just want to give my shot you know. I don't think I am going to get into either from the looks but just wanted advice for early so I can shoot by shot. \n\nAlso sorry about the longg post.",

      "text": "hey!! My best advice is to choose the school that seems to fit you the best personally/that you really love, regardless of prestige. Yale and Brown are at about the same level academically so you would still get a killer education at either regardless of their humanities departments; I would take that off the table. My best advice is to contact current students (discord servers or reddit works well) and ask them questions to get a feel for the student body and environment. It sounds to me like you are really leaning towards Brown over Yale but have some doubts. Based off the tone of this post alone I would say choose Brown because you like it better BUT do an extensive amount of research on both, try to tour if possible or virtually tour, and make sure you like it better than all your other schools before you decide to ED. ED might give you a bit of a boost and you get a response sooner but you should really know what you want.\n\nI was stuck between Yale REA and Tufts ED around this same time last year, although I did tour both. Yale was wonderful but I liked Tufts a bit better: the environment, the campus, the student body, the location, the overall vibes. Everyone was so passionate and smart and kind and genuinely some of the most interesting people I've ever met. The thing that really decided for me was watching drone footage of both campuses and realizing that Tufts looked like home to me while Yale looked like a museum. Also, I kind of felt that if I didn't ED I'd regret it forever. I got in and am very happy now, but I was also pretty happy with my decision to ED there. Talking to the awesome people who also got in through ED1 was a great experience for me and reaffirmed my decision. My twin EDed to a school that she never saw, but researched it EXTENSIVELY. Multiple Zooms, multiple virtual campus tours, talked to a lot of students. She's happy with her decision as well but if you can't tour I would really recommend doing the level of research that she did.\n\nAlso-shameless plug-have you considered Tufts? I'm not trying to detract from the schools you're looking at right now, but it could be a good RD or ED2 school for you if you like it. We have an absolutely fantastic undergrad public health program (our Community Health major) which I am currently on track for; I'm also planning on doing an Anthropology double major and I know a lot of people double major in the humanities. My CH professor told me our CH majors are consistently some of the best prepared in the field and we get her master's level understanding of the topic. We have a lot of liberal-arts-style distribution requirements but there's room to choose. Also, we have the Ex-College, where students can design and teach their own classes on any topic they want. Tufts is actually very collaborative and while we have a reputation for being more dry with the party scene, we're right next to Boston and a lot of people go to nearby schools to party. It's definitely a better city than New Haven or Providence. Our stereotype is actually Brown rejects and that's kind of true for ED2 admits (I would recommend applying ED2 over RD if you like it though). I can't speak too much on the diversity statistics but I recommend looking them up or talking to current South Asian students. Job placement is great (we have name value but less than the Ivies so people project on you less) and while classes are rigorous they're not too bad. I think school spirit depends more on your individual perception of the school; however, the people here are awesome imo and there's definitely some to be found because people generally love it. Sorry for all of this I thought it just might help a bit with building your list?  \nBest of luck and feel free to DM me with any questions!",

Everyone I have met is so bubbly and def quirky. It feels like a safe environment to be around so def considering (literally my 3rd on the list LOL)",

      "text": "Hey! As someone who lives in New Haven and is applying ED to Brown, I think I have some insight on this. Both are top tier schools, in terms of education youre not really sacrificing one over the other. The reason I chose brown is because of the environment; I toured and it has such a relaxed and welcoming aura to it that I did not feel at Harvard or Columbia when I visited. However, I do know that Yale is a slightly more laid back than those two schools, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll feel a welcoming vibe, just not to the extent of brown. I was so concerned about prestige until one day it just hit me that nobody cares. It\u2019s your life, you need to choose where you\u2019re gonna fit best because nobody\u2019s gonna look back and think \u2018wow, remember ___ that went to Yale!\u2019 It\u2019s all for your own journey. I would say brown sounds like it fits your criteria a lot more (can make your own major, very collaborative, not toxic), but you\u2019re attracted to Yale because, well, it\u2019s Yale. Both are great schools and are impressive nonetheless, just make sure you make the choice for the right reasons .",
