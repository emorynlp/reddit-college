  "text": "1. for unc chapel hill\u2019s 25 word essays, i had the idea of going with haikus. would this be too much of a risk?\n\n2. i\u2019m applying to columbia as a hard reach. would it be too risky for me to acknowledge this in my essay and focus it on how i want to dream big, even if my chances aren\u2019t the best?",
