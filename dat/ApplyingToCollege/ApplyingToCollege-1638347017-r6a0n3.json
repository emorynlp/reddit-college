  "text": "For reference, I solely applied to Harvard because I expected to get in.\n\n**Demographics**\n\n* White Male, CN\n* Hooks: Harvard Legacy, Feeder School\n\n**Intended Major:** Politics and Economics\n\n**Academics**\n\n* Class Rank: 65/110\n* GPA: 1.30/4.0 (school doesn't do weighted)\n* SAT: 540 Verbal, 670 Math\n* Senior Year Courses: English, Physics, French II, English History\n\n**Activities**\n\n* School Football Team\n* School Sailing Team\n\n**Awards**\n\n* Voted \"Most Likely to Succeed\" in school yearbook\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nOverall a 2/10, some pretty mean comments.\n\n**Essays**\n\n*Why Harvard*: The reasons that I have for wishing to go to Harvard are several. I feel that Harvard can give me a better background and a better liberal education than any other university. I have always wanted to go there, as I have felt that it is not just another college, but is a university with something definite to offer. Then too, I would like to go to the same college as my father. To be a \"Harvard man\" is an enviable distinction, and one that I sincerely hope I shall attain.\n\n**Results**\n\n* Harvard: Accepted",
