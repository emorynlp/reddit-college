  "text": "Over the past few months, I\u2019ve built up a pretty good relationship with my admissions counselor at my top pick college. I did so through emails, being at my school\u2019s visit and introducing myself in person, and having an interview with him. Recently, I was lucky enough to have a very prominent alumni come into my life through my job, and he offered to send some words of recommendation to the college since he has some pull due to him sitting on the board. I was so thrilled to hear this and couldn\u2019t thank him enough since he\u2019s a great person and in my intended field! He wrote a really kind email asking for it to be sent to my officer and stating that I\u2019m a great student and an extraordinary member of the community - a great fit for the school according to the email. He cc\u2019d me on the exchange and the school wrote back to him saying that they would pass it on to my counselor. I\u2019m a little worried that they may have forgotten or that my counselor may have gotten it and I was wondering if I should email to see, or just let it be. I\u2019ve heard that letters from board members can be the tie breaker on applications and I need all the pull I can get.",
