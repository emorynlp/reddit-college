COVID has really put a lot of uncertainty in this whole process.  Are internationals able to travel, get visas, health concerns, are colleges going to be in-person.  International are not able to come/get visas to the US if their classes are online.  Visas are only given for emergencies right now.  Visas for students are not being processed.  There are still travel bans.  The world's economy is in trouble with the pandemic.  Tuition in the US is increasing.  It is more expensive to come to the US than it is to come to Canada/UK.",
