  "text": "Basically, In my essays and app I've mentioned my passion for structural engineering and how I hope to construct resilient infrastructure systems. I wanted to upload a photo I took some years ago, it was of this very weird looking building I visited that had a very complex, abstract-looking structure, which looked really amazing and impressive, and the photo itself looks pretty cool. Do you think a photo like this one is good enough for the prompt, and do you think it may (hopefully) show my interests?",
