  "text": "the mit supplement asks for a rec from a research advisor or mentor for the research porfolio. this is very complicated so brace yourselves to follow along: i did my own independent research with a mentor who works for a program, and then i presented this research to the director of the program with my mentor, and then i worked on projects with the director/a new team of ppl from the program (no longer with my mentor). the new projects we worked on were heavily based on the research i conducted, but the director/new ppl didn't actually supervise me as i did my initial research. i talked to my mentor and they suggested to me it would be a good idea to get a research supervisor rec letter from the director, who can vouch for my other projects/research/my personality/etc even tho he didn't supervise me directly for the independent research im submitting. he did, however, supervise me for another research project, but that project doesn't have an abstract or a poster, though it was in a way derived from my initial research with my other mentor. idk what to do: should i get a rec from the director of a program who didn't supervise me for the research im submitting but can still vouch for it and knows me better or get a rec from the original mentor who thinks the former would be best for me. my mentor and i but thought it would be cooler to have a rec from the director, but idk if that will be questionable/annoy mit since ik that the people looking at the supplements are profs volunteering their time cuz that the last thing i'd wanna do.",
