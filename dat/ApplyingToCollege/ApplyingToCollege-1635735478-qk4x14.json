  "title:": "Not Applying ED Anymore",
  "text": "I was planning to apply ED to the University of Pennsylvania, but has changed my mind because my essays are simply not ready yet.\n\nI'm scared because the Admission Officers may think I don't want to go there anywhere if (?) they see that I was going to ED but didn't. Also, I've already told them before that I was going to be an ED applicant (I had problems with my papers so I had to contact them), will they even remember that? It seems crazy to me because they get hundreds of emails a day.\n\nI know it would be worse to be rejected because of half-baked essays, but how would my chances drop after I go into the regular pool? I'm also an international student who's applying to the Huntsman Dual-Degree Program, so I really have no background in how Admission Officers think.",
