  "text": "Should I worry? I mailed them before registering for the interview to ask if RD students can also take the Nov interviews, and they said it's for every student applying for fall 2022. And, I just realized yesterday that I HAVEN'T EVEN APPLIED TO THE COLLEGE YET. I wasn't planning to apply now, and I am not even ready to apply now. I don't know if it would make sense to join the interview without having any of your details sent to the interviewer.\n\nSo, does it work that way? Like. Without applying, just joining the interview? Where will they keep my records then? Should I mail them and talk about it?",
