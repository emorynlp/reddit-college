  "text": "I just need everyone\u2019s opinion, my personal statement is about how My family owns a restaurant business and because it\u2019s our only source of income I\u2019m forced to work there and I resent it. I decide to tell them that I don\u2019t want to work there anymore but then I hear their argument saying how we\u2019re in serious financial trouble. This really made me realize how selfish I was and boosted my efforts in school specifically comp sci because during one of the lessons in class we learned about machine learning and therefore I had the aspiration to develop a machine that can essentially function in the kitchen. \n\nThis is the general topic of my essay, and yes my intended major in college is computer science. Do you guys think this is cliche?",

      "text": "I don't think it's cliche, but I do think you should rethink how you are presenting the story. Focusing on resentment and your perception of being selfish are not positive attributes that you want people to judge you on. The CS element feels like it is trying too hard to fit into a story that is about you and your family. \n\nI would focus there instead. Ask yourself about how your family's lives and circumstances have impacted you and what you would like to do in college. Something to keep in mind is that CS is what you may study in college, it isn't what you will do there or what you will do with your life.",
