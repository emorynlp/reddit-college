  "text": "Hi, I love CS so I primarily only do CS ec's. There are kids around me that are doing cool things like on the City level (city council, some award, etc). I'm not really interested in that kind of stuff, I mostly like programming stuff. Is that bad, do I need extra ec's to be well rounded as well?",
