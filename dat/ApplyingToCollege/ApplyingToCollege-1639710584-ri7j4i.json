  "text": "All my cousins and friends are getting into ivies and their top-choices. When I got my Stanford rejection, I heard my cousin on the phone with mom, telling her that she got into Penn law.\nIt feels like all of my work over the years was invalidated. I\u2019m so disappointed in myself. Do I bother applying to the rest of my schools or just settle for UMD. If I go to UMD, I be stuck with the fact that I could\u2019ve done so much less and be in the same position. I think I might just be majorly burned out, but it still hurts to know that I can\u2019t seem to do anything right. I have no motivation rn\ud83d\uddff\ud83d\uddff. Maybe I\u2019m just being a baby, my rejection depression is still lasting a day after the decision. I don\u2019t wanna keep thinking about college for the next couple months. I wanna live my last year at high school without stress. Is this too much to ask?",

      "text": "hmm I'd take at least tomorrow off and not look at any college-related things (as much as you can), maybe the whole weekend if you can spare it. Spend some time doing things you like, or hang out with friends. I think you might need a reset after that tough rejection. You sound burned out to me, which happens! But it means you should take a bit of a break.\n\nAnd then when you come back, ask yourself again if you want to keep applying or if you're satisfied with UMD",
