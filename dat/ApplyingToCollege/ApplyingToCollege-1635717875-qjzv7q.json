  "text": "Hi everyone, my brother is applying EA to UMD (in-state.) At the last minute, he decided to submit his scores for UMD. He submitted his application saying this and requested to send his scores regularly (not rush) to UMD on Thursday but they still say pending (not sent.) We didn\u2019t realize that UMD required the official test scores to be electronically submitted by the deadline and that self-reporting was not sufficient. Now I\u2019m worried that they won\u2019t arrive on time, but since he submitted his application saying that he wanted them to consider his scores, it will be marked as incomplete and not reviewed. Does anyone know \n\n1. Is there any way to switch to test blind after submitting the application?\n\n2. If his scores arrive late, will they still consider him in this application deadline or will he be pushed to RD? If that\u2019s the case, it would be better to be test blind.\n\nAny other help would be useful. Thanks!",
