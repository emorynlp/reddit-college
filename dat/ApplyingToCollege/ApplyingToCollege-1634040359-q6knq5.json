  "text": "Hello! I'm very much interested in applying to T20s. I've been told that applying for EA would be beneficial to me as an international student, but my SAT was cancelled and I only get to write it on December 2021. Submitting my SAT would really benefit me in terms of admissions. So, I would like to know if I should apply for EA without SAT or wait till RD.\nMy GPA according to the USA : 4.0\nMy 100 point scale : low to mid 90s",
