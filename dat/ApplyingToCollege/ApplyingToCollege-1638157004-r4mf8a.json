  "title:": "Is it worth rushing applications for merit scholarship deadlines?",
  "text": "The merit scholarship deadlines for two of my top choices, USC and Vanderbilt, are coming up on December 1. \n\nMy family doesn\u2019t make a lot of money and I think I can get a decent amount of need-based aid, but I know these two schools have really good merit scholarships, although the full-ride ones are certainly highly competitive. I have the essays done, but they\u2019re not as good as I think they can be if I take a few more weeks to edit them. \n\nI want to make sure that I don\u2019t burden my family, but I don\u2019t want to ruin my chances of *being accepted* in the first place. Any recommendations for my next steps?",

      "text": "It's better to have a chance than none at all. Polish the essays as much as you can, and then send it in.\n\nAlso, I think scholarships and admission are judged/reviewed separately, ie, you have to get accepted first in order to be considered for the scholarship (since it doesn't make sense for a college to waste effort into judging a scholarship essay that won't be accepted anyway) \u2014 but this is mostly speculation on my part.",

The scholarship application is submitted at the same time as the actual application, but it makes sense for them to only consider the ones that would get accepted. \n\nI think I\u2019m just going to take a few weeks to submit the apps because these are two of my top schools.",
