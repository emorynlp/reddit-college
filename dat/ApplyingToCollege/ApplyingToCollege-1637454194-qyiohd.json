  "text": "hi! i just honestly feel like making this post to help me make the decision. when i was a freshman, it was my dream to get into harvard. i wanted to apply to all of the ivies and ultimately attend one. these days, i just couldn\u2019t care less. i don\u2019t care much about prestige anymore and care more about fit. i think the environment would be so competitive that i would not enjoy it at all. i dont like cities and i don\u2019t want to go north for college (im from virginia). ive already gotten into three safeties and im applying to quite a few already, and my dream school is william & mary. close to home and everything i want. i mean, i always felt that applying to the ivies was a once in a lifetime thing and something i really wanted to do, but now i just don\u2019t care so much and don\u2019t want to make my mom pay an application fee for a school i ultimately will not attend. and grad school is a thing. thoughts?\n\nedit: was going to apply to harvard, brown, and dartmouth",

I recommend you work hard on all the other college applications first (but it sounds like you may already have completed them all) and get those sent out \u2026 and then re-evaluate and see if you feel like you should add an Ivy or two.  Maybe the answer will come to you naturally after you have spent a great deal of time perfecting all of the other applications. Just don\u2019t get bogged down first on the 5-8 essays most Ivies require and then quickly patch together a bad job on other applications at colleges where applicants have a better chance at admission.  Get those in the bag first.\n\nI don\u2019t know what your financial situation is, but have you thought about applying to William and Mary Early Decision II? The class of 2025 submitted a total 1184 ED I and II applications and 545 are attending, which is an acceptance rate of 46%.  It would be a travesty if W&M ED II was an option for you and you didn\u2019t do it because you were holding a candle for an RD Harvard application, and ended up not getting into your true \u201cdream school\u201d, William and Mary.  \n\nI love William and Mary\u2019s history \u2026 it is ancient by US standards!

      "text": "I seem to have a different opinion from most others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI go to Columbia now, but I transferred from a medium-sized college in the south. I originally applied to mostly smaller-sized colleges in the South, similarly to you, but quickly realized I wanted something different. So I can tell you this: applying to Ivy League isn't a once in a life time opportunity and dreams/goals do change. If you end up at William & Mary, and you like it, great! But if you don't, you can always choose to transfer and apply to the Ivies or wherever else, albeit a bit harder to get in and adjust to transferring credits, retaking classes, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would say apply for the Ivies, but don't bend backwards trying to get in just so you are not shutting the doors. Like, you don't need to stress for three months over what words you write down, but you can just spend a day or two transforming your W&M essays that you worked very hard on (hopefully!) into something that feels personal for Harvard, Brown, and Dartmouth. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbout the application fee, you can probably request a fee waiver to Harvard, Brown, and Dartmouth.",
