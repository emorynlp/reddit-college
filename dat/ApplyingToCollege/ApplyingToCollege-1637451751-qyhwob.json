  "title:": "Need help finding the right college for me. I want to be a software developer/ computer programmer.",
  "text": "So right now I am currently a junior in high school, and graduating in 2023, and I want to be a software developer or computer programmer, but I'm not sure what I should major in, or what college I should go to.  Now I haven't really taken any honors or ap classes for my core classes like math and such, so I don't have any college credits or anything like that. And my GPA isn't anything that would get me scholarships or stuff like that(about a 3.3 last time I checked).  I've taken ap Computer Science Principles, and ap java, and next year they're adding a python class next year that I signed up for, and I am/ been a part of some computer clubs. I  live in Arizona and would like to stay in-state when going to college. I was also thinking of going to community college for 2 years and then going to a real college to get my bachelor's, but I'm not sure which college I should go to and what I should major in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Skip this long-ass paragraph if you want, I have everything summarized at the bottom.**\n\nI talked to my java teacher, and she recommended Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, which is has a software engineering course available on their Arizona campus, but it seems pretty expensive with a 37k tuition.  I also talked to my counselor, and he recommended ASU and GCU, and I've had other people also recommend GCU.\n\nASU offers software engineering courses and computer science courses, and also has the cheapest tuition out of the 3 colleges. \n\nGCU offers a software development course, a software development course, and 3 computer science courses that emphasize in big data analytics, business entrepreneurship, and in game and simulation development with each semester costing $8,250.  Right now I'm leaning more towards GCU, because it looks like a nicer campus, and people have told me that its computer programs are better than ASU.\n\nI'm planning on going to Chandler-Gilbert Community College to get my prereqs done for cheap, and then apply to either ASU, GCU, or ERAU. I also saw that they have a computer science course for $25 that I might take, but should I go to community college for 2 years, and then go to to another college for my bachelors, or would it be better to just go to a college for 4 years and get my bachelors that way?\n\nI was also thinking about maybe going to a college prep place called EVIT, because my school lets us go for free while we're still enrolled in high school, and EVIT offers a coding & mobile app design course that gives a \"Certified Internet Web Profession (CIW) JavaScript Specialist\" and  a \"Microsoft Technology Associate (MTA) Certification\"  which might be beneficial to add to my resume, but to take the full course, I would have to stay in high school an extra year, which IDK if it would really be worth it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo basically, I want to know what college I should go to, and which degree I should major in, and if I should go to community college for 2 years, and if I should stay an extra year in high school to go to EVIT.  And are there better options than what I listed for colleges? The cheapest would be the best, but I also want the best education and degree.",

      "text": "ASU would easily be the best option compared to the other two universities, and luckily it also is the cheapest one for you - they have a very strong engineering school, and place a lot of students in the Silicon Valley area and the rest of California.\n\nAs for Community College, that could be a great pathway if it saves you a lot of money in the long run - ASU would still accept you at the end of two years, and you can work with your CC Academic Advisor to figure out which courses to take so that all or most of them get transferred to college for credit.",

Possible Software Engineering if the school offers it.\n\nGo to ASU, or consider community college to get better bang for your buck.",
