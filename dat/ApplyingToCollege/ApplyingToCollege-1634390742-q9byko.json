      "text": "If you are applying to a test-optional school, the rule of thumb would be to not report a score below a certain threshold. Different people have different opinions on where that threshold is. My general opinion would be to not report a score if it's below the college's published 25th percentile. Others say 50th. Colleges publish admission data on their websites in the class profile or the Common Data Set, and at [https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/](https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/).\n\nKeep in mind that acceptance rates for internationals at top US schools tend to be around half the overall rate.",
