  "text": "Im a sophomore in high school I know it\u2019s  a little early for me to be thinking about college but I can\u2019t help but think about what I want to do apart from the fact I want to go to college, I don\u2019t know what major I want I\u2019m really interested in computers and stuff but I did some research and to work with computer or become some type of engineer you basically need to be a god in math and i suck at that I dont know what I want to be bro like I wanna do something computer or engineering related but I feel like that too much work and that it\u2019s hard but maybe I\u2019m just tripping. So anyone got suggestions for a good college path also I\u2019ve taken like a million of those college career tests and their all dumb",

      "text": "You've got a lot of time, take a deep breath. :) You're just a sophomore in high school.\n\nAnd at many colleges, you don't even declare a major until your 2nd year; many people don't decide their major until they're finishing up their sophomore year in college.\n\nIt sounds like you like computers but don't like math. It's impossible to avoid math in CS, but maybe look into Cybersecurity?\n\nBest of luck.",

      "text": "Maybe info systems? You'll see it called MIS at some schools - it leads more into IT kinds of jobs - system administrator, network admin, database admin, head of IT, etc.   Usually in the college of business. \n\nYou still need some math - intro stats and a semester of Calculus is pretty typical - but it's not nearly as math heavy as engineering.",

      "text": "You don\u2019t need to be a god at math. You do need to be able to do math tho. But a lot of the math you will be taking in college is not what you will be taking now. College will prepare you for being an engineer. So get better at math if you are struggling talk to your teacher they can probably help. \n\nEngineering is an amazing college path, so I would recommend pursuing it. Unlike humanities engineering is a path where the school doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nTry taking a physics class when you can at your high school.",
