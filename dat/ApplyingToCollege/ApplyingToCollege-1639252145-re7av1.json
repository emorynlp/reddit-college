  "title:": "Can \"my current campus is unsafe\" be a possible reason for transferring?",
  "text": "Hi. So I'm thinking of reasons for transferring schools, and I have some solid ones now, such as 1. I want a more rigorous compsci program than what I have now, 2. the culture/student environment now is just not right for me (I currently go to a commuter school), and 3. I want to expose myself to more \"well-known\" professors that work in a field that I'm interested in. (Please let me know if these are reasons that I should change up or anything).\n\nI have a 4th reason that's admittedly one of the main reasons why I want to move, and that is because the area it's in is unsafe. Since it's in a city + near a crime-ridden neighborhood, there's shootings/muggings less than a mile away from me at all times, and it's just not safe to go out at night. There also have been 2 major murders that happened very close to where I am (I think you could already pinpoint where I am on the map lol...), and it just makes me feel so much unease. I feel like I'm missing out so much because I'm worried something will happen to me even if I do take proper safety precautions, so I just don't go out. Along with it being a commuter school, that's just more of a reason to not go out because there's NOTHING going on. I'm just... kind of jealous of my friends who currently go to a school with a nice campus and can walk around with no worries + there's always something going on which makes it more fun \n\nAnyway, I'm worried that this will make me seem unreasonable or whiny if I'm like \"wahhh I want to go to a school with a safe campus :(\" .... i don't know. What do you guys think, should I add this in my transfer essay? Of course, I'll figure out a way to present myself as nicely as possible, but I just don't know if this is something to include in general, even though it's one of my main reasons for wanting to leave.",

      "text": "It's a perfectly valid reason to transfer but I don't know if the safety aspect is necessarily one to include in the essay, as you should sound more proactive than reactive. You could say that the community around the school you are applying to is a better fit, and name specific things you like about that community and how you may get involved. \n\nYou could then make a comparison between that and your existing school's community, but I would avoid making it sound like you're trying to put down your old school, as it won't come off well even if your reasons for doing so are valid.",

          "text": "I disagree, I think reasons 1 and 2 are far and away the most salient.  The safety issue seems more like an afterthought, and it certainly doesn\u2019t strike me as unique.\n\nEdit: put another way\u2014the issue of safety doesn\u2019t suggest new schools, it suggests new *locations*.  Using the issue of safety makes OP\u2019s choice in college incidental, as in: I\u2019m choosing your school because of its location, not because of the school itself.",

One of my main reasons for wanting to leave was that small towns are boring too, but it doesn't read as compelling I think.\n\nInstead, I might emphasize that the urban experience has (insert undesirable factors more related to college life, like: less of a unified culture, harder to get to know professors/students directly, oversaturation of certain roles) and that an experience at (fill in the following town) will serve your academic and personal goals better. In particular, saying that you've tried to do (xyz) to branch out at your current school already, but it'd be much more effective at (schools you're targeting.)",
