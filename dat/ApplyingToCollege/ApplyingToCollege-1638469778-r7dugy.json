Plenty of state schools also offer full rides to OOS students, it just depends), it's just the fact that UCs are so highly ranked and so attractive as schools that the issue is amplified by the # of OOS students interested in attending",

I do also think more students have a slightly different perspective and are only applying to UCs they're actually willing to attend vs all of them (especially because those app fees aren't cheap).  Last year people were stressed and desperate and applied to all of them because of it.",
