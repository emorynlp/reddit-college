      "text": "Babson College is a hidden gem. They've been the  #1 entrepreneurship college in the country for 23 consecutive years.Their alumni include:\n\n* Akio Toyoda (President of Toyota)\n* Arthur M. Blank (CEO of Home Depot)\n* Edsel Bryant Ford II (Director of Ford Motor)\n* William D. Green (Chairman and CEO of Accenture)\n* Jamie Siminoff (Founder of Ring)\n* Roger Enrico (former CEO of PepsiCo and DreamWorks)\n\nand several other start-ups and successful corporations.\n\nBabson recently revamped their course structure to involve more education around what makes a **sustainable** business. Beyond all elese, Babson hopes to help people with the creation of businesses, rather than hurt.\n\nBabson has been described by alumni and current students as a college that basically eliminates the stereotype of a business school. It focuses on community, rather than money and the competitve factors only serve to connect the student body, not tear it apart.\n\nI hope this post helped. As someone who literally ran a lap around my school library when I got in on Friday, I hope you choose Babson even though most people who aren't involved in Entrepreneurship haven't heard of it.\n\nThis post also serves to show that you shouldn't pick a university just because it's \"famous\". A lot of immigrants will subscribe to that ideology.\n\nThe most famous colleges are not the ones you'll be the happiest at and thrive in. Remember that when you make your decision.",
