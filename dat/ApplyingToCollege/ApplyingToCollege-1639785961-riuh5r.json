      "text": "I hate to hear that. I applied in 1991. 30 years ago. The top universities were competitive back then. People even said that 1991 was the most competitive year ever. But it was nothing compared to how things are now. Back then, I was considered a very strong applicant. Probably the top applicant from my very large school. And I did get into some top universities. But if you transplanted my application to the present day, I doubt I would be accepted. My SAT scores, which were far above average in 1991, are well below what is considered competitive now. My extracurriculars, which were a huge strength of my application, would be considered fairly humdrum For an applicant to the top 20 universities.. My AP classes and exam scores which stood out back then would be considered near the minimum expectation now. I suspect that many parents simply don\u2019t understand what is going on out there. College admissions has become a brutal arms race and there\u2019s no end in sight. Perhaps you disappointed your mother, but that\u2019s about her. Ask whether you disappointed yourself. If you did, Examine why you feel that way and what you can do about it. If not, mom will just have to live with it. It\u2019s not her life.",

Having been there, I hate that your mom isn't being supportive to you in such a sucky situation, but don't let their disappointment project onto your mentality!! just buckle down, shotgun if you want to, and work your hardest for rd. that's what matters.\n\nalso sometimes moms just don't understand the college process and you just really gotta hammer into them that it's all just one in a million. ideal situation is xxx couldn't get into their dream college either, so just point to them and be like see? see??? lmao",
