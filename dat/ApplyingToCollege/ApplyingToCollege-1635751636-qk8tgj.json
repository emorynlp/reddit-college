  "text": "Because of some misinformation from my guidance counselor, I am now sending my scores(this includes ap scores as-well) through college board right now. I\u2019m applying to Binghamton, WPI, Penn State and Northeastern for EA. Am I screwed??? because I realize now it takes like 2 weeks to send the scores.\n\nEdit:\n Ok so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m totally screwed because Bing Northeastern and WPI accept self reported scores. I don\u2019t think thats the case for Penn State tho :(",

      "text": "I can\u2019t speak to the others schools, but I beleive Penn State means what it says that all material must arrive by Novermber 1. This includes the SRAR that you might not find about until submitting your application.\n\nThey will likely roll your application to their December 1 priority deadline.\n\nCollege aboard doesn\u2019t take 2 weeks. Their rush service states that they typically send scores on Monday, Wednesda, and Friday, so there\u2019s an outside chance a rush score sent right now (like, right now!) would go out on Monday.",

I think you can also add AP scores on the applicant status check but double check!\n\nPlease note that SAT or ACT scores that were self-reported in the Common Application will NOT be automatically added to your application file, as we allow students to control their testing status for a grace period after the application due date. Students wishing to share SAT or ACT must either self-report via the Application Status Check or have scores officially sent to Northeastern via the testing service.",
