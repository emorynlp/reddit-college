  "text": "So basically my freshmann year wasn't bad but it was't great, mostly Bs and A-'s. But, not to given an excuse, but in that year, both my grandpa and close friend passed away which took a huge mental toll on me.\n\nI didn't include it originally because I did not want to give an excuse, but is it too late to send the admissions office like explaining the grades? Ik those arent bad grades but to the school I EDed too, they aren't amazing or good enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs it too late? (I ED to NYU)",
