  "title:": "should I reupload my personal statement for ut Austin?",
  "text": "I didnt realize this but ApplyTexas removed all paragraph spacing in your essays and short answers and makes everything one big paragraph. the problem with this is the my personal statement was formatted in a way that made it necessary for line breaks. is it okay if I reupload my essay in MyStatus in a pdf document so they can view it formatted properly?\n\nthis what it says on ut's website\n\n\"Generally, you should plan to submit your essay in conjunction with your admissions application.\n\nYou may also submit your essay within [MyStatus](https://admissions.utexas.edu/mystatus) using the Document Upload System \u2014 or by mailing them to the\u00a0[Office of Admissions](https://admissions.utexas.edu/contact)\u2014although these submission methods are not preferred.\"\n\nim not sure if I can submit it both ways though",

              "text": "[ApplyTexas FAQ](https://goapplytexas.org/faq#)Submitting an Essay\nA:\nHow do I save and submit an essay?\n\nYou can access the essays portion of ApplyTexas in one of two ways:\n\nIf you are on the Essays page of any admissions application that requires essays, you will see a list of your required and optional essays. You may save essays via this page in the application card. At the time you submit your application, you will have the choice to SUBMIT all saved essays with your application, or to submit later.\nWhen I review the text I want to submit, I notice I've lost my formatting.\n\n*Any text you input will be converted to a mono-space font and any formatting you may have done (bullets, tabs, etc.) will be lost. In addition, if you cut and paste your essay from Word, some characters may not translate properly.*\n\nBefore submitting an essay online, we strongly recommend that you compose and save your essay in a program that uses a mono-spaced font (like NotePad), then copy and paste it into the ApplyTexas essays submission text box.\n\nBefore you submit, you will be asked to review your essay. The text you see will be what is sent to the university. Be sure to check through your essay, check the last line to ensure nothing has been cut off and make any necessary revisions before you submit.",
