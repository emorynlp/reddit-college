  "text": "this question was worded so weirdly, but i\u2019m mainly talking about trying to select schools based on maybe fishy or racist incidents that have occurred in the past at that specific university/college.\n\npersonally, i cared at first and only picked hbcus, however, i\u2019ve come to the realization that this is the scenario everywhere and that i\u2019ve grown up going to pwis. i\u2019m so used to it now that it doesn\u2019t faze me. \n\nwith that being said, texas a&m has like little to no black people, and my happy ass just applied there lol.",
