  "text": "Guys am I screwed?\n\nOur school has a strict policy for dating and my counselor caught me dating with a guy ( absolutely no physical interaction just talked alot) and I told her later I broke up with him( lied or I will be suspended). But then few months later today she saw me just walking to school together with my so-called ex and said she would suspend me and write it on my recommendation letter. I know it sounds weird but her dad is like the school president so I cant do anything about it",

As for your counselor recommendation, hopefully the AOs take anything negative with a grain of salt given the reason why she suspended you. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry your school has this shitty policy; students at mine get caught doing all sorts of sus stuff but very rarely do they get suspended. Even if it doesn\u2019t have a material impact on your application, it just seems like a really weird in general. All the best tho!",
