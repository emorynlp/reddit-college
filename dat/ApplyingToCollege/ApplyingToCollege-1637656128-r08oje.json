  "title:": "Finished my Duke interview!",
  "text": "My interviewer loved my major and how I wanted to utilize everything offered at Duke to further myself. For reference, my major is computational linguistics, but I would be creating my own major at Duke through program II. I also talked about how I wanted to use my major to further research in translating indigenous languages. Then connected that to the my indigenous language that is very hyper specific and almost no other university but Duke offers.\n\nShe loved my internship and how I connected my development of special education technology to my experience in the ESL (English as a Second Language) program by stating that all educational programs designed for disadvantaged students advance their learning instead of asking students to regurgitate information. \n\nI\u2019m so happy my interview went well. I am a great candidate, but I think I was maybe borderline. If I was borderline, then this interview definitely helped me. I would love to just go to college because that was never in my parents plan for me, so this just feels unreal.\n\nMy parents don\u2019t care about college and want me to work right out of high school, so this was such an amazing experience to enjoy, but I wish they could also be proud of me. Happy holidays:)",
