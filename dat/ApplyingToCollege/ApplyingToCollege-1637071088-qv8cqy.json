I would rather the American system because of how more diverse the type of topics you can take.\n\nWith the British system (atleast in my country) there are fixed subjects you have to study throughout form 4 and 5 and you can\u2019t switch because you\u2019ve already been placed in it. The external test are draining as hell because you have both multiple choice and a written test on different days and sometimes overlapping with each other. Not to mention, extracurriculars are non-existent and you get to have zero social life, so it\u2019s just school, work, study, repeat. \n\nThe American system may not be perfect but I was able to take a virtual course (my cousin just FaceTime me during her AP psychology class) and it was fun as hell (can\u2019t say so for the bored looking Americans though lol). My country only have like 18 main subjects with zero clubs\n\nThat\u2019s atleast how I see it, I don\u2019t really expect anyone to agree with me and but I just find the British system draining this year.",

Being made to specialize at age ~16 would be depressing. I like having more time and opportunity to explore different subjects and work between disciplines. I like sciences, but I also like languages, and history, and literature. Picking 3-4 specialties that early on would make me feel like I\u2019m missing out.\n\nHowever, I do like how all UK university admissions are based on a universal test system, rather than employing the nebulous aspects we do like essays and extracurriculars. It seems fairer to people across socioeconomic divides: you don\u2019t need parental connections for internships, or money to pay for training in sports or music. All you have are your books and study materials, and the smartest, most-hardworking student wins. It sets a clear objective up for everyone. You know exactly why you will or won\u2019t get into a school, with no uncertainty about it.  I\u2019d like to keep American high schools the way they are, but make the college admissions process closer to the UK one.",

I'm an international American, so i still take the act/ap exams. but the prices are ridiculous. the act without writing is $168. aps start at $128 then testing centers charge $50-$75 more for \"sitting fees.\" also, ap exams don't even have full waivers but reductions. and act doesn't have fee waivers for international students. and the sat can't have better security regulations so it's not administered in a few countries. i fully think standardized test fees shouldn't exist. it can increase the financial burden on many, who also feel the need to pay for prep materials. also, it's education. non profits that care about equal opportunities to their students (yes, I'm talking about you, CB) shouldn't be charging ridiculous fees for their tests when their managers and higher-ups get $500,000,000 annually",

In the UK, decisions about your a levels at 16 restrict the subjects you can pursue in uni. That's rarely the case in the US where you're encouraged to take time until junior year of college to decide. A levels and GCSE (in my experience) also don't prioritize understanding as much as they do regurgitation of facts. For example, derivatives are taught in gcse without any fundamentla understanding of calculus. Linear relations and quadratic relations are brushed over in around a month of GCSE whereas the american system spends a lot more time developing the student's mathematical understanding.",

Not sure which I preferred, but back then, the standard in US schools was lower than the UK.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward quite a few years and I live in the US now.  I was looking at current entry requirements here for undergrads coming from the UK at a state university in TX earlier today (UT, but not the flagship campus).  This is what you need (copy and paste from the website):\n\n**'5 IGCSEs or O levels at Grade C or higher in academic subjects. Subjects must include Math, English, Science, Social Sciences and 1 elective.'**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the UK, that might not qualify you to even take the A levels you'd need to get into a university in the UK 2 years later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think this is deliberate - you defund publicly funded education, the level of education provided falls, and students have to pay for an extra year in university in the US to get to where they would have been academically on day 1 in the UK.  It also drives people into university who will ultimately drop out - it's still more revenue.",
