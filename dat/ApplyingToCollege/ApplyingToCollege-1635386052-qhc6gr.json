  "text": "I'm currently a Highschool Sophomore and kinda lost with ECs. Ive done edx courses, and have a diploma in applied modern psych. But I need EC that's a little more longer time commitment and I'm just lost. Like the key clubs at my school literally does nothing. they do \"meetings\" but some kids just go in the back and smoke weed. like my school clubs are so stupid and unproductive. I'm interested in pre-med. Ive been trying to find research positions, but I haven't even taken ap bio or ap chem, so I'm a little under qualified (my school only allows AP for upperclassmen) I just need some ideas. I'm interested in premed btw. pls help",
