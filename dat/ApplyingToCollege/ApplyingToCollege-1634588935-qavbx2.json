  "title:": "Question about Early Action",
  "text": "So my school has this thing where you have to turn in your stuff for naviance at least 3 weeks before the deadline so you can be guaranteed that it\u2019ll be processed. For me that was on Friday. However, I have just discovered Macalester College and love it and really want to apply early action. If I do and my school doesn\u2019t ended getting everything processed and sent (LORS, transcripts, all other material not in common app) does this mean that they won\u2019t consider me for early action and will roll me over to regular decision? Or will I have to just reapply for regular decision? I know that they can still send LORS and transcripts after the deadline but they made it seem like their was more they had to do that will affect my common app being received.",

I would not let the school document timing stop you from applying early.",
