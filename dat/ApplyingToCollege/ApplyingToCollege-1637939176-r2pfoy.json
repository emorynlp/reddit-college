  "text": "Hi! I applied for an early decision and submitted my common applications with a fee waiver. And I canceled the fee waiver after I submit the applications. Which then I already received an acknowledgment for my application and passed it to the university\u2014 given an applicant portal... Question, Should I still pay for the fee or not? I am afraid it will affect my application but I am genuinely confused.",
