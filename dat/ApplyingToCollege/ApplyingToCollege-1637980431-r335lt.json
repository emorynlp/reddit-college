  "text": "Hi there!\n\nWe live in California. My son scored 36 in ACT and 1570 in SAT. Unfortunately, the University of California does not accept standardized test scores this year. Is there anyway to subtly let the admission committee know of my son's high scores. If he mentions the scores in some context in the essays, will it do more harm than good? As a parent, I want my son to get into his dream UC. Feeling helpless his high test scores are not helping him to achieve his dream.\n\nThanks!",

UC did not go test-blind for shits and giggles; they did so as a result of a court ruling. \n\nAny \"subtle\" way of circumventing the system will be pointless.",
