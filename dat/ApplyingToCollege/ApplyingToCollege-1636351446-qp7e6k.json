  "text": "On november 4, I received from Richmond email about my Student Portal with all necessary data as temporary PIN, my birthdate and my gmail acc. I am an international student btw. But when I wanted to sign in, I cannot get access to my portal. I wrote to addmission, but  they did not answer me yet. Time is running for early application finances. What I can do?? Are here some people with the same problem?",
