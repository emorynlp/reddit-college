  "text": "So on Common App I self reported me ACT score, but I accidentally put in the wrong date for when I took it. I put in February 12 instead of February 2, because i had a lot of trouble finding past ACT dates online and i hadn\u2019t written down exactly when i had taken it. I didn\u2019t misreport my actual score or anything like that. I\u2019m freaking out and I don\u2019t know what to do? Will colleges care or will they just realize it was a mistake?",
