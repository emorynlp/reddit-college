  "text": "For context: So FAFSA screwed me, not sure how but according to the govt, Im supposed to pay nearly 80% of my family's gross income in order to afford college, obviously not sustainable, but this number comes out to be about tuition of UM.  \n\nThat being said, I assume a private university is more inclined to accept someone who says they can pay full price on their apps. Now the issue is I already ticked off the \"need financial aid\" box when I submitted my app. Can I email admissions and tell them that I don't need financial aid? Also, will that boost my chances of being accepted?",

      "text": "I would do some research because some schools are need-blind and this change won't necessarily benefit you. I think the University of Michigan is need-blind, which means they reportedly don't take financial aid into consideration when admitting students. In this case, I would just apply as \"need financial aid\" because there will likely be more barriers to getting the aid you need if you don't.",

              "text": "My advice is to apply with \"need financial aid\" because it sounds like you won't be able to pay for the tuition long term without it. If you apply as not needing aid, then they may not provide you with sufficient aid or aid at all to attend the school. It's best to be honest in this situation because it would be really disappointing to turn down the offer because you can't afford the tuition or to go into significant debt because you want to attend the school. I would talk about this with your family and consider if you would be willing to take on the full price or most of the price of tuition. If you can't, then apply as \"need financial aid\".",

      "text": "You are not alone, the FAFSA only benefits the very needy.  The amount FAFSA states is based on annual income, but in the sense that it is the amount a family should have saved to contribute to your education every year.   \n\nSchools use Cost of Attendance to determine financial aid - that amount is calculated not only on tuition, but room/board/other incidentals.  So, if tuition is the same as your family contribution, then you are likely going to be eligible for some need based aid.  (because of room/board/etc).  This page explains: [https://studentaid.gov/complete-aid-process/how-calculated](https://studentaid.gov/complete-aid-process/how-calculated)\n\nI don't think you should change your answer regarding needing aid.  Because it does sound like you will need it.  Also, private schools give a lot more scholarship and merit money to students than state schools.",
