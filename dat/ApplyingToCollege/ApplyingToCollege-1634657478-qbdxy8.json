  "text": "I am very confused on how US colleges look at the A level exams. I have not completed the exam yet as it is in June next year but I have predicted grades. Will they consider that? Also I have done my GCSEs, does that play a part  into my application.\n\nI have done the ACT and got a 31 and I don\u2019t know how my grades at school will affect my score and likelihood of being admitted.",
