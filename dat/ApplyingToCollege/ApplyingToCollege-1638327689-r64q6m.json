  "text": "I'm trying to apply for Berkeley's Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, B.S. major, but I heard it's easier to get into Berkeley with Computer Science, B.A., plus they also have other interesting majors in College of Letters and Science just in case I want to switch major if I got admitted. But the note under Computer Science, B.A. which says \"You are selecting an intended major; Letters and Science does not admit students directly to majors.\" got me wondering what that is supposed to mean. Should I just yolo and give Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, B.S. a shot or Computer Science, B.A. just to be safe? I appreciate any advice and suggestions. Thanks!",

Which means there is a chance you won\u2019t be able to get very competitive majors such as CS. But I\u2019m not 100% sure bc i am in the college of chemistry at Berkeley.",

In order to transfer into Comp Sci B.A. for example, I think you need to get an average GPA of like 3.3 across three Comp Sci related classes. I just applied, and I'm doing comp sci so i just applied to college of L & S with intended major",
