I am actually interested in doing some AI/ML research and (hopefully!) getting it published, I think it will be a really cool learning experience for me. Will that be looked down upon for AO's, that I did some research for AI/ML (for a CS major ofc).",

Most high school students who do \"research\" (just like most people with \"non-profits\") don't actually do research, at least not in the way that colleges define the word (see u/IntheSarlaccsbelly's point on the post)  \n \n\nThe reality of the situation isn't that research is useless, but that low-quality and low-impact research (what the vast majority of HS \"research\" turns out to be) is held in low regard by AOs",

It still has to be good and quality. \n\nAn example of research:\n* Dr. Hadiyah-Nicole Green is an American medical physicist known for the development of a method using laser-activated nanoparticles as a potential cancer treatment. \n\nThis is new. This is high impact. She will change the way cancer is cured and diagnosed. \n\nThat\u2019s how colleges define research.\n\nBut high schoolers are rarely doing that. Usually they are teaming up with a professor, and not doing any actual research themselves. Research isn\u2019t just writing a paper on something, the way high schoolers research and write a paper for biology class. \n\nYou should be discovering a new and innovative way to solve a problem.",
