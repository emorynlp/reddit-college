  "text": "preface: sorry about my awful formatting i\u2019m panic typing right now.\n\nhey y\u2019all! so i\u2019m contemplating dropping ap calc ab because i have a C right now, and i\u2019ll probably get a 1 on the test i\u2019ll take in a couple hours.\n\nmy mental health has been really rough this year, and i just cannot handle calc. i swear it used to be immaculate, but this year im fucked in the head :((\n\nmy calc class doesnt allow any test retakes and our teacher is super harsh at grading. so basically im screwed in this class. i\u2019ll most likely end the semester with a C or even a D. would it be better for me to withdraw from the class and get a W? \n\nhere\u2019s my course load:\n\nfreshmen yr: 6 normal classes, APES\n(i ended the year with 4.0UW and 4.14W)\n\nsophomore yr: 5 normal classes, APUSH, AP bio (year ended with 4.0UW and 4.28W)\n\njunior yr (so right now): 2 normal classes, AP gov, AP lang, AP calc ab, AP psych, (i used to be in AP physics C before i dropped it to be a teachers assistant instead) \n\ni\u2019m concerned about dropping calc because i already dropped ap physics (luckily this didn\u2019t go in as a W though, and it got completely replaced by me being a TA). would it be better for my college apps to have a W? \n\nif i get a 1 in calc, my UW gpa will go down to a 3.85. and my Weighted gpa will be a 4.2. if i get a W though, my UW gpa will stay a 4.0 and my weighted gpa will be a 4.32.",

      "text": "GPA plays a really important role in college admission. Normally, if this class you're taking will not affect your GPA too much then I suggest you keep taking it, bc colleges do want to see how you challenge and apply yourself to vigorous courses. However, if you feel like you're mentally drowned bc of the course and it does have a pretty significant effect on your GPA, my advice would be to drop it. \n\nI know junior is literally the worse, but keep working on your classes!! You got it!!!",
