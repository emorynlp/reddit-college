  "text": "I\u2019m going to start applying to a private boarding college overseas starting now, and I have some questions. The schools I\u2019m looking at all have application forms, ive filled them out and handed them in of course. Some require interviews.\n\nThe thing is I\u2019m not so sure I\u2019ll get into them as they are all pretty good schools so I\u2019m lucky if I even get accepted.\n\nNow the question is I have applied to multiple schools 5-10, if I get accepted into let\u2019s say 2 of them do I get a choice? Does the school give me a choice or what how does it work. If they accepted me that means they have reserved a spot for me in their boarding houses etc, if I choose another school do I just turn them down or what? Isn\u2019t that disrespectful or something?",
