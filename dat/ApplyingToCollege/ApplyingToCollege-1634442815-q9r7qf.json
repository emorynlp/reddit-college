(The Additional Information Section)\n\nI am an International Student from Egypt, last year, unfortunately, the SAT got cancelled from August till now due to the leaked of the test by teachers (The College Board said, \"The test will be cancelled to June as by this time the test will be a computer-based to avoid the leak of the test but June passed and nothing happened) \n\nAt the beginning of this year, I took a full-time job to help my family with the fees of the tests (Toefl and SAT), The ACT was available for me this month, but it cost a lot of money that I did not have in my budget.\n\nI am not sure what to do now to explain what happened in my application (Also, as I didn't take the test, I will use the fees of it to help my younger sister education expenses as she will be in high school this year, and it cost a lot of money here, I am not sure too if I can mention that in my app too).",

      "text": "It's not necessary to explain this. If a college is test optional, they won't really care why you're not submitting the test, and it's been very common since COVID began for students to experience situations like yours. Of course, if it makes you feel more comfortable, go ahead and write about it! But don't stress about adding that explanation to your app.",
