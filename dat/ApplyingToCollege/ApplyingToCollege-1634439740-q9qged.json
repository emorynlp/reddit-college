  "text": "I'm an international student applying for financial aid at top private universities.\n\nMy family situation is pretty complex, I'm just wondering how far would FA officers go to verify information? If I submit my parent's tax returns and bank statements, that should be enough right? Are there instances where FA officers will call up my parents or check up on their address? Has anyone encountered situations like this?",
