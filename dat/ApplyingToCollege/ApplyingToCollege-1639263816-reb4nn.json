  "text": "Speculating right now, but I think the decisions will be released tmr. Georgetown releases their decisions on the weekends before they say they\u2019re going to post them\u2014 just looking at previous trends. Last year for early action, they said they were releasing December 15, and they released them Sunday, Dec 13. They also did the same thing for the regular decision pool, releasing over the weekend. What do you guys think??",
