      "text": "Just adding a PSA to try to reach those UC out of state applicants who may not yet be aware:  public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.",
