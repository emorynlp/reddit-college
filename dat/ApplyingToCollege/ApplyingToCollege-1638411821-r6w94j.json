  "text": "So hear my plight... I'm looking to get a PhD in astrophysics. I live in northern Virginia close to GMU. My dad makes a ton of money but is only willing to give me about 8k a year for college. This means grants are pretty much out of the question and I have to pay the full brunt of tuition, housing, and all other costs. Without grants, out of state is just not an option leaving me 2 schools for my astronomy bachelors, GMU, which I can commute to putting the cost at about 14k, or UVA, which will be a around 35k including housing. After my undergrad, I am pretty sure I'll go to Leiden in the Netherlands (I can speak dutch because I am South African) for my masters and PhD. From what i've gathered online, Leiden is a cheap (cus EU) top tier astronomy school. The whole issue though is the cost of getting a masters there (because the PhD will pay for itself). If I go to GMU I will definitely be able to save money for grad school but I won't have as good of an undergrad education, while if I go to UVA, I'll get a strong undergrad  but I'll almost certainly be in debt going into grad school.\n\nI think going to GMU and saving is the smart decision as I may not financially even be able to go to grad school if I go to UVA, but at the same time I don't know if I'm shooting myself in the foot.\n\nLiterally any advice will be incredibly welcomed!",
