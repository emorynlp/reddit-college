  "title:": "Looking for Canadian unis with certain conditions",
  "text": "I have already completed a semester (sem-1 year-1) of my current uni in an Asian country. I just completed sem 2 and want to transfer to a Canadian university. \n\nMy main concern is tuition fees, and secondly the ranking/faculty services. The field I am pursuing is Computer science Artificial intelligence undergraduate (bachelors) degree. \n\nCan you recommend an affordable uni for an international student? \n\nAs for my grades:\nO levels: 5 A* + 3 A\nA levels: 1 A* + 2 A\nSemester 1 GPA: 3.7 out of 4\n\nDo I have a chance at an elite uni with low fee structure, if there is one; and do I have a shot at bursaries or scholarships?\n\nI am also open to the idea of going in as a fresh student but obviously it is less preferable.",
