  "text": "Hey all! I took the October School Day SAT and got my scores back today. Some good news and some bad news...\n\nBut first, some context! I'm a QuestBridge student who's applied early to a few different schools, and I submitted my SAT test score of 1490 (740 English, 750 Math).\n\nSo here's where the dilemma kicks in. I got a 750 on the English section, so superscoring that would give me a 10 point boost into a 1500. Unfortunately, on the day I took the SAT, I was incredibly tired and decided NOT to take the math section seriously. I spent 5 minutes solving the easiest of problems, then bubbled in C for the rest, resulting in a 520, a score significantly lower than my other score (and one that I believe is not representative of my true abilities).\n\nMany schools ask that you submit your full test score from a particular date if you wish to superscore, and I was wondering whether I should submit this new test to them. Sure, they say that they only look at the highest score per section, but I'm worried that they might have questions about such a significant drop off (750 --> 520). What should I do here?",
