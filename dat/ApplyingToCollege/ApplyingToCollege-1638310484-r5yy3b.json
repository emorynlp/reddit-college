  "text": "Hi everyone! Hope you guys aren\u2019t stressing yourself too much like I am but I have a question: I voluntarily work for my parents small business with no pay twice a week for 8 hour night shifts. How can I add that into my UC App? Can I put it under the extracurricular and award section? Would I list it as volunteer work because when I list it as volunteer work it asks questions like \u201cwhat is the purpose of the organization\u201d and I\u2019m overthinking that they only want volunteer work from like non profits or something.",
