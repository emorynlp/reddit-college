  "text": "Do you know people that received assistance from the EducationUSA Club but went to a college with a non-american system?\n\nI'm asking this because I personally think about doing so.\n\n(A little backstory) I have two options for studying abroad: the USA (dream choice) and Germany (more realistic & affordable). I'm a member of the local EducationUSA club, so I do receive its free assistance like individual consultations and proofreading my essays for the college application. However, it's quite unlikely for me to be accepted to the US university and afford it, so I will also apply to German colleges (with different requirements ofc).\n\nWhat if I went to Germany after using all club's free resources?... Would it be okay at all?",
