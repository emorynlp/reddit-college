  "text": "Silly question but if ur biological dad(sperm donor) went to college, r u considered as a first-gen?\nOr if ur surrogate mom went to college?\nOr if ur mom was wild and doesnt even know ur biological dad, how do u know if ur first gen?\nOr if ur dad died even before ur born, r u a first gen?\nI heard rather ur dad/mom is dead or separated, if she/he went to college, ur considered 2nd gen. But what is the line?",

              "text": "I would say in these cases, it's more about if there was a college-going culture in your home. So if a parent passed away when you were very young (or before you were born) and/or you never knew that parent, you could be considered first gen because you weren't raised in a household with a parent who went to college. That being said, every college has a slightly different definition of first gen, so it doesn't hurt to ask.",
