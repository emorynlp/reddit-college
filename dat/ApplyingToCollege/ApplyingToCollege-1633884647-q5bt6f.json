  "text": "I've written 2 research papers and 1 review paper but have only submitted 1 of them so far (to AAAI). I asked my counselor about how I should mention this in my application and she said to mention them in the Awards section. I think this is a good idea since I want to explain what I actually researched about in the activities section rather than wasting words saying I wrote a paper. What is your opinion on this? Thanks!",
