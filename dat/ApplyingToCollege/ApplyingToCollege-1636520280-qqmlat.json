  "text": "My son will be in 10th grade next  year. He has the option to take AP Physics 1 or World\u00a0History Honors. Will colleges look for four years of social studies? Not taking a social studies course in 10th-grade affects admission to top private universities?\u00a0 My son is planning to go the STEM route and so considering AP Physics. Your input will be\u00a0greatly appreciated in\u00a0this matter.\n\nthanks in advance.",

The typical plan at our specific campus has them taking 4 years of SS and \\*strongly\\* encourages they keep taking foreign language after completing the two required credits.",

      "text": "No it won't affect admission. In taking either of the classes (as well as the rest of his schedule) he's definitely showing enough academic rigor. However, I'd keep in mind school graduation requirements. It may be the case the decision he makes this year could affect 11th or 12th-grade course selection. Additionally AP or other dual enrollment credit could potentially help him in the future. Whatever he decides he's well on his way to becoming a wonderful applicant.",
