  "text": "im gonna submit my uc applications tmrw; all i have left is choosing my majors\n\ncan someone pls explain the difference between computer engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science and computer engineering and science?\n\ni wanted do comp sci but my mom said that comp engineering has comp sci in it & comp engr is considered better than comp sci (which means more money ;) ) -- is this tru?\n\nalso, does major/alternate major mean first preference and second preference or does it mean pick two majors\n\nthank you!",

I highly recommend developing the \"internet research\" skill if you want to work in software.\n\nElectrical Engineering - concerns the design of electrical hardware and firmware, both analog and digital.\n\nComputer Engineering - often considered a sub-specialty within electrical engineering; concerns the design of digital components, most often computer chips.\n\nComputer Science - concerns the theory of what can be computed, how best to do so, the features of constructs like \"programming languages\", \"operating systems\" and \"databases\", and usually includes some training in how to write software.",

      "text": "I found that 'Engineering Degree Tier List' by Shane Hummus on Youtube was a helpful video that talks about the different engineering disciplines. Might also be more beneficial doing more in depth research on your intended major... And I believe it's first preference and second preference",

      "text": "Others already commented on the differences but just fyi CE is not necessarily better than CS. In terms of money, they are nearly identical. Just because a major has engineering in it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s more lucrative. Statistically, CS pays more on average but by a very very tiny amount. \n\nIf you prefer working with software, choose CS. If you prefer working with hardware and electronics, choose CE. You\u2019ll earn more in the field you enjoy the most.\n\nAnd yes, alternate major means second preference.",
