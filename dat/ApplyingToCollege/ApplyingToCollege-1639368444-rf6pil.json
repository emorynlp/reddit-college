  "title:": "Accepted into my dream school, riddled with constant anxiety",
  "text": "I can't convince myself that this is actually happening.  Every afternoon I enter a state of panic where I feel like I'm going to get an email saying \"We're sorry, we made a mistake, we're rescinding your admission.\"  My hands start randomly trembling and I start doing stupid crap to try to make myself feel better.  But I'm never able to calm down; one worry pops up after the next and the unending uneasiness is eating away at my skull.   I've never felt like this before or had any issues with large periods of anxiousness, but now I have to and it's such a horrid sensation. \n\nI think I need therapy just to accept the fact they accepted me.",

      "text": "Sounds like something you should work to address, sooner rather than later.  I'm not sure what the answer is, but given you just got into your \"dream school\" and are continuing to have anxiety related panic attacks, it stands to reason that you will probably deal with similar issues (if not worse) once you matriculate.",

      "text": "Just take big, deep breaths for now (and whenever you feel overwhelmed). Realize that a big weight is actually off of you (for nervously anticipating the worst), and that you\u2019re gonna be alright. Keep telling yourself this (and if you don\u2019t *feel* that way now, fake it until ya make it, if you have to). Is there a guilty pleasure show you like watching? Or one you\u2019ve been putting off until you \u201chad the time?\u201d Well go ahead and binge the hell out of it during break. Or find* one to binge (trust me, there\u2019s an episodic escape out there for everyone, no matter who they are or if they ever watch any tv). Just tell me a genre and I can point you in the right direction. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nBut if that isn\u2019t your thing, or dosen\u2019t work to calm your nerves..the best advice I could give (and this goes for anyone) - is to get out & take in some peaceful, open spaces. It may sound corny - and not everyone is a nature lover - but it will work wonders for your soul. I can\u2019t ever feel like crap when on the trail in the \u201cEnchanted Forest\u201d section of our local botanical garden. (Longtime members there.) There\u2019s just something about it, it\u2019s soothing - when you\u2019re fortunate enough to have a good spot. Best of luck to ya! If you realize it, you\u2019re gonna be fine.",
