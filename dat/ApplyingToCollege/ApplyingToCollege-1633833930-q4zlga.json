  "title:": "Reminder from a College Junior",
  "text": "I used to browse this sub pretty extensively, let\u2019s say 3-4 years ago. Even then, people\u2019s applications were competitive af. I didn\u2019t realize my ambitions until the 11th grade, and by then it was too late to build an impressive CV. I didn\u2019t break 1500 on my SAT. \n\nIt\u2019s fine to not get into the Ivy\u2019s or the T20s. You can begin grinding at state school, get good grades, make connections, get LORs for internships and all that. There\u2019s no rule of thumb that says you had to go to SUNY Ithaca or UC Hicago or \ud83c\udd71\ufe0fama (is that still a thing here?). The college that offered me a scholarship isn\u2019t even nationally ranked, but I came freshman year determined to work my tail off and be the best premed I could be. Research labs, clinical exposure, high GPA, you name it and I strove for it. I\u2019m planning on attempting to apply to medical school this Spring, so hopefully that goes well. \n\nJust a well-being reminder that life won\u2019t end if Ivy day doesn\u2019t go your way (bars!). In fact, the chip on your shoulder from not getting into your dream school can be channeled into positive energy to working even harder in college. As you all get ready to start getting some decisions, I just wanted to say good luck.",

Passing interviews is based on your technical performance. Sure it might be slightly easier for your resume to get an initial screen coming from MIT , but if you prove you\u2019re a competent coder by doing impressive non trivial projects you can go anywhere and get interviews. Compared to say IB/Consulting where school and GPA are pretty much most important factors.",

Being at a place like MIT you\u2019re not gonna get in on school name alone , and will get rejected resume round without something notable. Now of course JS likes things like IMO medalists of which there are very high concentrations at MIT . Those people are more likely to get interviews and more likely to pas them because they\u2019re smart enough to be IMO medalists. They\u2019d be able to achieve the same thing had they gone to their local state school.",

It\u2019s mostly just networking, knowing some finance technicals , and performing well in behaviorals. \n\nPlaces like JS it\u2019s almost 100% your mathematical ability",
