  "text": "the uc app asked for income and it said to include things such as unemployment compensation which i did because my parents filed for that in 2020.\nbut on fafsa my parents total income is much lower because of losses.\n\nso basically i put the amount of umployment compensation on the uc app but its not the true total income\n\ni already submitted my uc app and dont think i can update the income.\n\nwill this affect me?",
