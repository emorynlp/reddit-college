  "text": "hey guys, i already graduated but i just wanted to let you know about a possible job opportunity! are you worried about application fees because you don\u2019t qualify for fee waivers? consider become a professional college applyer! \n\nt20s pay me just to apply to their schools and help them lower their acceptance rate artificially, and i pull in around $20k per application season. if that sounds good to you, just email t20 admissions offices with \u201cplease pay me to apply!\u201d and then immediately submit your applications with the same message in your supplemental essay boxes.\n\nthe colleges will reimburse you with quadruple their application fee within 3-5 business days. remember to do this especially for berkeley, northwestern, and stanford before the professional priority deadline tonight. don\u2019t wait!",
