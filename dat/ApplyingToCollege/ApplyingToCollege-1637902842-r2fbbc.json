  "text": "I\u2019ve been struggling with health issues and had to drop out of national honor society, and am considering dropping an AP class as well. I already submitted some of my applications with this info on them; who should I email to let the colleges aware of these changes? Just the general admissions or should I find my college counselor for that school??",
