  "text": "the FAFSA has been the bane of my existence.\n\nA long story short, a college financial aid officer asked for a DRN so he can pull data from one of my prior corrections. The only thing is.. my DRN is the same for every submission I've made? even ones with somewhat-significant changes between them.. \n\nSo, I sent him my DRN, but it got me wondering, how could they possibly use that to retrieve data from a specific FAFSA? Wouldnt it just pull back every correction I've made? \n\nWhich got me to wondering.. is it weird that my DRN has stayed the same for all submissions? is it supposed to change?",
