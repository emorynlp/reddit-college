  "text": "I am applying for the economics and business program in Utrecht as an international and am curious what kind of school it is. On the internet it states that it is a prestigious university and ranks #1 but on further research it's rank is like 200 something on the Shanghai Ranking. Any information about the eco and bus program or the university itself will be appreciated.",
