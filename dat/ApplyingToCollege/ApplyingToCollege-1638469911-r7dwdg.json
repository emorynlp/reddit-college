  "text": "okay backstory, on nov 1st i tried applying for UT with their priority deadline, and i spent 7 hours on deadline day and still didn\u2019t finish \ud83d\ude35. Fast forward to nov 30th and i decided to try a sugar free monster energy (a few sips) and it was desgustan \ud83e\udd22 but i finished all 4 essays from scratch within 1 hour and 30 minutes \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udd25and the UT prompts are bland asf!! it\u2019s probably the best essays i\u2019ve written in a while too\u2026 \n\n\ntldr: i\u2019m not advocating to procrastinate or for energy drinks, BUT if ur on a time crunch, monster energies will do the job",
