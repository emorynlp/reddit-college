  "title:": "Question About Covid and Additional Info",
  "text": "Hey guys\n\nSo my entire family and I tested positive for covid around May-June 2021, which was right when I had my first set of school exams for Grade 12 AND my APs, all in the same week. Since they were online I took them, but obviously did not do well and thats affected my 12th Mid term report card and I ended up with 3's on both APs. if I explain this to colleges in the Covid Disruption part of the Common App, will it kinda reduce the negative impact of the 2 B's I got cause of this??\n\nThanks :)",
