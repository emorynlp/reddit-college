  "title:": "Currently a Junior in High School, looking for universities to research about",
  "text": "I was wondering if anyone knew of some good universities to research since I heard it\u2019s good to start looking at them junior year.\nMy most important needs in a uni are\n1. Must be near a town that has things to do\n2. Must be decently walkable\n3. Must have humanities majors\n4. Cannot be a really religious school\n5. Opportunities for languages and journalism type study \n6. Is good for students with autism; accommodations \n\nI am also interested in going to colleges outside the USA but they can also be in the usa as well",

      "text": "**Macalester -** Very walkable, gorgeous school. Beautiful location in a sort of suburban neighborhood of Minneapolis. Super nice neighborhoods with cute little houses; great for going on walks. Nice shops and restaurants nearby. Nonsectarian school; great for humanities, languages & Media/cultural studies is their journalism major. Not religious as I mentioned earlier; and progressive, LGBTQ+ friendly, etc. And Minneapolis has so much to do!\n\n[https://www.macalester.edu/disabilityservices/](https://www.macalester.edu/disabilityservices/)\n\n**Drexel -** Great school in Philadelphia. Unique in that you graduate in 5 years with 2 semester-long (usually paid) co-op positions within your field of study. Very walkable, and great food, music, and entertainment nearby. Not religious. Very diverse. SO many majors; you're bound to find something in the specific field you're interested in. Large-ish school.\n\nBut their autism accommodations and support (DASP Program) are what blow them out of the water. It's seriously amazing. My neighbor is on the spectrum and the support he receives at Drexel is incredible. He's a freshman and he loves it. We text nearly every day & he is having a great time.\n\n[https://drexel.edu/counselingandhealth/autism-support/overview/](https://drexel.edu/counselingandhealth/autism-support/overview/)\n\n\\-----\n\nBest of luck! :)",
