Try to find \"dream\" schools with various acceptance rates. You can have an ideal reach, target, and safety school. That way the rejection can roll off your shoulders.",

I just searched public universities with moderately good acceptance rates and lower tution costs and applied there. Besides, this year's application cycle was brutal, and I was pretty sure my profile wasn't up to bar. I knew that acceptance rates would lower for T20s, because of the whole test optional thing. \n\nI kind of regret not taking my slim chances and throwing an application into the Ivy League abyss, but whatever. There's always grad school to look forward to.",
