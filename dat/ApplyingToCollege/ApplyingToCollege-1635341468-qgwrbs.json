  "text": "So yesterday at 5pm I kinda passed out on my bed\u2026 after doing minor hw, sending emails, etc. etc. (I\u2019ve been getting 3-4 hours of sleep in the past week, so understandable \ud83d\ude2d)\n\nAnd I woke up this morning at 7:30 with a horrifying realization that I didn\u2019t work on my college applications nor my AP Lit project due today \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 I was in such a rage that I punched my head like 8 times (it didn\u2019t even hurt and that made me even more angry) and swore more in that hour than I ever would in a month.\n\nIt\u2019s been around 2 hours since that happened so now looking back, it\u2019s kinda funny. But it was the most startling way to ever wake up without an alarm.\n\nSo basically, y\u2019all should get some sleep and don\u2019t do what I did\u2026 bc your body might make you pass out and miss doing some important assignments and whatnot lmao \n\n(Rant flair bc I guess that\u2019s the most fitting haha)",
