Feeling annoyed that the REA or ED rates are so much higher.\n\nMost non-rich people (i\u2019m middle class) still can\u2019t realistically do ED/REA if they want their financial aid stuff back in time for decisions. My parents also aren\u2019t shelling out to fly three people to a school across the country prior to getting in when they have a 5% acceptance rate. :(",
