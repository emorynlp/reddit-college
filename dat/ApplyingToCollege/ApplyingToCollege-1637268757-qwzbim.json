  "text": "My high school only offers one AP class (AP Calc AB). Which I am going to take next year. However, I am a College Credit Plus student and take college classes. I also take the honors version of all classes. I hear that course difficulty is a big factor in college admissions. I'm wondering how this lack of AP classes will affect my chances at the more selective schools?",

      "text": "From what I've heard from most colleges is that they base it more off of what the school offers. They get an info sheet that tells them about all the classes, average grades, etc. If you take the hardest classes your school offers you will be showing that you challenge yourself. For example, I'm taking 5 aps this year at my school, but also are like 20+ other kids, so it's not super special.",

      "text": "your counselor should be sending in a school report where it should mention that there is only 1 ap offered at your school, in addition to those honors classes, and that (im assuming) students are allowed to dual enroll at a college for more courses. With this, colleges will see that you are willingly adding rigor to your courseload, so you should be fine.",

              "text": "The guidelines for a school report seem pretty loose. I helped my HS counselor make one a few years ago cause the one she was using seemed outdated and inaccurate, and she could have just as easily submitted that and not been questioned. My school being super small made it easy for me to hash out these details and at a huge school this might not be possible. So yea, they should be accurately reporting APs and other school policies, but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.",
