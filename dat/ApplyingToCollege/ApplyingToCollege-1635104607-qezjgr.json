  "text": "I\u2019m working on my UVA CAS essay and I\u2019m doing it on a poem, so I embedded a link to it in the essay. I\u2019m not 100% sure that AOs will know what the poem is and I also cite a specific line in it. I\u2019m debating if I should keep the link or not. Would it be fine if I submitted it with the link?",
