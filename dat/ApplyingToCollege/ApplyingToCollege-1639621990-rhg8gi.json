  "text": "So Yale is my dream school and I\u2019m a junior but academically I\u2019m a bit uncompetitive (mostly high 80s and low 90s freshman year) and some A minuses in sophomore year with that being said I have rlly good extracurriculars. I know that the Yale website says that all applicants are evaluated through the same processes, but would my intended major being film/ cinema studies make admissions easier? and does anyone have any tips to increase my chances? Ik this is rlly unorganized I\u2019m just overthinking right now. Thanks.",

      "text": "if you want to increase your chances, I would check out their recommended courses and make sure you are fulfilling those. look at their common data set for what type of students they admit and make yourself a competitive candidate. Showing interest in a specific major by engaging in some major-related extracurriculars and classes would probably help you, but because they don't admit by major, what the major itself is will not be a significant factor. If you love film, then try to make it come across in your essays, classes and activities; that is where your major can help you most!",
