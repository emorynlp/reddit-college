Would you look into it again thinking you already found an answer? What would happen if you just never got corrected even after all the talks you've attended?\n\n\nAnd yeah, in hindsight, the terms \"Early Action\" and \"Early Decision\" do make sense given their differences. However, let's say you didn't know the distinction. Is it not reasonable to infer that they are the same?",
