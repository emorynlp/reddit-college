  "text": "I\u2019m a Senior in high school and I have had a very harsh start to school this year. My grades have suffered badly due to my own mistakes, I chose classes which I could not keep up with and as a result I had to drop 2 of my Ap classes. So here is what happened. \n\nI was never really interested in science classes such as biology and others that are related to medical fields, however I did like and had really good grades in my chemistry class in my junior year  and my physics class during my freshman year, I also did good in my biology class during my sophomore year but I was never really interested in the subject. Regarding, When choosing classes for my senior year at the end of my junior year, I just asked my senior friends (who have now graduated) for suggestions and mainly chose my classes based on that. The biggest mistake by far was choosing AP PSYCHOLOGY, I absolutely hated that class and had no interest in it. It was also because 70% of my grades were based on tests and I was failing because of that, on top of that, The teacher would not accept any late work. What made me even more mad was that the other Ap psychology teacher at my school allowed test corrections up to a b-, while my teacher did not even accept late work. I could not switch teachers because my school has a strict policy against that. My bad performance in Ap psychology had really hurt me and I was extremely demotivated because of that. As a result, my other classes were suffering as well. \n\nThen, after a week or 2, I got myself together and after a few meetings with my guidance counselor, I was finally able to drop Ap psychology from my transcript and chose a half year course which will begin in the 2nd semester around February 2022.  \n\nI also downgraded from Ap environmental science to A level. \n\nNow the problem. \n\n- when switching from Ap environmental science to A level, my teacher only transferred  3 assignments from Ap to A level because those were the only relevant ones.  She also transferred a 5 part assignment but I did not complete them \n(we were working on the 3rd part when I switched out) \n\nSo I had to make up all 5 of these assignments as well as keep doing the classwork and homework in this class, I could not finish all of them and only got credit for 2 of these 5 assignments. \n\n(Remember THE DROPPING OF AP PSYCH AND DOWNGRADE IN AP ENVIRONMENTAL HAPPENED AT THE LAST MINUTE IN THE TERM - I only had 2 weeks and the term was over) \n\nI could have finished most of the work but \n1 - I was being lazy and very sad with all that happened. \n\n2 -  I had upcoming tests and midterms in almost every class so I could either study or complete the missing work. \n(I gave priority to the upcoming tests) \n\nSo now the term has ended and here is what my grades are looking like \n\n\n\u2022 Spanish- 93 (A)  \n\u2022 English Honors - 90 (-A) \n\n\u2022 Math- 80 (B-)  \n\u2022 Enviro Science - 68 (  D+)  \n\u2022 Economics, this is a dual enrollment college class (Ap credit)  - 68 ( D+ )  \n\u2022 Gym - 100 (A+)\n\n( I dropped Ap psychology so it doesn\u2019t count). \n(These grades are final and I can\u2019t change them) \nThe most I can do is have my Spanish grades raised to a 95 by retaking a test, my Spanish teacher is the nicest after my English teacher and is willing to help but I doubt that going from 93 to 95 will change anything. \n\nMy concern is how do I apply to college with these grades? How badly will they affect me ? \n\nI\u2019m very confident that my term 2 grades will be tremendously better than term 1 grades. \nI\u2019m confident I\u2019ll finish with most As and Bs \n\nSO can I convince colleges to look at my term 2 grades as well ?",

      "text": "Colleges go back and review applications for their second term grades, especially when making scholarship decisions\n\nbut my advice to you is to explain all of this shit to your current teachers and turn those D's into solid C's if at all possible. \"C's get degrees\", as it were.\n\nAsk for extra credit if you have to...but ultimately colleges will look at your entire transcript and care more about test scores than any one semester. Plus, your essay.\n\nWhat'd you get on your ACT?",
