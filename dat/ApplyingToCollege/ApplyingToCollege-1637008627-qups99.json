  "title:": "How Do I Submit a Teacher Letter of Recommendation as a Transfer Student?",
  "text": "I transferred to a new school for my current senior year, and the new school uses Naviance for requesting and submitting letters of recommendation. My English teacher from my former school agreed to write me a letter of recommendation, but she's unable to send it to my school's Naviance because she's not from my school. Due to that, another option I have is submitting the letter through Common App. However, I can't figure out how to send it to Common App as it uses Naviance for teacher recommendations too. I looked at the \"Invite Recommender\" option on Common App, but there's no option to invite a teacher.   \n\n\nHow do I send a letter of recommendation from my teacher who is from my former school to Common App/Naviance? If both aren't options, what other option do I have?",
