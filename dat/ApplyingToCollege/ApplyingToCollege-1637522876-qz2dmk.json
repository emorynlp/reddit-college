  "text": "Reporting in as a freshman in college and I just wanted to share the biggest thing I've noticed in the application/enrollment process. It's easy to get caught up in the hype of going to the \"most prestigious\" or \"lowest acceptance rate\" school but the truth is if that school isn't the right fit for you you will not be successful or happy. I have personally witnessed dozens of students from my high school fall into this exact trap. They are now miserable at these schools and trying to transfer to a college they should have originally chosen in the first place. The best decision of my life was choosing a school that I knew I would be happy it because it was a good fit for my preferences, personality, and academics. I was choosing between this school on the west coast and a slightly more prestigious east coast school and I was extremely close to choosing the east coast school-based completely on name brand. I can now say with confidence that I made the correct decision because I would not have been happy at all at the \"more prestigious school.\" I have met so many amazing friends and truly found a home at my college this year so I urge you all to consider your own personality and well-being when choosing your college. Good luck everyone!",

I personally knew I wanted to stay on the west coast because I am happiest near the beach and with warmer weather and I wanted a school that was academically rigorous but still collaborative, not cutthroat. Definitely try to tour your top schools and observe whether or not you can actually see yourself on the campus. You can ask yourself if you are similar to the student body/can see yourself getting along with them, what extracurriculars the school offers that you would be interested in, if you like the size of the physical campus, and other questions like that. I found that during my tours I was able to get an immediate overall \"vibe\" of the college if that makes sense so if you tour just pay extra attention to where you feel the most comfortable. Be realistic with your choice/preferences and remember that you are actually going to be moving to this campus in the fall, it isn't just a label.",
