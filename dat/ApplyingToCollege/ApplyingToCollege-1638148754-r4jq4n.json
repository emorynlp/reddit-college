  "text": "I'm a high school senior applying to college for fall 2022. I don't know whether SJSU and Cal Poly SLO are rolling or not, everyone keeps telling me a different thing. The reason I'm asking is that I just submitted my application today and I just wanted to know if that's going to give me a disadvantage because I'm applying CS and those spots I anticipate will fill up fast if it is rolling. Thanks in advance.",

      "text": "I can speak for Cal Poly. Their deadline is the deadline. If you apply before that, it doesn\u2019t impact your admission. \n\nThey have an incredibly annoying rolling announcement on admissions. I believe they release an early batch to share who\u2019s admitted. That batch is released over multiple days in March. Then who\u2019s rejected. Then waitlist and then they wait forever to tell you if you get off the waitlist or not and by June/July they tell you if they\u2019re done with the waitlist.",
