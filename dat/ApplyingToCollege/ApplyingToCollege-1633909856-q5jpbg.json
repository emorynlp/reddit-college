  "text": "So I want to apply to more schools but I'm not sure which ones to apply to. I want to go to a college in or very close to a big city.\n I've applied and got accepted into the 2 major colleges in my state, WV.\nI want to major in Psychology.\nI have a weighted cumulative 4.2 GPA, but also got an F 1st semester junior year bc of lost motivation which i mention in my common app essay about covid.\nI've gotten 3s on 3 AP exams. Lang, Euro, and Psych. I'm taking AP Gov and Lit this year. \nI'm 2 years ahead in math so I'm not taking one this year. \nMy SAT is 1190 for my first test. Im taking another one soon.\nI did marching band freshman year but had to quit when I moved schools in sophomore year and their band wasnt good. Moved back to my schoo junior year. \nI've held a job almost consistently since the week after I turned 16.\n40 hours of community service.\nI'm trying to join my schools literature club once clubs start this year.",
