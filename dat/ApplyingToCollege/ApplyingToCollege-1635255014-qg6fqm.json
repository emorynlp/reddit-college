  "text": "Im a freshman in high school, im really interested in geopolitics and international relations. I applied to a summer program and got a partial scholarship, decided not to go since covid was really bad at the time ( I later realised it wasn't prestigious at all, just another cash cow program). However, now I'm looking for better summer programs, ones that lean towards my interest. I know about TASP, YYGS etc but due to the eligibility factor I'm still too young to apply. Anyone knows any good programs that take rising sophomores? also if anyone could give pointers to other activities I could opt for to have a strong college application, that'd be really helpful. Thanks!\n\nps: Im not very accustomed to the US high school terms, so if I get anything wrong, I just want to confirm that I'm in grade 9 as of now, will be a grade 10 student by the summer.",
