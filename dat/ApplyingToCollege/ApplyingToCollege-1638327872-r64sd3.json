          "text": "I loved this quote.  I've read a lot of essays that \"made my teacher/parent cry\" that weren't very good.  You have to remember that those people know you and care about you, so seeing you bare your soul can be moving to them.  But a random AO has no connection to you and likely won't feel anything.  Don't try to emotionally manipulate them - try to demonstrate positive and compelling qualities that make them want to add you to their community.",
