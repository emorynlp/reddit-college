  "text": "Basically title. I\u2019ve never lived in US. And I lived in 2 different country. And here\u2019s my rant. \n\n1. Dangerous : I know it depends on the region but I\u2019ve spent my whole life living in countries where I can leave my phone in the bathroom stall or starbucks and get or find it back the next day. I\u2019ve never felt unsafe walking alone at night(after 10pm) despite being a girl. I\u2019ve never worried that I\u2019ll get shot by random dude cuz he/she\u2019s having a bad day. (not saying it\u2019s common but it\u2019s much possible.) heck I\u2019ve never even got pickpocketed even after traveling more than 10 countries.\n\n2. Culture : I\u2019ve spent my whole life in Asia with me being majority. I\u2019ve never got much discrimination,racism, passive aggressiveness, or being shamed by my culture apart from my teacher in international school unable to pronounce my name or some incidents when traveling. (not that it will be very common in US) I\u2019ve never even worried tiny bits about hate crimes.(again, not saying its common. But it would never happen here where someone attacks me just because of my race) I eat rice everyday, eat what would be considered smelly or stinky in US, and take off my shoe before entering a house just like most ppl in this country. I\u2019ve just never been a minority.",

      "text": "1.  The US is mostly safe and college campuses have a lot of safety features (go on any campus tour and they'll tell you all about their blue phones).  But you can also do a lot to protect yourself by sticking with friends especially at night and making sure someone knows where you are.  I've been a lot of places and honestly felt safest here (well, except Sweden.  Hard get much safer than Sweden).\n\n2.  This can be tough.  But most people, especially in diverse places like college campuses, are understanding and welcoming.",

      "text": "While the US isn't as safe as developed Asia, it's not really dangerous. I live in Peru, but I'm from the States, and I've been to Japan, so that's my point of reference. You can leave a phone or computer on the table at Starbucks in the US and it'll still be there. I still personally wouldn't because Peru has taught me never to do that (it'll be gone in under 2 minutes). \n\nUnless you're in a really bad neighborhood in a city, which I doubt you would be, you'll be fine. I lived in Detroit and the worst that ever happened to me was somebody broke into my car and stole stuff while I was sleeping at night. Here in Peru I've been robbed at gunpoint, but even that wasn't dangerous. They won't shoot you. \n\nIn the US, we're used to having minorities around. It's one of the most diverse countries on the planet. Most people aren't going to even care. A few bigots will, but they'll always exist. Just ignore them. Universities are very open and receptive to minorities, so you'll feel right at home.",

      "text": "Most of the US is very safe, especially college campuses (with a few exceptions). Like in HK, Bangkok, Manila, Jakarta, or KL, trouble tends to be petty theft... or otherwise connected with triads/gangs. The most common concern at colleges is petty theft: laptops and phones may go missing if left alone.\n\nBalancing that: you may try things unavailable back home. Surf porn or smutty tales; buy adult toys; consume cannabis (in many places); read/post/scream about politician's/royal's misdeeds (including those back home); and, protest anything. Nobody will get much upset, apart from organisational issues (e.g. do not block traffic or disturb people studying). (Caveat: the CSSAs may have minders with prying eyes on those from the mainland/HK.) Be openly LGBTQ wearing short shorts with a Party Boi tank top, rainbow streaks in your hair, penis keychain, and glitter makeup; you likely won't be alone and may even get compliments.\n\nIf you're from Singapore, now you can try such naughty delights as chewing gum, going to a nude beach, using firecrackers, having a cat in a high-rise, gathering in large groups, and buying alcohol late at night. Some schools have places where you can spray graffiti. You may even bring a durian on transport (though you may have trouble finding fresh ones).\n\nThe racism and discrimination can be real but are often far less/near nil in college towns or large cities. Issues also tend to be reduced if your English is better. (The SG/MY British English accent or the Filipino American English accent are both seen favorably.) The US is a big country and many places have large Asian communities -- especially most universities.\n\nAs for culture concerns: Much will be familiar. Lots of Americans also remove their shoes in the home. You have also seen plenty of passive aggressive behavior in Asia and will quickly figure it out in the US. You may find less variety in food that you like; some items are harder to come by (kaya, laksa, \u6d77\u5357\u9e21\u996d); and, transport (outside a few cities) is worse. Despite all that, you will do great and adapt. You will likely even find redeeming aspects of American culture. Good luck!",
