  "text": "So basically most of my colleges take 1 letter of recommendation, and I chose my Anatomy teacher to write it. I have a great relationship with my Anatomy teacher and I\u2019m going to be a Bio major so it made sense to get one from him. I also have some schools that take 2, so I asked a social studies teacher. My dumbass counselor decided to submit my letter of rec from my social studies teacher to all my schools instead of my Anatomy teacher, despite me making it CLEAR that I wanted my anatomy teachers rec letter first. Is there any way this can be fixed on commonapp?",

I don\u2019t know why our school does it this way. Even if I do what you said, some of the schools already have my rec from my social studies teacher, so I don\u2019t know if they will take another.",
