  "text": "My friend that my Uni resume has to be \"Stacked\" to be able to get into a uni. I really can't be asked to do any ECAs or to do anything other that the regular school work and some school trips that involve learning leadership and such, the only thing I actually do are German classes after school. A lot of people in my grade join these clubs but I really don't care about any of them. My friend says you have to do them or else your personal statement is gonna be empty and no University would accept me, but that feels counterproductive, making a student do something do something they don't want to seem \"interesting\" I'm also going to apply in the UK if that helps.",

There are plenty of schools that will admit you almost completely on the basis of your grades and scores.  Though, the time investment needed to accumulate a few \"token\" ECs is so modest there's almost no reason not to have an empty list.",

      "text": "Contrary to popular belief, top schools don't want stacked resumes. They want just the opposite. They want a few things that you've made a high impact through. A few things that you've dug deep into. Also, what schools are you applying to? Some schools don't really care about ECs but the general rule of thumb is that top schools (I'd say top 50) want some form of engagement in and outside school.",
