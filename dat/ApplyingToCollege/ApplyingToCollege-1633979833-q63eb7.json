  "text": "The schools that require LoR's usually say that applicants can submit a supplemental LoR. The required LoR's have to come from academic teachers, and the supplemental one could be from a mentor, or someone who really knows you. My supplemental LoR would come from my piano teacher of nearly nine years. Should I submit it the extra LoR? I'm just afraid because I don't want to piss off any AO's with more reading. TIA.",
