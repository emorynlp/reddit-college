  "title:": "Are moving essays too generic",
  "text": "I am writing about my experience of moving from india to the us in 8th grade but that isnt the focal point of my essay, my essay is mainly about change and how that helped me grow as a person and how it gives me a different perspective on life. But i am worried that it may be too generic, half the people at my school say its fine and as long as I write and connect it with growth or a different more broader thing, but the other half says its overdone and generic and not unique anymore. I am almost already done with the essay and I just want to know what to do with the topic. Is it generic or not? Whats your opinion?",

This is a random example (choose one that resonates with you) but an essay where you talk about having to adapt to different traffic rules and street crossings is specific.",

Is that more unique or a specific experience is kinda needed like the example you gave me. Or even some specific about high school?",
