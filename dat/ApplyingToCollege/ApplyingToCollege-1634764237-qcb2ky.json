If I accept their request, is there things I should be removing from my account (bikini pics, curse words, etc) I know this sounds dumb but I don't wanna make a stupid mistake or anything",

Just don't post anything racist, highly controversial, or anything so sarcastic that people take it in the wrong way. I'd also suggest to like stay away from anything political.
