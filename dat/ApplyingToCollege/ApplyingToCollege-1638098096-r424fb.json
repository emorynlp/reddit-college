  "text": "So the world limit on Common App is till 650  and one must type atleast 250 words. My essay has  271 words but I'm worried that it is short and due to which I might not  get admission in the universities in which I'm applying. I just want to ask does the length of the essay matter if the writing is good?.",

Now, maybe it's a perfect 271 words. In that case, you're good. But nothing's perfect, and, even if it was, it'd probably raise some eyebrows. I'd say try and get that word count up higher. Maybe double it.",
