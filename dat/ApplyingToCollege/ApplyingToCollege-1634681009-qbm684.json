  "text": "8 ivies, MIT, Stanford, Duke, Northwestern, Rice, UChicago, Berkeley, Vanderbilt, Pomona, Amherst, and the list goes on. How can all of these extremely, monstrously competitive schools divide the perfect students between them? I mean, if you get all the 4.0 GPA, 1550+ SAT, and 34+ ACT students, adding those with Olympic medals or giant national and international honors, that already cured a disease, how many are them? If they all get accepted to all the T20 colleges they apply to they are more likely to go to Harvard, Stanford, or MIT, you know? I bet that around 20-30% of them make that decision. Then there are the ones who might go to other top-tiers like Yale, Columbia, Princeton, Cornell, Dartmouth, UPenn, etc. That might be other 30% of the perfect students. If they were all accepted to all of these competitive colleges but didn't choose all the same college, then there's still space for us, normal hard-working people, 1300-1500 SATs, international students starving for FA, trying our hardest to be great choices. I'm almost writing the communist manifesto here, but cheers to us, and may this amateur but sincere logic of mine provide hope to all of you having your personal crises right now. We all have our spots in the world.",

      "text": "I think Reddit has totally warped the perspective of the average T20 admit. The average SAT scores at these schools are in the 1500-1530 range, so the majority of kids who get in have below 1550s. 34 ACT might be around average. Most kids don\u2019t have 4.0 GPAs, and many who do get them from grade inflated schools; GPAs are just too subjective.\n\nSo no. Those \u201cperfect\u201d kids do not make up the majority of T20 schools. I know a kid with a 4.0 GPA and 1600 SAT who didn\u2019t get into a single Ivy League school, and a kid with a 3.8 GPA and a 35 ACT who got into Yale.",

The only difference is almost everyone is extremely wealthy and I see a lot more private school kids, many of which are legitimately (not to sound rude) stupid. I say this because I went to a midwest public school and especially in intro classes it's absolutely apparent that whatever private schools were using the 20k/yr from each student on was NOT related to academics.\n\nTo be fair there are many genuinely accomplished or just plain genius students here but they are in the minority. Most people just have decent stats, went to a really good high school, and profited from connections and wealth (i.e. had research internships, finance internships, etc. during high school from dad).\n\nI also think ACT/SAT are terrible predictors of college success or how much you care/dedicate. There are far too many students here who literally just want a degree in economics and do nothing to take advantage of the school, profs, or academics despite their high stats from tutoring (this is a hot take, but if you are raised in a private school environment or have parents that pay for consistent high quality education since you were young, it is almost impossible to NOT score below a 33/1450 on these exams provided extensive tutoring and/or you can probably wing it and get those scores\u2014most of these people have this shit integrated into curricula and take standardized exams for middle school/high school); they literally just pass or get low B's and move on with their life. Of course, they have the right to do this, but it's kind of annoying when you contextualize it with the fact that they went to an insanely good private school and have been spoonfed all their lives; meanwhile some public school kid who outperformed these private school kids, objectively, won't even get looked at by the AOs.",

Not denying it's inequality- if you're rich and get under 1500, there's a problem. But that it's the easiest area to equalise for a determined applicant.

Since they have a full-ride here they also didnt' have to worry much about financials, so got time to study for the MCAT (standardized exam 2) and got a 90th+ percentile score which is amazing.

      "text": "I think it might be helpful to think about admissions from the school's perspective.\n\nYes, the schools are looking for academically qualified students. However this does not mean they are only looking at academics, in fact they are very clear in stating they are looking for a much broader range of qualifications when looking for prospective students. What they are specifically looking for will obviously be different from school to school, and from situation to situation.\n\nIn most top schools they are primarily looking for two things:\n\n1. 'Fit' with the school\n2. 'Make up' of the student body\n\n'**Fit**' deals with a portfolio of characteristics that make up a student's application; grades, scores, ECs, recommendations, essays etc. In other words, from a school's perspective, does the student look/feel like a student they envision going to that school. For top schools this obviously includes academics, but after a certain level academics becomes less important - there are diminishing returns. There is much less difference between someone who got a 35 on their ACT and someone who got a 36. Both would be assumed to be capable of handling the rigorous academic environment at the school. However, someone who scored a 32 might be a little different, especially if the applicant had a lower class rank or GPA. You would have to have some really attractive 'extras' to overcome that lower academic perception. Both Ivies and NESCAC (Amherst, Williams etc.) schools have rules around who they can recruit - colloquially known as AR; Academic Rank. While I don't know what the specific rules are, many understand that students are not eligible for recruitment under AR4. AR is also used for non-athletes, where applicants under a certain AR are rejected.\n\nA 2014 article published at Williams states that AR1 would have the following qualifications:\n\n* Valedictorian or close to the top.\n* 'A' record (4.0 GPA).\n* Exceeding most demanding curriculum (e.g. lots of APs)\n* Evidence of deep intellectual curiosity (e.g. broad range of subjects and supporting recs/ECs to back this up)\n* Passionate interest in particular discipline (e.g. a 'spike' in a certain subject area - AP Calc BC + Multivariate calculus)\n* Exceptional essay (e.g. good writing skills that tell a strong story of 'fit' and 'spike').\n* Strong support from the school (e.g. good recs).\n* ACT scores of 35-36.\n* Mostly 5s on their APs.\n\nAR2 is slightly below that and AR3 will generally place the applicant academically below the bottom 25% threshold. Another article states that around 50% of AR1 students get accepted, and if contrasted with the overall admissions rate at Williams of around 11%, that is significantly higher - which also means that applicants with AR3 and below would have incredibly low admissions rates.\n\n'**Make up**' refers to a general brief given to AOs around how they should fill out the next class. Commonly known things as; race, income, region, special talent (e.g. musicianship) are a part of this. It may also include considerations for donors, alumni and other special cases (e.g. son of the president of a country). This is an interesting area since there is an opportunity for students to identify these areas and communicate directly to the schools; for example requesting an interview with the musical conductor of the school orchestra program - this could help especially if two flautists are graduating seniors and there aren't enough students in the current student body to fill those roles. Having said that, it still is important to have a high enough AR to even be considered.\n\nNow the hard part. There are more AR1 and AR2 students than the number of students being admitted at top schools. If you include AR3+ students with special skills and 'tips', this number is even larger. Hence the importance of thinking carefully about where you apply and when. ED, EA, REA etc. plays an important part because of this. If you're Princeton or Yale it probably doesn't matter when you apply too much (it does a little since Yale admits go to Harvard and vice-versa). But if you're Bowdoin or Williams, you know that a lot of your students have a good change of being accepted at better known schools...so yield is a big issue. You want to lock in a highly qualified group before you enter the RD round. That's why ED generally has a much higher admit rate than RD in most cases; even when considering 'tips' and athletes that are part of the ED round.",

There are way too many perfect applicants among this demographic. Having a 3.9+ GPA, 1550+ SAT and 5 on nearly all APs is just the BASELINE (if you don't have this you are basically immediately disqualified); on top of that you need top-tier awards, ECs, and essays to even have a *chance* at a T20. If you are not an elite applicants, you are likely not getting into anywhere decent. It's fucking brutal, but it is what it is and there is no reason to spread false hope.",

I'd definitely agree, I consider it to be a lot in comparison to 80,000!",
