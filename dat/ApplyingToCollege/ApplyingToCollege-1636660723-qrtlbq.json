  "title:": "How bad do P grades look in non-core classes?",
  "text": "I am a sophomore who plans on applying to super rejective universities (ivies, Stanford, mit...) in the future. Last year, I took financial literacy and gym through my district's online learning platform. The platform is different from how classes at my school were, so I became super confused. I got a P grade in the first quarter of financial literacy because I ended up taking the pass-fail exam thinking it would give me a grade on the A/B/C... scale. I got an A in the class during the second quarter tho (its a semester-long class).\n\nIn gym, I got an A in the first quarter, but a P in the second quarter (I was confused about how grading worked in this case as well).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have the option to do grade replacement. I could redo the portions of these courses in which I received P's. The P grades would disappear from my transcript, and I would get a new grade. Should I do this (considering the kind of universities I will be applying to)?",
