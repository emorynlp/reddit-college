  "text": "Hey everyone I am struggling a lot to decide where should I apply for RD. I am an international student who has 4.0 UW GPA (we don't do weighted) 1350 sat (760 math but planning to go optional) bunch of pretty good ECs (which I believe is my strongest point) with many achievements (won couple of competitions). I don't have any APs since my school didn't offer any but I will take 3 APs this year. And I also went to Stanford's Summer session and earned college credits there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo far I have applied to Umass Amherst(EA), Maryland(EA), Rice(RD), Cornell (ED), UCLA, UCB, UCSD, Texas A&M, Texas Austin, Michigan State (EA), Northeastern (EA), Purdue (EA), Stony Brook (RD), USC(RD), Wisconsin-Madison (EA), Vanderbilt (RD)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I am planning to apply Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, Brown, Caltech, GeorgiaTech, UNC, Duke, Northwestern, UIUC, Michigan\n\nI am trying my chances to get admitted to T20 school. Should I add some other college to my list or is it enough. Waiting for your responses...",
