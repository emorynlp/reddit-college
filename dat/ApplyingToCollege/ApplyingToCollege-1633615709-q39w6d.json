      "text": "First and foremost: Your transcript & GPA & Test Scores need to indicate that you are capable of handling the academic courseload.  \n\nIt's not negotiable.  \n\nIf you are a C- student, taking all standard-level (not honors, AP, IB or dual-enrollment) courses, then it's a hard-pass, not-gonna-happen.  \n\nThe Ivy and their peer-level schools almost all use the same language in their admissions documents:  \n\n*\"We assemble a freshman class from the applicant pool.\"*  \n\nThey want to kinda-sorta pick and choose applicants who are entirely qualified, accumulate into a desired level of diversity, and will represent the institution well as graduates.  \n\nI simplify/summarize this as: *\"Are you interesting?\"*  \n\nIt's possible I am reading too much into it, but I find this blog article really supportive of this concept:  \n\nhttps://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/its_more_than_a_job/  \n\nFurther support comes from this:  \n\nhttps://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying_sideways/  \n\nHow does one go about achieving a level of \"being interesting\"?  \n\nWriting a highly persuasive or emotionally-connecting essay might work.  \n\nInventing your own extra-curriculars and all tie into a good story of \"Why this university?\" might work.  \n\nWriting a New York Times Best Seller might work.  \n\nPerforming poetry before the Super Bowl might work.  \n\nBeing the daughter of the first black President of the US might work (or frankly any child of a global leader).  \n\n-----  \n\nElite-level universities have more exceptionally high-qualified applicants than they have room in the freshman class for.  \n\nMany of those exceptionally high-qualified applicants really look a lot alike.  \nLooking the same as a large array of other applicants is boring. It's easy to lose visibility of 185 applicants who all look the same.  \n\nBut if only one of them wrote an essay that reaches into the very soul of anyone who reads it, THAT stands out as interesting.  \n\nIf only one of them tells a story of how they became a world champion ping-pong player, and started a campaign to start a tri-state annual ping-pong tournament with 13,000 total participants in the first year, that's really interesting too.  \n\nIf only one of them tells the story of making a YouTube channel dedicated to documenting and preserving the artisanal blanket making techniques of their local Native American tribe-members, that's interesting.  \n\nThese applicants are easy to see in an ocean of private school attending, piano-playing, olympiad-competing, my-life-is-a-hardship applicants.  \n\n-----  \n\nBut, that's all just my opinion, I could be wrong...",

But didn't accomplish anything interesting in that role.  \n\n* Student was a MEMBER of a club, but took the leadership role of Championing a major project across an entire school district, county or region.  \n\nI live in a semi-rural region of Virginia that still has strong roots in agriculture & family farming. Many of the farms are dead or consolidated now, but we still have a fair sum of community passion for farming. We have grandmothers around here who will shank you in the parking lot for trying to steal or emulate their Strawberry-Rhubarb Pie recipe. And that grandmother probably lives on 300 acres of farm, and knows how to drive a big-assed tractor. Your body will never, ever be found.  \n\n\nBut, I digress...  \n\nConsider these two possible CommonApp accomplishments:  \n\n\n* President of FBLA Chapter. (Future Business Leaders of America)  \n - Organized the same cookie bake sale like we did last year, and donated our profits to <charitable foundation>.  \n - Invited some local small business owners to talk to us about entrepreneurism.  \n\n* Member, FFA Club. (Future Farmers of America).  \n - Organized Tomato Growing Competition among all High Schools in our county to see who could grow the most tomatoes by weight using only 12 potted plants. Competition was featured in local newspaper, and I was invited to make a presentation at the annual State Fair. I have received requests from two neighboring counties who want to participate next year, bringing the total number of competing schools to 15.  \n\nI just made those up, so this isn't a real-life example.  \n\nGetting a leadership role is cool. It really is.  \n\nBut actually DOING something awesome, regardless of leadership-role is cooler.  \n\nRepeat that for creating a new Non-Profit Organization and doing the same damned bake-sale or carwash that your predecessors did last year, v/s taking ownership of somebody else's Non-Profit and carrying the torch forward, but in a new & interesting direction.",
