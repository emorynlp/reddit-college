  "title:": "Any non-resident Americans feel screwed over by the admissions system?",
  "text": "As Americans who don\u2019t live in the US, I feel like we get a lot of the downsides and none of the upsides. We pay some of the highest tax rates in the world, sign up for the military draft, yada yada yada. We pay for infrastructure that we use MAYBE two weeks a year.\n\nA lot of people think that US citizens have it really easy in terms of applying to American colleges, but in reality it only applies to US residents, and not citizens on the whole. Non-residents literally have to go through the exact same process that intl students go through when applying to college.\n\nNot only does this ostracise us and make us feel like foreigners in our own country, it\u2019s an astonishing lack of goodwill on the part of the government. Why is it that despite millions of dollars in taxes (that we will inevitably pay in the future, and that our parents have already paid), we aren\u2019t treated equally as American citizens? \n\nWe have it tougher, more competitive, and MUCH more expensive than any of our counterparts who live in the US. And here\u2019s the kicker - most of us have NO OTHER OPTION. There is simply no other country for us to go, and since EVERY country subsidises its own citizens, we are essentially rendered stateless in terms of affordable college. There are no scholarships, bursaries, athletic scholarships, no where for us to go but the lenders. \n\nI would argue that Americans who don\u2019t live in the US have it worse than a true international student, for the simple fact that we have nowhere to go. Any international student will almost always have his or her own country that gives them access to affordable education. \n\nWe\u2019re an afterthought for the admissions system, and we\u2019ve been left behind by our government. It\u2019s laughable.\n\nTl/dr: Americans who live abroad are treated like foreigners in their own country even though we contribute millions in taxes",

And even that is no different from any other US citizen living a different state. And no OOS applicant should be salty about OOS tuition if they paid no taxes to the state",

While there may be a small number of exceptions, in the cast majority of cases, US citizens living abroad are domestic applicants for admissions and financial aid purposes; they are not part of the international cap.\n\nThat said, if you have been targeting top US colleges, admissions is difficult for everyone.",

There are objectively far less places for international applicants, we pay more money, and we don\u2019t qualify for the same aid. So yes, ours is a particularly nasty \u201cflavour of bad.\u201d",
