  "text": "I'm from India, I'm thinking of college that I can get merit based scholarship or financial aid from.\nI have moderate amount of extracurriculars and excellent academic scores (98 percent and all A+)\nI've got SAT score of 1370. I may give again in December to boost the score.\n\nI've started looking for colleges online but it's taking me ages to find right ones. Plus I don't know half of good colleges I'm only searching ones that are popular.\n\nI'm looking to apply for fall 2022.\nCan you guys help me telling some colleges that fit me ?",
