  "text": "Hi! USC Sophomore + College Essay Editor here :)\n\nOne of my biggest pieces of advice is to embrace your youthful perspective and student voice. I remember applying to college and always comparing myself to other essays with advanced vocabulary and skilled literary techniques. I tried so hard to sound \"wise\" and \"elegant\". I ended up with streams of words that didn't make any sense. I sounded like a try-hard claiming they have a \"refined taste\". \n\nI found it really liberating to learn how that mature writing is a lot easier than it seems. A mature essay is concise with specific topics with an organized structure. Write with this structure in mind: a specific topic, thorough elaboration, and ending on how it relates to you. Be specific in the emotions you experience and the personal tenants you have. Knowing this, you can write about anything you want, as long as you relate it to why it's important to you. \n\nEmbrace your youth. Write about heartwarming connections, the thrill of learning, our innate wonder. You are so unique! Best of luck! I also edit college essays as well. Dm me for prices, my essay samples, and email :)",
