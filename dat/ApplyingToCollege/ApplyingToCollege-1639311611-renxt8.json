I am trying to explain to people that it is not that easy although I have \"perfect grades\" in their eyes. These universities do not only look at your academic performance. Yes, I really am proud of my Exc as well but idk we are talking abt an IVY league school. What advice would you give me? And should I tell people the schools I am applying for regular decision? I need help :(",

      "text": "Same for me, everyone is so sure I'll get in except for all the other students who are applying to Ivy leagues, only they understand how competitive the process is. I know it's hard not to worry about disappointing others, but at the end of the day you're the only one who matters in your life, and you should put yourself first. It's not your fault if you disappoint someone who has unrealistic expectations. Plus, if they're so sure, they're most likely to blame Brown for rejecting you, it sounds like these people think of you highly and wouldn't think less of you if you got rejected. you don't deserve the extra stress of everyone else if you get rejected, you should take care of yourself first and foremost. After all, it doesn't affect those people where you get in, and next year, regardless of your college, you'll be happy in any community you end up in, with memorable experiences and personal connections to your college. If you think it'll just cause you more stress, you don't have to share your RD college list. \n\nBasically, if someone gets disappointed in you for this, that's their problem. You did all you could and they should be proud of you regardless. Don't put this burden on yourself. Everyone has their own life and I'm sure they'll move on from your college decision soon, they have their own problems to worry about. What matters the most is that you're proud of yourself no matter the outcome. and maybe you will get into brown, who's to say? good luck! :)",

      "text": "It\u2019s time do some emotional planning. Get real with yourself and hope for the best but expect the worst. Know that you did everything you could possibly do but it just probably isn\u2019t gonna work out in your favor and be ready for that. A lot a lot a lot of kids with super shiny amazing applications won\u2019t have decisions go their way.\n\nHere\u2019s a post I wrote this weekend that talks more about emotional planning. https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/r8sjp7/happy_weekend_beautiful_seniors_if_you_applied/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nAnd here\u2019s a podcast from Inside College Admissions from Scoir where I chat about planning for your decisions. https://insidecollegeadmissions.buzzsprout.com/1384537/9651241\n\nThese early decisions can really hurt if things don\u2019t go your way for sure. And it\u2019s ok to give into the pain. But either way \u2014 you got this. You are way more than your college admissions. You will grow and learn and be stronger for it in the end.",
