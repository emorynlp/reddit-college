  "title:": "cc to university transfer",
  "text": "I am a sophomore at a community college looking to obtain a transfer to a state university after this year (umass). I have a 4.0 thus far but am doing poorly through the midterm in one of my classes, calc 2 (c-). If I continue this route I have no idea how this will effect my shot of a transfer. I am unsure if I should continue with the class or take a W to then retake the class. My end grade will be weighted heavily (25%) on the final exam which makes me very anxious. I cannot do anything that would be detrimental to my transfer or federal student loans. I\u2019m not sure how universities look at C\u2019s in a transfer situation but that\u2019s looking like more and\nmore the outcome if I continue. I am also unsure if retaking a class to replace an old bad grade is an option. If anyone has been in this situation before I would love to hear from you. \n\nI have contacted my advisor multiple times and he does not help me. I don\u2019t know where else to turn besides the internet at this point.",
