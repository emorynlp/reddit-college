The teacher who's kind of ghosting me is a professor in my early college program who I only see once a week and doesn't really respond to emails much. I won't see her again before the deadline and she missed last weeks class so i didn't see her then either. Idk i'm kind of just accepting i'll end up at my easiest safeties if she doesn't write it",
