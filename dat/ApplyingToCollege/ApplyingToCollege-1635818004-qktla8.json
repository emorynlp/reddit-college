  "text": "So I submitted my first ED application yesterday and I got access to the portal today. But when I looked in the portal, it said that they haven\u2019t received my ED agreement yet. I think it\u2019s because my mom didn\u2019t submit her part of the ED agreement so I just had her do it. Is there anything else I missed or need to do? I\u2019m kinda worried cause tonights the deadline. Thanks y\u2019all!",
