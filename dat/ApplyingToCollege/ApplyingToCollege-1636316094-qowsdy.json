  "text": "This might be a lot but I can't help but be stressed and worried about my application to colleges because I didn't get the chance to get involved at my school(s) and this year (junior year) I just impulsively decided on going to college after years of not knowing.\n\nMy freshman year, I moved into a whole new state from where I've grown up the past 14 years - I got involved a bit in clubs & volunteered but no outstanding leadership roles. COVID hit in the third quarter of that year, so my school pretty much closed and I passed all my classes with a 3.7 GPA. I built a few relationships with my AP World & English Honors teachers, but they were just awkwardly cut because of COVID.\n\nWhen my school shut down freshman year, I moved to another state and did my entire sophomore year virtual so there was ... absolutely no way for me to get involved or meet anyone. Plus, my mental health declined because of this due to the no social interaction = caused my grades to suffer. I ended up remediating my major grades in the summer tho.\n\nNow, it's my junior year and I'm in the same school as I was in my sophomore year, but I feel so stressed and forced to be in these clubs, build relationships with my teachers for recommendation letter time, get a job, and raise my GPA up to a 3.5 after last year's mess. COVID has really messed up my high school experience because **it's no fucking way that my first FULL year in ACTUAL high school is my junior year man :/.**\n\nI'm interested in going to school for anything music related because it's been a huge passion of mine that I've pursued since middle school. I've recorded songs in my bedroom, built a home studio,  released songs to SoundCloud (over 100k plays in total), collaborated with local artists and producers from across the US and even outside of it, and more when it comes to that. So, schools with a good and updated music program are what I'm interested in. My dream school & program is NYU Clive and I'm just so nervous because I know NYU is very selective, but I also have other schools that I'm looking into.\n\n**Any tips, recommendations, advice, methods? /** **Are colleges going to consider the impact of COVID on my class ('23) when it comes to reviewing transcripts & applications?**",

      "text": "I think the first you need to do is de-stress. It\u2019s really not healthy for you to be extremely stressed and anxious about college applications from now until June 2023. Spend some time doing things you enjoy to destress - playing music, playing sports, going for a run, video games, whatever works for you. \n\nGet engaged in extracurricular activities this year to explore your interests. Don\u2019t do anything for the specific purpose of a college application. \n\nDo your best work academically this year. Get to know your teachers as part of being in class with them. Just work hard, participate in class, and be yourself and recommendation letters will come when the time comes. \n\nThere are thousands of great universities across the U.S. Do a search on a site like Cappex to find universities that have music programs (and other aspects) that would be a good fit for you. \n\nhttps://www.cappex.com",

      "text": "Hey, What\u2019s up, Clive Sophmore here. Just remembered this sub helped me when I was applying so decided to check it, and found this. I definitely relate to your story a lot. I can\u2019t imagine what It was like to go thru half of high school during the pandemic, but i struggled w/ undiagnosed learning disorders  for my first 2 years of hs and had to really work to get my stats up to apply to college. After alot of grinding and advanced classes I got my gpa to around the same as yours by college app season  and wound up getting accepted into clive regular decision in 2020.\n\nGrades are important n all for any school, but honestly having something to show for yourself in music outside of school counts for alot more here. The music professors at clive have a lot of say in our admissions, so your artistry gets weighted heavily and slightly lower grades can be overlooked. It sounds like you have some drive, and it\u2019s manifested in some tangible accomplishments, so I\u2019d say keep focusing on music and see if you can plan something big for the creative sample portion of your application. \n\nBest advice I can give for dealing with that stress is to remember that college is not the end goal, ESPECIALLY in music. Not to speak down on clive, but it is 100% not necessary to succeed in music, and you could honestly be fine at a college in another city that\u2019s good for music, that offers couple good music tech & business classes and/or recording studio access. Honestly, a lot of people drop out of clive after they\u2019ve been here for a year or two because they feel like they\u2019d be better off just making music without worrying about school. And Ive known some incredibly skilled people who\u2019ve gotten rejected from clive and found success still. I say all this to say you don\u2019t need Clive to make it in the industry, or to validate you as an artist. It\u2019s still a great program but you\u2019ll be fine if you don\u2019t get in. If I\u2019ve learned anything in the past couple years here, it\u2019s that nothing is truly worth that level of stress. \n\nI don\u2019t want to write a novel here but I\u2019d love to talk or help in any way I can. PM me and I\u2019ll give you my Instagram. Good luck w/ your music and last 2 years of school, and congrats on how far you\u2019ve come \u2764\ufe0f.",
