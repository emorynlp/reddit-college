  "text": "I received the best in biology award for my level. In the UC application portal, it says:\n\n> **What did you do to achieve this award or honor? \\***  \n>  \n>We'd like to understand what it took - on your part - to achieve this award. For instance: Were there multiple competitions that you had to participate in? How much time did you dedicate to winning this award?\n\nWhat am I supposed to say? Revised every day for biology? Or should I just say that no additional effort was needed?",
