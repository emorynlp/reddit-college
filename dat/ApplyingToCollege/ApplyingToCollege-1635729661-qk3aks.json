  "text": "I didn't know you could add on volunteering awards in the honors section. I had this pretty nice award that would have been 4th on the list, but I didn't end up putting it there. Now it's sitting in the 9th activity in my list, and I've already submitted two applications. Also I made a typo in writing the award in the activity. \n\nShould I email the AOs of the schools I applied to to explain this? \n\nShould I email them about the typo?",
