For example, at one point, I believe Harvard had at least 3 nationally ranked figure skaters (I remember watching on tv and the announcers kept saying \"She goes to Harvard as well...\").  They won't give you a break on the academics, like they might with recruited athletes, but they'll for sure see it as a big spike.",
