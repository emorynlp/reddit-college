  "text": "Hey all, I had a quick question about some of the subjects of my PIQ essay (one is on a STEM camp and the other is on school peer tutoring). Can I also list these in the activities section, or since they are the subject of my PIQ's, should I not? Sorry if this is a bit vague, I'd be happy to clarify! :)",
