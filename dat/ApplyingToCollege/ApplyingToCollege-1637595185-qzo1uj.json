  "title:": "School didn't offer APs until latter half of my senior year.",
  "text": "I am currently a senior in a small, rural high school. I am 1/70 students, and I have taken 5 Dual Enrollment classes. However, I was just told by my principal that I have been offered an online program to take AP Classes and that this is the first year they are offering it. I plan on taking 3 AP classes, but will schools believe I didn't take the most rigorous classes possible? I am afraid it will appear that I laid these classes off until my very last semester when in reality I was never offered them until then.",
