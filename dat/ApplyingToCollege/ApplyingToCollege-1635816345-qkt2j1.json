      "text": "Penn State does not require letters, teacher or counselor. In fact, in years past they\u2019ve told us they won\u2019t even look at them. They\u2019ve somewhat reneged on that at their latest training, but they won\u2019t punish you for not having them.\n\nMost people who have counselor letters to PSU this year is because another school they\u2019re applying to this year requires one and Common App and Naviance are one shots now.\n\nThe most important thing is to make sure you created your myPSU account and completed your SRAR through PSU and submitted OFFICIAL scores if not applyin test optional (and you can change this for a full six weeks after 11/1). If you\u2019re not sure ask your counselor to check their PSU Counselor portal and they can see the status of your application.",
