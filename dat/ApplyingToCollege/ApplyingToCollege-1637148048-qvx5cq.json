  "title:": "Confused about Teacher Evaluations & Personal Statement/Additional Info Section",
  "text": "Hi,\n\nI'm using Coalition App and Common App as I have some schools that don't accept the Common App. It looks like the Common App has its own format for letters of recommendation. Does this mean that my teachers have to complete another letter of recommendation for the coalition application? My teachers submit through Naviance, which my school has connected to the Common App.\n\nAlso, both applications have a section for students to include impacts from COVID-19, family circumstances, etc., that may have impacted grades, however, some of the universities such as UPitt and UT Austin ask a similar question on the college-specific writing questions. Should I repeat myself, leave the section blank, or leave a comment saying that all circumstances were stated in the general application?\n\nThanks for the help in advance guys very grateful for this community",
