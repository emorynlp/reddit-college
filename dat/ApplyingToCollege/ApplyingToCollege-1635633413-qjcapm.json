  "text": "Do you guys think it is actually harder to get into a college if you apply EA because the really good applicants do that?\n\nI am not the best out there. But I am good. My unweighted is 95 and weighted is 99. 1400 SAT score(going test optional), good extracurriculars(The significant ones: worked in research with scientists, robotics, working two projects where one of them is an app). My essay is as good as it can be and my letters are also good. \n\nWould it actually be harder for me to get into Northeastern if I apply early because the best people do that despite the supposedly higher acceptance rate? \n\nAlso, is acceptance rate really different? If you have the best out there applying EA and accelerate rate is higher, but then you have not so great people applying RD so you have a larger applicant pool but acceptance rate is lower. \n\nAlso, I heard that a lot of legacy admits to early so that would get me a lower acceptance rate?",
