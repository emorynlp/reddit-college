  "title:": "Friend Using Your Real Name in Bad Way for College Apps",
  "text": "So I recently read my friends common app and he wrote his on relationships with his friends and family and wrote about stuff concerning me and using my real name that probably wouldn\u2019t be great for my character on college apps. We go to the same HS and went to the same middle school, we share one or two activities, and are applying to some of the same colleges, but outside of that (and the use of my name) there isn\u2019t much linking us together. He doesn\u2019t specify anything after my first name (which is a pretty common name) and I\u2019ve asked him to change it but he\u2019s pretty adamant he wants to keep all the names real. There isn\u2019t a way that this will affect my decision chances right? My thinking was that my name is super generic, there are so many different readers and no one person is gonna read both our apps, and for all admission officers would know he could have already changed the name to my name. I am super anxious about stuff like this so confirmation that this is not gonna affect me at all would be super relieving. Thanks!",

They aren't going to waste time trying to figure out who the other person in the story is. Actually, this doesn't sound like a good essay if it is more about other people than himself.",
