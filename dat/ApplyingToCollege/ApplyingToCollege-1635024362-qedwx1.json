  "text": "I've been in the non-advanced Latin track for the past 2 years because frankly I hate languages and my school required 1 year of Latin and 3 years of a single language, so I just planned on doing 3 years of Latin. Anyways, our Latin teacher of the past 2 years retired and the new normal Latin teacher is horrible. On our first test, I scored a 50 not because I got anything wrong (I didn't), but because I apparently didn't answer the questions in the non-specified, right format. \n\nI have always been good in Latin, so I was considering just jumping up to Latin 3 Pre-AP which is taught by a different teacher to get a grade reset and the class is much better taught. However, at this point in the year, this would show I withdrew from Latin 3 while passing (barely), and I added Latin Pre-AP. Would this look suspicious on my transcript?",
