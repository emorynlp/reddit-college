  "text": "No offense with the title.\n\nI was just thinking and I realized one of my essays was incredibly cliche. Tbh I thought I was *very* original and creative with my other essays, but Princeton SCEA's \"difficult conversation\" prompt seemed too cookie cutter for me. I ended up writing about having a \"vaccination conversation\" with some people on my swim team. \n\nIt was pretty well-written, but the topic and the theme just seems like it's too straightforward. Like there's not much freedom and agency in the prompt anyway right? Like from essay to essay, the convo topic may vary, but how it plays out and the lessons each person learns are bound to get redundant after just 20 applicants right?\n\nI spiraled a bit thinking about it, and now I'm questioning my other essays. My essay on one of my EC's is a... somewhat common EC, but I accomplished more and committed to it more than most, but still... aside from whatever statistics and awards I have, AO's can only gauge commitment and passion from whatever we write. One individual who was more committed to an EC than another will be evaluated identically if they have the same writing ability, right? Anyone can falsify their love of the piano with a bit of romanticization, so what does someone who really loves the piano do to stand out from those who fake it?\n\nI just feel like maybe applicants aren't all that different? We all do sports, volunteer work, do some academic competitions, or work as a barista. Some of us even start a NPO, compete internationally in robotics, intern at a tech company, or do some research in a pharmaceutical lab. Yeah the combinations of our activities, awards and experiences together make interesting stories to tell, but like... doesn't it get a bit bland after enough of them?\n\nLike from an AO perspective (any school really bu especially at a T10-20) I can't imagine mentally differentiating between all the amazing applicants. \n\nMaybe, I'm just actually a shitty writer because I can't avoid cliches and have zero originality, but maybe we're all just not that original?",
