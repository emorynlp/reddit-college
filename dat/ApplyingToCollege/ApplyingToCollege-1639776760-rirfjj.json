  "title:": "Screwed for RD after early disaster?",
  "text": "This past week, I got rejected from my early school (a T10).\n\nI'm in the top 10% of my class, test scores in the 99th percentile well past the colloquially deemed \"threshold,\" multiple research gigs/internships/leadership positions, all that. Essays thoroughly reviewed by multiple AOs and other reputable sources. Good relationships with teachers as well. \n\nIf all of this didn't even lead to a deferral, am I ultimately screwed for RDs where I will apply to similar schools? I know it's one of the toughest schools to get into the country, but is there some massive flaw in my application I overlooked?",
