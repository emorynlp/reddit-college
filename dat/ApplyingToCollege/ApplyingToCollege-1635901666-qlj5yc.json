  "text": "sooo, i didnt really realize that we were supposed to do a video portfolio until i submitted my ED yesterday (ik its optional, but like\u2026 is it really?) Anyway, I\u2019m a tad stressed bc i feel like everyone else has probably made pretty elaborate stuff and im kinda lost and am probably gonna talk abt something random that im passionate about/interested in. Anyway, ig i just wanted some reassurance that other ppl did some chill stuff too? lol",

I didn't do a whole production either (mostly because most people who do that make a montage of videos of them and I don't document my life rlly at all)\n\nI know someone else who is doing a simpler one as well",

Mine is not done yet but I promise will be nothing elaborate. They really stressed that this is about getting to know the applicant and not about knowing how well you can make an artistic masterpiece",
