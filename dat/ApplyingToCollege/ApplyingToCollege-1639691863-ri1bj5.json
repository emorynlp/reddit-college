      "text": "Lol, as a current student at Davidson who\u2019s looked at their review process, I can assure you your level of writing will not make a difference in admissions. Not to say the peer rec doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s definitely one of the most important parts of the application. It\u2019s more about the substance tbh. If the admissions committee can glean that your friend will be a good fit, then the recommendation doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. Remember, it\u2019s a complex process; things aren\u2019t always so black and white.",
