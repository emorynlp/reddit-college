  "text": "Not getting into ur dream school is such a sad thing\u2026 i\u2019m starting to take things too negatively and now my worldview is just like rly pessimistic. I remembered myself as an optimistic person, now I don\u2019t even remember the time I was happy. Just this yr, it just feels like everything got messed up. Not just college apps, but also friends and relationships. Such a drastic change in my life, never been this of a drama. I lived in 3 diff countries and never experienced this much of a stress and depression in my life. If I actually don\u2019t get into my ed college I don\u2019t know how i\u2019m gonna live. Im literally gonna feel purposeless and think that everything I did was for no reason. Literally this yr, I have been experiencing so much losses. I lost quite a few best friends I have been friends all 4 years and it rly hurts. And not getting into my dream college, gonna hurt even more. I just feel like i\u2019m too weak to cope w it. I don\u2019t want to define myself by the name of the college, but I rly cant do that rn\u2026 Just cuz I lost so many stuff that was important to me recently, I just think I can\u2019t lose my dream school and if I get rejected i\u2019m literally not gonna be able to think picture my next path in life and my entire life. My american dream crushed\ud83d\ude43 College admissions is a complete crapshoot. Everything is just unpredictable. I wish college admissions is like tests, where u just need to study and get good grades. Ty for listening to my rant.",

      "text": "The problem is that there are far too many students with excellent grades, test scores and high school resumes to allow all of them to attend a T20 school.  The solution is that liberal arts colleges, state flagship universities, international colleges, and regional colleges provide excellent alternate paths that still will see you to your ultimate destination.  I cheer for the students who populate this site \u2014 and especially for students like you, who have had other recent hardships \u2014 but the extreme focus on the T20 and dream schools is not healthy or rational.  Many of the majors students here are pursuing are actually better or equally well-ranked outside the overall T20\u2019s for example.  And a large state flagship school can offer a terrific college environment, exciting D1 sports, exceptional professors and research dollars, more than 800 clubs and activities, and an extensive alumni network.  Engaged students who attend Clemson, Virginia Tech, Georgie Tech, and Penn State (among many others) are not bemoaning a lack of opportunity.",
