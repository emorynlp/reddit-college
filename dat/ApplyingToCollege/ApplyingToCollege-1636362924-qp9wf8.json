  "text": "Note: This is not to brag or show off! I just have a genuine question that needs my background to highlight my concerns. \n\nSo, I do have a question about how application sectors are ranked. I am someone who always was good with stats (4.0 UW/4.6 W GPA, 1540 SAT, 35 ACT, 15/645 class rank) and I\u2019m pretty comfortable with my honors (National Hispanic Recognition, National Rural Recognition, and potentially the presidential volunteer gold award) but when it comes to things like my essays, class difficulty, and my activities, that\u2019s where I worry. They aren\u2019t the worst, but they sure aren\u2019t amazing. \n\nI did the preIB program for two years, did two AP classes (got 4s on both tests), then switch to dual enrollment for my last two years. I did that because it was the most financially responsible thing to do (receive my AA fresh out of high school for more job opportunities and to skip 2 years of school if I stayed in state), but when I received my school profile, I realized it was ranked below both IB and AP. I already explained why I made the switch in my extra explanation writing area of CommonApp but still. As for essays and activities, I\u2019m not over the moon happy with them. Maybe it\u2019s cause this sub makes everyone delusional, but I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough for the T20.\n\n\nThe worst part is that people who are like 30+  years old that I talk to about this don\u2019t recognize that good scores don\u2019t get you in automatically. They review your stuff as a whole. So I am wondering if anyone is aware of what is calculated/valued more over the other.\n\nThanks for all yalls help.",

      "text": "To my understanding, your grades, SAT, rank, and etc. get you in the door. They use the hard stats to filter out all of the bad students. From then on, your essays are the most important thing. I know people who don't have that great stats but had amazing essays and went to some ivys. I don't think the classes matter that much as long as you did well in them and they are not regular. I wouldn't worry that much. Good luck!",

Good scores rarely get you in automatically. Especially at competitive schools.\n\nAt a safety, they may look past the rest of an application. My daughter didn\u2019t bother filling out the optional sections at Penn State and was admitted the first day.\n\nAt more competitive schools, objective metrics will get you over the first bar. When you\u2019re in the group of 5,000 applicants, from the  original 25,000 pool, that they need to narrow to 2,000, everyone else has the same numbers and the essays, recommendations, EC\u2018s, etc., are what makes the determination.\n\nThere are exceptions, and every school is different, but I think this is the general approach.",
