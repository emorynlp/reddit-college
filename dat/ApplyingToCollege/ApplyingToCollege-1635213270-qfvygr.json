  "text": "Too late to drop the course, the highest I'll get is a C and thats if I get a 100 on every other test and quiz.  \n\n\nWill colleges care if I make the class a Pass/Fail system and the rest of my classes are letter grades?  \nWill they care if I take Calc AB again next year along with BC? Will it look bad that I am repeating it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe I can do summer school but I doubt they would offer Calc AB  \nHelp please",
