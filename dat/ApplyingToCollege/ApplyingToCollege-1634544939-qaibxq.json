  "title:": "So I might get automatically rejected from UNC because of a recommendation problem... (serious CIALFO+CA breakdown)",
  "text": "I set up my Common App account months before application season even started, and organized all my materials during the summer, including asking **two external/optional recommenders** for their letters of recommendation. (For context one of them is a uni professor I did research with and the other is my art teacher from old school) \n\nSo here's the problem: my school uses CIALFO, a partner organization with CA, to upload all of our materials and school recommendations. We were told to NOT invite any school teachers onto the CA or there would be a technical glitch, but I didn't realize that I couldn't invite \"other recommenders\" on my account as well. So last week I submitted my UNC application\u2014without knowing that there was going to be a technical issue with my recommender system. Then two days later my counselor told me that she couldn't upload my application materials and recs on CIALFO anymore and that I would have an incomplete UNC application, AKA automatic reject.\n\nObviously, I start panicking and I try to remove my recommenders on CA, but since they've already submitted their forms I can no longer remove them on my end. I then emailed both of my recommenders and asked if they could withdraw their recs, but they couldn't either. At this point, my anxiety was fuming through the roof and I email Common App support, who responds with:\n\n\"It shows that your recommenders submitted as other recommenders which are done on the Common App and do **not** interfere with your CIALFO. You need to contact your school and make sure your accounts are linked properly to add your counselor and teachers. If your school is having trouble with Cialfo, please have them contact Cialfo support.\" \n\nI forward this email to my counselor, who is still having problems uploading my documents. Our guess is that somehow me inviting other recommenders on CA \"broke the system\". \n\nWe're trying to work through this problem, but has anyone on this sub encountered a similar issue? How did you deal with it? What do you suspect the problem is? Please, if you know anything, feel free to reach out to me or comment here.\n\nP.S. This UNC application is incredibly important to me as I am also a Morehead-Cain nominee, and I've just submitted my application for that last week. I really, really don't want to be automatically rejected because of a system issue.",
