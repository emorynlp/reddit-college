  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nSo I haven't gotten in anywhere yet, but my ED school has a no freshman car policy. Is there anyway to get around this (I have no medical condition/family need). Also the area doesn't really have available overnight parking. Do you think I could just pay an upperclassman to register the car as their own and get an on-campus spot? Thanks.",

      "text": "Parking on almost every campus I have ever seen is hell, so using the car to get around a large campus is impossible. Most large campuses also have plenty of shuttle buses. Road trips are a non-issue because you will not likely have time. Finally, I cannot imagine any older student wanting to stick their neck out for a new student they do not know.\n\nMaybe wait a semester and see if it is still important to you.",
