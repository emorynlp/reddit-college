I'm finding myself running out of characters in my answers, so I often take out some the's and a's to fit the character limit.\n\nFor example: \"perform live at Annual Convention\" instead of \"perform live at the Annual Convention\"\n\nAlso, does anyone know if National History Day (NHD) and Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) are well known enough to use their abbreviations?\n\nTHANKS SO MUCH",
