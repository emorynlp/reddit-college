The course is quite expensive, but I got a full scholarship for that class. \n\nThe thing is, I did not get the scholarship for any academic ability or anything, my school just happened to have some tie-up with the course, so I was one of a few students students that got a scholarship. \n\nI am writing that class down on my EC list, so should I include that I got a scholarship even though it doesnt mean much?",
