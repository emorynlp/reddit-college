  "text": "I already submitted the application for Case Western but I realized that my SAT score wasn't on the pdf for my application. I double checked what I wrote for the question and all it says is \"testing plan: no\" but idk what the question actually was. I was intending to submit my SAT score and I want to make sure I didnt accidentally apply test optional, is there any way to see what the actual question was asking so I can check what I actually responded \"no\" to?",
