  "text": "My school doesn\u2019t announce a class rank but I know mine and have the option to put it on my application if I want, but I only want to if it will help me. My rank is 17 out of 75. \n\nFor reference my weighted gpa is 3.809 and  unweighted is 3.76 and I\u2019m not submitting sat/act. I\u2019m interested in Purdue, UW Madison, IU, Syracuse and Lehigh. \n\nWould it benefit my application to include my rank?",
