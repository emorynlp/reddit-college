  "title:": "Worth applying to colleges in Junior year?",
  "text": "In a junior and I want to apply to some t20 colleges that have early admissions just for juniors but idk if I really have a chance. My grades are decent so far with mostly A's with 2 B's not counting junior year. Did anyone else apply as a junior? I just want to see if I would get deferred or full on rejected. I think it would be good practice but idk if I'll get in. What do the other juniors who are applying look like. Are they the kids who finished all math before junior year and have like insane extra curriculars with research or are they just like your average t20 applicant. Also, I'm an international so wouldnt this increase my chances because I'll only be competing against international juniors(probably not many). I'm live in the US but am an international so I have more recognizable Ecs and my gpa would be easily translated.",
