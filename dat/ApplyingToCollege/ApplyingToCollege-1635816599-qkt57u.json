  "text": "last minute essay panic here.\n\nOn the Princeton ed app, it asks what you want to learn in college and gives you 50 words. I tried to be quirky and wrote about how I refuse to poop in public, and I want to learn to be fine with it.\n\nIs it too risky? or is it a chance worth taking given that princeton is out of my league anyways?\n\nno, this isn't a shitpost... this is actually my essay, seriously\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*edit: lmaooo im getting trashed out here. dw yall i had a backup. no more \"dropping coins in the public can\" i guess*",
