  "text": "I\u2019m looking for more schools to apply to that I would have a fair chance at admissions. \nI have a 3.95 UW 4.5 W, 10 APs, 1570 superscore, but outside of cross country/track and field team and chess club and my job I don\u2019t really have that strong of ECs. I am applying as a CS major and I EDd to brown. I\u2019m also applying to UIUC,Tulane,Vanderbilt, and washu and I\u2019m maybe considering CMU as well. Do you guys have any input on colleges I should be aiming for? Thanks a bunch, would appreciate the help.",
