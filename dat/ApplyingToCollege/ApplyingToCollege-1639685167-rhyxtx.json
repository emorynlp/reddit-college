It's not uncommon for students to appeal (I myself did it too, but for a different reason), and was successful.   \n\n\nThe ability to appeal is MUCH BETTER than having no other option.   \n\n\nIf you applied to other schools EA or ED and you had that same mistake on your CSS, you should contact your other schools that you've applied to ASAP as well.",
