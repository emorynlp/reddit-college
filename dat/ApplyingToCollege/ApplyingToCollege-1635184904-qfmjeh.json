  "text": "International student here!\n\nI\u2019m a 12 grade student in India and I plan to apply at a U.S. university through Early Decision. \nI\u2019d switched over to a new high school after 10th grade. When I contacted my present high school for transcripts they informed me that they could only provide the transcripts for 11th and 12 grades and that I should contact my former high school for the 9th and 10th grade transcripts.\nWhile browsing through the common app, I realized that it\u2019s not possible upload multiple transcripts. This has left me puzzled. \nMy deadlines are nearing and I\u2019ve got no clue what to do. \nI\u2019d really appreciate an advice.\n\nPs: I don\u2019t have a private counselor and am applying by myself.",
