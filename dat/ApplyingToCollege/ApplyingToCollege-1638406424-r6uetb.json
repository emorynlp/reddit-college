      "text": "starting this off by saying a perfect SAT is very impressive. however, an SAT score is a highly-contested measurement of academic skills that represents your performance on one day. A GPA represents your academic performance over four years. A GPA is going to hold more weight in admissions because it shows a fuller picture of your abilities. It's also important to consider that many colleges remain test-optional this year. That doesn't mean that tests aren't important, but it does mean that more colleges are putting less weight on test scores. So does it \"make up\" for a non-spectacular GPA? no, it simply offers another piece of information. I recommend you look at your GPA in the context of the average GPAs for that school; that will give you a better idea of your chances",
