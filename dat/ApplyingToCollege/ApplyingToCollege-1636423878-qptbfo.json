  "title:": "Thoughts on Robertson Scholarship Extracurriculars?",
  "text": "I'll start by just pasting the prompt here:\n\n>\"Please list your principal extracurricular activities in the order in which you feel you made the most impact to the organization. What is different about the organization today as a result of your specific leadership contributions.\"\n\nI can list up to 6 extracurriculars, with 75 words to describe each one. On the CommonApp, I felt limited by the 10 options they provided, but I feel like what the Robertson is looking for might be very, very different. First, only a few of my extracurriculars can be described as occurring \"with an organization.\" (Is a YouTube channel an organization?) Second, I feel like from what I've seen on their website that they want me to paint a very specific picture about who I am from my extracurriculars (and it's possible that the extracurriculars I did with \"organizations\" are perhaps the least consistent/representative).\n\nDoes anyone think it would be okay to type in \"my Soundcloud\" or some BS to come up with a more representative extracurricular for my Application? If it isn't, would it be okay not to use the entire space of 6 options to make a more consistent picture of my goals and my values? If anyone has insight or experience with things like this I'd be greatly appreciative.",
