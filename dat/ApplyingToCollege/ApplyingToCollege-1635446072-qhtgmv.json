  "title:": "four days before ed deadlines and i just removed my dream school from my common app.",
  "text": "my plan was to apply early to barnard and live my little \u201cdream life\u201d of frolicking in nyc while studying something i\u2019ve always wanted to. the community seemed so welcoming and the classes seemed so nice. the professors are well accomplished and everything seemed perfect. \n\nwell, a little too perfect.\n\nyesterday, a barnard FGLI student unintentionally set fire to her dorm while doing her design homework, and instead of barnard trying to alleviate the situation, they instead kick her out of barnard housing for her next four years. she\u2019s basically homeless now. imagine being homeless in new york city. tragic.\n\ncolumbia/barnard have been protesting since then, and this prompted me to ask barnard students about the admin and the compassion for black students on campus.\n\nall of them stated that the admin is bad and the school itself is lowkey segregated. if you\u2019re not white or \u201crich\u201d, barnard will be isolating.\n\nso much for my dream school being a complete fluke. i fell asleep last night and forgot to submit my application. i\u2019ve never been happier.\n\n**UPDATE: I may STILL apply. I need to do extra research on this issue alone. I\u2019ve spent the last four months working on my Barnard App and I don\u2019t want it to be thrown away without further evaluation.**",

There are no T20/top LAC and few (if any) less-prestigious colleges that would do anything different. \n\nWhen a student purposefully lights a fire in their dorm, whether for cooking, smoking, a design project, what have you, that demonstrates dangerously poor judgement. She could have been criminally charged or asked to pay restitution for the damages; being removed from housing is pretty reasonable. \n\nDozens of other students, many of whom were also low income, lost possessions or were displaced from their dorms as a result of her recklessness. What do *you* think Barnard should\u2019ve done to \u201calleviate\u201d the issue? \n\nNot everything is a social justice issue. But if you want to keep living your life as though it is, that\u2019s your prerogative.\n\nhttps://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2021/10/27/low-income-barnard-student-who-unintentionally-started-fire-kicked-out-of-housing/\n\nP.S. you don\u2019t\u2026 you don\u2019t *go* to Barnard.
