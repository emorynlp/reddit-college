  "text": "National Merit semi-finalist applying to be finalist.\n\nOn the application under the section of College and Career Readiness, there's a question whether I plan to attend a regionally accredited college in the United States (which I do) and what college. I haven't received any acceptances so I obviously don't know so would I just put in my ED school here or what?",
