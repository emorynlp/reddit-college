  "text": "The Common App says Stanford\u2019s deadline is 11:59 my local time, which is EST for me, but Stanford\u2019s website says it\u2019s 11:59 Pacific. Should I follow the Common App or Stanford\u2019s website? I\u2019m scared if I submit it a little later on the Common App, it\u2019ll mark it late or something (I know this is kinda a dumb question and I should just submit ASAP but I want as much time as possible to refine my roommate essay, which I procrastinated until yesterday)",

      "text": "I just looked. You're right, they say Pacific time. It's always good to submit as early as possible, but if you absolutely cannot before 11:59pm your time, then I'm pretty sure Stanford will still accept your app. It's just a potential hassle to have to politely argue with Common App and then with Stanford in case they don't initially accept it.",
