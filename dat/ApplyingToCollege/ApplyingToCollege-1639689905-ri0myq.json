  "title:": "Should I apply to Rice?",
  "text": "Title. They emailed me and said they've waived my application fee. Here's what they said:\n\n\"Congratulations on your successful completion of the College Board SAT exams.\n\nYou've put in a lot of hard work to get to this point. We hope you'll seriously consider applying to Rice University, which is why we're **waiving your $75 application fee**. Just complete your application and respond to the fee waiver prompts provided in the Common Application or Coalition Application.\"\n\nI actually got really excited about Rice 6 months or so ago but scratched it off the list because it's in Texas. Anyone have any thoughts? If I'm going to apply I'd need to add it to the other 12 colleges I'm writing supplementals for, but I'd really only have to write one more 150 word essay, which shouldn't be too difficult.\n\nShould I do it? Be a crackhead and apply to one more school (on top of 18 total already lol). I'm weak for a fee waiver, and if Rice is emailing me like this does it mean they're interested in me?",

It's difficult to tell what any specific school means when they message you and urge you to apply.   \n\n\nKeep in mind that they are incentivized to encourage you to apply, since the more applicants they have, the more selective they will have to be, which will feed into both their rankings and how \"prestigious\" the school is seen as.",
