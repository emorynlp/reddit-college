  "text": "I had this college essay prompt for University of British Columbia. As much as my career, my future, my academic interests are VERY VERY important in my life at the end of the day my peace of mind and my happiness is even more important. So not sure what I should write as choosing one is hard.",

      "text": "I wrote a similar one for Stanford and how I approached it was using a figure/ object/ really random thing that seems meaningless to other (a microwave) but is a carrier/catalyst of very special meanings for me (family and giving back). You could consider this approach, tho I would advise you to really look into the \u201cvibe\u201d of the schools you\u2019re applying to and see what kind of essays they prefer. Stanford just happens to like quirky creative stuffs",

      "text": "Hello there!\n\nYour essay is your major chance to articulate the qualitative aspects of yourself to the admissions committee and the admissions committee\u2019s major chance to get to know you as a person. It is an essay about who you are and what you prioritise as a result.\n\nThere is no single \u201cperfect\u201d topic. What matters most is how you construct your story. At its core, given essay is about deep self-examination. This is a difficult concept to put into words. You should sit down and deeply examine yourself. It is about hard choices \u2013 those that have a real cost. What can you sacrifice? What matters to you? What are you ready to fight for? Also, you need your personality to come through and that is why it is important to make your response emotional.\n\nBest wishes in your academic pursuits!",
