  "text": "I'm applying to like 15 schools and I really don't want my recommenders to be forced to upload over and over again. They already uploaded onto my Early Action school, so if I click \"assign\" on all my other schools, will the website automatically transfer their letters without them getting notified or having to do anything?",
