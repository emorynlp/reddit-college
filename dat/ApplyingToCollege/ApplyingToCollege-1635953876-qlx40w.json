      "text": "A lot of schools who track demonstrated interest use a computerized system where they keep up with how often you open emails and click on links, whether you check your portal or not, if you visited campus or virtually visited, attended info sessions, etc. basically any point of contact. \n\nIn your application, for those who consider your interest \u2014 or engagement \u2014 they\u2019ll see it by if you applied early or not, noting if you made any contact with them prior to applying, if you showed that you\u2019d done research in your supplemental questions about the college, if you answered optional questions etc.",

Judging from the ways we demonstrate interest, I would guess that it's a quantitative count of things like how many emails we've exchanged, how many webinars we've attended, etc. I'm sure it helps for the AO to know who we are as well.",
