  "text": "Prompt 3\nWhat would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?\n\nI can\u2019t decide which to write about and how I could possibly expand on each.\n\n1. Handwriting - I\u2019ve always been complemented on my neat handwriting. Teachers have always kept my work because of it and some have even paid me to keep my class work. I don\u2019t know what else I would write other than that.\n\n2. Ability to listen - I like to make people feel like they\u2019re the only one in the room. I give everyone my full attention and respect. I\u2019ve also been told I\u2019m a good listener.\n\n3. Organized - I used to be a disorganized person but through time I\u2019ve learned to organize my things. I would lose everything, spend hours looking for things and now everything around me is in order.\n\nThanks for your help!",

I\u2019ve also done some canvas paintings, but it isn\u2019t something I often do. I\u2019m not sure if that last one would help.",
