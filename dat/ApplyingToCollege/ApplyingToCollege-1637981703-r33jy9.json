              "text": "Summer classes can help you graduate earlier, or just spread classes out more (for example, engineering is usually loaded pretty heavily at schools where you have to average a class or two above full time most semesters, so you could take a class each summer to lighten the load in the fall/spring). If you switch majors later into your college career, or double major, you might need to take summer classes to graduate on time (depends on the school and how many credits you can take per term). \n\nIf your college accepts transfer credits from community college, sometimes students will take a summer class there if it's known to be hard at the university or if that specific class has additional program fees that make the price very high relative to if you take it at a community college. \n\nSummer can also be a popular option for study abroad if you don't get an internship. It's the same length as a regular term, but you don't have to miss the fall/spring term back at your home university. This can give students more flexibility to take a light course load and do some volunteering or take classes outside their major but expand their worldview.\n\n(these are all reasons my friends have taken summer courses, but I'm sure there's also other reasons and it may not be as applicable at some universities)",
