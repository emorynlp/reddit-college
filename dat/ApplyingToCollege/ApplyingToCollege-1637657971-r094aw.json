  "text": "Hello I'm an International Indian Student wanting to study UG CS in a US college\n\nDue to a mix of some of my own stupidity and bad counselling I have ended in a weird situation where I didn't apply in time for fall 2021 session. \n\nI had received admits from UmassB, UIC, ASU, UofUtah and a few others. \nCurrently I'm waiting on an I20 from arizona state for spring 2022 which by all means seems to be a good college (IK i'm very late even in this) \n\nNow my family in no way made out of money(by US standards atleast) but I can fund this whole thing but I am second guessing myself very hard now. \n\nReasons primarily being cost/intake/QOL and ofcourse job/internship opportunities present and future\n\nA friend of my sibling went in San Jose State University a few years back and I'm also considering dropping the whole ASU thing for SJSU\n\nFinding information about overall cost of attendance has been pretty challenging for SJSU\n\nIK that ASU had me show 55k$ \nBut from what I understand SJSU will be cheaper in tuition but pricier in cost of living but finding info on this from an international viewpoint is kinda hard\n(45-50k usd acc to some website) \n\n\nSecondly from my own research spring intakes are shittier when compared to fall intake (less job opportunities, smaller batch etc etc) conversely though if I wait for fall 2022 at sjsu I'll be taking a full gap year and that might be hard to explain on my app and primarily to my relatives and friends (Ik i shouldn't care what they say but it is what it is) \n\n\nThird, I have heard that cali is overall much better place to live than in arizona for any person of color and in general cali is more fun and beautiful.\n\nAnd finally probably the most important piece of the puzzle, being situated in silicon valley SJSU cs program is overall better according to some quora forums I read. \n\n\nNow If decide so late that I wanna wait 6 more months it's gonna be a tough talk but If the advantage of going to sjsu(or any other good college in fall like virginia tech) outweigh going to ASU in 2months I'll do it\n\n\nAlso I'm not sure If I'll get any kind of scholarship cause I'm test optional and wasn't a high scorer in india by any chance",
