  "text": "I am applying to UCLA and Berkeley from a CA community college for Fall 2022. I currently have just under a 3.9 GPA and was wondering if UCs consider an updated GPA after this semester ends. I am hoping I am able to raise my GPA above a 3.9 for decisions but don't know if UCs only look at the GPA you applied with.",
