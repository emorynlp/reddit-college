I couldn't afford my dream school either, so went to state school and graduated debt-free, which I did not think about then but appreciated immed after graduating! While I had one or two memorable professors and classes - where i went to school did not matter as much as who I met, which internships I pursued and how i interacted with others. This was 20+ years ago...today you have so many alternatives when you don't get into the school of your dreams. Do some exploring of the many alternative paths - and good luck!",

      "text": "Hey, I came across this while browsing r/all last night and saved it to make a reply when i could add a little. \n\nI've been in your shoes and did some thinking as to what would make the most sense for 17-year old me to hear. Maybe it helps you.\n\nIt's OK to be bummed. Nothing wrong with taking the time to sit with your own emotions and reflect on the \"why\". Try not live there, but it's okay to visit. \n\nYou've learned an AMAZING lesson about yourself (albeit in one of the hardest ways possible). The more your world grows, the more you get out an experience new people and places and things, the more you'll come to understand just how **rare** it is to meet people that are capable of setting big, huge, seemingly unattainable goals, and then actually doing what it takes to get there. You did that! \n\nSure, you don't get to go to your \"dream\" school right now, but you DID do all the work required of you and then some to actually be accepted. **Don't sell yourself short.** You now know what you're capable of. The more you put *that* behavior into practice, the more it will pay dividends in your life. Take some solace in the fact you have (IMO) the most important attainable skill you can have in life. \n\nThis is something i imagine you've heard and will continue to hear, but it should be said as often as possible because it's really important: **Life** (if it's written at all) **is written in Pencil, not pen.** Things are going to change constantly. You are still super young and learning about yourself (that doesn't really ever stop, btw).\n\nWhat you think you know and want today will 100% be different in a year. If you're living life, and growing yourself, your understanding of everything and your situation will be so much more fluid than you think. When you realize that, and the impermanence of seemingly huge decisions, you can live a little easier. \n\nFWIW, I also was accepted at a few \"dream colleges\". I couldn't make the money work so I went to big state school on full scholarship. I had a month or so where I thought it would doom me to my own 17-year old idea of mediocrity. I was \"stuck\" with 30k other kids that i had at one time looked down on. They were \"other\"; too dumb/lazy/etc. to end up where i just knew i was destined to be. \n\nMan, that was a shitty attitude to have. I had to stop thinking in black and white like that, stop giving importance to things that held so little, (college rankings, etc.) and get the hell out of my comfort zone. Looking back, I think a lot of that happened for me by sheer dumb luck. I'm willing to bet if you put some effort into that, it'll be really beneficial for you.\n\nI look back now at my \"path\" and if someone would have sat down and told me exactly what would happen in my life to get where I'm at today, i would have NEVER believed them. \n\nWhere I live, what I do, What I make, who I love, What I like...ALL OF IT. \n\nI ended up doing SO many things i would have never thought of doing and was around so many new kinds of people. That will happen for you. \n\nOne other thing I wish i knew, is that the more you are hell bent on \"evaluating\" your life\u2014be it with some US news/etc. rankings of college, or the more you live and focus on getting good grades and being \"graded\" well, the less happy you're going to be. \n\nAnd I know, it's REALLY hard for \"high achievers\" that derive tons of self-esteem from the feedback cycle that is academic life and achievement to break through that mindset. Those things are means, not ends. \n\nBut it's akin to comparing lives on social media. You have to life your life for you\u2014not to be judged, or hit arbitrary bench marks. You'll probably feel like that's moving the goalposts or compromising...it's not. It's maturing. (you might already be past that point\u2014if so, kudos, you're miles ahead of where I was.)\n\nThere are a lot of other factual things i could also tell you, like:\n\n* Just b/c you can't go to your dream school NOW, doesn't mean you can't ever go\n* I've never hired anyone b/c of where they went to school\n* some of the smartest people I've ever met and worked with went to schools you've never ever heard of\n* Sure, connections (maybe from an elite college) help, but a good attitude and great work ethic are so so so much more valuable (also, you'll have connections from your school too).\n\nBut the most important thing i think i could tell you would be to **keep your head up, keep your sights set high, and keep putting one foot in front of the other.**\n\nThere's plenty more I could go on about, but these were the first things that came to mind\u2014things may be a bit shitty now, but if you keep doing what got you here they will end up going really well for you. \n\nFeel free to DM if you want to vent, talk more, etc.",
