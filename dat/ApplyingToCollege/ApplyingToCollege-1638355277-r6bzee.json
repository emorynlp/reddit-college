  "text": "I was here a lot (diff acc) in junior year looking for resources, and this is really helpful.\n\nHowever, as a senior who applied to college and am waiting for results, I haven\u2019t checked this sub for a month. Before I checked a2c, I was pretty rational and calm; I knew my chances, predicted possible outcomes, and was ready to accept whatever comes my way.\n\nLooking at everyone else freak out, however, made me really anxious too. Ik it\u2019s my problem that I need to change, but oh is this sub bad for my mental health. \n\nthis might be a suggestion for really stressed/anxious people: get off a2c, try it for a few days. Esp if you\u2019re a senior, checking this sub does absolutely nothing for you anymore.",
