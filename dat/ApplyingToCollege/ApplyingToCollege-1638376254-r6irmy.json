  "title:": "How hard is getting a Scholarship",
  "text": "Good morning all, I want to know how hard/ how common is it to get a scholarship as an international student, for let's say a top30 university. I really want to study in USA but i\u00b4m from Europe and USA universities are really expensive I was thinking of trying to get a scholarship/financial aid and pay like 30% or less of the tuition? How good do my grades need to be? How commonly does that happen?\n\nI\u00b4m not poor, I have what I need (thank god) but I\u00b4m definitely not from a wealthy family and I'm from a \"poor\" European country, so I will not be able to pay the whole tuition.",

I remember on a post about intls needing a full ride scholargrade commented that probably less than 0.1% of intls who need a full ride actually get one. Of course if OP can cover more of the COA it would help, but the unfortunate reality is that the vast majority of intls at US colleges are completely full-pay ones.",
