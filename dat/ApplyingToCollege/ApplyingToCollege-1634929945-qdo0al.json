  "text": "My high school official is not very familiar with the application process. While he can send my current transcripts via the common app, he is unsure how to add it to the common app. Asking my previous schools to email the colleges directly isn't feasible as I'm trying to apply to 20+ schools (tentatively) come January",

      "text": "you would have mostly handed over some sort of transcript or progress report to your new school. Ask them to include that while uploading it in the common app or ask your previous school to email them to the current school and then send all of them together check the college polices though.  If you shifted after grade 10 and did your 11 and 12 in your new school it becomes easier has you will have some sort of external/national/international exam results for grade 10.",
