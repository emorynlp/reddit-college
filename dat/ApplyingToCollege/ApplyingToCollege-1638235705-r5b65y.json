  "text": "I know this sounds pretty stupid, sorry.\n\nI\u2019m an international applying this cycle, and am no longer 100% sure that I\u2019d rather study in the US than stay in my own country. However, I\u2019m not sure enough to actually withdraw my ED application.\n\nI get that in the US, your ED college will let others know that you\u2019ve been accepted ED, so it\u2019s very difficult to back out of unless they don\u2019t meet your finaid reqs. \nIs it any different for internationals? I don\u2019t need finaid so that potential exit route doesn\u2019t work, but if I suddenly decide not to go to the US at all can the college do anything? \n\nOf course there\u2019s only a tiny chance I get in anyway, I\u2019m just spitballing here. \n\nAlso, can you switch ED application to RD once ED has been submitted?",
