  "text": "ok please dont make fun of me if this really dumb\n\nthis is a throwaway. duh\n\n... so theres this. lets say. media that i consume every once in a while and enjoy.. but my little sibling rly loves it consumes it all the time introduced me to it and it ties into their uh like general interests a lot? \n\nanyway so in my essay for a college im connecting my interest in that .. media ... to things in their college. (little sib is a yr younger than me.) anyway so i felt guilty so i asked my sibling if they wanted me to change it (it was a really good and unique and interesting connection, and i feel like that its a lot more imp for them - significant part of their interests and pursuits! - vs me - look at this other thing i am interested in :))... and they were like \"no it's okay id rather you get in.\" i was like WTF???????????????????????????????????????????? NO! id rather YOU get in. like it's honestly just a few sentences in mine but i feel like idk. im scared they might think that my sibling copied me. obv theyre applying in a diff year than me and its not like this is the center of my essay or anything.. but its the same college, and it IS a kind of specific comparison (very specific media obviously and very specific connection to a specific activity).\n\n1. is that deep\n2. should i remove it",
