  "title:": "If I mention the name of an idol survival show in my essay, will AOs think I'm lame and reject me?",
  "text": "This is not a shitpost. For context, I have a very good academic record, so hopefully they won't think I'm not intellectually curious at all. But the way this show changed me and the things it prompted me to do are singlehandedly the biggest influences on my character today. I feel like it's too abrupt when I'm introducing the things I started doing because of this show: right now, I'm only vaguely saying it was some \"show.\" Is it risky to mention these cultural items that seem \"low\" ? Opinions would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",
