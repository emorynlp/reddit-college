      "text": "It\u2019s fine to put on your apps, but I\u2019d make sure to focus on the actions you took rather than the title. It\u2019s extremely common to see people focus on getting the leadership title ( team captain, club founder, president, etc) when AOs don\u2019t really give that much to it on its own. Every one of the thousands of high schools in the US has a ton of clubs with presidents and team captains. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s nothing if you are, it\u2019s to say that what you do matters much more than what your called.",
