  "text": "I recently finished high school in India and I am not sure which Canadian university should I opt for. I got 79% in the 12th class, got 8 bands in IELTS and I also have a certificate for finishing 'Introduction to Psychology' on Coursera. I would like to do a BA in Psychology. I do have a few universities in my mind such as Concordia University, Carleton University and Mount Saint Vincent University, However, I would love to get a few more suggestions, preferably the ones that are not expensive. I would also like to know about the part-time job opportunities in the area as well as the tuition fees.\n\nThanks",

      "text": "Your IELTS score is good but your GPA is decent/above average. Although each uni has different requirements they are the least for humanities courses. Canada follows a somewhat  holistic admission process so other things like your essays and extracurriculars are considered to a small extent.  On the other side If you want to take admission in big and reputed colleges OR universities you must have at least 85% score. Tuition and living expenses vary and scholarships are competitive and limited.",
