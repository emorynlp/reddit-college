  "text": "Does anyone have experience with living on your own while going to community college? \n\nI'm fine with the actual idea of going to a CC, but one of main reasons I want to go to a 4 year is so I can move out. I heard that you can pay for off campus housing with student loans as well, but how does that work when you're going to CC? \n\nI'm trying to decide if this is a terrible idea. The obvious best choice is to stay at home for  a year and a half until I am able to transfer",

Many community colleges will list cost of attendance (COA).\n\nFor example, here are some of the most commonly mentioned community colleges on this forum:\n\nWalla Walla CC\nhttps://www.wwcc.edu/paying-for-college/cost/\n\nSanta Barbara CC\nhttps://www.sbcc.edu/financialaid/2021-2022_COA.php\n\nFederal student loans are limited your freshman year to $5500 total. That\u2019s not going to be enough to live & pay for tuition/supplies. Parent loans can supplement, but obviously you need cooperative parents. You\u2019d likely need a job if you don\u2019t have a decent amount of parental support.\n\nIf your situation is really bad, a part-time job and getting out on your own may be worth it, but it\u2019s not a choice I would recommend unless it\u2019s really necessary.",

If you need a co-signer, you may as well have your parents do a PLUS loan, which likely will have a better interest rate. \n\nIf you go to a 4 year, how were you planning to pay? Were you hoping for need-based aid or merit aid? The situation for CC is similar in a way, just with lower tuition and usually off-campus housing. \n\nA young person starting out with a lot of debt is worrisome. You may be able to get a high-paying job immediately, but large loans are like a noose around the neck - any slip up and you\u2019re in trouble.",

Rather than trying to cover everything myself (and prob forget something), let me direct you to a comprehensive post by admissionsmom. It\u2019s long, but it\u2019s worth the read (and since you\u2019re not familiar with the topic, maybe a couple of read overs). She also has links to other posts that will be helpful. \n\nYou definitely need to start running net price calculators (with your parents at hand or their financial info) for colleges that interest you so you can get a ballpark idea of where you stand.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/q455zl/way_too_much_information_and_lots_of_resources/\n\nFYI - the advice to go to community college to save money almost always assume you\u2019re not just saving on tuition but also room & board. In high cost areas, room and board are just as much or more than tuition. If you don\u2019t live at home, CC may not be the cheapest route depending on your financial situation. \n\nIf you don\u2019t qualify for a lot of need aid, consider applying to a private school where your stats are outstanding (so you make them look good) and that are known to offer merit scholarships.",

From there I'd only have ~$10,000 left, which minus $5,500 in loans would net me a contribution of around ~5,000. This seems kind of doable, honestly. Only if I have a part time job, though. \n\nI'll have to do more of these calculators for some of my target schools, but generally I feel like I'd be able to pay for everything if I have a job while in school. Some of my relatives also may be able to supply me with some support but that isn't too guaranteed.",
