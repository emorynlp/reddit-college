  "title:": "I was rejected from Harvard- Ethan Kim",
  "text": "Hey guys, my name is Ethan Kim. I was rejected from Harvard but it\u2019s all good. College doesn\u2019t define who you are as an individual. And while the rejection stung initially, I know that I\u2019m not meant to be in Cambridge and this is ultimately for the best. \n\nAbout 2 months ago I put out a rap video and while I knew it was a big risk, I knew it was the most authentic version of myself. \n\nToday I was rejected but I\u2019m still keeping that same energy. No college can define who I am and I will continue to be myself.\n\nI\u2019ll be uploading a video soon to the same channel that the rap video was posted. \n\nThank you to everyone for your support and congrats to those who were accepted!!!\n\nEdit: The video is out \n\nhttps://youtu.be/9m-1GCY4nwY",
