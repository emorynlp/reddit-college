  "text": "A freshman at Dartmouth (a '25) has been accused of raping 8 of his classmates this fall (his first term at Dartmouth.)\n\nHe (allegedly) uses his Twitter notoriety and left-wing credentials to position himself as an ally. Then, once people let their guards down, he rapes them.\n\nAccording to one particularly egregious allegation, he just went into someone's room and raped them.\n\nEDIT: more information in a new post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/rf2unj/more_info_on_the_dartmouth_sexual_assaults/)",

Furthermore, over 20% of students are international students. \n\nThe problem isn't \"rich white people\" the problem is people who are disgusting human beings. Regardless of race and income, anyone can be a disgusting person and commit heinous acts such as sexual assault. If you want to blame sexual assault on white people, you're sorely mistaken as the race distribution of SA is fairly even across normal United States demographics compared to the total population of those groups. Why don't we stop blaming \"rich white people\" for everything and try to find the actual causes of problems like sexual assault so we can actually try and prevent them, rather than just using sone scapegoat that sounds convenient. I know plenty of people who have dealt with this directly, including my sister, and the cause of their sexual assault/rape wasn't \"rich white people,\" but a sick human being. You're actually taking away from the victims when you make claims like this.",

On the second point, I will agree that people have high standards for the student body at Ivy League schools that just aren't true. Most people do believe what you're saying in your second point, but not because of \"rich white people,\" but because like you said its \"fancy\" and has the perception that it takes only the best students. While it may be true that there are more \"rich white people\" at Ivies, that's irrelevant to what your saying, it just seems like you're race baiting.

Is being \"deliberately obtuse\" looking at the picture at a whole without feeling the need to scapegoat and blame everything that goes wrong in society on \"rich white people,\"  as if there can never be any other causes? The user was seemingly trying to blame SA at Ivies on \"rich white people\" which is just untrue. If you to talk the entitled and mindset some people at Ivies have, I would agree with you, but that's mostly caused by reasons beyond \"rich white people.\" People here feel entitled for reasons such as the history of their grades. The vast majority of students at such schools were at the top of their classes throughout their K-12 schooling and have a sense of superiority from that, which goes well beyond race or economic status. There may be a few \"rich white kids\" that are here who may feel entitled because of their economic status, but I have not met a single person who is driven by their race.\n\nBeing at one of such schools, I can tell you that \"racial superiority\" is not a thing here in any large capacity. As I said in my comment further down, the majority of students at Cornell are NOT white (they only make up like 35%), and a large portion of the community is international. The majority of students here also receive financial aid. The user was quite literally blaming everything on \"rich white people\" because \"nothing bad can ever happen in a place with rich white people.\" Also, being entitled doesn't make someone a rapist, or someone who commits sexual assault. It may be a quality some of those disgusting people have, but \"rich white people\" or any person that's entitled doesn't automatically gain some urge to commit those crimes.   \n\n\nIf you want to say that I'm bringing in irrelevant facts, or argue against my facts and conclusions based on those facts and my experiences, then that's fine and I'm more than willing to have that discussion. But it bothers me that you're telling me that ***I*** am being \"deliberately obtuse\" yet someone blaming all problems regarding sexual assault at ivies on \"rich white people\" isn't doing the same and scapegoating to avoid the real issue.",

It does happen virtually everywhere whether by students, faculty, coaches, administrators. When I \"googled\" Dartmouth and rape, I found nothing bout 8 women and a student...but did find much about 6-8 students and 3 profs. Also at St. Anselms, UNH, Bryn Mawr. Since I am assuming that students know about or can research crimes on campus, I am always somewhat wary when one school is singled out. \"Withdraw all of the apps to Dartmouth, Yale, Harvard, Columbia, WashU\"...location doesn't seem to have a correlation...large, small. suburban, maga city. Several things do help students feel more confident and competent (being allowed to grow/experience/fail within a safe network of family and friends; education re fears/reason; etc forever. And that is the part that really makes me sad because it is not happening. Sorry, really can't do much more typing on my back! and have a dishwasher screaming to be emptied! But you were right to call it out.",
