  "text": "Rejected from my ED1 school, so now it\u2019s on to ED II and I could use some help...\n\nMajor: poli sci (probably)\n\nGPA: ~92\n\nCoursework: 6 APs, my school doesn\u2019t do honors or anything like that\n\nSAT: going test optional\n\nRecs: good I think? I have a good relationship with my AP eng teacher and counselor.\n\nEC\u2019s: Crew (huge time consumer), work, robotics, i have a website for GIS/election maps, couple other things\n\nSize: Nothing below 4000, above 10000 (loose on this one)\n\nCost: I\u2019m not low income but not high income enough to be out of the running for FA. It\u2019s fairly important.\n\nLocation: Anywhere not in the South. Prefer more urban environments, but one that has a \u201creal\u201d campus. In to anything from LAC to research universities. For reference I like American and Denison (as different as they may be), but could use some suggestions if anybody has some.\n\nThanks so much",
