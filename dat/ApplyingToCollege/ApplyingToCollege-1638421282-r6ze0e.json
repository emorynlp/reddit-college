  "title:": "Not sure if my application went through???",
  "text": "I just submitted an application to a school while the Common App site was experiencing issues through the inspect element method. At first glace, it looks like everything went through fine, as the Common App site marks my application as submitted and I recieved a receipt for my payment, but I've noticed that all of the buttons to view my submitted PDF are missing except for the one on the dashboard, which brings me to an error page, and going into my application shows the questions section as unfinished despite me having filled everything in. Additionally, I never got an email confirming my application after submission. \n\nAnother interesting note, when I submitted I got an error message and was able to go back and look at my questions again, but when I refreshed the page, everything switched to saying submitted but with the aforementioned issues.\n\nWhat gives? Should I be worried? Being unable to view my submitted PDF makes me skeptical that anything's been submitted at all.",
