  "text": "I already submitted my applications with the exception of NYU and Cornell because i\u2019m still working on my essays. I\u2019m applying to a lot of schools because I\u2019m relying heavily on merit money and scholarships to afford to go. I know the deadline is coming up but I can definitely get it done before then, but I only want to apply to the UC schools if at least some of them give out good merit scholarships. If anybody knows anything about that i\u2019d appreciate it.",
