  "title:": "i messed up my fafsa school list order",
  "text": "My fafsa was processed earlier in October and I was going to add new schools today since it was already sent to the first 10, but then I just saw that my state requires me to list an in-state school within the top 2 which I did not do. I just rearranged my list now so that my state college is #2 and I didn't get to add the other schools that still need the fafsa to be sent. My state says that if I update my school choices later to send them an email... \n\nSo do I email them that I changed my list so that the state college is now #2? And when would I get to add the other schools? Would I just remove the bottom listed schools since I only have to add like 5 more schools? And keep my state school and top choice school listed at the top???? I'm freaking out that I won't be considered for state aid now",
