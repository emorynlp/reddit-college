  "text": "Out of curiosity I\u2019ve been checking out the class of 2025 freshman profiles at all the schools I\u2019m applying to\u2026 only to find that the MIDDLE 50 percent of UPenn freshman had an ACT of 35-36. Minimum a quarter of the student body has a perfect score! I got a 34, I should probably apply test-optional, right? I would be in like the bottom ten percent \u2620\ufe0f",

      "text": "Several Class of 2025 stats published show that well under 50% of students reported test scores at test-optional schools.\n\nAssuming students followed the \u201csubmit if above previous 50th percentile\u201d, then \u201c25th percentile\u201d of scores could be 60-65th percentile (25% of top 50%), or higher.  \n\nHistorically at Penn, 2/3 of test scores received are the SAT, 1/3 ACT. If 75th percentile is closer to 90th, and then maybe 1/3 ACT, this means 3%. And these are admitted, not enrolled students, so maybe 2% of enrolled students have a 36. Maybe a bit higher, certainly not 25% of the class.\n\nMany more students submit the SAT. The 25th percentile of 1490 is the lowest 34 mapping (33.5). And again, only the 50% that provided scores. This would put the mid-point of all student around 1510/34, just like before.  The previous year\u2019s \\~1470-1550 and 33-35 likely still represents the enrolled class.\n\nAs a general rule, Classes of 2025 and 2026, at least, are going to be a meaningless mess.",
