This one girl in my school is the MOST prolific cheater i have ever seen, there isn\u2019t a single test, quiz, homework she hasn\u2019t cheated on. Literally almost everyone knows and sees her pull out her phone but SOMEHOW she never gets caught. This girl got into wharton today over so many qualified people and it\u2019s just shocking. Like wow karma just doesn\u2019t exist.",

This girl could very well go on to live a charmed life, never facing any barriers or obstacles that she can't cheat her way around, dying happy in old age with nary a black mark on her record. \n\nThe absolute worst thing you can do is worry about it. Nothing sucks the joy out of life faster than anger and envy.\n\nFocus on you. It's nearly time for winter break. Kill your last finals, and then find something fun or relaxing to do. Enjoy your best mates and the time you have left with them before you all scatter to the four winds. Don't spend your energy worrying about someone else.\n\nYou got this.",

      "text": "Well... for one: *Wharton*. There's a reason they have the reputation they do. Second, I would not worry: interviews usually crush people like her. That's not to say she won't find a way to do well. However, she will learn very quickly that some opportunities are off-limits to her because she doesn't actually know her stuff. Also, she will likely get caught cheating because university work needs a bit more creativity -- so cheating stands out more clearly.\n\nKarma exists, but it is like the river wearing away at the bank of a curve: relentless and crushing but slow. In the meantime, enjoy that you are living a life you are proud of and not one where you would be ashamed of your \"accomplishments.\"",

Maybe she can but at the end of the day all of our achievements are gonna be a small part of whole humanity no matter how big they are and so will our mistakes. All that will matter is how you lead your life and at the deathbed you would be proud to see that you did everything honestly and gave your best; the other person would not feel this once in a lifetime satisfaction(dark humor cuz who can feel after death xD). I know it hurts but try to chill and ignore her. Focus on you and let the winds carry you.",

Admissions offices don't have perfect knowledge.  It's not a justice system.\n\nThat doesn't make admissions a scam, and it doesn't make ivy acceptances a scam.  Sometimes people get in who don't \"deserve\" it (for various reasons), and that should not diminish the happiness or pride others should feel if they got the acceptance they were hoping for (and earned honestly).\n\nSystems can have flaws -- flaws that we want and need to be fixed -- and still largely work in the way they are intended.",
