  "title:": "I Couldn\u2019t Submit my Transcript, it Was a Struggle",
  "text": "So as the title says, one college I applied to wouldn\u2019t let people submit a transcript (you only can send them in once you\u2019re accepted) and I had to enter in every class I took. One by one. Some of my classes have weird categories or some were summer teaching assistant credits so it was a cluster. I had a mix of semesters, and quarter things and then Covid messed up two years (Pass fail sophomore year and the summer in between). \n\nNeedless to say I had to edit the self reported academic stuff maybe 5 times (3 were due to my schedule changing last minute this year) because of the way they wanted me to apply.",
