  "text": "My son took a course in a local community college last summer. He reported it incorrectly in the college application (reported it as a 3 credit course instead of 1 credit). His high school course credits and grades are (self) reported correctly. How does he contact the colleges now and correct it? He is checking with his high school counselor. Will it have repercussions on his admission? Thanks.",
