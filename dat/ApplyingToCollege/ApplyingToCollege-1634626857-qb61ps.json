  "text": "Hope you are doing well in your application process, I know my experience has definitely been better than others I have seen on here. Quick question about a remedial course I am taking.\n\nI was struggling with personal issues during my sophomore first semester, getting a D in English Honors. I am currently taking a UC Scout remedial course, and got the course approved by my Principal and Counselor. If I don\u2019t finish the course before I submit, but before my school sends in scores, what would happen? This is sort of a weird situation so there are probably dozens of possibilities dependent on when I finish the course\u2026",
