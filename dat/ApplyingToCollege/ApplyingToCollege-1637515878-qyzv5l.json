Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app, with an option in the portal to report or update scores \u2013 self-reporting is faster. Other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission.",

If the college's website indicates that they accept scores from the Nov test date, you might want to let them know to expect them. (When in doubt, ask the college admissions office.)",
