      "text": "[https://money.com/fafsa-listing-colleges/](https://money.com/fafsa-listing-colleges/)  covers it pretty well.\n\nThe short version is it used to matter because the department of education would send the list of schools in the info, and schools would abuse that info to try to improve yield (and violate federal privacy laws doing so).  They now no longer send that info, so it doesn't matter other than for state aid. \n\nEven if your state says it doesn't matter, I would still list your public in-state options first.",
