  "title:": "How do y'all celebrate achievements without feeling like you're bragging?",
  "text": "Title.\n\nFor background context, I go to a pretty small public school - my class is like 50-55 kids. I haven't done anything super impressive on the a2c scale, but I did quite well on the SAT, most AP tests, PSAT, and have gotten 100s on all my calc bc quizzes/tests so far this year. I also had a cool internship this summer.\n\nAnyway, the few times that these things come up in conversation, I always feel like I'm humble bragging, even though I'm specifically trying to avoid that. In almost every case, I'm not even the one who brought up test scores/other achievements. How do you guys avoid feeling like you're humble bragging? Do you have friends that have similar achievements, or do you just not talk about them unless really pressed? Or are people just impressed and happy for you without thinking that you're bragging? \n\nIt doesn't really feel good to hide stuff, especially when they're things that I'm proud of, but I hate feeling like I'm showing off or flaunting my test scores/other achievements. Sometimes I feel embarrassed to have done well at certain things simply because my friends/classmates didn't do as well, and I feel like that's not healthy.",
