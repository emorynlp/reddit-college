  "text": "I'm stuck. I can't choose a topic to write about. I can't fully plan out my essay\n\nI'm thinking about writing how I'm not physically flexible at all compared to everyone, and then somehow connecting it to my life or using it as a metaphor. Maybe showing how I'm different in many aspects. IDRK\n\nOr\n\nLife experiences with being friendly to others, either joking around with the deli owner becoming friends with him while I make my friends laugh, including the new/shy kid making jokes with him making him laugh, making him feel comfortable.\u00a0\n\nOr\n\nStarting my own business, the challenges I've faced, what I learned\n\nCan y'all shoot me some ideas of how to plan out these essays, or which one I should write about. I personally believe the 1st one can be good If I could think of a way to connect not being flexible to a bigger picture. Maybe I can connect all these topic into one essay?",

Imo if you focus on one interesting and unique story surrounding a challenge that you overcame it could work well for common app prompt #2.",
