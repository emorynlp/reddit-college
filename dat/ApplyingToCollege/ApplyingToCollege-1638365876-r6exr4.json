  "title:": "Beyond the basics, why would you most be excited for an EA/ED acceptance?",
  "text": "Besides the obvious stuff like going to my dream school and not doing RD apps, I'd be most ecstatic about:\n\n1. Finally being able to tell people where I'm going to college. I get asked ALL THE TIME and I'm tired of saying \"I don't know\"\n2. Not having to use \"if\" anymore. There is so much stress and hope and fear involved with saying \"If I get accepted...\" I never want to have to say it again for the rest of my senior year\n3. MERCH\n4. Planning my dorm decor\n5. Contacting other people who got in and making new connections",
