  "text": "Hey there guys! Are there any incorrect answers to an essay prompt? My main worry is about the \u2018Why us\u2019 essay. So let\u2019s say there\u2019s a prompt asking about what opportunies of this school most appeal to you. In that case, is it okay if I answer with only ONE opportunity that I\u2019m obsessed with and not go on talking about classes/professors etc\u2026\n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion on this guyss?",

      "text": "For \"Why college?\" essays, do not write general things like \"the area is good and I want to be with motivated students and stuff\". You have to go on their websites, look for programs you would be interested in, labs you would be interested in joining, clubs you would be interested in, maybe even professors you would want to work with, etc. So many things about a specific school you can write about. It takes a lot of work to do for each school, but it makes it easier to write a better essay.",
