It\u2019s only in one sentence, but I figured the medical reason was a more legitimate thing to overcome then \u201cpeople discouraged me [from activity my commonapp essay is about] because I\u2019m not inherently gifted\u201d",

              "text": "There is a wiki at the top of the subreddit with essay help.\n\nIn the big picture, keep in mind that the essay is an opportunity to sell yourself to the admission officers. Think of one or two personal qualities that you would like to display to admissions. Then think of a story or anecdote which shows those qualities.\n\nThere is no requirement that your essay be about overcoming challenges. Overcoming challenge essays can be difficult to do well.",

I was just looking for help on whether or not I needed to provide documentation for a condition, or whether it\u2019s relevant at all. I wasn\u2019t looking for essay help. Thank you though.",

Students who write essays about their trip to France don't have to prove theyve ever been to France. So if you mention your essay that you have a health condition, you don't have to prove that either.",
