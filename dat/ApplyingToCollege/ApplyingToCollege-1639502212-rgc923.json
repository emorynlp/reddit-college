  "title:": "Letter to self for after ED decision (if rejected)",
  "text": "No matter what the letter said, know that you did your best. You spent months and hours pouring your heart into your essay, you have done everything you can in terms of ecs, grades and scores. \nBut even more than that, you are not defined by this. Just because they didn\u2019t want you doesn\u2019t indicate your intelligence or your capabilities. You have done so much, continually trying to improve yourself: academically and personally. \nThe growth you have had as a person and student is something no rejection letter can take away. \nYou will end up where you are meant to be and if it isn\u2019t here, that\u2019s fine because there are better things coming your way. \n\nXx",
