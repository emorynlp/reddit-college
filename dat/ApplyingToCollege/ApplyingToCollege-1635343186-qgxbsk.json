  "text": "I've been looking into the Collegevine's chancing for a while. After putting in all the grades. ECs, and test scores, it showed a 60% chance at a specific college. Now, if my common app essay is bad/avg, but my stats are better than the 75th percentile, is there still a fair chance that I'll get rejected? I need partial financial aid and the college has been generous enough in the past few years with my seniors.",
