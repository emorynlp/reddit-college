  "text": "Bro, what the fuck, she charged you $70 just to ask her out? And you actually paid it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDude, actually though, what the fuck, you DM'ed 4 paragraphs about why you two would be perfect together, and she doesn't even know who you are? Actually bro, you're simping to the max.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDude really, stop refreshing the portal and go to bed. She's left you on read since November. She isn't into you. Besides, she's talking to 100,000 other applicants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway in all seriousness I'm pretty nervous for my UC decisions, just hoping I get into Santa Cruz. Hope y'all get in where you want!",
