  "title:": "Is a lopsided SAT score good or bad?",
  "text": "Let's say (definitely hypothetically) an overall score of 1380 but a split of 770R&W/610M.\n\nBetter than a 690R&W/690M because colleges see that you *can* get a high SAT score... in reading. Or bad because colleges see a clear \"weakness\" in mathematics. Maybe it depends on the college?\n\nWhat about the inverse 610R&W/770M?",

That's all I know. And even this is not confirmed or anything, just quoting something I read on here some time ago.",

      "text": "I suspect a split is better if it aligns with what you intend to study.  If you want to study math then a 800M/600V probably serves you better than a 700/700.  If you want to study English literature or history then a 600M/800V probably serves you better than a 700/700.",
