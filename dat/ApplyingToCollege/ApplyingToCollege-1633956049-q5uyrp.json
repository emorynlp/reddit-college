It can be very difficult and you will have different graduation requirements for all 3 majors, even if there is some overlap between the subjects. You will also probably not graduate in the normal 4 years it takes for college, because you will probably have to take on 3-4 extra classes on top of a full course load to even meet minimum graduation requirements. \n\nDoing a triple major really has no benefit imo, it just seems you want to do it for bragging rights based off of your post history? Nah don't do that. \n\nFocus on something that you are interested in. And exceed in that, instead of trying to do everything at once.",

In almost all cases, language courses don't even count for the major. It is highly **highly** unlikely that you studied Dante in the same depth in HS. That's like saying American students can breeze through an English major because they read Hamlet in HS. It does not work that way.\n\nProficiency in Italian may be beneficial after college, but you don't need to major in it\n You can take a few Italian courses to supplement your knowledge if you desire.",

You may breeze through the conversational part, but often these classes require studying the linguistics of the language. There are all sorts of grammatical rules that you would implicitly know to follow as a fluent speaker, but not actually be aware of or be able to explain. The linguistic aspect of the class will require you to learn all these rules and their terms. I don\u2019t know anything specific about Italian, but I have many friends (being from California) that are fluent in Spanish and took Spanish classes in college expecting it to be easy, only to realize \u201cI can speak Spanish, but I don\u2019t *know* Spanish\u201d.\n\nThat being said, it\u2019s not like the classes would be insanely hard either.

A third major in Italian (the other two would be in scientific subjects) would basically cost me nothing in terms of studying. It might cost me a little bit in terms of assignments and project, but I\u2019ve covered ALL the topics, authors, etc. here in Italy during high school\u2026 That\u2019s why I was thinking about triple majoring. An italian major would allow me to teach italian and to take the examination in order to teach in US schools.",

A triple major at a T50? you're going to go through 4 years of hell in pursuit of something that probably won't help you very much when you graduate and go to grad school or look for a job. unless the majors are, like, computer science, computer engineering, and data science, where the overlap makes it so that you only have to take a few extra courses (in which case it's pointless because a degree in any of those could get you a job in any of the three), you are going to die if you pursue a triple major.

Ex: double majoring in CS and fine arts may require you to complete 80% of normal CS coursework and 60% of normal fine arts coursework) \n\nBut either way, triple majoring is not a wise decision.  Since no matter the ratio of course works, you're not gonna use them all anywhere in the life ahead.  \n\nIt's like giving college free money for something you can't even utilize in future.  \n\nAlso, I'm pretty sure you don't have any idea how tough college subjects are compared to HS. You'll exhaust yourself with overwhelmed syllabus by around junior year.\n\nIts a silly question from both: academic as well as career point of view.  \n\nInstead of being average in 3 subjects, its better to master one :)",

I'd recommend looking at the Italian programs at schools you're interested in and seeing what requirements there are\u2014some schools have heavy cultural or linguistic components to majors in Romance languages. Also keep in mind that occasionally, schools won't even have an Italian program (generally some of the smaller ones.)\n\nIf you love Italian, go for it!
