  "text": "I have no idea what college i want to go to, but I do know that I want to go to a community college. And while searching for community colleges all I could find were colleges offering degrees in associates in art for psychology. Im wondering if I could just get a AA degree for transfer while after words getting a bachelors in science in psych. Once I transfer to unviersity. Can I do that if im mostly going to just fill out gen ed requirements while at community college? And of no can anyone offer community colleges in california that offer a associates in science degree for psych? Or should I just go straight to university? Thanks. ^-^ \n\n(srry for the post being long.)",

You should be able to find a lot of info on UC websites.",

You could consider doing courses online. A branch campus of the university you hope to attend could be a good option, and offer online courses.",
