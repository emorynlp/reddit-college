  "text": "I submitted my CSS Profile and it says I need my father to fill out an application as well (My parents are separated and I live with my mom, not my dad.) An email was sent to him with instructions on how to fill it out and the second step is for him to create his own college board account. So he is trying to do this but it is mandatory for him to put in his high school graduation date (or equivalent). The problem is he dropped out of high school and never went back to get a diploma equivalent or anything. Should we just put in the date he was supposed to graduate, or something else?",
