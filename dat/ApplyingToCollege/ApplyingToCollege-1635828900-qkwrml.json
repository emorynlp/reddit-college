      "text": "Relax. Once submitted, stop reading it!\n\nAlso, I am noticing a trend on this chat board with suggestions to email the college AO with every little issue. Before you email an AO, pause and think if it is a big issue.

Before emailing determine if the issue is big enough to outweigh potentially annoying the AO/being viewed as being too tightly wound.",
