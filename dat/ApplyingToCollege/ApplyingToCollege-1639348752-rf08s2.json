For me, I'm really enjoying lit hum because my professor is awesome, but that's not necessarily true for everyone",

My suggestion is to just do what you are interested in and whatever passion comes out of that will show in the app (no point in trying to gear your whole life to what you think columbia might like)",

The list questions are good for this\n\n\\- Find (genuine!) things about Columbia that are not related to the core and NYC to talk about, because everyone will say those two\n\nFav book questions + list\n\n\\- It's a really good opportunity to show a variety of interests - see above\n\n\\- We all tried to write things that were at least sort of niche but reinforced things we talked about in the rest of the app. Like if you're interested in physics it is nice to have some maybe non-technical physics readings to reinforce that point\n\n\\- Show that you are not boring (especially with entertainment)",
