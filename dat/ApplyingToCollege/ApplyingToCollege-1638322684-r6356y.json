  "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI am a senior in high school who has applied to many schools during the November 1st date for most early action deadlines. My parents got divorced during the pandemic and my dad was expected to pay for my college tuition. Though over time, circumstances have changed and he is refusing to pay for my tuition or fill out the CSS profile. Many of my schools require a W-2 and Federal Tax Return Form from non-custodial parents, but only if the circumstances are extenuating (parent has never had contact with their child, etc). I have tried many times to get the needed documents for the non-custodial part of the CSS Profile, but no luck. At this point, I have a deadline next week and am thinking of filling out the Non-Custodial Form given by College Board for these situations. Though they specifically state that they will not review applications where the parent refuses to fill the CSS Profile out, I do not know what else to do. My other attempt is to just leave the non-custodial side blank, but I think my application would get flagged as incomplete and it wouldn't be reviewed. My mom is a single mom and I don't want to ask a bunch of questions she has no answer to, so I thought I would ask on here. Any information would be helpful, thank you!",
