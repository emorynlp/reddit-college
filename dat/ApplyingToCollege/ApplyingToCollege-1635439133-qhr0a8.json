  "text": "I don't have an essay about my sexual/gender identity. The only things that really indicate that I'm part of the community are my pronouns and check on the non-binary box. I'm pretty open about it so it's not an issue for me to write about this aspect of myself. Should I still talk about this in the additional info section? If so, how should I approach it?",

I mean you probably wouldn't be applying to Baylor but you would still want to keep into account that people will have lots of different political views. so if you briefly mention it as something that shapes your identity or something you struggled with, that would be okay",
