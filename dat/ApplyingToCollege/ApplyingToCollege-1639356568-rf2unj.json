My apologies. I did not mean to discount sexual assault in the rest of the world, nor to imply that I am na\u00efve to the evils of the real world (although I certainly see how it was interpreted as such.)\n\nOne of the victims posted their account on Librex (a completely anonymous public social media app for ivy league discussion.) Attached [here](https://imgur.com/a/vUDLEiJ) are screenshots of their account.",
