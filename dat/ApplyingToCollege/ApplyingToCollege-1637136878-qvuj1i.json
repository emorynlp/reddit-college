  "text": "Hey guys, I'm a Korean 16-year-old who has taken the \uac80\uc815\uace0\uc2dc(South Korean GED). I plan on going to a 4-year college directly with the \uac80\uc815\uace0\uc2dc and getting high SAT scores, and plan to do  Volunteer work as well on getting certifications(possibly Computer Language, but I plan on a different major). However, I'm kinda worried on getting recommendations since I dropped out of HS immediately. Can I possibly get my recommendations from my middle school teachers or any tips otherwise?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. My parents suppose I go into a 4 year and tell me to apply to CC as a last resort. Also I'm a US citizen, so I'm also curious about TOEFL, as my first language is Korean. Does college require TOEFL scores for US citizens that their first language is not English?",
