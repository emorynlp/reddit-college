Two days ago, I brushed an emulsion of salt and egg whites onto a piece of cotton paper, and today I coated the paper with silver nitrate and made a print. After rinsing it in fixers and water baths, I saw a picture emerge in shades of gray and brown: an albumen print, produced with an arduous but exquisite nineteenth-century process that enables the photo to last a hundred years without decomposing. Yet the albumen process does more than preserve the moment captured by a camera\u2014the connection I build with each photo fully transcends any sort of digital point-shoot-print photography experience.\n\nThe first albumen print I made was the silhouette of a seagull in the sky. Taking out the exposed print, I submerged it in gold solution under the darkroom\u2019s safelight. The photo effused nostalgia as I reminisced about that late fall afternoon on Smathers Beach in Florida, chasing the seagulls, camera in hand, while my mother laughed and watched me from the shore.\n\nWhile I meandered back to the past, the image moved forward, metamorphosing. With gray gradually replacing its eggplant tint, the seagull suddenly seemed dynamic, as if no longer bound by the paper. The picture conveyed a newfound sense of freedom\u2014an epiphany revealing how fluid a photo\u2019s interpretation could be. I discovered, after the excess chemicals washed off, an image with unfettered spirit and soul. I saw how the chemical reactions developed an image\u2019s meaning as well as the image itself\u2014its mood changed, its message changed\u2014and I heeded the call to discover which parts resonated with me the most.\n\nSeveral weeks later, I finished drying my fifth albumen print, \u201c*Sailboat and Sunset,*\u201d and examined it under the studio light. Seeing how the density of the silver grains varied throughout the picture, I lightly rubbed its darkest and lightest hues, the sea and the sky, and felt that the former was thicker than the latter. The smooth texture of the undulating waves, I noticed, would have been masked by the bright sunset in the colored digital version. Reexamining the albumen photograph in its entirety\u2014the triangular sailboat floated still, forever eclipsing the circular sun right above the horizon\u2014I found a serenity I could see *and* touch.\n\nThe engagement of multiple senses, therefore, leads me to view albumen printing as a process, not a method; it\u2019s like an amble along an undefined path. For this reason, I prefer writing freely on paper to typing, because I can feel the paper\u2019s softness through the pen\u2019s tip as I ponder my faith in and relationship with society. Words flow out line-by-line, and my ideas spill out in all directions. Similarly, when designing mechanical works like robotic cars, I often hand-cut components from woodblocks. Instead of using a band saw, I trace the lines on each woodblock with a knife before making an irrevocable cut. The blade nips the grain, and new ideas about the design and shape of my car arise: an indent here, a concave there, perhaps a wedge\u2026*somewhere*? I cherish the intellectual process of approaching my work as a creator-craftswoman in these moments of quietude and self-reflection.\n\nNowadays, with digital photographic software, it takes only a second to select a filter, a second to add new effects, and a second to forget the picture because it comes too easily. Albumen prints, however, are deliberate but enduring. I prefer this laborious process for the new perspectives it offers and the intimacy I build with each work. It distills moments from my life into a cherished part of me, like the silver grains embedded in the albumen paper, which will neither be contaminated nor washed away\u2014physically or spiritually. The process of life, the day-to-day living, is each silver grain falling into place.\n\n**Recipe 1 - Analysis & Thoughts**\n\n[\\\\\"Tuna Roll Recipe\\\\\" by Nicole, 2021 \\(https:\\/\\/www.instagram.com\\/nehcole.wrong\\)](https://preview.redd.it/mfzbqlglkku71.png?width=1230&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b72cde1d039fac93370bf326f400d386af1ddbf)\n\n*This student was accepted to Princeton University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and Columbia University (Egleston Scholars1).*\n\nCooking and essay writing are similar: with making any dish, we should always examine our ingredients. Think of nouns, verbs, and adjectives as different ingredients: there is no *singular* correct way of making these analogies, so let\u2019s just say nouns can be rice, verbs can be the meat/fish, and adjectives are the vegetables.\n\nToday we will be making sushi.\n\nWhen I asked my student to pick the dish she thinks her essay most resembles, she replied:\n\n\u201c*This sushi chef Kodai made me this roll with daikon*2, perilla leaves*3*, and otoro*4*. He made this randomly at the end of dinner (because I was still a bit hungry), but I found it more delicious than anything else in the omakase*5*. Definitely not the fanciest piece of sushi, but something connected the fish, the daikon, and the leaves to make it \\[incredibly\\] tasty.\u201d\n\nLet us imagine we have never eaten sushi before. We have some raw fish, a pickled radish, a weird looking leaf, and some seaweed. For anyone who has never tasted sushi, it may not be very appealing at first sight. Yet as we read the essay further, we begin to see how each ingredient, when combined, culminates in a beautiful taste that leaves us completely satisfied. We do not seek more by the end; we seek to simply savor the flavor of the essay. In other words, there is joy in imagining the many ways we can dissect or analyze this beautiful experience that has now arrived at its conclusion.\n\nThe essence of a delicious dish does not require millions of fancy ingredients. We do not need to add caviar6 to foie gras7 to a Wagyu ribeye steak. That is too excessive, and for most respectable chefs and diners, wasteful (*I think this appeals more to people who want to splash money, not to spend money in order to understand culture. Please do not read this as criticism\u2014perhaps it is just a personal opinion*). Restaurants that serve these kinds of dishes care more about money and image than taste and culture.\n\nSometimes we just need to focus on the core ingredient\u2014the fish\u2014and to complement it with other ingredients that are of high quality and suit the flavor profile. To maximize the delicate, exquisite aroma that fatty tuna offers, we should surround it with the correct secondary items. These secondary items of daikon and perilla, while not as celebrated as the \u201cprimary\u201d ingredient, are just as essential, owing to people\u2019s tendencies to neglect them. Moreover, I would argue that they would also result in a better otoro sushi roll compared to adding ingredients such as truffle and gold flakes.\n\n*(What is fascinating about the way this dish is presented, is that it is not in its nigiri form, but served as a roll. The roll8 is the humble basis of most sushi, and like for most Japanese and first-time sushi eaters, my first encounter with sushi was neither sashimi nor nigiri, but rolls).*\n\nWhat makes this essay great is that it does not scream or shout or boast. It is not cramming in a hundred SAT words to prove a point, nor listing accomplishments. It takes a moment and reflects upon it in a way that is genuine to the writer. It possesses a quiet, simplistic beauty that unfolds over time, like a sushi chef who has trained in a specific craft for decades.  You walk in, sit down, and order a dish which has fewer ingredients than the fingers on your hand; and the chef distills a lifetime of hard labor and dedication into a bite of food that you must eat with your fingers.\n\nFor our purposes here, I decided not to describe in too much detail the writing techniques of the essay: syntax9, grammar10, and diction11. Rather, I wanted to write a reflection that would impart students and parents with a sense of flow, and to help grasp the understanding of narrative. I highly encourage students who do not understand the essay to find someone they respect\u2014another student or teacher\u2014to discuss those elements, and for parents to also discuss them with their children.\n\nThis concludes our discussion for the first recipe.\n\nNext, there is a list of terms for further explanation. For formal essay writing, we call these \u201cfootnotes.\u201d I like to joke that we can also call them \u201cfoodnotes\u201d, since \u201cfoot\u201d and \u201cfood\u201d sound somewhat similar, and I like the play of words in Chinese where the phonetic sound for \u201cfoot\u201d (\u811a *ji\u01ceo*) is the same as \u201cangle/perspective\u201d (\u89d2 *ji\u01ceo*), and the word for \u201cfood\u201d (\u98df\u7269 *sh\u00ed w\u00f9*) has a similar phonetic sound as \u201cmaterial object\u201d (\u4e8b\u7269 *sh\u00ec w\u00f9*).\n\nJoking aside, in this case, we have foodnotes for hand rolls, because **craftsmanship/craftswomanship**12 requires an engagement of the mind, the body, the materials, and the craft\u2014all as one, and one as a whole.\n\n**!!! Pop Quiz !!!**\n\nWhich do you believe is the statement that most reflects your interpretation?\n\n(a) The mind is the sushi roll, the body is the rice, the material is the tuna, and the craft is the seaweed.\n\n(b) The mind is the rice, the body is the tuna, the craft is the seaweed, and the sushi roll is the material.\n\n(c) The craft is the sushi roll, the mind is the seaweed, the rice is the body, and the tuna is the material.\n\nOptional: using the examples from the pop quiz, craft a sentence for the **literal** interpretation, a **figurative** interpretation, a **metaphorical** interpretation, an **analogous** interpretation, and finally use all these interpretations and write a short story on them.\n\n**Recipe 1 - Footnotes/Foodnotes**\n\n**1 Egleston** is an honors program for Columbia Engineering students which provides a stipend, guaranteed research opportunities, and close mentorship with faculty members, among other privileges. [*https://engineering.columbia.edu/academics/undergraduate/egleston-scholars*](https://engineering.columbia.edu/academics/undergraduate/egleston-scholars)\n\n**2 Daikon** is a variety of radish with a large slender white root that is typically eaten cooked, especially in Eastern cuisine, and is also used for fodder.\n\n**3 Perilla leaves** are an Asian plant of the mint family with medicinal and culinary uses. It is regarded as an invasive weed in some areas.\n\n**4 Otoro** is the most desired part of the tuna belly.\n\n**5 Omakase** is the Japanese tradition of letting a chef choose your order.\n\n**6 Caviar** is the pickled roe of sturgeon or other large fish, eaten as a delicacy; usually connotes lavishness.\n\n**7 Foie Gras** is a specialty food product made of the liver of a duck or goose. According to French law, foie gras is defined as the liver of a duck or goose fattened by gavage.\n\n**8 Rolls**: Joke\u2014what do you call someone who is full of sushi rolls? ROFL.\n\n**9 Syntax** is the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language.: \"the syntax of English\".\n\n**10 Grammar** is the whole system and structure of a language or of languages in general, usually taken as consisting of syntax and morphology (including inflections) and sometimes also phonology and semantics.\n\n**11 Diction** is the choice and use of words and phrases in speech or writing.\n\n**12 Crafts(wo)manship**: skill in a particular craft; a craft can not only refer to physical work but also artistic creation such as poetry or music-making. In the original essay, the craft is elevated from albumen printing to life itself. The play on words occurring here is of at least two levels: craftsmanship is primarily masculine, so to adjust it as craftswomanship would be allowing it to retain its original meaning while also adjusting masculine perceptions to incorporate and invite feminine mastery into the discussion of crafting. The second level of play here is of the Chinese character \u6211 (I/me, w\u01d2), implying the importance of the individual between the craft and the man/ship (craftsman/craftsmanship), to position the visualization of a Chinese individual between the object and the action (craftswoman/craftswomanship).",
