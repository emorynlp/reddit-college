  "text": "Tonight at my school 3 people committed to yale and another two to Stanford. While I didn\u2019t apply to these schools I can\u2019t help but feel jealous. Their future is pretty much set and they can just focus on school. They all have such amazing ECs and grade but all I have is two jobs which don\u2019t look as cool as being student board members and musicians. I feel stressed because i\u2019m in a magnet program and if I dont attempt a top school I would have wasted my time. How do I combat feeling this way?",

I got rejected from my fairly selective ED school today, and it was bittersweet to see some of my lifelong friends\u2019 insta stories full of Emory, Vanderbilt stuff etc. \n\nI was always somebody who put their head down and worked. Not that anybody owes me anything, but being first one in and last one out in school for years and coming to the realization that I don\u2019t have a shot in hell at any of my dream schools really just...sucks.",

That is most likely not the case:\n\n* You may have learned more than you would have at a different campus or if you had not worked hard\n* Even if you don't get into a \"top school\" you have likely positioned yourself to get into a wider set of schools than would have been open to you had you not attended that campus and/or worked hard\n* You have likely positioned yourself to win significant non-need-based aid at certain schools that would not have been available had you not done the hard work\n* You have likely positioned yourself to get into various public honors programs that would not have been open to you if you had not done the hard work",

Despite our best wishes for others we always feel the pangs of jealousy, especially if you're from a highly competitive environment like yourself. Be proud of your own achievements! Having two jobs isn't easy at all, and I'm sure you've accomplished so much during your period in high school. Going to a worse college doesn't detract from your personal worth. If it's of any reprise, I can offer you the solace that the feelings of jealousy will go away, given enough time. Just hang in there!",
