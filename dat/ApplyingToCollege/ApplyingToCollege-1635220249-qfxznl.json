  "text": "For me I\u2019m thinking about calling one of my activities \u201cartistic endeavors\u201d or some shit and it would include the time I designed merch for a big YouTuber as well as how I used to draw and post drawings online, but these two things happened in different years and aren\u2019t super closely related so is it bad to combine them?
