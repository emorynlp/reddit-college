  "text": "(Repost because I didn't get any responses last time)\n\nI'm trying to fill out the Courses & Grades section of the Common App for Purdue, but I'm having issues with the grade range it allows. I wanted to submit my weighted grades because that's what's listed on my official transcript, but for a grading scale of 1-100 the highest grade it allows you to select is 105, and I have a some 106s and 107s. Is it okay if I just use my unweighted grades?\n\nAlso, my transcript lists Gifted Participation for each year with my other classes even though it's not really a class. Do I still need to put it on Courses & Grades?",

I\u2018ve also ran into issues with the common app grades section, but in the end I emailed the admissions office and they said that if your counselor has already submitted your transcript, you don\u2019t have to fill it in.",
