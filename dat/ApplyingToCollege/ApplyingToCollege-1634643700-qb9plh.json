  "text": "While applying for Yale, I thought I got all the information down over the summer so I haven't looked much into it since. For the letters of rec, I thought I only needed 2 core teachers. However after going through the web again, I found I needed a counselor recommendation along side it which was not made clear in Naviance, which only allows 2, further reinforcing my idea that I needed 2 core teachers. I have emailed my counselor to see if she can write one before then but now I feel really selfish especially since the fact that she told us last Friday was the deadline for asking her.",

      "text": "All you can do now is hope for the best - I'm sure Yale will accept it even if it's a few days past the Nov 1 deadline, and you're only 2 business days past your counselor's Friday deadline.  You can also make it easier for her by filling out a brag sheet/questionnaire. At our Hs, all kids submit one, and no joke, my kid sent it all in at ~8pm and by 8am the next morning, had received an email saying that the letter of Rec had already been uploaded. I'm sure it was a generic cut-paste job, but oh well, at least it is in.",
