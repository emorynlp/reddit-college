  "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore and I recently took the psat, and did pretty well(atleast IMO). I, perhaps stupidly, subscribed to the college mail thing on college board so now I get my Gmail blown up by emails from colleges. \n\nThey\u2019re always offering me guides n stuff. Should I subscribe to any of these? I\u2019ve only subscribed to2 colleges, Stevens and Swarthmore because they were the only schools I was interested in",
