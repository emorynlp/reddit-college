  "text": "Hi guys, my predicted grades come out tomorrow so I'll be applying for my universities fairly soon. I'm currently applying for the Computer science course in the following universities: UCL, Bath, Warwick and two other safety's. Do you think 3 scores of 5, along with 3 predicted 5s would be a strong enough qualification for me as a home student to get into my wanted universities.  I will also be taking the SAT 3 times, so if I do get a condition on it I will have to meet it. Can anyone who has any knowledge applying to UK with Advanced Placement let me know if this is a strong qualification to apply with and if I should keep my hopes up.",
