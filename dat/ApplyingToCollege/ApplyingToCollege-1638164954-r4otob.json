  "text": "Especially when you've spent days on an essay, only to finally realize that its just a bad essay and it has to be scrapped. BONUS POINTS if its for a reach college that probably wont accept you in the first place, making you feel like you wasted your time. Idk man, it's a good learning experience, but i spent my whole thanksgiving writing my harvard essay only to scrap it today :(",
