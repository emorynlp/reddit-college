  "title:": "PG Year or go straight to college?",
  "text": "Has anyone considered a PG year? I have a 2.4 UW GPA but a 1490(790M, 700R). I had a mediocre first 2 years where I was bored out of my mind. So I decided to transfer to private school. The combination of COVID and the stresses of a new school were just too much and I got terrible grades. But after that year I decided to turn it around. This year I have a 3.7/4.4. I knew that I had the potential to get good grades. I also have excellent extracurriculars, I\u2019m gonna be vague here because I don\u2019t wanna get doxxed. It\u2019s not like I cured cancer but I have held 5+ high leadership positions in different extracurriculars with great success. My dream school is UVA but obviously that is unrealistic. Right now I\u2019m debating between doing a PG year and going straight to a local public college next year to transfer to a school like UVA or Cornell after a year. \n\nOther info:\nGender: Male\nRace: Caucasian\nPreferred major: finance possibly with a double major in electrical engineering or applied math.\nAlso, not seeking scholarship or financial aid.\nAlso, I want to make it a point that I am not lazy. Even though my grades were not superb, I maintained high extracurricular involvement. Will colleges see this or will they just see my GPA and throw my application out? On the other hand, I\u2019ve heard of people with trash GPAs similar to mine getting into decent schools. Not necessarily T20s, but very solid schools.",
