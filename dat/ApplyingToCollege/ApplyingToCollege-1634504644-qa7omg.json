  "text": "Hey guys! \n\nSo I got my oct SAT score back, and got a 1580!!\nReally happy with my score, and my grades are on point aswell, but I know that top colleges in the US want much more. \n\nFor most of my activities, I have been working on them since freshman year, and have continued those activities till now. They range from very diverse interests, and I have proper leadership and impact within those. The issue is that since I do not have an exact area of study mapped down, I feel a bit lost. I am super confused about whether I should continue doing the stuff I'm doing, or try to pick and focus on one area of study so my application to T20s is focused on a specific niche. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, as well as any recommendations or guidance for the colleges I should look into, if I require full financial aid. \n\nThanks in advance !",

That thing doesn\u2019t have to be your career path, colleges don\u2019t expect you to know that yet",
