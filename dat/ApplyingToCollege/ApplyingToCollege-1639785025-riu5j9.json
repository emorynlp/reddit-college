It stings, you\u2019re upset, frustrated, angry, questioning what you could\u2019ve done better. I promise you, it gets better. This time next year you\u2019ll be finishing up your first semester at a different school, and uchicago won\u2019t have cross your mind. You\u2019re going to make amazing friends and have the best experiences. Yes rejection hurts, and it will for a while. It will all be worth it in the end though when you\u2019re laughing with your friends in a dorm at 3 in the morning or getting that first A.",

Unfortunately most schools don\u2019t allow you to appeal and if you did you\u2019d just be holding onto hope to a outcome that is incredibly unlikely. \nYou are likely a very qualified candidate to any school and one will sweep you up in which you\u2019ll attend a great university where you can thrive and be happy. It\u2019s ok to be upset tho. You have to take time for yourself during this winter break and remind yourself you are good enough. A school does not define you. Lots of very very qualified candidates will get rejected. Appealing will likely lead to the same outcome with wasted time and stress",

It\u2019s not just some application that is rejected , it\u2019s a person. Of course it hurts. But I want you to understand that pain is ok. Negative emotions, when appropriate to the situation, are ok. These feelings are not a disease or something to be removed, they are you. Let your feelings wash over you. You wont drown, you will be cleansed.",
