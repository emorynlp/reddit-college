Whether it's cheesy or not would depend on the rest of the essay; I'd probably think about whether it sounds weird when you say it and whether it's easy - at a glance - to understand your meaning.",

      "text": "I agree with the other commenter. If it\u2019s just there and then there\u2019s no other hints of creative writing in the essay, it\u2019s probably cheesy. However, I think the use of descriptive language and literary devices can be a great way to illustrate meaning, as long as you don\u2019t go overboard. There\u2019s a balance to everything.",
