  "text": "I've been out of high school for a year now, this will be my third time applying to college. I thought of applying to Tufts for Art (I like their animation program) but I'm only now realizing how selective Tufts is... I was wondering where I should set my expectations. I got a portfolio review from Tufts and they gave me pretty good artistic advice while also sounding enthusiastic about my work. I just don't want to get my hopes up",
