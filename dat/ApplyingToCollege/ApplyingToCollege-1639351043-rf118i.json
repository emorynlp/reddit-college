  "title:": "Does assigning \"Other Recommender\" again mean that they need to submit some kind of form, or is it already good if they've written/sent in recs for other common app schools?",
  "text": "I have another recommender from research I was doing. I requested him as the \"other recommender\" for some schools before, such as for early action ones which he submitted for. Now, I'm also thinking that I want his letter to go to a school that I'm planning to apply for for regular decision.\n\nSince his name is already in the dropdown for \"other recommender,\" after I click assign, does that mean he still needs to do anything on his end, or is it already completely good to go? For context, when I just did it, it shows that it's been submitted on a November date and it says assigned today. (as in, I requested him for other colleges before, but not for this one. He didn't do anything and I just clicked on this dropdown, and it already says submitted).\n\nThanks! Just want to make sure the recommendation in, and if he needs to do anything else",
