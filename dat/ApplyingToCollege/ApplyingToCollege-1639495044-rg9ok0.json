  "text": "Every time I try to write... it feels like I'm pulling my teeth out. Like today I just sat down for 4 hours to write and only came up with a shitty paragraph haha.\n\nI guess there's no pressing NEED to write new essays yet, especially since writing while waiting out for early cycle results is especially deflating, but I'm curious about how yall avoid this!",

I'll still keep the prompt in the back of my mind and I'll think about it in the following days/week until eventually I'll watch or read or hear something and inspiration strikes. \n\nI think eventually if you think about what you want to say and what the question is asking eventually you'll come up with something. But, it's better not to force it. If you can't write, don't. Try and find inspiration instead.",
