  "text": "Hi A2C, I\u2019m a senior applying to Princeton (so many supps) and am a bit stuck for the difficult conversation essay. Right now my options are:\n\n-  Traveling to Israel over summer, conversing with the locals in Jerusalem, realizing how the many religious groups cooperate despite the tension. I overcame a fear that I had after the terrorist attacks in France (where I lived) in 2015 and learned that compromise is important to cooperation. \n- How I learned to follow my own path for my future career by declaring my independence from my dad, who was forcing his dreams on me by wanting me to go to naval academy, where he graduated from. This could be more personal b/c I rarely got to see him and therefore was willing to do a lot for him to be proud of me, but I learned that I had to do follow my own aspirations. \n\nWhich one sounds better? I\u2019m conflicted over this. Thank you!",
