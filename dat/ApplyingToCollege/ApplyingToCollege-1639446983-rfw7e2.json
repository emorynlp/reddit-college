      "text": "Perhaps you got rejected not because of your perceived lack of qualification, but rather that you weren\u2019t the right fit for the school. Just because you were rejected by one school does not guarantee your rejection from others. Write the best supps you can possibly type on that google document. Apply and see where it takes you because a potential missed opportunity is way worse than a normal, completely understandable fear of rejection held by pretty much any applicant to these schools. I\u2019m sorry about Cornell, but there are great things waiting for you !",

      "text": "If you would happily go if you were admitted, shoot your shot. Super selective admissions have enough luck in them that one school\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t necessarily predict another\u2019s. I know someone who got rejected Stanford REA and got in Harvard RD, and someone who got rejected Caltech EA and at nearly all private colleges until he got into Stanford REA on the last day of RD results. Keep expectations realistic of course, but don\u2019t let one result determine your whole trajectory of applications.",

      "text": "Yes!! If you think the selective schools are a good fit for you, absolutely apply! If you don\u2019t try, you might look back years later and wonder about what might have happened. For most of us, I think admissions to these kind of schools is just a lottery, so just because you didn\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d at Cornell doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t at another school. Good luck and I wish you the best!! There are so many great opportunities waiting out there",
