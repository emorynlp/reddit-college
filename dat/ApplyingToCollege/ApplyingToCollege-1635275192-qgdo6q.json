  "text": "Tbh Idk why but I was wondering, all of us know Indians (and Asians) excel in STEM, but what about majors in the Humanities field? I have yet to see any Indian applying for English or other fields primarily considered under the Humanities umbrella. Maybe that's because STEM is constantly in our faces, but I would really like to know if any Indian or Asian international applicant is considering majoring in Humanities field.",
