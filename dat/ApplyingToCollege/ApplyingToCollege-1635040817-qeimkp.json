  "text": "I feel it hard to believe that AOs, especially at top schools, read everything a student sends. I feel like they read the personal essay and then some of the supplements if they are unsure.",

Now, they might not thoroughly look at it and annotate it and write a reflection on it (I'm exaggerating ofc, they might do some of that if you're one of the difficult decisions), but they read through all of them and well enough to probably give you a summary and what they liked/didn't like about it.",

So imagine your 30 page application with LORs and endless essays and activities lists and transcripts and school report etc; they\u2019re gonna give it full consideration in 10 minutes max, which means each page gets 20 seconds. They get good at picking out the relevant things to spend more time on and skimming over other things. I imagine some of them are skimmed in 2-4 minutes.",
