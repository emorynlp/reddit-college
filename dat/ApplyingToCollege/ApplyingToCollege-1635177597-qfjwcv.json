  "text": "Im in my senior year of highschool and It seems I will be graduating a semester late with a 1.5 GPA. Sad, right? Ive made my peace with that and have even decoded to go around travelling witht my saved up money for semester before starting college, meaning I'll already by behind my peers by a whole year. Plan is to go to a community college for 2 years, transfer to a university for the later half of the 4 years and get my bachelors in Biology or statisticd, and then hopefully pass the MCAT and get admitted into a medical college. This seems pretty easy on paper, But I dont even know where to start. I honestly have no clue on what to do besides the general outline of a \"plan.\" Im starting to get overwhelmed now that I figured out just how much of a failure I am. Should I just keep my head down and figure out my College admissions a during my last semester?",

      "text": "It's ok - many colleges love the Late-Bloomer/Turned My Life Around storyline, and you just have to use that to your advantage.  Can you start cc a semester early, or take some online classes first?  It might take a little time for you to get up to speed on the study habits you will need to cultivate, to get straight As in cc.  Also, you may want to start on thinking about your ECs for transfer in to a 4 yr college.  This extra semester will be a great time to start.  Good luck!",

      "text": "As a professor one of my very best students was a woman who had failed out freshman year with a .75 gpa. A few years later, when she knew what she wanted, she came back and blew everyone away. You can totally do this.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to pick up study skills, and CC is a great place for that. Start out with just one summer class, or 2-3 in fall. Pick easier ones you are interested in that will help you review stuff you missed in high school before stepping up to harder math and writing classes. Use the tutoring!!! Talk to your teachers if you find yourself at all struggling. And try to find a similarly focused study buddy. Join the science club or pick one volunteer thing you really like to do consistently so you\u2019ll have a good extracurricular to reference if you apply to schools that look at that. Maybe work in a clinic or hospital or senior care home part-time.\n\nAfter 2-3 years in CC you\u2019ll be fully ready to transfer to a 4-year school and they will not care at all about high school. Neither will med schools. And there are also some great interim health care jobs you can train for at a CC as well, like X-ray tech or EMT. \n\nIf you want this, you can do it.\n\nPS my dad went from high school slacker/jock to rocket scientist. Anything is possible.",

      "text": "I really like the other comment in here about taking some time off to get your shit together.\n\nIf you finished HS with a 1.5 GPA, then for better or worse you\u2019re missing some fundamental academic skills. That\u2019s ok, as others have mentioned, you can still pick them up, crush CC, transfer to a four year, and get where you want to go.\n\nBut don\u2019t kid yourself, this is going to be an uphill climb, and you\u2019ll need to have a lot of motivation, grit, and a little luck to do it successfully.\n\nI strongly recommend a little time off from school. A semester, or a year. You may benefit from putting some distance between you and the habits that caused that 1.5. Go find a job, related if possible to what you\u2019re finding yourself interested in, save as much as you can, work hard, give yourself some grounding in the real world, and then tackle CC when you have some context and experience on work that is outside of and beyond a HS classroom.\n\nThe extra maturity and exposure will help you stay on track and stay grounded. A bit more not-school context will make what you\u2019re doing in college feel more relevant, which may be an important key to producing effort in CC and beyond that you didn\u2019t muster in HS.",

          "text": "This is good advice, OP. You need some concentration/organizational/problem-solving/time management  skills to do well and many people pick those up more easily when getting paid to use them. Start with a schedule mostly around a job (hospitals and senior living facilities have some in areas like food service or laundry that require no certifications, or a CNA/MA or EMT isn\u2019t too hard to earn) and do one or two classes at a time, starting with the basic math and English courses you test into.",

      "text": "I strongly agree you should spend the six months before you start CC learning to take efficient notes, study and general time management skills. Med students online share great tips for doing these things well. Perhaps find which Bio course is the foundation course at the CC you\u2018ll attend and use that text to practice on. If you\u2019re unfamiliar/not great with chem you may want to brush up in preparation (organic chem tends to be the weeder class for premeds). There\u2019s no shame in starting where you are, the only shame would be if you didn\u2019t. Good luck :)",
