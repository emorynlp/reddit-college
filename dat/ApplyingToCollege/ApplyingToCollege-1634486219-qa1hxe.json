  "text": "Dear A2C,\n\nI've transferred to a new school which does \"unweighted gpa\" calculations weirdly. Essentially, a 100 is a 4.0, a 99 a 3.9, and so forth.\n\nMy gpa went from a 3.87, to a 3.41(94 avg) because of it and now I'm low-key panicking. My transcript explains this dubious gpa scale but this clarification is buried away into an obscure part of my transcript which can easily skimmed over if the AO doesn't look carefully enough for it. \n\nTo make matters worse, I have an 'F' on my transcript(explanation on a previous post) so it may appear plausible that my GPA is actually 3.41 too.\n\nWhat do I put in the \"unweighted GPA\" portion of the common app? Will colleges recalculate my GPA or am screwed?\n\nThanks,",
