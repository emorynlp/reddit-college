  "title:": "Should i write that I crossed the border everyday when I was going to high school?",
  "text": "I'm currently applying for UC. I live in Mexico and when i was in high schooI would go to the U.S. everyday to go to school. As a result, I would wake up really early and get home late, which is why i did not get to do many activities in high school. Because everything is online now, i got a \"break\" from making long ass lines at the border.\n\nThe thing is that i dont know if this could get me in trouble because i'm supposed to be living in the u.s. since i've used my uncle's address in high school and community college. On the other hand, the school might take pity on me and accept me. What do you guys think?",

I think that the legal risk outweighs any potential \u201cpity vote.\u201d Maybe there is a way to talk about having your family in Mexico so you had to cross the border often to spend time with them, etc\u2026",
