  "title:": "This may sound dumb, but when rooming with someone how do alarms work?",
  "text": "I was thinking about this as college has become more and more a reality and there's one thing that has confused me. If two people are sleeping in the same room, but have different schedules how do they not get pissed at each other for having completely different alarms? Do they just live with the fact that they'll both probably have to have a similar sleep schedule? Or am I missing something?",
