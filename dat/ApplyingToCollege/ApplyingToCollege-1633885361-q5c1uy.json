  "text": "I\u2019m torn over my ED school. For more context, my intended major is economics/public health bc my intended career is healthcare administration. Grad school is kind of required for my intended field. Feel free to suggest other schools too!!\n\nHere are some specific reasons why I\u2019m considering them:\n\n*Cornell*\n\nPros:\n- College of human ecology supposedly has a slightly higher acceptance rate (23%) which could be even higher in ED\n- Many different unique programs like textiles, agriculture, applied econ\n- Gorgeous campus\n- Good food\n- A few of my friends go here\n\nCons:\n- I\u2019m not a very nature-loving person\n\n\n*UPenn*\n\nPros:\n- Wharton has an healthcare management concentration\n- I attended Penn\u2019s fly-in program (PEEP), though I\u2019m not sure how big of a boost it is\n- In the city\n- I don\u2019t mind the pre-professionalism that much bc I\u2019m also like that\n\nCons:\n- Clubs are very competitive\n- Campus is not that pretty\n- Not as much room for academic exploration\n- Not as much music/theater\n\n*Northwestern*\n\nPros:\n- Diverse academics\n- LOVE the campus\n- Good mix of suburban/urban\n- Good boost for ED\n- Good culture for music/theater\n\nCons:\n- Academic programs are good, not nothing is really the best (besides journalism)",

To me, because you have to get a grad degree, I would use this undergrad as a means of getting yourself sorted and heading in the right direction, enjoying the studies and the college life. \n\nNorthwestern floats to the top I think\u2026 (sometimes how you list things reveals what you desire). You started with a \u201cgo-to\u201d, then sandwiched the one you didn\u2019t really like in the middle, and concluded on a good note \u2014 the one you wanted (just my take)\u2026",

      "text": "I got my BS from Cornell and grew up in Evanston with a parent working at Northwestern, so I can speak a lot about both schools. Both schools are fantastic choices. Cornell has a health policy major, while Northwestern has the global health major. It's important to note that at Cornell, you could not double major in economics without taking a 5th year to do the Arts & Sciences distribution requirements.\n\nIn terms of internship and job opportunities, the on campus recruiting at Cornell will mainly focus on placement on the East Coast, while the on campus recruiting at Northwestern will mainly focus on placement in the Midwest. It's certainly doable to find jobs outside of these regions, but it's easier to find placement in those areas.\n\nNorthwestern's free CTA pass for the purple line makes Chicago really accessible, which is a great resource. I was also not an outdoors person when I started at Cornell, and I'm still not a fan of camping, but I came to appreciate the rural community. Ithaca is full of artists, academics, and farmers. The Ithaca Farmer's Market cannot be beat. The gorges on campus and seasons are stunning. It gives you a unique appreciation for winter.\n\nThe rest of it comes down to personal preference about culture. Northwestern has a quarter system, which means you get to take more classes, but you also have to take a lot more finals and tests. Cornell and Northwestern both have Greek life, but there's more focus on Greek life socially at Northwestern.  There's a much bigger emphasis on sports at Northwestern, while the only decently big sport at Cornell is hockey (but it's so much fun to watch).\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about these schools!!",
