  "text": "I\u2019m currently a senior and taking an online dual enrollment psych class. I just hate the class in general. I currently have a C-D average in the class. Would it be better to just withdraw from the class completely and not risk hurting my college gpa and my high school 3.9 gpa? Or does a \u201cW\u201d on my transcript look bad for colleges and I should just tough it out and finish the class?",
