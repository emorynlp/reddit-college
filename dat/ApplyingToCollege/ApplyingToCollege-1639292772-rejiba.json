  "text": "Yesterday, Dartmouth decisions were out. A student from Kazakhstan with 44 IB, 1540 SAT, unusually high GPA got, 5 times ISO Olympic medalist, awesome extracurricular activities, super essays got rejected.( I compared his application with others who got admitted. His application was stand-out). The same happened with Ara Memberyan a few years ago. According to statistics, ivy league schools admitted very low amount of students from Post-soviet countries.",

For example every country has a top chemistry student and top math student etc but Harvard can\u2019t take 200 chemists and 200 mathematicians and 200 physicists and on and on. All these people are amazingly smart and accomplished and talented, but if you\u2019re shaping a class, maybe you want 50 chemistry majors and 30 math majors, etc and only 10% of the class will be internationals. That\u2019s why admissions seems unfair or arbitrary.",
