Most of the admissions software used by colleges allows for the dynamic creation of an offer letter, inserting or removing text based on the fields that are indicated on the student's record.  It's possible they failed to mark it earlier and then caught the issue later and wanted to be sure you knew you were offered more than the original letter stated.\n\nIn any case, congrats!",

Homework takes him about 10 minutes per evening. His extra-curriculars occupy six hours per week. There are a couple kids in his Scout troop who are really into coding.
