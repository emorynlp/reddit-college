  "title:": "32 yo reapplying to college I dropped out of when I was 21 - what reason do I give on application?",
  "text": "I attended college for 4 years but due to family problems, depression, and anxiety I failed some classes over the years and after my fourth year I ended up not returning. Not finishing my degree has always bothered me and I want to complete it. The re-admission process as a returning student is pretty straight forward. Just had to have left the  college in good academic standing with a GPA of 2.0 or better and clear  financial holds, both of which I have. Then it's a matter of filling out a simple form. The only thing is I am not exactly sure how to answer  the question \"what was your reason for xyz college?\" What is a good way of explaining it? I don't really want an association of mental health to my name. Thanks in advance.",
