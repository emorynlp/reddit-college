  "text": "For the extracurriculars essay supplements, I was thinking of writing abt my work experience @ CFA, although I don\u2019t agree with it\u2019s politics & some things they\u2019ve done, I see it as a job I got as a teenager and wanted to talk abt some of the things it\u2019s taught me.\n\nI\u2019m just wondering if it\u2019d be a bit controversial given some preconceived notions.",

Not voting for the same president isn't controversial, and if a school is going to discriminate against students for their political views  I wouldn't want to attend anyway.",

It's sad how the mainstream media's reduced one of the most important humanitarian organizations around to an 'anti-lgbt' organization. CFA doesn't fund them anymore either way, but it's a shame how they've sold out to the leftist outrage mob like all the other corporates.",
