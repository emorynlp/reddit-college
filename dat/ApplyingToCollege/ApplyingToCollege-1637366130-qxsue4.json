      "text": "Those programs are incredibly difficult to be accepted to. Covid has made it hard to get the ECs for everyone so hopefully, you're working on some online stuff.   \n\n\nYou should start looking into what you'll be doing this summer. There are a million things to tell you but don't worry too much about it. A four-year degree and then an M.D. might actually be better for you in the long run.",

      "text": "If you can do research, it might help. Work with a professor, bonus points if you get an abstract accepted at a meeting, or even middle author on a paper. God-tier would be national level semifinalist (Regeneron STS or something like that) or first author on a small clinical paper (doesn't have to be basic science, doesn't have to be a tier 1 journal, but should be in an acceptable journal - your mentor will guide you)\nHaving said that, it's not the only way. There are so few spots, they are choosing students individually, just like with Med school. If they're looking for community health kids, they'll focus on the ones who have that interest. If they have too many research oriented kids, they might focus more on volunteerism or clinical shadowing.  No one knows for sure, and each program is different. Makes it hard to generalize.  \nApply broadly, and best of luck!",
