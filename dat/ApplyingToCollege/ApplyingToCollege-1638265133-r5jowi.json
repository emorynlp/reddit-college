  "text": "So I know that this is a bit odd to say on the subreddit, but I want to see which one is more valued at a college perspective. I\u2019m in both Model UN and Speech (and DECA but it\u2019s not that important in this story), and both MUN and Speech have two really important tournaments on the same day. NHSMIN and the states qualifier for speech to be exact. I\u2019m really conflicted on which one I should go to. Could I get some advice on which one seems more important?",

But if not then I would go to the Model UN because colleges have that club on campus. Law schools are the ones that do Mock Trial\u2019s or speech.",

I ended up choosing the Band thing, but that was because I would have a chance to advance in Speech later (I could still attend National Qualifiers).  \n\nI know this isn't what you are asking, but I would go to whatever you find more enjoyment in, rather than what looks better on a college application.  I don't know if you plan on continuing these activities in college, but these might be one of your last opportunities, so try and enjoy them instead of just focusing in college.",
