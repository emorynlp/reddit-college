  "text": "I\u2019m only taking four classes this year (AP stats, AP lit, PLTW class aerospace and EDD) because I wasn\u2019t able to fit anything else in my schedule. Would this hurt my chance at a selective school (T10) ? I want to do dual enrollment but since the common app is due on January 1st I wasn\u2019t sure how to update them on my class load for senior year.",
