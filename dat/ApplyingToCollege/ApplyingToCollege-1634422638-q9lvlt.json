  "text": "A little background - I live in Florida, a state with a wonderful scholarship program called bright futures. If I get into one of the well-known state schools (UF, FSU), I'm going to be able to get a solid education basically for free. \n\nI have the scores, grades, and extracurriculars to realistically apply to some harder schools, like ivies, but I know that if I got into an ivy and UF, I'd choose UF over the ivy largely because of pricing. It's highly unlikely that I'd get any sort of financial aid based on income, so my family would have to pay out of pocket for school, and I'd have to apply to a plethora of scholarships. \n\nMy dad believes that even if I don't plan to go to one of those top, out of state schools for undergrad, that I should apply now so that when grad school comes around, I have a \"shoo-in\" that will make my grad school admission more likely at one of those schools. Is this believe true in any way? Should I bother applying to these schools that I'm not particularly interested in for undergrad for this reason? Or should I save the application fees and apply only to my more financially-realistic options?",

As such graduate admissions office is usually separate from undergraduate admissions. Also most graduate school admissions are for specific departments and those departments are not involved with undergraduate admissions process.",
