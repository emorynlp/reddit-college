  "title:": "Need some info on applying to US",
  "text": " I'm a student from India. I came to know about the process of applying to US at the end of my 12th grade. From videos on internet and blogs it was evident I learnt this late and that I couldn't start my study in US without staying idle for a long time due to the application process (which my parents won't like). So I decided that I'll try for transfer and joined an Indian engineering university and am doing Bachelors in Computer Science as Freshman. Now I want to apply for a transfer to US universities and am confused with the procedure. Some questions for which I couldn't get clear answer on the internet.\n\n1. When should I apply?(After my freshman year or..?)\n2. If I take SAT and IELTS/TOEFL by the end of freshman year and apply after completing it, which year do I join as?\n3. Is Transfer application as difficult as people as on blogs?\n4. Can I work part time as a student?\n5. Is it easy to get job as international student?",
