      "text": "Probably a bit higher.\n\nThe 80% rejected includes all of those well below that threw in an application on a prayer, or have very special qualities. The acceptance rate there is probably very low. Those in range and higher have a higher acceptance rate to balance it out.  But probably not a lot higher.\n\nLooking at MIT\u2019s data, the tiers below the median range have \\~1% acceptance and those in the range have about 10%, against an overall 5% rate. So among all students that applied with a 760/790, it\u2019s likely around 10% were accepted.",
