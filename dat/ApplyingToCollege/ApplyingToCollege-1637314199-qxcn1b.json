  "text": "Hi folks, anyone applying to Soka this cycle? I just wanna complain a little bit about Soka's transcript requirement.\n\nSo basically, as an international, if I want to apply to Soka, I must send my transcript through IERF (a service to convert my grades to US grade system :> ), and it costs me almost $190, which is too much for me. Also, I am applying to 21 colleges, and only Soka requires that, lol.\n\nDoes anyone have a tip for dealing with this school about this policy? I have a limited budget for college applications, and now I'm almost bankrupt. Should I email them to explain my financial situation and beg them to consider my case? My EFC is low too.",
