  "text": "idk why but I just can't bring myself to write them. I've done my common app ps and most of my safety essays but for my reach schools I just can't. Idk why I hate it so much it just sucks to have to try and write \"quirky and appealing\" essays for admissions teams that'll probably reject me anyways. My brain just tells me no. So be it if it gets done it gets done if not then it wasn't meant to be!",
