  "title:": "My motivation to get good grades is driven in part by a desire to get revenge on the system",
  "text": "The two B+s I got this quarter were both due to my participation grades driving my overall grade down, and I absolutely hate it. The US is probably the country in the world where non-academic factors like \"participation\" and \"effort\" matter as much as test scores. I want to spite whole system of factoring in irrelevant participation grades, which has only harmed me, by managing to benefit from it. I'll start turning in all of my assignments on time, making my responses longer and more detailed, speaking up in class more, etc. I know that this is such an unhealthy attitude to have and I'll probably cringe when I look back at this post but this is how I honestly feel. I'm tired of getting 80% on my assignments because I don't put in enough \"detail\", or 80% in a 20% participation category because answering the teacher's questions makes me too uncomfortable. Fuck this whole grading system. Hopefully I'll be able to game it like everyone else one day.",

      "text": "As a person who gets extremely nervous to say anything in class, I am with you 100%. That being said though, saying the shallowest of things in classes can get you the bare minimum of points to get you the grade you want. \n\nBut also, just FYI, many other countries weigh participation on the same, if not a higher level, as in the US. Off the top of my head, in Germany, participation and test scores are split 50/50. It\u2019s all just to make sure different types of students aren\u2019t left behind but it really just marginalized each type of student. Anyways, the best you can do is to just bite the bullet and fight thru it.",
