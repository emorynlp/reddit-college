  "text": "\\*Repost bc it got buried under shitpost Wednesday last time haha\n\nHi everyone, I'm currently a senior and I began to work on starting a clothing brand (just screen printing using premade blanks, not actually designing whole garments from scratch yet) last summer bc I really love fashion and graphic design. I want to include this on my list of ecs, but I really have no measurable progress?\n\nThe process of actually getting started, sketching, vectorizing the designs, researching for quality blanks, building a website/ social media pages, etc. has been taking a very long time so I haven't been able to officially launch my brand or begin to sell my products yet. However, I have been investing a lot of time into this every week and it's something that I truly enjoy doing.\n\nI know that it's important to be very specific in the ec descriptions and include metrics whenever possible, so how should I describe what I have been doing without being suspicious or too vague? Any tips? Thanks :)",
