  "title:": "Writers of A2C! I unironically translate hentai. How would I go about explaining this in EC lists/essays/interviews?",
  "text": "**EDIT: Thanks to all for the advice. I'm going to just list it as translating manga and will also be asking for some SFW work so I can provide examples if necessary. I'm going to keep this post up because I think I saw some comments about people in similar situations. There were some great comments in here so I hope it serves as some advice for any future hentai translators (lol).** ***PS: This is one of my alts and I'll probably never use this one again, so any requests for sauce or translations will never be seen (sorry).***\n\nthrowaway for obvious reasons, but I'm 100% serious.\n\nThis all started about 8 months ago when a weeb friend of mine asked if I could translate a specific hentai manga. As I'm fluent at a native level in both Japanese and English and have done some translation work before (mostly volunteer work for close family friends' businesses), I accepted. My translation came out better than I/we thought and before I knew it, word had spread among the weebs which led to me receiving multiple requests. At one point, someone suggested that I should send the translated versions to the writers/publishers and see what happens from there (note: The works I translated were from small groups/circles/creators so there were no prior translations). For the most part, I got positive reactions and thanks and even got requests from a couple of groups if I could do more. They actually offered to pay me but I refused because 1. I did it for fun, 2. I didn't need the money, 3. I didn't want to \"take\" money from these aspiring artists, and 4. I don't like responsibility and getting paid = having top-notch quality which I couldn't guarantee.\n\nOver the course of 6\\~7 months, I've done about 50 translations ranging from images, to short stories, to long series. The reason why title is because I'm an aspiring international relations major and figured I could mention that I did some translating work. But, given the nature of the translated work, I'm a bit hesitant on how I should phrase it. Would appreciate any advice.\n\nPreemptive edit: For those who suggest I do \"real\" translating work, the legit opportunities I found that are known/reputable to the schools I'm applying to required either a degree or certifications which I do not have (couldn't be bothered tbh).",

This is the kind of unusual extracurricular that I can imagine being brought up in an interview, and if your interviewer wants to know more details beyond \"translated manga\" you're going to need to have something to talk about.\n\nAgreed with everyone else, though, I think you can say \"manga\" instead of hentai. Don't forget to drop numbers (i.e. translated 90+ hours of anime)!",

IT IS PIRACY.\n\nThis is coming from someone who also is in this business (peep my profile). Yes, this is my alt. Being in this business, there are extremely fine lines between being completely ok and getting into legal trouble. That being said, I did write about my organization in my college application, but solely as a \"collection of recommendations of contemporary Asian artwork.\" Yes, that means hentai. Yes, we have our own translation group. Yes, I did get into the college I applied to. So that being said, if you do talk about this, talk about the PURE PG elements. In other words,\n\n# Don't talk about hentai\n\nand\n\n# Don't talk about translating manga.\n\nYou can say you translated fanfictions (because most of them are).\n\n^(p.s. would you like joining us? pm me hehe)",
