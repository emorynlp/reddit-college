  "text": "BG Info: HS Junior, International\nSoph: Macro/Micro \nJunior: APUSH/Bio \nA in PreCalc/Alg2/Geom/Alg1 \nA in Chem/Bio/Phy/APBio \n\nBasically, the past seniors have told us that our AP Calc teacher is \ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28, and my school only offers AB, but Calc II is required for many majors I am applying for. Secondly, my school does not offer any AP Physics in person course. I recently saw a few commercials of Private High schools in the US offers Summer Term AP. I am wondering if anyone here has taken it and whether it would be wise for me to spend a Summer (June/July) dedicated to AP Physics C and AP Calc BC. \n\nHas anyone done anything like this? Are there any school that has good summer programs? Any recommendations?",
