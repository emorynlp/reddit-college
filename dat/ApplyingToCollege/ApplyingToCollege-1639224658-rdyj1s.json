  "title:": "I got my first rejection and I need help ASAP please",
  "text": " I applied as with an early decision plan to the University of Rochester, I am an international student with a decent SAT score of 1380, an IELTS mark of overall 8, a great expected score of 45 as an IB student, the top of my class, and I have pretty good essays and extracurriculars (various competitions such as ISEF, lead organizer of a TEDx event, etc.) I want to study computer science and I'm aiming for the USA. I also require financial aid or any type of merit scholarship that can cover full tuition. Could that be the reason for my rejection or is it the SAT score?\n\nif anyone has any recommendations for good universities in the US that offer financial aid for international students please let me know, and if you have any recommendations outside of the US it is also welcome.\n\npls I'm desperate I need help pls pls thank youuu",

      "text": "Unfortunately, you're applying to one of the more competitive undergraduate majors and you need full financial support.  Since UoR meets 100% of demonstrated need for accepted students, the school would be on the hook for paying for your costs out of their endowment if you were accepted.  Since you're an international student, you wouldn't even qualify for government loans or grants, so the entire cost of your education would be paid for by the school.  And they might be willing to do that for some absolutely incredibly competitive international applicant.  But the reality is that there are thousands of other applicants who are as competitive applying to CS who can pay (or whose families would borrow money to pay).\n\nSo, you're competing against students who can pay their education expenses, students who can pay most of their education expenses, US students who have financial need, and then international students who have financial need.  That reduces your odds of acceptance dramatically.  With the overall acceptance rate of about 35%, your chosen major, high financial need, and international student status, your personal odds of acceptance are probably much much lower.\n\nThis is all just a bit of an explanation.  I don't have much advice.  Apply to more schools.  Do your best to frame yourself as an amazing applicant who will add to the school's community.  Continue to apply to schools that meet 100% of need, since you realize you need that support.\n\nI hope you get accepted somewhere amazing.",

It is most probably because of the financial need, i assume they only pick the best of the best in the world. However, i do know a few who got in with full aid with not much high credentials, so not 100% sure how it works there\u2019s always some luck involved",

Also it's not true that \"everyone submits it.\" According to [this Rochester report](https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/college-set-for-record-breaking-class-of-2025-481982/), 45% of applicants last year did not submit SAT or ACT scores.\n\nThere are many LAC's that offer generous aid to international students. As long as you don't submit your 1380, you might still be able to get them - your profile seems pretty strong otherwise.",
