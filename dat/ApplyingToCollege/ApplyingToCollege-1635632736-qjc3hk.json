  "title:": "How to write Common App Additional Info?",
  "text": "Hey, just finalizing my common app, and I was unsure how I should write the additional information section.\n\nThere are some things that I would like to mention, including how my SAT tests got cancelled, and also some of the situations I dealt with at start of grade 11 (moving to different country for study)...\n\nIs it okay if like the main point of the narrative changes, or talks about multiple things? Or can I use bullet points with longer points in the additional information section?\n\nAny tips or comments will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks",

      "text": "So from what I\u2019ve heard from consultants: typically additional info is a disjointed set of INFORMATIVE points that give the AOs a more complete image of you (what you should and shouldn\u2019t include is up to you but obviously I\u2019m sure each of you have a decent idea). They have said that this \u201cessay\u201d is less of an essay and more of a bullet point type space to objectively describe instances that have affected your application/life/health etc.",
