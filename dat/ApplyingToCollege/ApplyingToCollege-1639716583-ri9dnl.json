              "text": "If you feel like you could do more, then I would focus on taking what you are doing to the next level. Spending more time, connecting with others to learn more, and committing to new projects within your existing extracurriculars.\n\nIf you feel like you're competing with others and need more to \"outdo\" them, then I would caution against that sort of thinking. Extracurriculars do not matter except in how they speak to who you are as an applicant. A large number of poorly thought-out extracurriculars doesn't help. A small number of things that you are passionate about and have done well at is far more valuable to your education and to your profile as an applicant.",
