  "text": "Obligatory throwaway account notification\\*\\*\n\nSo title sounds crazy, and I'm sure there are many exceptions to what I'm about to share, but maybe, just maybe, there is a bit of truth in my story. **I know my story doesn't always apply to other cases**, but I will share anyways. \n\nI'm a current senior attending a prestigious t10 university. It doesn't matter which one really, and I won't specify for privacy, but most of them are about the same level of rigor. I was one of those kids that was *Ivy League Bound* in high school. 4.0 GPA, 1500+ SAT, a buffet of AP classes. I  was the president of 3 clubs, varsity sports, concertmaster of orchestra, won writing awards and science scholarships and all that jazz that you see circulating around A2C. \n\nMy teachers told me I was brilliant. And I believed them. \n\nBut I had a secret. After coming home from all my  club meetings and track practices and violin lessons, I sat down and studied for hours upon hours upon hours. I stayed up until 2 am most nights and got up at 6 to start the whole shebang again. \n\nAlthough I was jacked up on AP classes, things didn't come that easily to me, especially math and science. Which was a problem, because I was a prospective premed engineering major. I would study twice as hard as everyone else to get the exact same grade, and I know that it's impossible to know for sure how much other people studied, but from anonymous surveys and several different testimonials, I was studying a lot harder than other people and it was not paying off. But I fought tooth and nail and finally got an A (along with 90% of the class lol).\n\nI wasn't happy with my life and many of my activities I didn't enjoy, but I kept on pushing because I wanted to get into my Dream School ^(tm). Sometimes I lost sight of my dream. I started saving up my antidepressants in my sock drawer just in case I felt the sudden urge to end it all. But I thought that \"if I can just make it through high school it will all be ok\".\n\nSo fast forward to April of my senior year. I was extremely blessed when I got my first t20 acceptance from Duke \\*yay\\*, and I was like \"this is it, this is what I've been killing myself for\". It was nice to feel validated for my efforts. I picked a prestigious private university over my state school and had a \"college reveal party\" and it felt so good to be done. \n\nBut the thing is, once you get accepted to an Ivy League or t20 university, you are not done. It gets 10x harder from there. I moved into a larger pond, and I was surrounded by some of the best and brightest students in the world. Most of which didn't have to try in high school and were somewhat naturally gifted. We had so many math whizzes in our engineering department that it became so hard to keep up. I studied constantly and neglected working out, showering, eating, and enjoying my life. \n\nBut no matter how hard I studied, no matter which study techniques I used, my grades were just mediocre. Grade inflation may keep you from failing, but it doesn't keep you from getting bad grades. I was depressed and suicidal and I was seriously considering dropping out of college. My whole life I had the mentality \"if I work hard enough, I can get ahead\", and while that is somewhat true, sometimes you just can't do any better. \n\nSometimes no matter what you do, it isn't enough. \n\nThings have gotten a bit better, but not good enough for me to be a competitive medical school applicant. I am going to a different school to get my Masters and then reapply to medical school. \n\nThis is not to tell you that you shouldn't have a dream school or that you shouldn't go to a t20. My advice is: Don't let getting into college consume your life. Do activities you love instead of resume builders. Don't lie to yourself, you know you are doing *some* things just to put on your resume.  I, being the pre-med gunner I was, stocked shelves at the hospital for 10 minutes a day to bolster my resume, even though it literally did nothing for myself or the hospital except give me a talking point on my application. \n\nRemember, YOU have control over your life. Not the admissions committee. I felt like getting into college controlled me, and I let it take away my adolescence because of it. \n\nStudy, but don't study to the point of neglecting your mental, social, emotional, or physical health. Study for the SAT, but don't waste thousands of dollars on prep courses, prep books, tutoring, and retaking it 6 times because you want a 1550. \n\nMy t10 university was not the place for me because I tried to live my life in terms of my high school resume instead of doing things I loved, regardless of if they weren't resume builders or not. If I was my true self, I probably wouldn't have gotten into my \"dream school\", but that's okay, because I would have fit in a less competitive environment. \n\nIf you try to live as yourself instead of living what colleges want you to be, you will end up where you are meant to end up. \n\nIf you are still reading this, thank you for listening :))",

          "text": "Medical schools care about your GPA, MCAT score, and what you did in college. Of course, they look at your undergrad and may take it into consideration. If you go to a school known for grade deflation and have a lower GPA but have a solid MCAT score, they may be a little more understanding of your GPA. Generally speaking though an applicant from the University of Arizona with a 4.0 GPA, 520 MCAT, solid extracurriculars and LORs, and a strong personal statement will beat out the applicant from Harvard with a 3.5 GPA, 500 MCAT, and unimpressive extracurriculars because he didn't have the time in between all of his studying. \n\nMed school is also very expensive. My wife turned down an Ivy League school in favor of her state school because she knew she wanted to go to medical school and her state school (T50) had a solid biology program. Saving money was important and med schools know that. She got into her top ranked medical school and, while there were some Ivy Leaguers there, there were also plenty of students from state schools, LAC, and small schools she never heard of. Not much has changed. The residents and younger doctors at her hospital also vary a lot in where they went to undergrad. It only really comes up during college football or basketball season and she is always surprised to learn that the guy who went to Duke for med school got his undergrad degree from Kansas State or the woman who got her medical degree from Stanford spend her undergrad at the University of Oklahoma. If you are planning on going to med school, consider the cost and where you can succeed academically. Undergrad prestige matters for some majors but people on the premed track shouldn't let that consume them.",

You said you were told you were brilliant, and I'm sure you've received your fair share of adulation, but the fruits of your tireless labor aren't completely in vain.\n\nEven though you getting into a t20 school is a clear testament to this, you've got good storytelling and cohesion in your writing. I know it's just a reddit post or maybe it took you all of five minutes, but I genuinely enjoyed reading it. \n\nI felt for you. You unearthed my empathy. I needed to know what was your next step, if you were going up a rung on your ladder. \n\nEither you've heard this more often than you care to remember or hardly ever. \n\nI appreciate you taking the time to create the post that you did. It really puts things into perspective, and helps me cement the ideas in my head about college.\n\nOP, thank you. I'm excited for you to earn your degrees, and best of luck to you, and remember to take this as a sign. Personal reflection doesn't come easy, especially in your situation. I applaud you for your dedication and hope to see you on a billboard, magazine, front page of the paper, or even sitting in your corner office at the zenith of a popular building. \ud83d\udc99",

      "text": "It\u2019s interesting how we find ourselves on similar yet fundamentally unique journeys. \nI was like you in high school, tons of extra curricular activities, a buffet of honors and AP classes, but I was super chill about it. \n\nI busted ass when it counted like learning to write research papers and essays in a crunch in one day or one hour at times, and that served me super well in college. I did average effort or less but got superior grades, and then each time moved in and up to the next thing. That left me with enough time to myself for hanging with friends, alone time with my thoughts in nature, recreational sports, computer skills, video games, and picked up some disciplined martial arts training for several years. \n\nI didn\u2019t have any pressing aspiration for Ivy League college, so I took the SAT once with no prep, got a good enough score for acceptance to an honors program at the nearby state university, and enjoyed in-state tuition fully subsidized. In college, I expanded the extra curriculars to more social activities, took extra PEs all the time which is highly recommend both for the activity and camaraderie, and really came into my own maintaining an unimaginably large but mostly shallow real life social network (this predated in-line social networks by a few years.)\n\nI also aspired to medical school and attended a respectable non-Ivy League medical school, marched in my chosen specialty in a major metropolitan area, and went to a top tier fellowship that I landed in part from interviewing skills, in part having superiorly practiced technical skills, and in part from having the drive to show up in person at a smaller scale event sponsored by prospective mentors and asking to be considered. And just like that, there were basically no closed doors professionally speaking. \n\nPeople make a big deal about where they go to college, and it\u2019s somewhat important, but the most important thing for future prospects is how you present yourself, followed by the last place you worked or trained and who will vouch for you from there. \n\nIf you are adequately prepared for life\u2019s next stage, if you are known for some forms of competence, the names of places on your resume matter rather diminishingly. This life is your adventure. Choose wisely that you may reap both the most benefit and the most enjoyment at each and every stage. \n\nThere are times that good work ethic you mention will come into play. When you are doing the indentured servitude if your professional training, when you are starting a business or professional practice, that nose to grindstone mentality will distinguish you. Just be sure you set limits and stick to them lest you find yourself in the throes of burnout like so many successful people of our time. \n\nCheers to you and your potential.",

Furthermore, your top school is gonna be expensive since most are private and will likely make you pay full tuition unless you get FA or a scholarship. If you already feel like you have the grades/ resume to go to a top school, apply to a few state schools because odds are they will give out a handsome scholarship for you to attend. Believe me, college is expensive, so know that you might have the opportunity to go to a school at a significantly reduced price, even if the prestige isn\u2019t where you want it to be.",

If you use the worst ranking on the market, the only \"t10 university\" without a committee letter is Stanford (if your grades were just mediocre, you probably won't get a committee letter at other schools, which probably saved yourself the disappointment).   My advice to freshmen (as a peer advisor) is that if you think you can survive as an engineering premed, your academics is so strong that you don't need engineering as a backup (unless you are really interested in engineering). The most likely scenario is people can't handle both engineering and premed and they end up dropping out of premed.",

I traded a good college and scholarships for happiness, strong friendships, and mental health. So many teachers and my parents kept telling me i was \"gifted\" or im just super smart but that's just how i come off i guess but in reality i knew i wasn't so i didn't kill myself for 4 years trying to be what others said i was. I know if i tried really really hard i could get a scholarship or 2 and get into a good in state college but im happy where i am and the community college im enrolled in.
