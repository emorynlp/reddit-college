  "text": "I submitted my Common app for yale yesterday on time (around 9:50 pm cst). I received my yale confirmation email and portal this morning. However on the portal it says my application and recs and transcripts were received on 11/2 when i submitted 11/1. Also it says i applied early action round when i did restrictive early action. it does say my common app was submitted 11/1 but says received 11/2. Is this okay and yale portal is just on a different time zone?",
