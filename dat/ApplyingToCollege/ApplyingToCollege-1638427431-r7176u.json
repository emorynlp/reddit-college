  "text": "I couldn\u2019t get a chance to attend the virtual Q and A today so it would be very kind if someone could answer my questions.\nQ1 - Can you win twice in the same category? As in can I win twice for flash fiction for example.\nQ2 - How exactly do regional awards work? Is it if you win regional your story is now a contender for national awards or if you win regional now your stuck? Can two stories win regional awards?\nQ3 - If you submit a portfolio can you win a national award for the scholarship and simultaneously submit each individual story and win for those. Like they have specific scholarships for portfolios that are separate from the individual stories. So can the stories that are included in the portfolio win individually and then the portfolio as a whole can win too? \nQ4 - God forbid if I were to miss the deadlines is there any way I can still submit if I have a reasonable excuse?(assuming I can get in contact with someone from the awards)\nQ5 - Is there a word limit for sci-fi/Fantasy?",

      "text": "1) yes.\n2) what the other guy said- if you get a gold regionals it gets considered in nationals.\n3) yes. Every portfolio piece can also be considered individually.\n4) if you miss the deadline you can\u2019t submit. It\u2019s not like college applications where it\u2019ll affect your whole future. You can email them, but in 90% of cases the deadline is the deadline.\n5) just go look at their website. Can\u2019t tell you off the top of my head but it\u2019s on there.",
