  "text": "Last year, I received an F and a couple of C's and D's because I was suffering from an illness. As of now, I have a 3.5 weighted and a 3.3 unweighted, and I'm expected to have over a 4.0W by the time I reach senior year. Should I apply to my school of choice(T50) or should I attend CC and transfer? \nContext: I'm a junior.",
