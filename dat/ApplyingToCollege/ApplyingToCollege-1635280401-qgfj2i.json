  "text": "TW: Seizures\n\nOkay. I experienced Epileptical seizures for\u2026 almost 6 years. It proceeded nearly all through my Freshman year, however finished during the portion of the final quarter. \n\nThe thing is, It influenced my grades severely. I put on weight, turned into an Introvert and so on, and was essentially not in a decent state. \n\nI was contemplating talking how I lost weight, got new interests ( CS bc I used to sit at my home the entire day ), and worked on my grades in the wake of recuperating. (Freshman CGPA was 8.3/10 and Junior is 10/10). \n\nI've seen many posts on this sub which basically say to abstain from talking about topics like these, which is the reason i'm quite conflicted at the moment.\n\nPs: I apply next year.",

      "text": "I'm not really sure how you could write a good essay about this topic. What did you learn from this experience? What important traits does it show about you? Why would this make the AO want to admit you? I don't think this essay would provide good answers to any of those questions. That said, if you have a unique experience that would answer those questions, then go ahead and write about it.",

              "text": "I understand and agree that this was definitely an important part of your life, and that there was a lot going on. But again, what does this tell the AO about you? What important parts of your personality would shine through this essay? Obviously I don't have much to go on here, but based on what you wrote in the post I'm not sure that this essay would provide effective answers to those questions.\n\nEdit: Also, you're a junior. You have time to experiment. Write the essay and see how you feel about it, then change it if you don't like it.",
