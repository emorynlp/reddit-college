  "text": "So a month ago I was torn between applying early to UPenn vs. Stanford. I applied to UPenn under *binding* ED believing that I have a very low chance for Stanford CS so decided to play safer by applying to UPenn Wharton (which has a \\~20% acceptance rate for ED).\n\nMy ECs have improved quite a bit since then and I genuinely feel like:\n\n* If I get accepted into UPenn I'll regret it a lot, believing I played too safe but binded to attend\n* If I get rejected then Stanford is out of the question\n\nWhat should I do? Really, *Stanford* is my dream school (Just a personal opinion. UPenn is great no hate on Penn intended)",

I think these are just like momentary thoughts like \"Did I make a mistake? I'm good enough for Stanford, right? Yeah I am. I should have applied REA!!\" But you're thinking this in heat of the moment. Sit back, relax a bit, think calmly about it. Don't think about Stanford, think about the consequences of you withdrawing your ED application from Upenn. Think about it for like 15-60 min. If you think that you can handle them, go ahead and withdraw it. Remember that you're bound to feel a strong feeling of guilt once you withdraw it, not to mention the even bigger feeling of guilt if you get rejected from Stanford after that. So think long and hard before coming to a decision.\n\n\n(P.S. Students make an institution. Without students, both UPenn and Stanford are just pretty buildings of no use. I think both of them have amazing resources which will help you achieve whichever goals you have.",

The three possibilities here are going to Stanford, which would open many doors, going to Penn, which would open many albeit a lower number of doors, or going somewhere else where their dream likely will die. The chance of 1 happening is quite low, and I have a fundamentally different philosophy compared to you in that regard because I do not think it is wise to risk what you already have that is more likely to happen and still be decently good for something that will be unlikely to happen.\n\nWe differ in philosophies, so I guess it is up to OP to decide which philosophy they would rather have.",
