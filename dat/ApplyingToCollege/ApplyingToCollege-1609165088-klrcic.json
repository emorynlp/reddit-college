  "title:": "The final push is now. Never forget all the work you've put in for these applications.",
  "text": "We have 4 more days until our apps need to be turned in.\n\nYou have busted your asses off for 4 years of high school to have a shot at getting into these amazing schools. But you're telling me you want to procrastinate during the final push? This push that matters most?\n\nThe one you were working towards when you stayed up at ungodly hours to study for a test, or you weren't able to hang out with friends because of some academic commitment, or when someone joked around that you wouldn't be able to get into your dream school?\n\nProve them all wrong.\n\nAnything that you write within the next 5 days will determine your future for the rest of your life. \n\nWith this being said, forget about all the smaller things you are worrying about right now. Forget about why your friend isn't texting you back. Every time you check your social media, feel guilty that you're putting your future and education at risk. Stop picking up your phone to see if that one person you're waiting to get a text from has texted you. These are all things you will forget about in a couple of weeks, if not days.\n\nHave something to look forward to when RD decisions come out. Have no doubt in your mind that you submitted the BEST version of your apps and this was all you could have given.\n\nGood luck A2C!",

      "text": "It\u2019s difficult for me to find any motivation to finish my RD apps because they\u2019re all for my reach schools. I didn\u2019t work throughout high school for a chance to get into those\u2014rather, my focus was only on getting lots of AP/DE credit and taking hard classes so that I could get a good scholarship to my state flagship. In fact, I never realized I perhaps had a chance at the T20s until I got my SAT/ACT scores back early junior year (by then, arguably too late). This is a nice reminder that I shouldn\u2019t give up. Thanks for the push.",
