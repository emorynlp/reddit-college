      "text": "That is (mostly) correct. The score is calculated by adding your score index on each of the SAT sections out of a possible 40 (although since PSAT is only up to 38, it's capped at 38 per section - reading, writing, math). Then the sun is multiplied by 2 to get your qualifying index score. Ex. a 40r 32w 36m would be (38+32+36)*2 = 212 NMSQT index score.\n\nEdit: In case it wasn't clear, I said mostly because it's done by section for 3 sections (reading, writing, math) not 2.",
