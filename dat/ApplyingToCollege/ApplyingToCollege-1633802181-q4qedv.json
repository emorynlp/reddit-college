  "text": "I'm filling out my common app and I've done a lot of volunteering during highschool but some of these organizations have yet to resume since Covid started. I'm really passionate about some of these organizations but I technically have not volunteered with them since they had events in 10th grade. Should I make a note that they have temporarily stopped their events due to Covid?",
