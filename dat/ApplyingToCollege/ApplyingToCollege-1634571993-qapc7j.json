  "text": "Hey everyone, \n\nI'm almost done applying Early Action for Some of my Colleges(Purdue, Georgiatech,etc.) And I was wondering when I should order my score reports to send to these colleges. Common App doesn't have a specific date and so I was wondering when I should send them(and have 2 weeks before the due date for all the processing).",

Others may accept scores self-reported in the app or portal, for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll.",
