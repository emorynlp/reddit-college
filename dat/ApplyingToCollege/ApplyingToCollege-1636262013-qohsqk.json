However I can apply what I learned to working for the modern versions of the institutions that I study, or to places helping people deal with the repercussions of said history. It isn\u2019t as direct of an application of study, but it is close enough for me to feel like I\u2019ll feel fulfilled. Of course this approach is not for everyone. I still encourage you to take a history course or two as electives if you are interested in the subject.",
