  "text": "\nMy friend switched to a forensics class early on and told me it was super easy, and now I regret staying in Chemistry, which is quite confusing for me\n\nIf a college saw that I had a 75% in Chem (which I think is what I\u2019d end up with) would it be seen as more impressive compared to an easier class like forensics?\n\nI just don\u2019t want to regret not switching to Forensics. It might be too late to switch now and I\u2019m worried that by sticking with a class like Chem, which I\u2019m not very good in, it would hurt my chances of getting into college compared to if I went to Forensics, which I likely would have succeeded in",

There will also probably be some info on switching classes in there as well.\n\nMy kids' school offers forensics but it doesn't count toward the required 3? years of lab science for graduation.  It's essentially an extra science elective for kids looking at STEM or health sciences majors.  At their school both bio and chem are pre-reqs for forensics.",
