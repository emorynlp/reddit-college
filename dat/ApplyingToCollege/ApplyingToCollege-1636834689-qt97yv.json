  "title:": "Should I take Computer Science A or Computer Science Principles?",
  "text": "Hey there,\n\nI'm thinking about potentially going into computer science for college and was wondering which one I should take. I know that Computer Science A is much more code focused and principles is much more about real world applications. I'm interested in both is there one colleges like to see more especially if I am going to be going into Computer Science? Thanks!\n\nEdit: I am self studying but am taking a CS class in school right now. I also have a good amount of experience in CS.",

      "text": "As someone who has taken both, CSP is a waste of time especially if you are familiar with coding logic and if your class will teach using block coding. There were people in my CSA class that had no previous experience in coding and still did well in the class. This could vary school to school so you should ask people from your school who have taken the class to make a better choice",

I took CSP last year, and it was my second worst class I've taken in high school, even though I want to pursue computer science. The concepts were so basic and common sense. CSA is a lot better and a lot more fun, but it's rlly basic that it doesn't teach much. I like programming projects, but not doing anything new is a bit boring. It's best if you take both, but if you had to choose, do CSA",
