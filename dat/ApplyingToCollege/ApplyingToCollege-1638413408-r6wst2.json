  "text": "I applied Harvard REA and lost all the hope by now. In case I don\u2019t get in, I should probably apply ED2 to another highly selective university to increase my chances. Do not bring up WashU, I live too close to it to apply, as I want to run away from my toxic household (WashU is 20 minutes from there, I won\u2019t survive it). Where else could I apply ED2 within 4-8 hours drive from STL?",
