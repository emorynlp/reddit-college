  "text": "I hate that we live in a culture where our college essays have to be this unique work of art. I hate it I hate it hate.\n\nLike I\u2019m working on my drafts, and reading them back I\u2019m thinking to myself \u201chm this isn\u2019t really original but I think it\u2019s pretty well done\u201d but I\u2019m CONSTANTLY reminded that not being original is bad. All the tips I\u2019ve seen from past AOs and consultants and counselors have all recommended not being \u201cthat kid\u201d who uses the overused topic.\n\nLike MY BAD I didn\u2019t have some crazy experience in the forests of Brazil where I was enlightened to cure the disease that is cancer. MY BAD I\u2019m just an ordinary person with interests in an ordinary field. \n\nWhy does being unoriginal have to devalue all the work we\u2019ve done up until this point?? You\u2019re telling me we had to grind up our GPA, AP scores and ECs just to risk losing all our hardwork because a reader found an essay uninspiring?\n\nThis is silly. I feel so overwhelmed.",

Not to mention a lot of them sound of conceited, virtuous tones.\n\nAlso know that these kind of prompts can be found nowhere outside of the college admissions world because they serve no other purpose than for students to tacitly humble brag about themselves and attempt to show why a college needs to accept them. Sure, some essays can be very unique, thought-provoking, heartfelt, or entertaining; the vast majority, however, is just bad writing and should never be used as an example in real world writing.",
