      "text": "Your Counselor is exaggerating a little bit. Simply put, you fit your fun time in based off your work/focus time. You\u2019ll have time for sports, hanging out with friends, parties, etc, But With that comes responsibilities; Make sure you finish all homework before going out. If you have a test on Friday study the whole week and not just the day before. Set a time Constraints so you turn typical wasted time into time for gaining knowledge and building on your student profile. Ex. Instead of just staying at home all summer or doing things that don\u2019t benefit you academically, cut come of that time out and put that towards an internship, research, side Projects & anything related to your major. \n\nMy Main point is that High School students always have a surplus amount of time where they aren\u2019t doing anything, so use that time wisely and split your free time into segments so you get to have fun while also making school a priority.",
