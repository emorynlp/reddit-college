      "text": "BU's page for this has actually vanished, for some reason.\n\nIn general, these programs are not binding once accepted at undergraduate.\n\nTypically, accelerated medical programs that are 8 years long grant an undergraduate degree at the 4 year mark, and give an option to waive admission to the medical school in exchange for the ability to apply elsewhere.\n\nSeven year programs can occasionally offer a bachelor's on completion of three years. The wording from what I could glean from BU was that BOTH degrees would be awarded at the 7 year mark, which is unusual, but would likely be binding. Some programs mesh in the medical courses with undergraduate studies. \n\nI would probably email them for confirmation.",
