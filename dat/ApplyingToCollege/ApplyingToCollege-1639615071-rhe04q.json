      "text": "I think the entire experience really enlightened me to how caught up I was with the pressure of what OTHERS thought of where I went to college rather than my own personal goals. Sitting alone in my room and reading the decision was much less depressing than I thought it would be, and in the end, I\u2019ll get a good education no matter where I go :)",
