  "title:": "Unsure whether my family circumstances will translate to American AOs?",
  "text": "In my UC PIQ 5 (significant challenges), I wrote about how I went to a highly-rated secondary school, and my self esteem took a hit because I was ashamed of my family background- I was from a single-parent family which wasn\u2019t financially well-off, while my classmates were all from nuclear families and the majority of them were upper/middle class with parents who worked professional jobs; but slowly, I started to learn to appreciate how my unique background made me more self-motivated and empathetic towards the socially disadvantaged.\n\nWhen I first wrote it, I was satisfied with how it turned out. But after looking at some data, I realised that single-parent families are far more common in the US than in my home country (I\u2019m international). And now I\u2019m not sure if AOs will understand my essay when it comes from my cultural context? I\u2019m not sure how Americans view kids from single-parent families, but I do feel that there is a certain stigma surrounding these types of families in my home country, at least from my experiences growing up. Now I don\u2019t know what to do about this\ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "In your essay, you can do what you just did here - add the context that in your country single parent families are not looked favorably. But my suggestion would be not to dwell too much on that. Spend majority of your essay on what you learned and how you grew from the experience. It should be fine. I understood it perfectly, so will AOs. Good luck.",

      "text": "I am certain the AO will be able to at very least empathize. No doubt your case, still unique in its own right, will not be the first time or first instance of a single-parent family situation from abroad. And so even though it\u2019s not uncommon, it\u2019s relatable. \n\nIf your situation motivated you and holds great meaning, I would write about it and focus on the cultural, the stigma in your country and not on what it means in the States or to the AO because that\u2019s nothing to do with how it affected *you*.",
