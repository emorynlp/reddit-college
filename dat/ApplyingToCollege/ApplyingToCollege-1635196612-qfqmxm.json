  "text": "Hi I plan to apply for MIT and have gotten a 35 on my ACT. However my SAT is only 1470, below what they expect/average. Should I send my SAT score then still as it is test optional or will it only hurt me? (This also applies to a few Ivy League schools I\u2019ll be applying to later). Thanks!",
