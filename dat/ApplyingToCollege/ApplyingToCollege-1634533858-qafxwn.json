  "text": "Hi all, I don't even know how to start this off sorry. i'm an asian immigrant senior who goes to a competitive public high school in socal. Although people around me keep saying that I did really well considering the circumstances I was in, it doesn't even feel real. i'm not trying to say that that are faking it or anything, but I just feel like I didn't give my best at school, extracurricular, ... etc. The idea of \"I could've done something\" keeps bothering me to the point where I started hating myself. I have 4.25 W/3.91UW GPA and although it's not that bad, it kinda is considering that I will be competeing against other asian kids who have 4.7 gpa... AIME... etc. What makes this even worse is that i'm applying as a cs major and the only things i really have are gpa, unbalanced 1530 sat(730rw/800m), and a couple of club board position(not culb predident or vice prez). Sorry for ranting here I didn't know who else i could talk about this with",
