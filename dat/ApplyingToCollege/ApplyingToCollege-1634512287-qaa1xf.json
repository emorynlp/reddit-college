  "text": "So I am just trying to avoid paying the application fee, but the waiver code I got sent is only valid by the 18th. I have everything else completed in my application except the official documents. I have already sent the requests for it, but it will probably be a couple more weeks until my counselor uploads them. If I submit my application without the official documents uploaded, can my counselor still add the rec letter/transcript to coalition afterwards? Or do I have to wait to submit?",
