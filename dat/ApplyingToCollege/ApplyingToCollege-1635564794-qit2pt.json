      "text": "Probably yes, but it's hard to find out what they are without poring over a ton of Common Data Set data.  This is doubly complicated by the fact that some schools don't provide data for the GPA section, and there's no single standard for how schools calculate the GPA numbers they do report.  What one school considers a \"3.5\" might not be what another school considers a \"3.5\".\n\nBest bet is maybe to look for schools where:\n\n1. Their SAT range is much higher than their US News ranking \\*and\\* they are not STEM-focused (STEM-focused schools tend to have SAT ranges that outstrip their ranking).\n2. They offer guaranteed merit scholarships based on SAT score (with a fairly modest GPA requirement; often it's something like 3.25 or 3.5).\n\nYou might also consider going \"down\" in selectivity until you find a school where your SAT score woudl put you in the top cohort of applicants.  Top 25% at the very least, but probably higher than that.  When you're score is *that* much better than the median applicant's they somewhat more willing to overlook a sub-standard GPA.",

It's worse than having straight As all throughout high school (but you probably know that) and better than having a downward trend. That I can say with certainty; I would personally not write my essay solely about it because that on its on probably doesn't present a compelling reason to admit you, especially next to constant (near) 4.0 students. If you want, you could mention it in the additional information section.",
