Also, no\u2014I myself am not trans.***\n\nslightly more user-friendly method which might come in handy for:\n\n\u2014 folks whose parents/guardians/etc are aware of inspect element\n\n\u2014 folks who want to replace their preferred name with their actual name or some other option without changing any information on the application\n\nthis sounds incredibly counterintuitive, but there's a profanity filter browser extension for Firefox and Chrome (and by association, Opera/Opera GX) and you can configure it to replace your preferred name with your legal name or some other option without your parents batting any eyes. ^(safari also has a similar extension but it is not by the same developer\u2014richard frost\u2014and it is paid\u2014prices vary\u2014so i would be careful there)\n\nfirefox link: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/advanced_profanity_filter/\n\ngoogle chrome link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-profanity-filter/piajkpdbaniagacofgklljacgjhefjeh\n\nopera extension to support google chrome extensions (OPERA USERS, THIS NEEDS TO BE INSTALLED FIRST BEFORE INSTALLING THE GOOGLE CHROME PROFANITY EXTENSION):  https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/install-chrome-extensions/\n\nsafari for macos and ios (warning\u2014paid extension, also not by the same developer so i have not tested this): https://apps.apple.com/us/app/profanity-filter-for-safari/id1545964301\n\nmobile versions of browsers besides safari will not have access to other extensions of this function and caliber as of time of writing\n\nhope this helps\n\nedit: after reading teresajs's comment i would like to clarify that these solutions aren't intended to last long-term, as paper communications will be quite the tenacious factor later down the road\n\nedit 2: wording and disclaimer\n\nedit 3: more wording tweaks and credits to proper person(s)",

Multiple colleges that my child (NB) applied to have sent me (the parent) emails (\"We're so excited your child applied to our school\") and those emails all used my kid's preferred name.\n\nSimilarly, my oldest (MtF) didn't add their preferred name until after they were accepted to college.  But their college has contacted us here at the house for fundraising purposes and used my daughter's preferred pronouns.\n\nBasically, if you tell the school your preferred name and pronouns, the school will use them in reference to you.",
