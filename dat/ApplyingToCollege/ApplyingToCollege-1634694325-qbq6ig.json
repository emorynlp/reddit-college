  "text": "Hello fellow Enlighted members of A2C. I had a quick question regarding my ECS. If I choose to do school sports, I will miss out on opportunities to pursue academic clubs like Model UN, S&D etc. because many of them have mandatory meetings. I wanted to know which of them would make me more competitive for colleges. Will colleges even really appreciate the time commitment I put into sports?",
