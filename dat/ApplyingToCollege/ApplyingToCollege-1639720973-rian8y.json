  "text": "Basically the title, I got rejected from Penn ED today, and I really loved the school and programs that it offered. I know that rejection is redirection and it isn\u2019t the place that was for me, but I can\u2019t really shake that feeling of dread that I have and I really feel like I can\u2019t get in anywhere other than my safeties. To add insult to injury, there are 4 people who got into Penn ED from my school and I just feel way too inadequate. Any tips to get over it and move on, or should I just soldier through with it?",
