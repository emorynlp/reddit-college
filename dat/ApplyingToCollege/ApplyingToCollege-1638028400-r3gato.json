  "text": "Hey guys so I\u2019m a avid dungeons and dragons player and I absolutely love the game. I haven\u2019t been able to play recently cause *cough* college apps *cough* but I have been a avid player from 9th to 11th and I plan on making a club or joining a game after like January. But it being something I\u2019d like to do in college I was wondering if I should add it on my apps too as something I like to do? And if I were to how\u2019d I go about it? I\u2019ve applied to 6 out of 13/14 schools already so I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s relevant?",
