This process is a whirlwind of emotions but I just wanted to say for everyone who didn\u2019t get the mid-December news you wanted, there is a college out there that wants you 10x more than the. one that rejected you. And the hard work is worth it regardless.",

You will still get a high quality education and depending on your field of study, it may in fact be a better option for you vs other top tier schools. If you go, just be aware of the party scene. It can be a distraction (at any college for that matter).",

I can\u2019t speak about the quality of the business program, but I can tell you I LOVE MSU and East Lansing.  \n\nI am out of school now, but when I was in college out of state, I came home in the summers and took physics and organic chemistry at MSU with MSU students, and I was able to apply the credits and satisfy the course requirements for my own college.  The quality of the classes was great, and it is one of the best decisions I made during college because I could spend time with my family, hang out in the home I grew up in and knock out 2 core requirements.\n\nThe MSU campus is really nice - it is a land grant college so the campus is very large.  The Red Cedar River runs through the center of campus. There are botanical gardens, walking and biking paths and you can rent a canoe and take a trip down the river.  I highly recommend you seriously consider MSU.",
