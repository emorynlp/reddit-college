  "text": "Yesterday, Georgetown deferred me. Today, I woke up to damn near a full ride at one of my safeties. This process is a whirlwind of emotions but I just wanted to say for everyone who didn\u2019t get the mid-December news you wanted, there is a college out there that wants you 10x more than the. one that rejected you. And the hard work is worth it regardless.",
