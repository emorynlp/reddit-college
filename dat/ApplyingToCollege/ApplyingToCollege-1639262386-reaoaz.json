  "text": "idk what the acronyms are but the ones that go like AIME, USAMO, USACO??, IMO or whatever tf. Literally no one in my school has heard of them and I doubt anyone from my district or even state knows about them either. Ppl who got into T5s from my school, esp MIT, didn\u2019t do them/know abt them either so I\u2019m curious where/what regions these competitions are popular since I see so many people on here stressing about/feeling unworthy about the fact that they haven\u2019t done them",

      "text": "AIME/USAMO is the American math competition track to try and get on the American IMO (international math olympiad) team. Internationals can take the AMC+AIME, but they can\u2019t proceed further since only those residing in the US can be on the US team. Your country certainly has its own process for getting on its IMO team. IMO is the most competitive and prestigious of the official olympiads, but there\u2019s also a physics olympiad, chemistry olympiad, etc. USACO is a series of coding competitions with different levels to get on the US coding olympiad team. \n\nThey\u2019re popular with just competitive kids in general, although naturally more wealthy/competitive areas will have a higher concentration of participating students. They\u2019re absolutely not necessary for getting into top schools. (And you can achieve those things and still be rejected by T5s.)",
