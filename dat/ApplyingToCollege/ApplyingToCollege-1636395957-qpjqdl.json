  "text": "In some cases, my SAT score's above/between the college average but not exactly on par with their top scholarship recipients. They have November deadlines, so should I apply Test-optional for the time being and then send them a good score from the December SAT (if I get one, that is)? Or is applying without a score worse than applying with an average one?",

Also this was last year, so they may have changed policies. but something to consider ig.",
