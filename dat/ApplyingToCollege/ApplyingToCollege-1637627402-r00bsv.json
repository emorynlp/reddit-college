  "text": " Hi all, I inquired about this matter to each school's admission office but they are taking a bit too long to reply, so I was hoping if I could get some insight from people here.\n\nI graduated high school in Canada last year in June and currently in South Korea. I am holding a temporary permanent residency visa card, and planning to visit the U.S. in January to get my regular green card.\n\nAs a university in Florida consider me an international student, I'm wondering if that standard applies to every other schools.\n\nOn Coalition, it says \"some schools may consider you an international student\". Does that mean some schools can consider me a domestic student?\n\nI understand that I cannot say that I'm a permanent resident right now, but once I get my green card, can I change my status? Or is it still impossible because I attended high school in Canada, not in the U.S.?",

For UF, I\u2019m not sure if that means they\u2019ll put you in the admissions pile with other intl students, which is generally more competitive. But for financial aid, you should be treated as a domestic student once you have the green card since I believe that would make you eligible for FAFSA. \n\nThis is a bit of a weird scenario with UF. From what I\u2019ve seen, most colleges determine domestic/international status based on citizenship (or holding a green card)",

They also say that domestic vs.international does not impact admissions, which is not true for many other universities.\n\nBut yes, different colleges may classify you differently.",
