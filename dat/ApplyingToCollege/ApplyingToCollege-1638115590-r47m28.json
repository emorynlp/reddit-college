  "text": "I applied to Rutgers using the Coalition application. On the activities section of coalition it allows me to fill in my leadership positions and extra awards I received. However, after looking at my activities and experiences section on my Rutgers profile, almost everything is blank except for the title, and it doesn\u2019t show a single leadership position that I mentioned in Coalition. Is this supposed to happen or should I restart my application directly through Rutgers?",
