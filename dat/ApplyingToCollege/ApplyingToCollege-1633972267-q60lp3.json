  "title:": "Include Undergrad Transfer/Master's Drop Out on New Bachelor Application?",
  "text": "While I graduated from my undergrad in two years, I had to transfer due to financial and familial strains. As one can assume, I finished the degree at the age of 20 and begun a one year Master's program in the same year, 2020. Before the year was over, *I dropped out of the program due to being bullied by a professor and complications to the integrity of the program due to COVID-19*. I now am switching subjects and will most likely be going back for a second Bachelor's program. Part of the problem is I have relevant coursework from the Master's program. ***I am wondering if it is wise to mention my transfer or failed attempt at a Master's program in the application.*** \n\nThank you for taking the time to read/respond!",
