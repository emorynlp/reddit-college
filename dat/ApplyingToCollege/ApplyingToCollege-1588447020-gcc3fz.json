Social life is lacking, and there isnt a whole lot of \u201cfun\u201d to be done there, which is something a lot of ppl look forward to in a college experience. \n\nAlso, many pre-meds make the *dumb* mistake of choosing jhu because of their name recognition, but the last place youd wnna go as a pre-med is somewhere where 60%+ of the student body is also pre med. Like I cant even imagine the amount of competition youd face not only academically, but also in regards to your ECs. To give you an example, a close friend of mine is a junior at jhu as a pre-med and she told me stories that some of the labs there have 3-4 undergrad spots with over a 100 students applying.",

          "text": "My sister is a freshman at Hopkins and adores it there. She's always talking about the amazing friends she's made there. However, there is admittedly a competitive aspect to the school; in some ways, more socially than academically. I forget what they're called, but I know there are some hierarchical clubs that you need to apply to/kinda have connections to get accepted into. (Yes, you have to apply for these clubs. I think you'll know the one's I'm talking about once you get on campus.) But aside from that, kids seem really nice.\n\nWhen school was still going on, I visited my sister for a week there and it was honestly a blast. She showed me around the buildings (and some parties) and every single person I met was so kind and lively. I think it's hard to see the life that goes on in the campus because most of it is indoors; and not in the quiet buildings they showcase during the tours. The main libraries and stuff are always packed with students having fun, chatting, and studying.\n\nFor context, my sister started as a English and Poly Sci major. Now she's in International Relations and Environmental Studies. Hopkins has a *lot* of flexibility when it comes to choosing your major. (My sister basically wrote her essay on that and she's now on the Essays that Worked page.)\n\nJust stay away from the edges of campus. Muggings are frequent.\n\nEdit: I read your recent comment concerning resources at Hopkins. (Like most great schools,) Hopkins receives billions of dollars each year specifically for research opportunities. I even took the formal tour while I was there; they explained how students can pursue virtually anything they want once they talk to a counselor (or something like that?) about it. (However, presenter's bias.) As said, you'd likely have more difficulty as a pre-med. Other than that, you're fine. As for teachers, honestly I haven't heard jack about 'em.",
