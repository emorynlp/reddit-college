  "text": "Obvious answer: *probably not*\n\nBut it hurts knowing that I have such high odds of my getting into my dream school; GA Tech. It feels like that academic grind for 12 years was worth *average*. \n\nAnd it sucks, even more, knowing **what** is keeping you from getting into your dream school. For me, it was *one test* that determines the tier of colleges I'll get into. I can't complain, I've always felt like I could've done better; I'm sure many others felt worse. But that pain of being *average* when you put in the effort to go above that, can you really put it into words?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt makes me want to find those bad things about my dream school and just nail it into my head, y'know that thing where you can make a headache better by hitting your head.",

      "text": "Very sorry you feel this way and I can imagine what youre feeling.  Nothing is worse than knowing your hard work didn\u2019t pay off as you had envisioned and hoped.  But please know this\u2014 where you go to school isn\u2019t so much a big deal as you think so long as you maximize your opportunities wherever you go.  I have been out of school for many years and I have more perspective now \u2014 the \u201cdream\u201d school isn\u2019t all that it is cracked up to be.  You gotta take care of you and focus on looking forward and finding opportunities when one door closes!  Go out there and find other schools that will give you life fulfillment and satisfaction.\nDon\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket I\u2019ve learned!  Diversify! :-)",
