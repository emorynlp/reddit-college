  "text": "So I did some research with a professor last year, and I asked her for a letter of rec in September, and she said the earliest she could write it was mid-November. I want to apply to the University of Michigan, whose deadline is November 1, and Stanford, whose deadline is also November 1. She might submit it in late November, based on what she said, so should I just not include it in my application? I don't want to put my application in jeopardy because of her lazy ass.",
