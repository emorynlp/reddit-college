  "text": "i\u2019m applying nyu ed and i\u2019m conflicted about which letter of rec i should use for the other section.\n\n1. my superintendent who i have worked with to create a social justice club that i\u2019m vice president of. he knows me on a personal level and sent me the letter by accident and it\u2019s very good.\n\n2. my stepmom\u2019s friend who is a nyu alumni and is getting her doctorate from USC. she does not know me but i figured since she is alumni it might hold more weight.",
