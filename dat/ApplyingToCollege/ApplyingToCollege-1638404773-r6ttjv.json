  "text": " \n\nHello everyone, I'm seriously considering NYUAD as I just got invited to the candidate weekend. I'm wondering If it would be a good fit for me. I love to travel, I'm good with my studies, and everything about the school draws me. However, I have some worries. For one, I do really enjoy partying. I can sacrifice big parties for traveling and small dorm parties but if I'm more likely to be studying than having fun on a Friday night that's certainly a problem. This brings me to my second question, is there much free time? It seems from the things I've seen, people rarely are not studying.",
