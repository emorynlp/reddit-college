  "text": "I guess this could read like a diary entry, but I'm pretty sure I'm not alone in this so I decided to make it public. I'll probably look back at this and say, \"Damn, it ain't that deep. I didn't have to stress so bad.\" But hindsight 20/20, amirite?\n\nThis past semester has been pretty crazy for me. I still don't think I'm adjusted to in-person learning yet: my work ethic and discipline have been piss poor this entire semester and I've been seriously finessing all of my classes and it's coming to bite me in the butt. I've been mostly cramming right before a test and never was able to retain info. I used to be a good student\u2014staying on top of my work and ECs, being able to focus when needed, etc.\u2014but I haven't been able to get back into the groove. \n\nWhat's worse is that my grandfather passed away a few weeks ago. I made a post about it, I haven't been able to respond to the comments yet because it's still painful (but please know I appreciate every one of them). I don't know if I'm using his passing as an excuse. It feels like everything is an excuse now. My friends have been saying that it's normal for me to grieve, and something grieving symptoms can be confounded with burn out/depression symptoms so I shouldn't brush off my feelings. Yet I still feel guilty. \n\nI worked so hard my entire life to become this person that can make a difference, but I'm literally throwing it all away because I can't sit down and study for my finals that are in less than a week. I'll end up where I'm meant to. But at the same time, I can't help but feel as though I might've had a shot but my performance this semester might've ruined it. \n\nI'm rambling at this point. But I guess what I'm trying to say is: My grades aren't terrible. But it could've been better. And I'm scared that's going to affect something drastically, like some sort of karma for me. And it's not terrible to the point where AOs might think \"this girl is using her grandfather's passing as an excuse for just 1-2 Bs\". Or maybe I'm being paranoid right now. I know they're humans too and compassionate to some extent but I don't want me writing about his passing in my add. info to come off that way yk? \n\nAnd it feels like I'm wasting my parents' money, and they're going to be disappointed in me. I already had very little chances of getting into amazing reaches like Ivies but something that was SO AVOIDABLE if I could've just sat my ass down and studied might be a deciding factor? I can't live with that. Or maybe I can if I miraculously get into a reach. \n\nI'm apprehensive about starting to study. I'm burnt out. My grandfather's passing is affecting more than it should. I just want this semester to be over so I don't have to have lingering regrets before injury even occurred.",
