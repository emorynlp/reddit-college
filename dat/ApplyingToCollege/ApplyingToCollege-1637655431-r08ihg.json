      "text": "I think honors students get something like half off tuition. Otherwise the top 20% or so (outside of honors) of applicants get anywhere from 10-20k off each year via the deans scholarship. There are probably more selective, program specific scholarships too but I\u2019m not as familiar with those. (I\u2019m an neu student btw)",
