  "text": "I was browsing this subreddit and found lots of posts from you guys, and I\u2019ve something to say: YOU\u2019RE GOOD, breathe. You literally deserve to take a second, a minute, an hour and even a day. You\u2019re more than enough. Stop worrying about that SAT score, that essay, that EC section or the LOR teacher you\u2019re happy you asked. All will be well. You\u2019re awesome. Take some time for yourself and let your light flow and your self be. Don\u2019t let anyone dim your light, you bright and shining star. You shine so bright, it\u2019s a marvel to the eyes \ud83e\udd0d. Someone from the other side of the world, is cheering and rooting for you. Always and forever, Isa",
