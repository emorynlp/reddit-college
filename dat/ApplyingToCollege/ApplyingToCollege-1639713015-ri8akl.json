  "text": "What does \"priority consideration for interviews\" mean? Rice University said that in order to get priority for requesting an interview you had to have submitted your application by the 15th. Should I try to get it in the next few days and see if I can request an interview, or spend more time going over my short answers and maybe miss out on an interview?",

      "text": "I don\u2019t know. I applied RD but submitted my application on Dec 2 and even then I couldn\u2019t get an interview with a current senior and have to have the interview with an alumni. I got my credentials for the portal about 2 days later. I don\u2019t think it makes that much of a difference though. I was told that matches to my interviewers will be released through December and January. So there may be more interviewers left but I think my suggestion is to get your application as soon as possible.",
