  "title:": "Questions for Current Universities Students Who Got Rejected ED but Got In a Better School RD",
  "text": "As the title says, and as you can predict based off my username, I got rejected by UPenn Wharton today. I am trying to motivate myself, and was wondering if there are any current university students who were rejected ED by a \u201cless selective\u201d school (Brown, UPenn, Cornell, Duke, etc) and got into something \u201cmore selective\u201d (Yale, Princeton, Harvard, etc). I realize that the odds are lower RD, but I think that there is a luck component that could be maximized through increased applications (assuming that you\u2019re at a level where you are considered \u201ccompetitive\u201d for these schools.)",

The difference in some cases are almost 10%",

NYU Stern is arguably the second best business school and their acceptance is near 30%. Stern\u2019s acceptance rate is similar if not identical to NYU\u2019s general ED acceptance rate, which I believe would be a similar situation with Wharton. I highly doubt that there would be a 10% discrepancy between the general acceptance rate and the business school.",
