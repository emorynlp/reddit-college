  "text": "Hello everyone! I am currently looking to transfer and had trouble calculating my GPA.\n\nI had a 3.2 UW in high school, but there is a obvious incline in my grades (all A\u2019s senior year). I only took one semester at community college, but I have a 4.0 UW. How would admission staff members calculate this?\n\nThank you!",
