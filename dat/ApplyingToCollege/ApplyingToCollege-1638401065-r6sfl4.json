  "title:": "Would it be better to take an AP and break consistent electives or do the consistent electives even if they have no college credit/GPA boost attached? For example, if a school has cyber 1, 2, and 3 starting soph yr, is it better to do all 3 or do cyber 1 and 2 and then e.g apcsa or ap stat? thanks!",
