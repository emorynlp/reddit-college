  "title:": "Trying to make sure I\u2019m focusing on the right things",
  "text": "To start off, I\u2019m a current sophomore who is very future-oriented. I try to slow down and enjoy high school, but my brain won\u2019t let me relax unless I have stuff planned out. Hence why I am here. I want to make sure my current path is going to be enough to get into my dream schools.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the schools: NC State, Carnegie Mellon University, and MIT. All 3, I would be going for mechanical engineering.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what I have so far:\n\n- I\u2019m in an engineering academy at my school, by the time I apply I will have taken 5 engineering classes and be getting ready for internships provided through the program\n\n- Presumably around a 1550 on SAT based off practice tests (taking it in March)\n\n- I took part in Duke TIP (Talent Identification Program) before it was dismantled during a certain virus\n\n- Have been doing Science Olympiad since 5th grade, no breaks, not even during a certain virus. Up to 11 medals, including 4 first place and 2 second place\n\n- Joined TSA (Technology Student Association) this year, plan to do it for the next couple years\n\n- Plan to join the National Technology Honors Society once I\u2019m eligible as a junior\n\n- Straight A\u2019s with 4.5 weighted GPA (academic is 4, honors is 4.5, AP is 5)\n\n- Took AP World History: Modern (5 on exam), and am currently taking AP Gov. One of my engineering classes was weighted as AP but I don\u2019t think it was an actual AP (didn\u2019t have an exam). I also plan to take AP Calc AB and AP Physics next year\n\n- I plan to run for leadership positions in both Science Olympiad and TSA next year!",

      "text": "Sounds like a great plan!  How good is your scioly team?  As a future leader, could you boost it up to state or even national level? Sometimes, it's not just about the title, but about what you accomplish with the group, that really defines leadership.  I believe MIT used to run a Scioly invitational - even if your team doesn't place at states, see if you can do well at their invitational. Good luck!",

      "text": "It\u2019s great you are so focused. One tangible thing you can do is check out the costs for the schools you\u2019re interested in and have your parents run the net price calculator for each. If NC state is in state and it\u2019s affordable then you\u2019re on a great track! CM isn\u2019t known for generous financial aid and merit is super competitive so check out the costs so you go in with your eyes open. You sound like a fantastic person.",
