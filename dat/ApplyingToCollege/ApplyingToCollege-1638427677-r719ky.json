Do you need a lot to merit aid bc your family makes too much for financial aid but you still can\u2019t afford the ridiculous price tags of many colleges? Is money not a problem for you? \n\nSchool Type: are you interested in HBCU (historically Black colleges and universities)? PWI (primarily white institutions)? MSI (minority serving institutions) or a women\u2019s college? \n\nGeography:  where do you want to be? What part of the country? \n\nLocation: Urban, Rural, College Town, City Campus, Enclosed  Campus, distance from an airport? \n\nWeather: Are you a sun worshipper? Or do you want four seasons? Do you hate rainy cloudy weather. \n\nSchool Size: small intimate classes or more large lecture style? Do you want to know your professors or slide through college anonymously?\n\nSchool Vibe: rah rah school spirit? Quirky intellectual vibe? Coffee house and hanging out? Partying and football games? Or more studying and library time? \n\nPrograms: anything specific for your major? \n\nYour Stats: where do they fit in? \n\nAlso you might want to check out my post filled with my college lists: https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/p871lc/lots_and_lots_of_college_lists_for_you_to_check/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",

Including this year I will have taken 6 APs and maybe 10/11 total. ECs: they\u2019re decent but probably not amazing/exceptional, no nonprofits or writing books lol (leadership in a few clubs/ planning projects for them, like to do community service, internship in my preferred field, piano for a long time&awards, a couple other orgs like stuco & environmental group that I am just a member of). As for college preferences, probably the Midwest since I live in eastern Missouri (dont really wanna stay in MO tho). Probably not more than 8/9 hr drive from MO. I\u2019d like a suburban/ college town area, maybe also a city but idk. Lastly, My parents can\u2019t afford colleges that are T20 because for us they will barely give any aid, probably 55,000/year is the most we can pay (total expenses). One very last thing lol is that id like a research university that\u2019s not huge, probably medium size. Thanks in advance for your help, I hope I\u2019m not too picky lmao\ud83d\ude2dAlso my major not completely sure but probably envi sci and I might be NMF",
