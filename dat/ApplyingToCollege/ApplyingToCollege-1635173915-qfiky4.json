  "text": "I applied ED1 to Boston College but I don't think I will get in so im considering applying ED2 to another school if I do get rejected from BC (if this is not possible let me know). \n\nSo im wondering what schools are similar to BC , looking for a kinda prestigious city school. Looking at NYU but soo expensive any other suggestions. \n\n- Many may say Boston University but I've heard its a commuter school and I don't really want that. I'd prefer someplace that has a campus but is not needed\n- Safety school is Temple University",

      "text": "What do you like about BC? It is a mid size Jesuit university with great school spirit and a nice campus at the edge of a city. The Boston city line cuts through the middle, with much of the campus surrounded by suburb.\n\nThe only thing BC has in common with BU is the Boston in the name and a location about three miles away. BU is a large private with a campus of city streets that stretches about a mile of Comm Ave. BU is not a commuter school. Students live in dorms (which are urban) or apartments in the surrounding parts of Boston.\n\nNYU has absolutely nothing in common with BC.\n\nThe problem with prestige is that similar or more prestigious schools are also similar or more selective (ND, Gtown, even Villanova is tricky). If prestige is all you're really after, also check out Emory, Tulane, Wake Forest.\n\nStudents applying to BC who are interested in other Jesuit and Catholic universities with a similar, campus in or near a city and perhaps a sports team might check out Villanova, Providence College, Gonzaga, Marquette, Loyola Chicago, SLU, Fordham, etc.\n\nIf it's merely the city aspect, BU is more urban in feeling than BC. (Do tour via google maps if you haven't already.) Some other mid size to large schools to explore that are in or *near (suburban)* a city, at various levels of selectivity, would include Northeastern, Tufts, Brandeis, U Rochester, RIT, Case Western, GWU, U Miami, University of Denver, SMU.",

              "text": "Yes, BU and NYU would be similar, large, private, with an urban campus that is comprised of the city itself.\n\nFor BU vs BC, most people who have visited find a preference for one or the other, not both. BC has a gorgeous, quintessential college campus, with city access but also its own bubble, which some people love, but others are really looking for the 24/7 urban feeling of BU. If you can figure out which one you prefer, that will go a long way in helping you make your list. Do online tours and definitely wander around google maps.",

And Nova will be easier for you to get into, in particular if you don't live nearby.\n\nVillanova is great btw - we DO live nearby and I would rather my kid doesn't live too close to home so I had him look at ... BC! Which he really liked. He may end up at Nova tho, he is a legacy and has other family connections.\n\nWhat do you think about University of Richmond? Obviously Richmond isn't as cool of a city as Boston, but it's getting there? Another great school - it's not far at all from the city.",
