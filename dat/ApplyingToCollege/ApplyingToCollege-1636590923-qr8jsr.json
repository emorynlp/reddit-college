And yes, it's often the butt of jokes but it's ranked #117 on USNews, and is well-respected by employers, especially if you're a Barrett grad. (their honors college.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I have read that UoA is more prestigious ???\n\nThey're around the same in terms of overall prestige. But for CS, ASU is more well-known and well-respected by employers.\n\nAmazing honors college, amazing merit scholarships as well.\n\nBest of luck.",

It's not too difficult to get into if you're an above-average student and they're pretty quick to reply.\n\nPeople say it's more prestigious to have on the resume but I don't really think so. You can use the time you save from Barrett to pursue other meaningful experiences or projects that are even better for your resume.",
