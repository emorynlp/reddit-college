I go to a large and competitive   public hish school and so he gets 100 requests each year excluding summer program applications\n\n2) I typed it up but I have a very distict writing voice and so both my LOR and personal essay sound similar as one person wrote it.

      "text": "Any AO will be able to sniff out a letter written by a 17yr old kid vs an adult teacher.  Even more so if the voice/tone/style matches your essay.\n\nI\u2019d suggest giving the teacher a \u201ctone-free\u201d bullet-pointed outline and ask them to turn that into a letter in their own voice/style. You can cite your concern about the letter being obviously written by you otherwise.",
