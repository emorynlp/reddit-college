      "text": "You can explain (in additional info, I think, but go through your applications and it\u2019ll be obvious), but I\u2019d lean more towards calling it a \u201chealth issue\u201d than specifically \u201cpsychiatric health issue\u201d, unless you explain that you\u2019re basically better now in an essay, since it might (unjustly) make schools nervous to admit you.",

      "text": "you can definitely explain it in your application. But call it a health issue not a psychiatric health issue. It sucks I know but college AOs can be discriminatory about this, they're always trying to protect the school's rep after all",
