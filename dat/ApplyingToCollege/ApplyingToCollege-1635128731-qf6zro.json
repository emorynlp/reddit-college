      "text": "Applied and got in as a mech e major, switched to econ/finance. Did it for because:\n\n1- Always loved econ in HS but I was always the 'smart science student' and chose to apply for engineering. My parents, counsellors, teachers etc also pushed me to choose the prestige and rigor and apply as an engineering major. As my engineering app was extremely strong, I decided I would apply as an eng major and choose my actual major later or double major. After coming to college and finishing a semester, I decided that I would switch (talked to seniors, joined econ clubs, attended econ classes).\n\n2- Double majoring too hard\n\n3-Econ/Finance majors have amazing and high-paying career outcomes in my school",
