  "title:": "Is homecoming court a good idea on college applications?",
  "text": "I was elected to my school's 7 person homecoming court (we don't do king and queen for inclusion reasons). Is this a good thing to put under, say \"honors\", put somewhere else, or does it make me seem bratty?\n\n  \nPros - I only have 4 honors right now anyway... can it hurt?\n\nCons - If it's the \"respected by my peers\" angle, I also am the student body president, so I kind of have that covered - is that too much where it makes me seem stuck up?  \n\n\nNot really sure what to do, counselors / friends have split opinions. Thoughts?",
