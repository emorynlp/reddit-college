  "text": "I\u2019ve submitted my UC application which includes UCLA, and a major therein which requires a supplemental application. If I do not submit this supplemental application or get rejected from the major, will I be rejected from the university outright? Will my alternate major become my first major? If I am accepted into the university without completing the supplemental application or get rejected from the major, will I still have the opportunity to apply once I\u2019ve declared my major in the university?",
