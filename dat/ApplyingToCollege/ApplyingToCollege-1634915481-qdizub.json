      "text": "So for math, you need a 5 on AP Calculus BC to qualify into a special class that helps you finish their first math course in half a semester as opposed to a full semester (it will also let you take the second math course in half a semester + one month). You can also take the ASE, which is just an MIT exam, to get the credit for the first required math course.\n\nFor English, you don't technically get credit for any course. If you get a 5 on either AP lang or AP lit, it just allows you to take a CI-H class as opposed to a CI-HW. A CI-HW is just a writing intensive humanities class which most people try hard to avoid because then you'd need to take both a CI-HW and CI-H to graduate as opposed to just a CI-H. You will still need to take 8 HASS classes which are essentially just humanity classes.",
