  "text": "I\u2019m trying to apply to UCs for the first time. My family made more income than the usual and now I don\u2019t qualify for the fee waiver. Would lowering their income to where I could qualify for a fee waiver be bad? \nP.S. I had the same issue when applying to CSUs and my teacher lowered their income so I could qualify, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s bad to do that or not.",
