It\u2019s not that hard to do this but still make it unique for the student. I\u2019ve done many of these and a few  one-page+ LORs for top MBA programs which I did in less than a day. All solid enough for people to get into Kellogg\u2019s, Stern, etc.",

Scholarships have one form, grad school recommendations have other forms (one for MBA, another for MS, and PhD is the most involved). The trick is finding the solid block of time to devote to a letter.",

I thought it would be mediocre, but he confessed that he thought it was the best letter he\u2019s ever written.\n\nPoint being, don\u2019t underestimate how efficient these professionals are at writing letters. Years worth of letter writing really helps. I\u2019m sure it was a great letter!",
