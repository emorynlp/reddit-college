  "text": "I'm a sophomore and I don't really browse this sub often but what exactly is an extracurricular? I don't think I had any last year because I took everything online. How important are they and should I start doing them? Does high school sports count as an EC? sorry if this is a stupid question.",

      "text": "It's not a stupid question at all! Extracurriculars are exactly what they are called - extra activities outside of your curriculum. High school sports definitely count as an EC. \n\nThe more selective schools tend to place more importance on them because they're a way of holistically distinguishing high-achieving applicants from one another. If you have interests or passions outside of school, it's definitely worth pursuing them.",
