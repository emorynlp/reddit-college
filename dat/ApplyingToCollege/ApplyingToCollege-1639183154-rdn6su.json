Not wanting to check that designated mailbox on daily basis though.  \ud83e\udd37",

Her ED school has said which day & time decisions will come out next week so my plan is to ask her if we're going to go get cookies to celebrate or console. \n\nWith all of my older kids, acceptance packages usually showed up in the mail within a week of decisions coming out, even the one who got her acceptances in spring of 2020.",

Also, over 2 kids' very different app seasons I lurked a LOT on A2C and found it very helpful for a variety of things. Turns out the kids are alright :). Break a leg, Mama and Mama's Kid!",
