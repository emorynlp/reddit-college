  "title:": "I'm an Indian student planning to transfer from a university in my home state this year and could really use some help.",
  "text": "I had big things in plan but due to a very personal family tragedy, my plans went haywire and I had to take admission in a very crappy university here in India and I am extremely unhappy. I was considering applying abroad as a transfer student this year, but due to the financial loss my family incurred after the tragedy, the sum total of application fees might end up costing me a very heavy buck. Is there anyway around this issue? Also, will my acceptance as a transfer student be plausible? Will I still have a chance at financial aid too? \nI have completely valid reasons as to why I didn't apply in the previous year. Can someone please help me out with this, I'll be extremely grateful. Thank you!",

Plus given your financial situation you could probably qualify for a fee waiver. And I\u2019m also not sure with how finaid works for international but a lot of good schools try to meet their applications need.",

      "text": "You do realize that the number of unis offering fin aid to transfer internationals are very limited? It\u2019s already hard english applying as an international freshman from an over-represented area like India with financial aid - applying as a transfer makes the situation much worse. Public unis are already out of question, as none of them provide anything close to a full ride for internationals. But even a large number of popular private unis that otherwise provide limited aid to freshman don\u2019t have any funds for transfers.",
