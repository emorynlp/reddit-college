  "text": "Does anyone know how the common app SAT testing section works. Because I have no clue why it doesn't show on my colleges on the review page because \"This college has chosen not to include certain Common App answers in the PDF they receive for your application.\" even though I literally put in that I didn't want to be test optional. Do I have to put in their application portal later?\n\nAlso, how do I self report more than 1 score, meaning not super score. Do I have to do that in their portal as well?",
