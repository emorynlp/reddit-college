  "text": "I\u2019m currently taking a gap year bc I wasn\u2019t accepted into the schools I did want to go to bc I was either rejected or waitlisted and then rejected. I was later accepted into of my waitlist schools that I would\u2019ve loved to go to but tuition was still too much for me to afford. I was also accepted into a few schools that I couldn\u2019t afford. The schools that I was accepted too and could afford were not schools I was satisfied with attending. I also have a few friends who were in the same boat as me and are currently attending those schools and aren\u2019t happy with the schools at all. So I am glad that I did take the decision to take a gap year since I feel like it\u2019s been much more meaningful and impactful for me.\n\nSo bc of all that I\u2019m taking a gap year to reapply to colleges. During my gap year I\u2019ve filled it with meaningful extracurriculars, started to work and earn money, and I\u2019m currently interning in my intended field. I\u2019ve also retaken the SAT since I wasn\u2019t able to take it bc of Covid before. \n\nI don\u2019t want colleges to think that I\u2019m an inadequate applicant since I was rejected to a lot of schools or that I chose not to intend schools bc of their reputation. So I wanted to know how exactly I should go about explaining a gap year to colleges in the additional information section",
