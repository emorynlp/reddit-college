  "title:": "A tip for sophomores and juniors: The SAT is not the only option, nor is the ACT.",
  "text": "Most schools accept either, so you should analyze the different pros/cons of both and consider taking both if you aren\u2019t sure.\n\nFrom what I can tell and what I\u2019ve heard:\n- The SAT is better for English-minds (it deals more with vocab, reading, and critical thinking)\n- The ACT is better for STEM-minds (it has the science section, longer math section)\n- If you have ADHD (or something like that), the SAT is probably a better choice (it has a lower question density, more time per question)\n- If you retain knowledge well, the ACT might be more straightforward\n- If you suck at tests, work on strategies (e.g. pacing yourself, process of elimination, etc.)\n- If you tend to fall for ambiguous/trick answers, the ACT might be better, **also slow down** (the SAT is designed to trick you if you speed through tests)\n- If you\u2019re an English learner, avoid the SAT (in case you haven\u2019t heard, it has a rap for obscure vocab words)\n\nALSO, also, also\u2026 keep in mind that standardized tests aren\u2019t perfect and do have their shortcomings. In my opinion, it\u2019s still the fairest way to equalize GPAs, cuz it\u2019s **standardized** (the same test across the board). Some schools are even looking at AP scores, which I personally think is a good supplement to apps and an equalizer for AP course grades. (Again, still has flaws.)\n\nSomeday, I hope there is a better way for all students to prove themselves. I personally am a more logical type, so tests work well for me, but other people have different strengths, and a standardized metric for those different strengths should be invented. Don\u2019t forget that there are other metrics and ways to vet applicants too, like your essays and interviews, so make sure that you spend time working on doing well with those too.\n\nBest of luck, and remember to enjoy your high school experience too! There\u2019s more to life than just good grades.",

      "text": "Honestly they're both pretty equivalent. I say sat over act because it requires way, way less time (like almost half as much) in specific studying, being academically strong is going to help you hugely. Act requires a lot more specific studying. Also, act had an oppressive time limit, so it's way more stressful imo",

      "text": "I would personally say to take both, or at least a practice test of both, since it really varies from person to person. I am not a STEM person at all, but I did way better on the ACT than the SAT- the no calculator section was a problem and, honestly, the science part of the ACT is much more like a reading section than a science one. The SAT is easier to study for if you're lazy, however (Khan Academy versus printing out practice tests and scoring them yourself). I found that the ACT didn't require much studying at all compared to the SAT though. Best advice is to try them both out.",

      "text": "One of the smartest decisions I\u2019ve ever made was taking both. I took the ACT and really struggled with the time limit and I didn\u2019t fully finish a single section, ended up getting a 29. Took the SAT and I finished every section and ended up getting a 1430, which is a pretty decent improvement with almost no studying in between.",

      "text": "Hi, so I wanted some advice on my situation. I'm a junior who got a 1520 SAT for my second attempt with 720 reading and 800 math. I've actually heard that the SAT was better for STEM people since half of it is math and I guess that's the reason why I started with it.  I was just unsure what I should do at this point and how to continue: SAT, ACT, both, or neither. Any advice? Thanks  \n(Please let me know if this comment doesn't belong here)",
