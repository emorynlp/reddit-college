      "text": "i had this decision to make and i chose mit.\n\n\nwhy:\n1) mit students appeared to have a life outside of schoolwork. i got the impression that once caltech started you were stuck in the suburbs because it would take too long to get anywhere. throughout zoom cpw i saw students that did so many things on and off campus, it seemed like they had lives outside of schoolwork (which we do).\n\n\n2. caltech had a much more rigid and theoretical curriculum. mit\u2019s requirements are a lot looser and you have a lot more options, which appealed to me. also i\u2019m into engineering and applications, so i don\u2019t think i need to be able to prove the math, i\u2019m want to know how to use it.\n\n3. caltech students didn\u2019t seem as excited about their school. on all the webinars i saw the same small group of students and most of them weren\u2019t super enthusiastic. for mit cpw, it felt like the entire campus came together to welcome the prefrosh and share all the things they loved.\n\n\n4. mit was closer to home and i like 4 distinct seasons.\n\n\ni\u2019ll say i do think about what would happen if i were at caltech now, and i imagine i\u2019d be working at jpl and would be doing work and have friends. but i\u2019m happy with my choice. i\u2019m not working at nasa but i\u2019m working on a mission they are sponsoring and i have friends and do lots of things i enjoy. and there is still a lot of work, but i choose to believe that it is more fun than proofs.\n\n\nthat\u2019s not to say i wouldn\u2019t have been happy at caltech, but i don\u2019t regret the decision to not go there.",
