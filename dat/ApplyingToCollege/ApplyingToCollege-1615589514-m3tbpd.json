  "title:": "MIT interviewer accused me of working for a \"criminal operation\"...",
  "text": "I've been sitting on this for a month now, but with MIT coming in 2 days, I'm literally breaking down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring the interview, I mentioned that I\u2019m working as an instructor and chapter director at ScioVirtual, where my team and I teach STEM to raise money for our local food bank. After I mentioned that we raised over $21,000 for charity during the pandemic, there was a moment of silence while my 70-year-old interviewer jotted something down. When he looked up, he straight up told me that it sounded like I was lying and that the only way that could be possible was if we were running a \"criminal operation.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI chuckled, trying to make light of a somewhat risky joke, but he just sat there stone-faced.\n\nI froze for a good 20 seconds in complete shock before trying to explain how we raised the money, but he just didn't want to hear it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I was actually in the wrong then yea, I'd be able to accept it. But what the actual fuck\u2013I worked 10+ hours per week for close to 5 months and taught over 350 kids, each of which paid 60 bucks. Maybe this fossil just didn't believe that today\u2019s youth can get real shit done? The work we put in was very real and my team worked to fundraise every single one of those dollars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor a good week after that interview I was mentally fixated on that interview and could barely focus on anything else. Somehow my work with a charity that has legitimately helped our community has probably turned into a red flag on my application because of an out-of-touch MIT alum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've honestly lost hope in my chances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: Thank you all for the support!\n\nEdit 2: Looks like MIT enjoyed hearing about my criminal work with ScioVirtual... I GOT IN!!! Would've been an easy decision for me pre-interview, but after what happened I'm gonna need to think this one through some more.",

They literally don't care if the hostile environment drives people out of the major, because their perspective is \"Well, we have more undergrads than we can deal with, anyways.\" And that's not getting started on the constant microaggressions, hostile admins, the fact that the selection process for their internal REU program is essentially \"faculty gossip with each other and then put a list together\", and much more.",

Like very very hard (at least for me). But it\u2019s only been hard because of the material covered and the expectations professor put on the students \u2014 not because of the competitiveness.

                      "text": ">Where did you hear this stuff about the MIT math department? \n\nI witnessed parts of the infamous summer meltdown where many of these things were discussed. Not everyone in the department had negative experiences, but it was surprising how many did. I've also numerous friends who have been treated poorly by the admins, who are extremely unhelpful even about small things like future class offerings. There were also some members of the \"certain demographic\", who made jokes about \"trading sexual favors for math help' to their faces and demeaned their ability to make it through the math classes when there was really nothing to suggest that. Sure, it's only a few of the major (especially of that \"certain demographic\") are especially egregious, blatantly making lists of female attractiveness, making comments about how women are \"biologically unsuited\" for math, or loudly proclaiming this-or-that female professor a \"diversity hire\" when she's a senior hire and has a long list of accolades behind her. But when so many other students, often the same ones who claim to care about these problems, continue to stay friends with and even admire the bad eggs (and never approach these topics with them), and just stand by as these things are being said...Well, it's a bad look, to say the least. There are other things people have confessed that I can't remember off the top of my head. \n\nThere was also some toxicity about a few of the math organizations, including the part where one of them made MIT Confessions take down a confession pointing down an issue with them. (To my knowledge, it wasn't even slanderous, and much tamer than a lot of the things that get posted on that page.) The cherry on top is that when these things are pointed out to the department, they get angry, parade around PRIMES Circle as an emblem that they're good people, and then place the pressure on students to organize initiatives and fix things. \n\nAnyways, that's not to say that you're going to die in Course 18. It's a fairly light major (and this, IMO, contributes heavily to its bimodal nature), which makes double majoring way easier, and people make it out all the time. A lot of alums do quite well for themselves. But during my time at MIT, there was no other major with such a hostile admin (most are just apathetic or incompetent) and so many stories of undergrad aggression. \n\n>it doesn\u2019t restrict others from entering it.\n\nThere's no technical cap on majors; MIT doesn't have weed-out classes in the sense that many schools do. But an unsupportive department can certainly drive people to leave majors, especially when students are brought to question their capability and even passion for the subject. \n\n>Another thing is rigor; MIT is hard. Like very very hard (at least for me). But it\u2019s only been hard because of the material covered and the expectations professor put on the students \u2014 not because of the competitiveness. There are so many kind and helpful who will go out of there way when you\u2019re struggling. In essence, everyone is struggling and people come together to fight the problems together.\n\nYes, I am quite familiar with the difficulty and the collaborative setting; I got two degrees from the 'tute. I don't deny that the people there are generally great. My experience was that if you wanted help and were polite about it, most people, whether in clubs or classes, would be happy to help you out. That said, there are still quite a few dickcanoes around, and it's sometimes shocking how deep the dickery runs. IMO, what's more common is an almost naive apathy, where students are friendly and outgoing, but only until systemic or personal sufferings have entered the chat. \n\nAnyways, this isn't to invalidate your experiences. Your mileage may vary, after all, and there are Course 18s who were overall satisfied with their experience. But the department has a long history of all these things, even if some people do flourish within it.",

I've said elsewhere that math and stats is weird at MIT (with stats being almost non-existent) and I've always gotten a weird vibe but not enough to detail -- so hearing this corroborates a lot. It's sad because I really like a lot of other departments at MIT: people I've met have been great. However, math has always just been... off and felt like it was trapped in a time warp.",

You're in 8th grade, you have a lot of time to figure out what that is.  Idk much about you though, but if you aren't Asian I would actually assume that a high SAT and a decent AIME score could probably make you very competitive for MIT.  The most important things, though, in HS are to stay on top of your grades and ECs.\n\n>Also, did you have fun in highschool? It looked like you just studied a ton and didn't really enjoy it.\n\nI see where you're coming from saying this since I too thought that HS would be a nightmare when I was in middle school.  It's seriously so overstated the amount of work you have in high school.  I have like max an hour and a half of homework a day.  (Part of that is because I don't need to study much as long as I pay attention in class.)  And the dirty secret with ECs is, they sound like a lot more time commitment than they really are!  I enjoyed high school and have logged probably thousands of hours in Minecraft and other video games since the start of high school LOL",

I was thinking of studying for AP calc over the summer, taking the class to boost GPA, but at the same time studying for Calc BC. Any APs to avoid? Any Aps that are overhyped/'easy' to pass?

I find it baffling that someone who went to school with so many (supposedly) bright people would be shocked to see a high schooler raising $21k. But then again, from what I've heard, older MIT people were uh, way more maladjusted. Report that guy immediately.\n\nAs for how much this might matter, interviews generally don't count for much. For MIT specifically, they do pay a bit more attention to applicants who were rated a \"1\" (for poor fit, who the interviewer thinks should absolutely not be admitted) or a \"5\" (top 1% of interviewees that year) or \"a plus one\" (one of best students interviewed ever). Even in these cases, it all comes down to the \"narrative\" that the interviewer writes. Unless the guy rated you a 1 and wrote an extremely convincing \"fraud\" narrative to go along with it, I wouldn't stress too much. (Those narratives are pretty hard to write though, unless you have a lot of evidence, and something tells me this guy is one of those two-sentence people.) But for real, report this dude.",

Don't bother sharing to their generally email inbox, but instead request to be connected their person in charge of coordinating alumni volunteers.  \n  \nThere's this weird pseudo subculture of alumni volunteers who conduct College interviews. Some of them are young recent graduates and are excited to stay connected to the university. Some of them are older, parental, and also love thing connected to their alma mater. But there are some who are older, and feel that their mission is to gate keep for their alma mater, and the enjoy flexing that power, subtle is it might be.  \n  \nThe admissions person who coordinates them, is almost certainly beating his head against the wall on a weekly basis communicating with these pushy volunteers who are often rude and entitled, even to the coordinator.  It's hard to break up with these alumni because they have such a history with the institution, but a report of behavior like this will certainly be correctly received by the admission officer. Of course, they will never say that they are going to remove the interview, but they will quietly put a note in your record, or maybe even pull the interview all together. The most you will get in response will be a \"sorry for your experience\" type of message, but it will certainly impact notes on the interview, and will very likely impact how often that alumni volunteer gets \"assignments.\"\n\nGood luck, try not to sweat it too much, you've done amazing, philanthropic things that are worthy of recognition.",
