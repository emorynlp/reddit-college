      "text": "This is a weirdly specific thing I can really relate to. In junior year there was a period where I was exhausted academically and in my personal life from a bad combo of overworking, virtual learning, a manipulative relationship, etc. I came back home at 11pm once and just wanted to make some hot food\u2026only to spill it once it was done. That just broke me for some reason and I ended up crying for a good 10 mins until my brother saw me in the kitchen (or else I would\u2019ve cried more). All I can say now is that in hindsight, it does get better. At that moment, everything felt terrible and I couldn\u2019t imagine getting away from that exhaustion, but I did. This is an incredibly stressful time, and I remember constantly being on the verge of a nervous breakdown last year. But no matter what your result is today, I promise what feels so monumental and terrible now will get better. I hope you can heat up the food, or get something else nice and hot. Best wishes with UChicago.",
