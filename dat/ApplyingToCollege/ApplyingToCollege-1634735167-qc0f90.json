  "text": "I\u2019m applying to penn state via common app, and have a question regarding their essays. Obviously since it is on common app, there is the option for the common app essay(which they don\u2019t require). Also, they have an optional personal statement in their section of common app. I already have the common app essay written. Should I also do the personal statement? Will they value one more than another?",

So, if there is supplemental information that you would like to make sure is included as part of your Penn State review, we recommend submitting your Penn State Personal Statement. You can submit the same (or a version/portion of the same) essay in your CA essay as in your Penn State Personal Statement, or submit a completely different essay/statement; it's up to you. But the Penn State Personal Statement is the only piece that we will read in our review.\u201d*",

We do not use the essay in every application review.  You can submit either the Common App essay or Penn State's personal statement, we do not have a preference.\u201d So I\u2019m pretty sure they actually will consider the CA essay as long as you check it off when you submit",
