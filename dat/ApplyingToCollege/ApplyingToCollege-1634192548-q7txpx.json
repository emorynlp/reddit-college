  "text": "title basically,\n\nIm applying ED (Nov 1) but i think the teachers i asked for my letter of recs havent started yet and might submit late (im hoping they dont, but the possibility is there). i think i read somewhere that teachers can submit them up to two weeks after the deadline because it's past the students control, but i cant seem to confirm this anywhere and it's starting to stress me out. any help would be appreciated",
