  "text": "Sorry for the incoming rant \u2639\ufe0f It's probably an overreaction but I just want to vent a bit right now.\n\nOne of my friends has been asking me every day about when my decisions are coming out and saying \"I KNOW you will get in\" really loudly when we're in front of other kids/teachers/etc. She also frequently talks about how we can cry and be depressed for the rest of the year together\ud83d\udc80 if we both get rejected (She actually exclaimed this very loudly in orchestra this morning \ud83d\udc80).\n\nTo be honest, it's really embarrassing and I regret telling her where I applied. I never initiate conversation about college apps but she always brings it up and forces us to talk about it when she sees me - to the point where it feels like she is far more invested in my application than I am myself (extremely uncomfortable). \n\nI actually don't even care that much about my EA school (absolutely not to the extent that I'd be depressed or cry over it) and I sort of suspect she's projecting her own college stress onto me... maybe she's using my application as a talking point to distract and destress from her own apps? I don't think there's malicious intent (I don't even know if she's aware of how much pressure she's creating). \n\nBasically what I'm saying is I feel bad asking her to stop talking about college things, but also I'm getting REALLY irritated by the lack of self-awareness. We may be friends, but my college apps are not her business. \ud83d\ude2d I really want to be left alone because she is just worsening the pressure right now.",

I just try to nod and move on, so hang in there op and don't stress too much. Some people just like to project their insecurities onto others and there's nothing you can do about it.",

              "text": "Same here. In my school only like 1 or 2 people per year apply abroad and they are usually geniuses with international awards while I am mostly average, perhaps slightly above average. And then I have my counselor tell me everyone she ever worked with got into a prestigious school abroad and how I hopefully won't break her streak... It's so pressuring. If no one knew I'd just move on from my rejections, but I can't stand everyone cheering over my failures (happened a lot of times before) or looking at me as if I let them down personally. I don't care much about what others think about me, but that kind of environment is so toxic and isn't helping my anxiety at all.",
