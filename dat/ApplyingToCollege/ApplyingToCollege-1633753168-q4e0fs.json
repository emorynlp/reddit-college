      "text": "Okay, I have the exact same question. We didn't write any tests here since the last two grades, apart from unit tests and other shit that everybody cheated in. So technically I have no scores for the last two years. However, I do have scores of 9th and 10th grade, which are quite high, ranked 1st and 2nd. I also do NOT come in the 10% of my class now because I changed schools since COVID. I am aiming for really really nice scores for SAT. Also, Cornell emailed regarding their 20% acceptance rate in ED and my SAT is in December.",
