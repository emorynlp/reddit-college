  "text": "Title. My absolute top choices are super selective (for context my ED is Wharton, also applying to MIT and Chicago as 2 more ultra-reaches). My intended major is econ/business analytics at Wharton and econ/data science at most of my other schools. \n\nThe problem is that I didn't figure out what I wanted to major in until late my junior year, so I didn't really have a chance to build a spike in my intended major. I took AP Macro and Micro and got As and 5s on both (I know this doesn't really help) and I'm self studying some CS stuff on my own, but that's about it. \n\nMy ECs are pretty strong in general, and I've reached a decently high level in the stuff I actually do, but again the stuff I do is not really related to my major.\n\nDo I even have a chance at schools like these? I do have competitive stats for these schools.",

Closest thing even related was AP Physics C: Mechanics and AP Calculus BC + Math 2 and Physics subject tests.

Second decile of my class by graduating GPA (top 20%), every person I knew going for top colleges had a prestigious internship or summer program at some point in HS. Multiple USAMO and USABO qualifiers from my school, and a USACO camper + 3 USACO Golds\n\nI'm asian, not low income, no hooks, had to take the SAT thrice to get a competitive score and dropped on the second attempt. AP scores were not all 5's, I had 3's and 4's. B in pre-calculus first semester. Fucked up Math 2 the first time I took it as well.\n\nso no, i had all the opportunities possible for a high schooler to obtain and fucking squandered them. still did fine in the end",

I'm doing way better in college now that I actually give a fuck about my learning instead of having to stack APs and honors classes that I didn't care about for the sake of looking good to colleges (i only really cared about chinese, calc bc, physics c mechanics, chem and physics honors). You'll be the same way, I'm sure of it",

I knew those people had better ECs and awards than most people at those schools, so I maintained a handle on reality, but my expectations of what is needed were still kind of inflated.\n\n>also this sub is unhealthy to stay on\n\nYeah I know. I joined in sophomore year and learned pretty quickly not to compare myself with the people here because they're not representative of the average high schooler, the average applicant to T20s, or even the average T20 student. I just kept seeing that a spike was super super important and got kind of worried.",
