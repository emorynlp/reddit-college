  "title:": "Mistake on UC Applications (pls help lol)",
  "text": "currently freaking out because its 4AM and I just caught a mistake in my self-reported courses section after already submitting my application. for ALL of my 9th and 10th grade classes, i put the correct courses, but the incorrect honors level [for example, for my math, i selected Geometry (H) as the course, but put it as non honors]. i'm the first generation in my family submitting college apps so I can't ask anyone advice on what to do so if you can please enlighten me on what to do in this situation and somehow convince me that UC admission offices won't think im stupid for overlooking such an obvious mistake i will love you forever\ni am petrified that no colleges will accept me over this rn",

      "text": "The UC application autofills courses as honors based on what the UC considers as an honors course. If you live in CA, UCs have already assigned all of your courses as honors non honors etc. very few courses qualify for honors. For example, all of the \u201chonors\u201d courses in my school did not qualify as Uc honors. There\u2019s a distinction between honors and Uc honors. I think that\u2019s the case here-Geo may be an honors in your school but it\u2019s probably not a UC honors.",
