  "text": "in the spring i\u2019m going to be taking a course for CS that will only count for college thru my local CC and not appear on my HS transcript. for current and most recent year courses it only shows dual enrollment but it\u2019s not that so idk how i\u2019d list it.\n\nfor the colleges & universities it doesn\u2019t let me list specific courses. \n\nalso, if i\u2019m enrolled to take college courses to be directly awarded the credit in the summer right after I graduate from high school but before going to a 4-year uni is there any way to report these?",
