  "text": "Hello Everyone.\n       Well, I\u2019ve applied to 12 schools so far, gotten into 3 and have visited several. I applied early action to some pretty selective schools, but in all honesty I still have no idea where I want to go. Every campus I visit seems the exact same as the last one. I have no idea how to choose a college. I don\u2019t even know if I applied to the right colleges. How in the hell do I figure out the right fit for me before the regular decision deadline!?!? Anything helps!",

Which one is more flexible and do you care?\n3.  Job placement for your major\n4.  Co-op and internship oppty, research if you care\n5.  How easy is it for you to get into your major?\n6.  Is cost an issue?\n7.  Ask admissions once they accept you if you can talk to their current students.",

      "text": "That\u2019s a challenge for sure\u2026 after you\u2019ve walked enough brick walkways, and heard enough admission counselors share the joke that they have \u201cstudy abroad programs in every continent except Antarctica\u201d, it all sort of starts to blend together. \n\nYou\u2019re getting some great information here on attributes of schools to compare. But if can throw my two cents in on a potential approach you can try, it sounds like there\u2019s some level of filtering you can do to key into what you actually value, before you sift through all of that. \n\nYou\u2019re already on the right track given that you included two incredibly important words at the end of your post: FOR ME. That\u2019s where you start. Try stepping away from thinking about any particular school for a moment, and more broadly, consider your own whys/what\u2019s/who\u2019s.  THEN you apply that to your \u201cwhere\u201d. \nWhy do you want to go to college? What would your success and happiness look like, say, a year from now? What sort of learning, physical, or social environment do you want to surround yourself with? \nThat\u2019s obviously a pretty weighty set of sample questions so, [I\u2019ll link a blog here ](https://sites.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2021/10/24/is-that-a-good-school/) where our director Rick Clark added some more practical considerations and tools as you decide what matters to you. \n\nHope that gives you a start! -Sammy",

      "text": "Some of them may make the decision for you by not admitting you.\n\nOnce you know your status at each school, wait until March/April to see how much each one will cost.  Sometimes they give will give you more money the longer you wait to commit.  You may also wish to try negotiating.\n\nOnce you have a final cost for each one, that may put some out of reach.  Or, at least, make some much more attractive than others.\n\nBeyond that it's down to stuff like \"vibe\", how well-regarded they are in whatever area you intend to study, where they're located, whether they have a particular niche major or program that interests you, etc.",

      "text": "One of my big discriminators is class size. Is your freshman calculus lecture 500 kids and then you go to a smaller recitation on a separate day led by a TA? I personally hated that in college. I resented a three credit hour class actually taking four hours of class time and the extra hour taken from my study time. I also didn't care for paying big $ only to be taught by a TA. How is the alumni network - do the alumi hire other alumni. How is the job placement - do lots of big name companies recruit at the campus, is the school targeted by good companies. Does the school/profs have industry ties that can hook you up with an internship/full time job. Is the school in an area with lots of companies that you can intern at/get hired into a full time job. Does the school have a co-op program, will they help you find an internship.  How safe is the campus - can you walk on campus late at night without worrying about getting mugged or your apartment getting robbed. How is the vibe - are the kids friendly, intense, or are they cut throat, give-you-the-wrong-notes-on-purpose competitive. Are there professional clubs and social clubs. Do you see yourself making friends there. Is the school a big D1 sports school, which honestly can be a blast and a source of memories you'll cherish for years. Is the school easy to get to or will it cost a fortune and a day and a half to fly into some podunk airport followed by a two hour drive? How much debt will I end up with and will my projected starting salary support it. Edited to say I find it very helpful to make a decision matrix to lay it all out and help me decide. I also like to read reviews on Niche and other sites to get a feel for the common complaints about campus. It's one thing when the worst thing people complain about is the bad food compared to not being able to get the classes they need to graduate in four years. Another thing to consider - how easy is it to change majors.",
