          "text": "Your best bet is to look at the common data set for each school. Most, but not all schools publish their CDS. There is an aid section section H I believe) that shows need based aid data in addition to merit aid. So you can see what percentage of students receive either form of that aid and what the average award is. \n\nWith respect to how competitive the awards are, it really varies. Some schools (like Ivies) don\u2019t give merit aid. Some highly selective schools (like Duke and WashU) do, but they are very competitive with additional applications required. We\u2019re talking people who get into HYPSM but opt for the $$$ to attend Duke or WashU types. The trick is to find the \u201csweet spot\u201d where you are an upper 10-25% matriculant for merit aid. There are other schools like Alabama that have a more defined framework that triggers merit awards (SAT and/or GPA cutoffs). \n\nIn terms of aid:  as a general rule, the most selective private schools with the highest endowment per student ratios provide the best need based aid. Many schools will claim to \u201cmeet full need\u201d but they have different definitions of what your need is. Example:  HYPSM v WashU v USC v SMU. They all cost the same.  If your family has x of assets and y income, HYPSM may say you need to contribute $5,000 to your annual $80,000 cost. The subsidize the rest. WashU 10,000. USC 16,000. SMU 25,000. Somebody else (like an out of state public) may not over to meet need at all for OOS applicants.",

I didn't get into Harvard, Yale, Princeton or Stanford, but I'm assuming they would be around the Columbia/Dartmouth level in terms of aid.
