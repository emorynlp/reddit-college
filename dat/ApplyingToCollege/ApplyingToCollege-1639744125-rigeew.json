Yes, you can appeal especially talk about the pandemic. However, I appealed and got 1k, I think that award is specifically set aside for appealers since it's called emergency fund or something related.\n\nI haven't met any full rides yet, but it seems possible if you're a commuter in the Honors College. Because I am a non-honor student commuter with a 14k cost, so I'd imagine the honors scholarship would cover that.\n\n(edit: I'm NYC campus btw. Westchester campus is a whole different story)",

I like that idea of saying this is how much I have for you, do what you want.  No loans for me and you can keep the rest.  The only thing is we have another one who is not scholarly and she will turn 18 and say, I don\u2019t want to go to college where is my x dollars!  I want to buy a new car.  Haha.  Thanks for the insight.",

The only thing I struggle with it that this kid is incredibly bright and an extremely hard worker.  Most of her friends are online and go to these top schools.  She has one school that she has been talking about since 7th grade.  I have no idea if she will get in there but my guess is she might.  I told my wife I just could never tell her no.  I couldn\u2019t.  Very few people that are accepted turn it down.   I like the idea of giving her a choice.  If she wants to take what we offer and get loans, then she can.   I am going to play up all the travel and experiences she could have with a bunch of extra money if she chooses instate.   Thanks for all the information.  I think you had exactly the right approach.",

          "text": "Your best bet is to look at the common data set for each school. Most, but not all schools publish their CDS. There is an aid section section H I believe) that shows need based aid data in addition to merit aid. So you can see what percentage of students receive either form of that aid and what the average award is. \n\nWith respect to how competitive the awards are, it really varies. Some schools (like Ivies) don\u2019t give merit aid. Some highly selective schools (like Duke and WashU) do, but they are very competitive with additional applications required. We\u2019re talking people who get into HYPSM but opt for the $$$ to attend Duke or WashU types. The trick is to find the \u201csweet spot\u201d where you are an upper 10-25% matriculant for merit aid. There are other schools like Alabama that have a more defined framework that triggers merit awards (SAT and/or GPA cutoffs). \n\nIn terms of aid:  as a general rule, the most selective private schools with the highest endowment per student ratios provide the best need based aid. Many schools will claim to \u201cmeet full need\u201d but they have different definitions of what your need is. Example:  HYPSM v WashU v USC v SMU. They all cost the same.  If your family has x of assets and y income, HYPSM may say you need to contribute $5,000 to your annual $80,000 cost. The subsidize the rest. WashU 10,000. USC 16,000. SMU 25,000. Somebody else (like an out of state public) may not over to meet need at all for OOS applicants.",

Columbia was maybe a few thousand more than Dartmouth, but negligible.\n\nThat being said, I think all of them have updated their FA policy since, so your mileage may vary. I didn't get into Harvard, Yale, Princeton or Stanford, but I'm assuming they would be around the Columbia/Dartmouth level in terms of aid. In addition, Brown and similar schools like Chicago was not that far off either. I think they all provide 100% need-based aid, but just have different definitions of what need is.",
