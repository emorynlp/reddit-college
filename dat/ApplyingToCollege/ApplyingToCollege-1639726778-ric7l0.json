  "text": "Hi guys,  \nI'm an international student, and I had applied to the Indiana University Bloomington by the November 1 deadline. I got my acceptance a few days back, and that is when I realized that my counselor actually forgot even to start the nomination. I'm the first student from my school to apply abroad, and my counselor being new to all this, panicked.   \n\n\nWhat should I do now? How should I approach them, like with what stance?",
