U shouldn\u2019t have trouble coming up with those reasons. Now structurally I would have 2-3 reasons maybe related to your major and interests that would help you achieve your specific goal at umich. Other than that, find fun and educational reasons as to why umich is a school u like. It can literally be as complex as a professor and research there or as stupid as watching football and wearing a umich shirt. Write whatever u want but just be creative with how it helps you and supports why umich should accept u",

      "text": "I wrote a killer Why Michigan essay which probably carried my application, and I'm a sophomore at Michigan now. \n\nMichigan is a school that looks for a certain kind of fit, and you need to demonstrate that you are that mutual fit. It's not one specific thing, but a lot of them. It's an *extremely* unique school and your application needs to show you understand that. Part of that means being really specific. My Michigan essay focused on the school culture, my experience meeting a Michigan football fan for the first time, how I wanted to be apart of such a passionate community, and then specifically how I wanted to pursue my academic interests down to the exact classes professors and study abroad I wanted to do. Then I tied it back together with the frame of meeting the Michigan fan again. I had to cut that thing from like 2000 words to 600 or whatever the word limit was.\n\nIf you want more details, PM me! You can read my essay and we can talk more about that culture. This school is not for everyone, but if it's for you, there is absolutely no better place to be on earth. There's a reason almost every grad is clinically insane about it. If you want to show that, your essay needs to packed with info, very specific, and demonstrate you know what Michigan's vibe is. Good luck!",
