      "text": "How would that be a knock? The majority of the time it\u2019s public state colleges trying to give the most academically qualified students a chance at a small liberal arts school without breaking your bank account. Just because it\u2019s not an east coast power house doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad. Too many A2C kids think that way.",
