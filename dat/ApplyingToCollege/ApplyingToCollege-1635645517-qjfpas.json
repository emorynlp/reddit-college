  "text": "Hi,\n\nI made a mistake in reporting my current (senior) year course load to some of my EA schools. When I submitted those applications, I was fully expecting to take Discrete Math as an online course in the spring semester, but I am no longer going to be doing so (already have enough credits to graduate, didn't want to spend more money on courses). How bad is this, and should I email all of them?\n\nThank you so much",
