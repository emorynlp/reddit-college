              "text": "Yes, since FAFSA is need-based aid from the US govnt, internationals are ineligible for it. Some colleges provide need-based aid and/or merit aid to international students out of their own pockets. For need-based aid, colleges usually have you fill out the CSS Profile, where you list financial info that the college uses to calculate your expected contribution and aid. For merit aid, some colleges will give it automatically for a certain gpa+test score, while some will require extra essays, some will consider everyone automatically, etc. \n\nNeed-blind colleges do not factor your need into admissions. Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, and Amherst are the only US colleges that are need-blind to internationals and meet full demonstrated aid (technically Georgetown is need-blind also, but they do not meet full aid and explicitly state they have very limited finaid for internationals). All other colleges are need-aware, meaning your financial need will impact admissions. That is one of the biggest factors that make admissions ultra competitive and difficult for internationals, many of whom require aid.",

Some institutions do give need-based aid (basically they'll give you an amount of money depending on how much they think you're family can/cannot pay) and merit-based aid (they'll give you an amount of money depending on how good your grades/stats/extracurriculars are) to international students--and plenty of international students are able to attend college pretty affordably.\n\nCommunity College is a viable option, but only if you have about USD 10-20k-ish your family is willing to spend for your education. Part-time work won't be able to cover all the costs of college, unfortunately--best case scenario, you'll have about 7k per year by working 20 hours per week (which is the limit for internationals on an F-1 student visa), which is best spent for living expenses and emergency savings.\n\nIf you need aid, why not try the ones that offer aid to internationals? Granted, a good amount of them are super competitive, but you're 14. You've got a couple of years left before you have to apply--if you work on your grades, your SAT, and your ECs starting now, by the time you apply, you should have a pretty strong app.",

I've been asking him to save up for over a year already, so thankfully I'm not in that deep of a hole\n\n>Part-time work won't be able to cover all the costs of college, unfortunately\n\nthat's to be expected, I'm really not sure about working, probably a better option to spend that time studying. Maybe integrate studying into working? I think it's too early to know now, but dad said it's inevitable that I'll have to work there. Oh well.\n\nalso I'll be of legal age to work in the final year of school, so hopefully I can do at least something; one of my relatives is a manager in a relatively large franchise maybe I could get something out of that\n\n>7k per year by working 20 hours per week \n\n that's.. hmm less than I expected honestly.

                      "text": ">are the grades/stats/extracurriculars taken into account before   \nadmission? After? Both?\n\nI'm not quite sure what you mean, but generally the process would usually go like\n\n1. You submit your application for both admission and merit scholarship\n2. AOs will look at your stats (grades + test scores), extracurriculars, and essays for admission\n3. They decide whether to admit or deny you\n4. If they admit you, they then look at your application in context with the rest of the admitted pile to see if you qualify for the merit scholarship\n\nSo if I understood your question correctly, it would be both before (to be admitted) and after (for the scholarship.)  Note that this process is like super general and I'm not 100% sure if that's how it actually goes in the Admissions Office.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Sorry I'm not very knowledgeable, I made this account to learn more\n\nNo need to apologize! We all start somewhere, and it's great to see that you're out here learning. By the way, highly recommend checking out r/intltousa and the Discord, as a lot of the members are quite helpful!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>that's to be expected, I'm really not sure about working, probably a   \nbetter option to spend that time studying. Maybe integrate studying into  \n working? \n\nI'm not 100% sure, but I think most schools offer you work in-campus as part of your financial aid package when you get admitted, to cover some living expenses. Some schools have a more formal work-study program, which you might be interested in checking out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>also I'll be of legal age to work in the final year of school, so   \nhopefully I can do at least something; one of my relatives is a manager   \nin a relatively large franchise maybe I could get something out of that\n\nOh that's neat! You sure you can't get started earlier, even if it's only for a small stipend? I worked freelance way before I turned 18, and it's a good way to save up a bit of money, if not for college, then at least for your own wants haha\n\nIf you're able to get started early, enjoy what you do, and consistently work hard in your relative's franchise, that can be a good extracurricular! Paid work is usually a great activity to add as it shows Admissions Officers (AOs) your maturity and responsibility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>would you mind sharing a couple? I'm hooked\n\nOoohh man, there's a lot. And it would depend on what major you intend to take up, what type of collegiate environment you want to be in, etc. - but I highly recommend using [CollegeBoard's College Search engine](https://collegesearch.collegeboard.org/home). Once you click on the categories and find an initial set of colleges, there's an option for 'Affordability' - then at the very bottom is a toggle for 'Aid for Internationals' click that, and you should be shown schools that all offer both need-based and merit-based aid.\n\nAlso, if you want a much more detailed list, check out [this resource](https://www.bigjeducationalconsulting.com/resources) \\- scroll down for the International-specific database.\n\n \n\n>I'm interested in gap years; if I take one after graduating high school   \n(would be extremely helpful in terms of money) how would it affect   \neverything else?\n\nFor college apps? Well, first thing that comes to mind is the fact that you get so much more time to work on your apps compared to doing it during a school year. Also, if you're productive during the gap year (attend gap year programs if you can afford it, work on self-directed projects, get part-time work, etc.) then that's definitely going to help your case! Don't worry - plenty of gap year students end up getting admitted to top schools, so simply taking a gap year won't harm your chances of getting admitted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\\[ECs\\] err.. what are those?\n\nOh, sorry! ECs are extracurriculars. Sometimes I forget that certain lingo are specific to all these deranged kids who have been unhealthily obsessing over college apps for so long (yes, that includes me). ECs can also be called ECA (extracurricular activities) - it's the same thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I certainly hope so, I've basically murdered any sort of social life   \nthat I had. Hope it pays off in the future like everyone says\n\nOh mood lmao but if there's one piece of advice that you remember from this absurdly long comment, it's this: enjoy your teen years :) I've got a lot of regrets not being able to hang out with my friends because I was too busy with extracurriculars or other college-app-related commitments. Then COVID hit, and I haven't seen my friends in over a year. I probably won't be able to see them for years to come due to some personal circumstances.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with having a little fun! Play games, enjoy your hobbies, find and be yourself, since really, that's what matters most--in both life and college admissions. :)",
