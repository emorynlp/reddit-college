  "title:": "Missing A-G requirement for UC app?",
  "text": "Hi!\n\nI was trying to submit my UC app when I found that I'm missing an A-G requirement for Geometry.  I took it the summer after 7th grade, so since it's not a full year course it doesn't satisfy my requirements.  What do I do?  Can I just submit without meeting the requirement, or is there any way I can fulfill the requirement?  I've taken enough math (Calc, multi, stats, and linear algebra) in highschool, I'm just missing geometry:(  Thank you in advance, freaking out rn!",

One transferable college course will not satisfy the full three-year math requirement.",
