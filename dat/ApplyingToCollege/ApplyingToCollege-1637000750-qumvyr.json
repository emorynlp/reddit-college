Cheaper housing seems to be uniformly terrible no matter where you go.  Lots of mass shootings in and around the area.  The drivers are absolutely insane and I fear for my life when being driven down the highway (more than I did in Houston), which apparently has a minimum speed requirement of 93 mph.  Far-ish from Boulder (if you\u2019re even in to that\u2014it\u2019s not that great either) and the weather is bonkers (80 degrees one day, snow the next\u2014not a joke). \n\nOh and the city is hideous except for the wealthiest suburbs.\n\nEdit: oh and don\u2019t let me forget that because of the elevation and weather your face will look like a leather handbag by the time you\u2019re 33\nand you\u2019ll probably get skin cancer.",

It's more of a commuter school - CU Boulder and Colorado State are the main traditional public universities in the state, with Mines as an engineering focused school.\n\nIt does get some boosts in some research ratings because administratively it's tied to Anschutz (the CU med school), but that doesn't really have a significant impact on their undergrad offerings IMO.",
