  "title:": "What scores do I submit for R.D? (CBSE)",
  "text": "So basically, I am applying to NYU(all 3 campuses), Minerva & Knox early, whereas for my other unis, I'm applying through R.D & through a special cycle for a 3rd party scholarship (runs parallel to R.D but deadline is E.A).\n\nCountry: India ; Board: CBSE\n\nComing to the question, for early applications, I am sending in predicted scores through my school but by the time I'm sending in my R.D, I'll probably have my semester 1 board results. The exams end on 22nd dec and the tests are OMR based, which means they'll get corrected faster than traditional papers. In case of that, should I send those for my R.D or my predicted results would suffice?",

      "text": "First of all, don't waste your time on Minerva - read the previous posts on it.\n\nComing to the question, if the Term 1 exam results are available by then, then you should submit those. I think they'll probably take longer and might get released in early-mid January.",
