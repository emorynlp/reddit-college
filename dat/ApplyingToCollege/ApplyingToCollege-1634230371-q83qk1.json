  "text": "basically i have a part time job where i work ~20 hours a week and it\u2019s so demotivating to see what my peers and people on this sub and whatnot are doing, because a lot of it i could do too but i have no time.  my ecs are not as fleshed out as i\u2019d like them to be because, like i said, no time.  i have also had to make sacrifices in terms of my course load to accommodate.  i just hate it so much. am i the only one?",

I still managed to accomplish a lot, but I had to find different ways to pursue my ECs; virtual opportunities, planning in advance, really strong time management skills. I get you!\n\nKeep in mind that colleges do like seeing students with work experience, so that\u2019s a +1 for you.",

              "text": "Same! I\u2019m lucky that I was able to quit my job before school started back up in person (I don\u2019t have a car\u2014I had to bike or have my mom drive me when I worked since school was online), and I had never been so tired. I got heat exhaustion a few times too since they kept the pool room super hot for little kids. I was luckily able to do a lot of virtual volunteering which I did well in, and the bulk of my ECs worked really well around that, but still\u2014not an enjoyable experience.",
