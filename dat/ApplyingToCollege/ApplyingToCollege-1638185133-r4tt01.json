  "text": "I'm an international student and I've been spending alot of time completing the applications and essays. Now that I've submitted applications of 13/20 colleges, I realised that I've lost my gf, lost 4 of my 5 best friends, lost a bunch of good friends, don't talk to literally anyone anymore, fell into depression, and haven't studied at all for my term 1 board examinations. Idek if it's even worth it anymore.",

Just remember that wherever you end up, you\u2019re going to find people who respect your priorities. \n\nGood luck op :)",

Ofcourse college application is damn stressful, I experienced it too. But you've got to understand the consequences of every action. Give yourself breaks, be kind to yourself. And try to prioritise. There is still time. You will find good handwritten notes (covering NCERT and PYQs) so try to read them and do few sample papers. You will be good to go. CBSE and School everything has been giving me and my friends anxiety. Even my exam centre is more than 60 kms from my home and it takes 2 hours to reach. I can't wait to get out of class 12.",

      "text": "IMHO you may just have different goals for your futures.  If they aren't grinding to get into colleges like you, you may just be at a different stage of life and some people are just in your life for certain stages.  Going to college can be a great time for students to find other people that are more like them than the smaller pool of kids from high school.  This may just be a transition time for you while you find people more serious about school and career.  Or it is a short term thing and once you finish your applications and exams you will have more time for socializing and you can catch up with them and become close again.  No matter which you do need to take some time for yourself and mental health.  Set goals for time to relax and breathe.  Good luck!",
