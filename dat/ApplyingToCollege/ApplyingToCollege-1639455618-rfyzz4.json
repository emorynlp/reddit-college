  "text": "Hello everyone! \n\nI enjoy creating art both digitally (animation) and traditionally (drawing, painting). When I did my research for college admissions, I found it hard to choose between the two majors. \n\n1) Is the acceptance rate drastically lower for technology art (animation/ game design)? I heard it\u2019s a common major for people who wanted to pursue computer science while being creative. I\u2019m wondering if their average stats are much higher than the students at Studio Art.\n\n2) If I\u2019m interested in focusing more towards the art rather than the programming, should I be looking into Studio Art more than Tech? How much of the Technology Art departments are actually about art?",

      "text": "Animation and game design can be incredibly competitive (especially if there are portfolio components) simple because there aren\u2019t that many programs compared to the number of studio art programs. \n\nIf you want more art than tech, I\u2019d go with studio artists but definitely look at the course requirements for the programs. With tech-related art programs, you are typically looking at the tech elements coming in by the second year (but this totally varies based on the program).",
