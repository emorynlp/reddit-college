      "text": "1. Some if the teachers are so out of touch. I spent an extra 200 dollars on tutoring and supplementary books just to fet a C in a class that I had taken in a previous college and Aced. He taught an into class like we were graduates.\n\n2. Covid testing every week and you can get in serious trouble if you miss even one week\n\n3. C and D grades don't always count towards your degree but will still mess up your gpa\n\n4. High crime area around Jhu campus so there is a moderate chance of getting mugged if you aren't careful\n\n2. TAs grade so effing hard. Harder than almost any professor will. Had a TA grade my papers harder than the rest of the class because \"she knows I'm passionate and care about my work\" told me if it was any other student my work would have been satisfactory (an A) but I got Bs instead because she held me to a higher standard and didn't even tell me. \n\n3. I have to eat a lunch I packed OUTSIDE (even in the winter) because I couldn't afford a meal plan (no access to dining halls) and you can't eat inside anywhere else because of covid protocols. \n\nhope this helps (:",
