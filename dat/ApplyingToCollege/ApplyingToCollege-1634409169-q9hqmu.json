  "text": "I legitimately have no self-motivation right now. I\u2019m so behind with my college applications and just can\u2019t bring myself to do anything. I have no idea what topic to choose for my personal statement because I\u2019m so unaccomplished and boring. My ECs are garbage and there are barely any of them. I don\u2019t even have a set major that I want to apply for. Honestly, I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019m not good enough to go to college. Someone please yell at me so it hopefully motivates me to get off of my butt and do stuff :)",

      "text": "That sounds rough. \n\nI'm not going to yell. But you have a decision to make. Every day. Do you want to accomplish things or not? Get up each day, get your work done (whatever it is), *then* have fun, check reddit, whatever. \n\nIf you cannot do this, then make peace with not achieving your goals and a more difficult life. \n\nI suggest you start (?) having physical exercise each day as well. This will improve your energy levels and motivation. \n\nGood luck.",

What was the hardest part for you and who helped you learn? \n\n2. Who is your favorite teacher ever and why? \n\n3. Have you always lived in the same town/city? Do you like it or do you wish you lived somewhere else? Why? \n\n4. Have you gone to school with the same people since you started school? What do you think your life would be like if you had not (or had)? \n\n5.  If you could live in a different historical time period, which would you choose? \n\n6.  Describe your ideal day. Is it packed with excitement and amusement parks? Or is it quiet and in nature? Or something else entirely?",

      "text": "Something to consider on for your college applications:. \n\nDespite what you may see on this subreddit, college applications aren't as much about being better than other applicants as about finding the college best fit (academically, financially, socially) for you.\n\nSo, stop comparing your application against anyone else's.  Instead, focus on making your application a good representation of who you are... who you you as a student, who you are as a person, and what your interests are.\n\nSo list the activities you've actually done and write about who you are.  Be secure in the knowledge that if the school doesn't choose you, it probably wasn't the best fit for you anyway.\n\nI highly recommend that you consider writing for the prompt that's about something not listed elsewhere on the application.  You probably have something to say and this is a good place to say it.\n\nAs for majors, it's okay to apply undecided.  But it's also worthwhile to go on a school's website, look up \"academics\" and pick through the majors.  At most schools, you can click through the majors and eventually find the curriculum requirements to graduate in that major.  Look at the classes required for different majors.  Do they sound fun?  Or would you rather walk over hot coals than take those classes?  If you aren't interested in most of the required classes, it isn't the right major for you.\n\nFor instance, if you look up the curriculum for any Engineering major, there's a lot of math and science classes.  If math and science aren't your jam, you shouldn't consider majoring in Engineering.  You can look at the curriculum for any major at most any university and make that kind of evaluation.",
