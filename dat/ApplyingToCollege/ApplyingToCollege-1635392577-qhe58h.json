      "text": "Depends what school you are planning on going to. All schools should have information on what exams they give credit for/ what score you need to have to get credit for them. I went to a private and they accepted all 6 of my APs even the two tests I got a 3 on for credit for their corresponding courses. Just depends but they should have info on their website because it changes year to year.",

      "text": "If your high school does not offer APs, you will not be expected to have taken them. Colleges generally evaluate you in your context. Taking the exam alone without taking the course might get you some college credits, but there are much better things you could do in terms of strengthening your application.",

      "text": "It\u2019s not that important for applications. For most schools, taking an AP level class looks rigorous \u2014 with or without the exam. A high school can be a small plus, but AP scores are low on what schools will look at compared to GPA, etc. \n\nThe exam really can help if the school offers credit, though. Most state schools and some private schools offer decent credit. Some only offer general ed credit but others give better credit. The very top private schools don\u2019t offer much credit at all but will let you take more advanced coursework with certain AP credits. I\u2019d look at each school you are interested in and see what they take for credit.",

      "text": "Not very important for admissions, especially if you cannot afford it.\n\nCredit and placement from AP exam scores will vary by college and major. This info will be posted on the college's website. For some schools, especially non-elite schools, AP credit/placement can really come in handy. If you can afford the fee, and do not plan to retake the class at college, AP calc is among the most useful.",
