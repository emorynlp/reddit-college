  "text": "in my highschool transcript, it displays my grades from 9th to my senior year. in 9th grade, I had 2 4\u2019s, and in grade 10, 2 4\u2019s but they were semester grades and the rest were a mix of 5s, 6s and 7s. in grade 11, I achieved a 40/42, then a 39/42, and again a 40/42 without the 3 points in my trimester. i\u2019m worried because i heard that mcgill don\u2019t accept people with any 4\u2019s on their transcript. advice?",
