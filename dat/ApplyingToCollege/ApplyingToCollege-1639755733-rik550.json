  "text": "My ECs are mainly related to education and advisory service. I'm also interested in sharing knowledge and providing advice for others. After graduating, I want to pursue a consulting major.\n\nI applied to Finance/Business/Econ majors for EA and ED but I think these choices are not very suitable, especially considering the irrelevance of my ECs to these majors. What should I choose instead? \n\nP/s: I don't like Education major, neither becoming a teacher. And I'm an international student.",
