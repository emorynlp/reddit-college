Just because you are not a US citizen.  \nHowever, in Texas universities, if you are an international university, and you get a scholarship of at least USD 2000, you are considered a domestic student. Your costs go down from USD 40000 per year to about USD 26000-28000 per year. On top of that there are scholarships that are guaranteed if you have a good GPA at school and a good SAT score.  \nAgain, why are you even applying for the US? I wanted to study in Germany (imo Europe better than US) but I am not fluent in German, so I had to give up on that.",
