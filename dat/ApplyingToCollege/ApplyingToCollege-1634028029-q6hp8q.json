  "text": "Okay so I've chosen the following prompt for my common app essay but I've got no clue if im tackling it right.\n\"Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others\"\nNow I feel like there are two ways i can write an essay about this prompt:\n1) I describe an experience of mine and how that shaped my view on a family memeber\n2) I describe an experience of mine and explain how that changed my view on the concept of \"work\"( I'll also shortly touch on why i chose my major)\n\nSo out of the two, which one do you think would be better? I personally feel like the first one is a bit too personal, but at the same time i feel like the second one feels a bit cliche.",

      "text": "Choosing a prompt is common but generally poor advice.   \n\n\nIgnore the prompt and write a story that shows why college will be a core to your development and future identity.  \n\n\nOften you'll be able to easily shoehorn it into a prompt or choose the open prompt. The AOs don't care about the prompt they care about the content.",
