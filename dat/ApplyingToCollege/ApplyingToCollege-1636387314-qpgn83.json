  "text": "I am first year CS major potentially looking to transfer. I am not exactly unhappy at the university I am currently enrolled in however the electives for my major and just general opportunities and clubs are not the best.\n\nI was wondering if there is any demerit to applying for reach schools as a first year transfer student AND as a second year transfer student (to the same school(s)) if I don't get accepted. The idea being that I might have some more projects, leadership positions, etc by my second year, but would also like to try and apply my first year.",
