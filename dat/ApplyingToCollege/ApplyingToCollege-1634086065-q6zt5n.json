  "text": "I\"m currently sending out the LoR links to my recommenders, but I was wondering if an elective teacher still counted as a teacher. The question sounds dumb, but when you open the \"Invite Teacher\" part of the Common App, it lists only core curriculums. FYI, my elective is Student Media. Would that count as \"English\" or \"other\" or would I just have to put that teacher as an \"other\" recommender? \n\nThank you!",
