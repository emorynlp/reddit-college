  "text": "Hello A2C!\n\nI have a question regarding waiving my FERPA rights for recommendation letters. I accidentally selected to not waive my FERPA rights to my recommendation letters when filling out my application on ApplyTexas, because I am a careless fool who did not think to double-check their choice. I have not yet submitted my application, but I have emailed the two colleges that I am applying to, and have let them know of my mistake. I have also asked them if there is any way to update/change my selection.\n\nI wanted to know if anyone else has been in this situation, or has any advice for what steps I can take from this point onwards. If it so happens that I am unable to update my choice, should I also not waive my rights on the Common App? Any advice would be much appreciated.\n\nApologies if this post came out a bit rough - I'm kind of freaking out right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time, and good luck to those applying!\n\n\\- CS667",
