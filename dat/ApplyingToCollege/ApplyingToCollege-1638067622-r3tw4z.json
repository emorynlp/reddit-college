  "text": "I\u2019m out of state in the US and I\u2019m trying to enter my courses but I\u2019m so confused about what counts as UC honors for me. Only AP and IB? What about DualEnrollment, honors, or other full-weight classes at my school? \n\nAlso, is the UC recalculated GPA the average of all 3 years of high school so far or only 10th and 11th grade? \n\n\nIf anyone is an expert on the UC app for OOS students please help\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",
