  "text": "I applied to college in 2018, but since then a lot has changed and my little brother will be a senior next year. I'm trying to give advice but it seems like the process is totally different now. What's different since 2018? Is there a 'guide to college admissions' that people found useful when applying this season? \n\nOne major difference I've heard from my brother is test scores being optional. His counselor says they don't really matter. He can send them in if he does well, if not, it doesn't matter.\n\nWithout test scores it also seems like EC / essays will matter more. My essays were super shitty. Do people get help writing essays from third parties? Are there good resources for this?",

      "text": "Eh, I don't think there's much difference. The fact that some schools are now test optional doesn't change the underlying mechanics of how most schools evaluate applications.   \n\n\nAs I said in another post: Keep in mind why colleges are test optional. It was a social justice move because the SAT and ACT were seen as disciminatory for minority and low-income students.   \n\n\nIt remains that many test-optional schools (such as Vassar) still boast about their high SAT/ACT scores, and that a failure to submit scores may register as a red flag with SOME admissions officers.   \n\n\nAs for essays: they're important. There are lots of services (paid and free) to help students craft their personal statment and the \"story\" they want to convey to admissions offices.   \n\n\nWhether ECs/extracurriculars matter more.... I think that remains to be seen because at most schools (at least the top ranked/ more selective schools), the vast majority of students still submit their scores anyways.",
