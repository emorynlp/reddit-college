  "text": "I'm currently a sophomore at Johns Hopkins, and for a long time, I thought I got in just because of my disability or that the admissions office had made a mistake. I worked extra hard during my first year here to prove to myself that I belonged here when it seemed like everyone knew what they were doing.\n\nI recently viewed my admissions file for my school and there wasn't much on there. But, there was a small note that said \"Scholarship Matching - 2nd round\" and that made my day. That was the validation I had been seeking out for 1.5 years.  To know that they recognized my potential/everything I had accomplished in high school and that they were willing to actively try to give me money to come was just an amazing feeling.  I have that huge burden off my shoulders now and I can now just go enjoy college a little bit more!\n\nFor those struggling with imposter syndrome when they get to college, know that they chose you for a reason and that they saw you could succeed at whatever amazing school you end up at.",
