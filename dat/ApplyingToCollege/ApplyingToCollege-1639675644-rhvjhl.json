      "text": "I was in a similar position.  I attended ASU\u2019s arch rival \u2014 The University of Arizona \u2014 undergrad on a full-ride scholarship, choosing UofA over several T20\u2019s.  I don\u2019t regret it one bit.  I loved living in the desert southwest, found wonderful classes and professors in the honors program, tremendously enjoyed the D1 athletics (go, Cats!), and received a ton of attention and research opportunities as I continued to excel there, all without paying a dime to attend.  And although many on A2C fret that their world will end if they don\u2019t attend a T20, that was not remotely the case for me.  I won a Truman scholarship at Arizona that I used to attend a 10T law school where I made law review before heading to a prestigious DC firm.  And my best friends left Arizona to attend law school at Stanford, Berkeley, and Notre Dame. \n\nAs to ASU, the campus is pretty lovely and the honors college is consistently ranked in the top 3.  It\u2019s hot as heck May-September, but every building is air-conditioned.  And October-April you\u2019ll enjoy highs in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s.  There\u2019s excellent nearby hiking, climbing and tubing, and doable weekend trips to Tucson, Sedona, and the Grand Canyon.  Restaurants, coffee shops, bars, bookstores, movie theatres, and shops are nearby and plentiful.  And you are on the college circuit for bands, comics, and theater touring from California.  All good stuff!",

              "text": "No worries.  If you want to discover more about the vibe, Google the university newspaper and ASU\u2019s list of clubs and activities.  You can also check out the rec center and see what kinds of outdoor trips and activities they sponsor.  And I always recommend checking out the course offerings in your intended major \u2014 also available online \u2014 to see if the required and elective courses are exciting (or at least interesting) to you.  Finally, I always find it interesting to check out student top tens and bucket lists to see what the students really love about their school.  For example, you can Google top 10 classes at ASU, top ten professors at ASU, top ten experiences at ASU, or things to do before graduating from ASU.  Stuff like that.  It will help give you a better sense of the students and the school.  Good luck!",

      "text": "i go there currently. i really like it a lot! they have great STEM programs, and tempe is a perfect college town. the music scene is great if you're into that as well! there are quite a few venues nearby, and they advertise music festivals all the time. there are plenty of good food options right around campus too! not to mention there's tempe marketplace a couple miles away for shopping. the transit system is very easy to navigate, and i think asu students can ride it for free/discounted price. there are also good thrift shops nearby...tempe is super walkable!\n\ni would also recommend checking out barrett. it's the honors college at asu, and their housing and food are some of the better options for first-year students. barrett also has great one-on-one tutoring resources that you might get as a regular asu student.\n\nalso there's boba and a trader joe's within walking distance, if you're into those things.",
