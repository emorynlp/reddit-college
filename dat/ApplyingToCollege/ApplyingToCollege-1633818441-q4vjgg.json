      "text": "For me personally it was a lot of small steps over a few years. I got pretty interested in ML as a freshman so I took some online classes and downloaded all the packages and tried to mess around with data for fantasy football and things like that.\n\nThen I did a (free) four week summer camp at MIT called BWSI where in my group we learnt about the applications of AI in healthcare and that really got my interest in it going strong. \n\nThen I entered a few competitions, none as big as ISEF or anything like that, and felt pretty good about my work so I reached out to some professors with samples of my work and how I envisioned contributing to their teams.\n\nI only got two responses, one of which was a polite no, but one of them let me intern with them for a summer, and I got to do high level research into Generative Adversarial Neural networks! It was so freaking cool.\n\nBut anyway, TLDR: I took a bunch of smaller steps that eventually led to research, but tbh they would\u2019ve been super enriching on their own anyway.",
