Do ucs (test blind) rly not consider sat scores at all? I have an ok score (1500), and im curious if it will help my chance after all. \n3. Do major choices affect admissions, or is it possible to affect them? Im planning to choose art/business majors\u2026less competitive than stem majors, (ex. cs) I believe?\n\nthx. have a nice day\u270c\ufe0f",
