  "text": "I am literally confused about what to do and how to do it. I was interested in Astronomy, Astrophysics in the beginning but soon I develop an interest in Rocket Science and aerospace, like that. Now I want to pursue engineering in my undergrad but my whole profile and my projects works that I did in my high school were like research types, related to astronomy and astrophysics. \n\nMy final goal is to end with Aerospace Degree. So what should I do for now while applying to college? Should I take Physics and computer science in an undergrad and apply for aerospace or engineering in my master's or apply for engineering as my first priority? \n\nPlease Help me out. By the way, I am an international Student.",
