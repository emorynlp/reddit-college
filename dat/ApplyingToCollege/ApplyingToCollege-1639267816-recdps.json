  "text": "obviously, i am not expecting her to get rejected, but the school she is applying to is an especially competitive one. \n\nshe is finding out her decision on monday and i was wondering how best i should support her if it doesn\u2019t go well? i feel like it would be especially difficult considering 2/3 of us have gotten in (or at least it was something that i was worried about for myself if it was me in the position). \n\nwhat kind of comfort/support do you think would be most appreciated? \n\nthanks sm!\n\nUPDATE: SHE GOT IN! NO CONSOLING NEEDED!!",

      "text": "Remind her how much value she has without the school and be there for her because of who she is \n\nHonestly just make sure she feels seen \n\nBe proud of her because of what she\u2019s done but more than just academics proud for who she is, let her know you see how hard she\u2019s worked and that that isn\u2019t discredited because one school judged her only on paper \n\nI think a lot of people base their self worth on stuff like this and while your support might not ease all the pain of the rejection it can help her realize she is just as great",

      "text": "I have never been in this situation, but I\u2019d say you have to emphasize that you know so much more about your friend than the college that rejected her. Tell her how much you value her and why, and explain to her how that college couldn\u2019t possibly have known, from an application, all the fantastic things she is as a person that her friends (you), her family, and other colleges that do accept her will see more clearly.",

      "text": "I literally just made a reddit account because I wanted to give my two cents on this - I actually experienced (pretty much) this exact situation. My two best friends both got in ED/REA (both decisions came out before mine), but I ended up getting deferred from my REA (and eventually got rejected). \n\nIn my opinion, there's not really one correct thing you can do. My deferral meant that I had to laser-focus on the rest of my applications: remember that if they get rejected, they have pretty much 2-3 weeks to finish and submit however many more applications that you won't need to. What my friends did (which I thought was very effective for me) was to not linger too much over the deferral and to help reorient me towards making the rest of my applications as good as they could be. For me, there wasn't too much point in getting too hung up on a deferral; in some ways, I thought of it as an extra RD application that I just submitted super early (one college checked off my list!). To have friends that help ground you in reality - not overreacting (because it is far from the end of the world) but instead emphasizing that they had my back - was very important for me.\n\nThat being said, it's definitely dependent on the person. Some people  need emotional support/a shoulder to cry on, and that's completely okay and is obviously something that you should provide. It probably goes without saying that you should also not mention your acceptance if your friend is in an emotionally fragile state.\n\nLet me know if you want more elaboration on anything I said. Best of luck to your friend!",
