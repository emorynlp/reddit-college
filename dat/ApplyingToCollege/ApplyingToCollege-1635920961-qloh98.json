  "text": "Ok this is super random and weird bur I have 2 e-mails, one for all the college stuff and the other one is personal. Basically, my CommonApp, College Board and etc. accounts are registered on the work email, but my councillor decided to put my personal email while sending my scores. I got an email by the uni I applied to ED on my personal email, not the work one and I was wondering if it has some effect on my application and stuff. Please help T.T",
