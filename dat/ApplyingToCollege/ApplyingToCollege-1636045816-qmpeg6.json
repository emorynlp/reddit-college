  "text": "So I am in a dilemma at the moment. Back in March, I scored a 1490 on the SAT (790 Math, 700 English). This puts me in the 25th to 75th percentile for Yale and Harvard which is great but just below this percentile for MIT.\n\nNow, I heard that MIT looks mainly at the math score which is pretty strong in my case. Is this true?\n\nIf not, I will register for the December SAT. I expect a 1520 then (770 Math, 750 English). Will my chances improve through that?",

      "text": "Math is obviously much more important than English for MIT, but honestly scoring a 790 on a test that measures 9th grade math is meaningless for MIT. You need to show exceptional ability. Do you have a 5 on AP Calc/chem/bio/physics/etc? Do you have ECs that set you apart from others in math/science/engineering? That needs to be the focus for MIT, but a couple reading comprehension questions.",
