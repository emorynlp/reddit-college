  "text": "I am writing about my grandfather's death and the effect it had on me, which I know is advised against, but I am including my experiences as being one of his sole caretakers during his at-home hospice care. Would this add a unique aspect to the \"death\" topic and make it okay to write about? Obviously including how I reacted to the death and what it taught me, etc.\n\nIf anyone would be willing to read it through and give me feedback that would be greatly appreciated as well.",
