  "title:": "Advice for a Worried CWRU applicant?",
  "text": "Hi! So I\u2019m applying to CWRU in two days (almost done with everything just getting a check up on my final common app essay draft) and honestly I\u2019m worried. I messed up freshman year and got a 2.9 cumulative GPA and I\u2019ve worked it up to a 3.7905 but I\u2019m still nervous ngl. I have  a 32.25 SS for act. The only saving grace to be honest is that they like Eagle Scouts since apparently a lot of their admission team were Eagle Scouts but still nervous since it\u2019s a target school and I don\u2019t have anything crazy. Anyone have any similar feelings of nervousness and know anything that I can do to maybe increase my chances? I\u2019ve checked the rules and although I\u2019m close to the chanceme one I don\u2019t think I go over it. Thanks for the advice and sorry for the bother!",

          "text": "Definitely not saying to worry at all, but CWRU has rejected people from our district HS in the past three years who have gotten into MIT, CMU, and Yale. Yield protection? Maybe, who knows. All I know is that they\u2019re trying like crazy to get their acceptance rate way, way down through aggressive recruitment (all those emails) and ease of application (no extra essays). Just keep in mind it\u2019s been pretty random, w/ crazy results the past few years. Good luck!",
