  "text": "Hi guys! I\u2019ve been applying to boarding schools all over the place and I realised that for most of them they say \u201cA full time boarder resides at the college on a permanent basis during term time, returning home for the school holiday\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the problem, I do not want to return home on school holidays, does this mean I can\u2019t pick this school because they want me to go back during holidays? Or what can I do?",

      "text": "If you're lucky, you will make friends with a day student who will invite you to stay with their family during breaks. Or some schools organize trips for students who can't return home. But at almost all schools, students need to be out of the dorms when the break is a week or longer.\n\nFor how each school handles, ask that school.",
