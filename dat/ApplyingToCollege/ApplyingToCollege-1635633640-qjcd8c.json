  "text": "Hello,\n\nI just submitted my applications via Commonapp. I realized that each school will individually send me a log in code for their application status check within 3 business days which is already after 11/1, the deadline for applying early. However, I was wondering if I am missing anything, will I still be able to send them the missing materials directly to them via application status check?",
