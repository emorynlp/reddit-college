Also, no one really cares how you got in. Then again, I'm just a freshman who's been here for 4 weeks, and I'm not a hotelie. Please don't let this reason deter you from applying and hopefully enrolling. If you are that concerned, I would ask an upperclassman hotelie, though I really wouldn't be worried about this at all.",

I believe Cornell has their acceptances by college in their site if you do a bit of digging, if you want actual numbers.

I know plenty of people who haven't done something like this though. Also had good STEM grades in HS. While not having many stem things may hurt your chances a little, it definitely won't exclude you. \n\nFor the essay, do your research about classes, extracurriculars, etc and describe how you could effectively use what's unique at Cornell to help you in your life. State your current (academic or non academic) interests and state how Cornell specifically will help foster a great environment to help you drive deeper into those interests, if you know what I mean. Some examples are project teams, specific classes, things on campus, etc. \n\nSorry about the late reply.",

And yes, they do not offer an Aero major. \n\nI have no clue how good the program is, as I really didn't look into aero/mechE. Ask other people or look at some rankings or something (rankings are also not the best measure of how good a program is). \n\nWhile I have not looked into research opportunities, there are many opportunities where you can do something as a MechE major. Project teams are the big ones. Most project teams have mechanical subteams, and they are all very cool. [Look into them](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/students/undergraduate-students/special-programs/project-teams/active-project-teams). My basic knowledge of the availability of research labs is that there are a decent amount of labs that do look for undergraduate students to work in them. \n\nI really don't think you being an international student will limit any opportunities.\n\nI hope this helped.",

I put my all into the application and now all I can feel is that something I did caused the rejection from my dream school. While my obsession with the school died off a little bit this year (I found other schools I liked), it still hurt like hell reading that letter. Wondering whether I could have done more, what the application was missing, what I did to get rejected. Seeing someone get in from our rival high school just makes it all the worse because that shows that someone got in. The acceptances aren't foreign or anonymous to me anymore, they are right here, staring at me. The letter that most likely won't ruin my life, but that ruined my month. Sorry for the bum post but just had to get it off my chest.",

Whether you were accepted, deferred, or denied, you are all such talented humans and have bright futures ahead! Many people can't even imagine applying to a school like Cornell and for you taking the courage to do so - especially early decision - should be something to be proud of on its own. As cliche as it sounds, you will find the right fit and college decisions do not determine your worth. Best of luck and congrats to everyone <3",

Additionally, some of the space will probably be used to house freshmen currently in crowded forced triple rooms. So total increase in freshman population will probably be less than that, but still a really good sign!!",
