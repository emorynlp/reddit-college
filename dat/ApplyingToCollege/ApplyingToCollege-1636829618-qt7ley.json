      "text": "Same here! A lot of the essays are rather personal, so it's weird to have people I know read them. I mostly tell myself that there's going to be a bunch of random strangers (AOs) reading them and judging them anyway, so might as well get some useful criticism out of it and prep the essays for all that. Still weird when people I know read them tho",
