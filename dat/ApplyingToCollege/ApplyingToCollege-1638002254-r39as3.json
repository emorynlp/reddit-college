You don't want to limit yourself to one school when you're happy going to other ones. And unless you're perfectly happy paying 100% of what the net price calculator tells you, you're preventing yourself from getting other financial aid offers.\n\nED is great if you're really committed to a single school and money isn't an issue at all. But those two traits don't apply to 90% of college applicants.",

Essentially\u2014if the college gives you less than their net price calculator said you would receive. And the net price calculator tends to not give generous financial aid in my experiences. So even if the tuition would cause you a lot of burden financially, if you can technically afford it according to their net price calculator, you still can't reject their offer. \n\nAlso from what I've heard, there's a lot of hoops to jump through in terms of actually rejecting the offer, and overall just does not seem to be worth the hassle.",
