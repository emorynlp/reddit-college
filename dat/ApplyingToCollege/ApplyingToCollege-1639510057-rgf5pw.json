  "text": "I know decisions are comin out like very soon, but just hope for the best and don't let any negative thoughts enter your minds. In fact, I highly suggest you visualize yourself holding your acceptance letter and celebrating. It's a strategy I use a *lot*, and it sure helps. Reprogram your subconscious mind to think and hope for the best. \n\nGood luck to y'all! :D",
