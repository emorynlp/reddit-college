  "text": "I'm having a very tough time choosing between Harvey Mudd and CMU. The Harvey Mudd campus is much better looking, and I love the tightknit community, but from what I've found CMU has better recruitment. More students work at large companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.\n\nI'd be very happy at either one, but I'm having a tough time deciding which one to ed1. Fortunately they both have ed2 so I'll just ed2 whichever one I don't ed1.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Which one do you think has better academics, better community, and better employer recruitment?",

As you mentioned they have different numbers of students, but even factoring that in, mudd lags behind. Mudd has around 80 cs majors yearly (cs and cs/math), while CMU has 250. So CMU has a 5x big tech employment rate compared to mudd.\n\nIn general mudd has a great big tech employment rate. Comparable to Mit and other top schools. But for whatever reason CMU has a much higher rate.\n\nMudd does have the second highest rate of PhD achievers, right behind cal tech.",

The gap isn't that big though - Harvey Mudd is excellent there too.\n\nThat's just my preferences though - if you prefer being in a city to the suburbs, or prefer top researchers to a teaching emphasis you should go with CMU.",

There are reasons to choose HM but those aren't them. One of my favorite things about CMU is the courses offered. There's no university with more variety and more options in CS, at least partially due to being a huge graduate school and undergrads having access to most of those classes.\nIn the end, you can't go wrong with either choice, pick the one where you will be happiest and be able to do your best. In reality, you're choosing which awesome place to attend.",
