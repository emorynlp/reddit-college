  "title:": "Sometimes I\u2019m mad at myself that I like computer science",
  "text": "Not really, like I really love coding and I see myself doing it as a career, but from a college admissions perspective I feel like I could get into much better college if I chose history for a major. I have good AP test scores for History and it\u2019s less competitive overall and I literally watch history videos for fun (#nerd). My only science AP test score I got a 2 (yay distanced learning physics) and I\u2019ve never taken an AP math test (I am this year tho). Like I literally cried last night staring at naviance acceptance stats seeing that people got into certain school with my stats\u2026 but it probably wasn\u2019t an impacted major.",

      "text": "If you're truly passionate about Computer Science, you should focus on getting into a college that teaches you the subject well and gets you access to good opportunities - not a college that is simply ranked highly... Employers care about your skills, not where you went to college - these do have a correlation sometimes, but that's not always the case.",
