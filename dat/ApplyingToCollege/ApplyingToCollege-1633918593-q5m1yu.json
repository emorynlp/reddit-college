  "text": "Okay, okay. So today I just took a practice test for the SAT, and got a 1530 (which is just a fluctuation around my last score of 1550), and I was pretty meh about it.\n\nWell not until my toxic parents decided that this was the greatest failures of my lifetime (KEEP IN MIND THIS IS A PRACTICE TEST, I haven't even taken my first real one), and at this point I can't even give two shits about their opinion. They want me to \"care\" about the SAT, but their bullshit is just demotivating as hell, like wtf do they think I do when I practice?\n\nI just can't wait until college (cause like honestly high school mainly sucks cause of college) and don't have to deal with this shit.",
