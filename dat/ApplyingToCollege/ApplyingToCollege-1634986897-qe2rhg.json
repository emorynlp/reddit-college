  "title:": "I'm done with university applications.",
  "text": "No, stop celebrating. I'm not DONE with them, I'm just done with myself for having to deal with them.\n\nGah, here comes the feeling of burning out and left with zero motivation literally 9 days before the Early applications are due, and having two more applications completely not started yet... why am I doing this to myself? \n\nEarlier today, I checked the newspaper of the university I wanted to ED to (to gather information for their why us essay) and all I could find was people complaining about how fucking tight their schedule is just to pass college... would I be able to even cope with university life, now that I'm already struggling with high school? \n\nThe application is just the beginning. The real hell comes afterward. I'm not sure how it could get any worse. Being an international is just a fancy way of saying that you'll get rejected from all the schools you apply to unless you're an Olympic athlete or in the process of curing cancer. Being in university is just a fancy way of borrowing money you know you can't pay back but borrowing it anyway, and being in the US is just a fancy way of saying that you can't integrate into the culture and someday you'll be racially profiled by some lowlife wanker on the street. \n\nI look around my fellow students and they're fucking amazing. Granted, there are those who aren't doing as well as I am, but they mostly have low expectations. My parents have the same expectations for me as those in my grade who are national sports champions and curing cancer simultaneously, and I can't apply to any safety EA schools cause they're just gonna scoff at them. It's too late now, I can't even finish my originally planned early applications. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease take this moment to think about your own mental health when you apply for university. The worst is perhaps yet to come.",

I have been seriously working towards my application since the past year now and I am running behind on everything. I've suddenly started hating my essay and everything else about my application. If I do not get into a good university, my relatives and my parents are just going to think I am incapable. And at this point, I think so too.",
