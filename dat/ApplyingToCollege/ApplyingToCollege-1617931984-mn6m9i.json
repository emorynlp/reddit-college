  "text": "I got rejected/waitlisted from every. single. non-safety I applied to and I feel so terrible about it. My parents aren't making me feel any better. In fact, my mom yelled at me twice today for \"only getting a 1590 the second time\" instead of doing well on the first try, as if that's the reason why I wasn't accepted. It hurts so much more when all of my family and my parents' friends keep trying to console my parents about my rejections. Everybody around me thought I was going to get into a T20 and they were shocked when I didn't, so it feels like I disappointed all of them.\n\nI feel so alone because, not exaggerating, all of my friends are going to ivies + stanford/mit, and here I am looking at my state flagship (don't get me wrong, it's a great option and I'm happy that I was accepted at least somewhere, but it's not the same).\n\nBefore getting rejection after rejection, I have never cried about school or anything serious. But just today, I cried 7 separate times and at this point I'm too tired to even wipe the tears from my face. Not really a point to this post, just carthatic ig.\n\nEdit: Thank you everybody for your love and support! I definitely feel somewhat better and I think it\u2019ll just take time for me to completely be ok. For those of you worried because I got a 1590 and still got rejected/waitlisted everywhere: don\u2019t stress about it. Focus on your extracurriculars (mine were weak af and that\u2019s where I suspect got me all these rejections) and essays and you\u2019ll all do amazing!",

I also got waitlisted/rejected by my top schools and I remember my mom came in like, \"Why did you even bother doing all of these EC's and studying if you didn't even get in. You wasted your time you idiot. Why don't you go commit suicide?\"\n\nAnd honestly, that broke me. But I looked at the school that I committed to and tried to fall in love with it. Sometimes you can't change the past so you look towards the future. \n\nIf the world wants to shoot me down then fine, I'll just come back ten times better! :)",

If I had gotten into my top choice, it was in a different state and I wouldn\u2019t have met my spouse or had my three kids and very happy life and college experience that was my actual fate.

I would love to know how Ivy League schools even make admissions decisions, when they have so many talented applicants.  The chance of admission in any year is so small due to the huge numbers of applicants.  And with the elimination of the need for testing  scores due to COVID, the number of applications have greatly increased , and acceptance rates have dropped considerably. There was an article in The NY Times yesterday on this very issue.  I guarantee you that many students with 1600\u2019s did not get accepted to so called \u201ctop tier\u201d schools. It is simply a matter of numbers, and it Is absolutely no reflection on you.  \n\nThis country\u2019s obsession with the Ivy League and other \u201cbrand name\u201d colleges is disturbing to say the least. It is what led to the college admissions  scandal. There are so many wonderful colleges and universities in the United States.   The point is to get an education, and to make the most of it. Think of how many successful people in the world did not go to an Ivy League school!   \n\nYou are going to be fine, and you  have a great future ahead of you!   Good luck, and please  just be happy.

I mean u are saving $$$. Sure Ivies offer a bunch of new relationships and networks, but I met some of the most amazing and talented people outside of the \u201celite\u201d clubs and honor societies. In terms of career, yes a T20 will def help u, BUT ur happiness and mental health??? FUCK THAT SHIT, enjoy the next four years and focus. \n\nyou got this\nLove,\nW\n\nP.S. I\u2019m sorry if it came off as a bit aggressive :3",

For instance, look up grad school entry requirements or the career prospects of your flagship state school. It wouldn't be a flagship without any reason, and you'll definitely get enough resources to succeed in your undergrad years. Frankly the Ivies only tell you about a minor proportion of their graduates who are really successful. All schools do that. IMO it's much better to graduate as a top student from second tier colleges than graduate with \"meh\" results from the Ivies  especially if you want to get a good postgraduate degree. Besides, nobody really cares about your undergraduate degree once you got your postgraduate one, just like how high schools will NOT consider the prestige of your kindergarten while deciding whether or not to admit you. If your parents are still infuriated over you not getting into the Ivies, shut them up by talking about your postgraduate plans. As an Asian I can testify that this works amazingly well because you somehow need to show your parents some \"ambition\". If they are being too toxic, find them a psychiatrist.",

These top schools are only \u201celite\u201d because they have a bunch of kids like you and your friends: smart, ambitious, and resourceful students. But they don\u2019t have *all* of them. Just a handful that they picked will have fun together, interact well, etc. If it helps you feel better, Harvard students get rejected from streaks of job offers. Stanford students struggle to find CS internships even in Silicon Valley. Princeton students dress up and commute all the way to NYC for an interview, just to go home with a rejection, time and time again. \nAs someone who knows a lot of people who applied to top colleges, a lot of the decisions made zero sense to me. Obviously I didn\u2019t see their applications, but I think my four years of knowing someone is better than a five minute read of some possibly BSed extracurriculars and some arbitrary essay that nobody really wants to write. I reckon you should use some of your saved tuition money to buy yourself a little something whenever your parents chill out and allow time to heal these wounds.",

Don't listen to them because 1590 second time is better than whatever score you got the first time. \n\nYou're doing great. It sucks that the cultures of this generation have consumed the mindsets and perceptions to make us believe that the educational institutes determine our baseline of success. You can't even attend community college without people fucking looking down on you like you've failed to attend any major universities and cc was your last resort. \n\nFor what it's worth, try the mindset that we all personally have \"safety\" schools for a reason because they're easier to us all in a personal manner. You challenged yourself to reach higher standards by applying to \"non-safety\" schools and just because you didn't get in this time/were waitlisted doesn't mean you've failed.

My friend was accepted to Columbia last year for being really good at the mandolin! The college application process this year is especially crazy. Almost every school in the top hundred colleges had lowered acceptance rates and waitlists have massively increased. I also promise that people (other than your parents) are thinking about you a lot less than you expect!! And you're not alone in this- so many kids were surprised this year.

The last time I checked the average ACT score at OSU was like a 31. I\u2019m not sure if I would even get in now if I applied. \n\nHOWEVER. I graduated cum laude and am now in medical school. \n\nIt\u2019s sucks now, but going to a safety school will not hinder you in any way if you strive to make your college experience what you want it to be. I\u2019m consistently getting better scores on every single exam in med school than my classmates that went to a \u201cbetter\u201d school. So don\u2019t sweat it. You\u2019ll be fine!",

A state flagship school is a FANTASTIC choice if you are planning on grad school. My spouse went to a no-name liberal arts school for undergrad and then did grad school at that most prestigious school in Boston. Grad school is the only brand name anyone cares about. And it sounds like you\u2019ll save a bunch on tuition which will mean a lot more than you even realize right now.\n\nAnd not sure if you are aware of this, but colleges are expecting a much bigger than usual churn through the waitlists this year because everyone applied to more schools than normal. I would be surprised if you don\u2019t get an offer from at least one on those. But even if you don\u2019t, you are in a great position. I\u2019m genuinely excited for you; it\u2019s all going to work out.",

      "text": "Hey!\n\nI\u2019ve been lurking here for a few years because seeing what you all go through now is insane compared to what I went through way back when. But I went through this exact situation and want to help provide some clarity around what will happen for you at your state school.\n\nI was quite literally the same situation as you. I applied to 13 schools back in 2008, all the ivies + USC/ Stanford/ NYU/ Vanderbilt... and my state school, Iowa State! I had a 4.2 GPA, a 34 on my ACT, captain of the water polo and swim teams, involved in our schools investment and school pride clubs... I did it all. I\u2019m talking with everyone, I was more or less a shoe-in to go wherever I so pleased. Me and some friends had it in our minds that we\u2019d all commit to Yale and get a condo in new haven or some shit that I can\u2019t remember now. Our hubris was absurd but college wasn\u2019t this monolith of difficulty to get into like it is now, so we thought we were the top of the top!\n\nBut slowly, I was rejected from quite literally every single school I applied to, save for a waitlist from Vandy and NYU. I was shell shocked. I didn\u2019t go to school for two days just because I didn\u2019t know how to face everyone and tell them that me of all people, was rejected from every school. I was this Ivy guaranteed kid and now I didn\u2019t even have a school to attend in the fall. My parents looked at me like I was a joke. My sister had better grades than I did, and my brother has gone to USC, why couldn\u2019t I be like them? Here I was, set to go to a community college with borderline perfect stats from a HS student. I felt pathetic and worthless.\n\nSo I made a backup plan. It wasn\u2019t too late for me to apply to Iowa State, where I had plenty of friends attending, and they actually had a decent program for my desired degree! So I applied and got in the next day to their honors college. About a week later, I got their largest scholarship as well, making my expense there virtually free. Then I got off the waitlist and accepted to Vanderbilt and NYU! My luck was turning around!\n\nNow; my family was dirt poor though and I was left with a choice. Do I attend Vanderbilt for $60,000 a year, NYU for $75,000 a year... or a Iowa State for free? Two of the options validated my intelligence and made it feel like my four years of grinding perfection was worth it, and one option made it so that I would have a degree and I\u2019d be so far ahead of my peers financially that I could spring board that into future success. So I did the latter, and enrolled at ISU!\n\nIt was the best decision I ever made. The honors college was incredible, Ames was so much fun to be in. I found the love of my life twice and it didn\u2019t work out either time haha. I joined a fraternity! I got amazing internships with Deloitte and EY, I did research and competitions with professors and incubator programs. I got a perfect GPA... I had a whirlwind of a career there, and it was all free. \n\nMy senior year, I worked on my graduate applications and ended up at my magnum opus. I got into Harvard for my dream program. I attended, worked in hospital management for a few years, then management consulting, and now I\u2019m a manager at some fresh faces tech hub out in Denver. \n\nI have no student loans even from my time at Harvard, and my friends that went to Ivy\u2019s are similarly successful. But to get where we all are, they paid off $200,000 in student loans. I paid about $80,000 even with grad school because my internships floated most of my expense. \n\nI write this saga to you because I want you to realize your state school isn\u2019t a death sentence. You are not ages behind your peers now. In fact, you will likely surpass them! Your experience is what YOU make of it. And you WILL go to that school and be AMAZING. You will get amazing grades, and make lifelong friends, and be HAPPY. Life will workout for you, i of all people can uniquely promise that. And if your parents don\u2019t come around, fuck\u2019em. It\u2019s your life and when you become happy and successful and brilliant at your state school, that is all that truly matters. \n\nI want to say I wish you all the best, but I don\u2019t think you need the added luck; you\u2019re going to be incredible. This isn\u2019t a set back, it\u2019s platform for you to experience unneeded hardship, which I promise will happen many dozens more time in life. You\u2019re going to be a better person after this, so go kick ass and be amazing whoever you so choose!",

Yes, I understand the whole connection/prestige/halo effect but here's the thing; when I hire someone I don't really care where they went to school beyond that it's a legitimate school. I look at marks and activities if they are a newbie and after a certain point I don't care about that, I care about experience and abilities.

All of this really stinks and definitely let yourself feel crappy about it - for a small amount of time bc you need to grieve the loss of what you thought your immediate future was going to be.

Flash forward in time + experience + adventures, I now run a small IT shop. This not bc of college or THE college - more bc i kept an open mind and leaned into the journey. You sound super smart and clever. Don't let other people's expectations of you define you. You are going to do great things - and you don't need an Ivy for that. Go watch Robert Greene's youtube Ted Talk - it will make sense: [https://youtu.be/gLt\\_yDvdeLQ](https://youtu.be/gLt_yDvdeLQ)\n\nPer your parents' reactions - not cool.

There are gonna be people in the comments that are gonna say things like \"college decisions don't define you\" or \"where you go to college isn't important.\" Are these things true? Yeah, definitely. Does it make the rejections/waitlists sting any less? Not at all.\n\nWe've spent the last 4 years grinding for this, it's probably the most important and defining experience for a good portion of us at this point of our lives. In a sense, we've made these decisions define us because we've put in so much effort. So, I think it's ok to wallow in sadness and angst. I know I did for a bit. Keeping it in and trying to maintain a happy facade will only make things worse.\n\nSo fuck it, cry as much as your want. You may look back on it and cringe, I know I have, but it really helped me get a better grip on my emotions.",

      "text": "Okay, I'm terribly sorry for you. I'm almost **in the exact same boat**, but by some miracle, NYU accepted me. Every other non-safety waitlisted/rejected. So I kinda know how you feel.   \n\n\nI know this might be hard to hear, but I can give you a quick explanation for likely why you might have not been accepted (same reason for me, high SAT as well). Essentially, the SAT is virtually useless this year. Although you might send in a super high score, it matters very little because there's not enough people to benchmark you against. They can't compare you score, so perhaps you and some others were just lucky with that test, and it was easier than all others ever. Although that is not the case probably, your score honestly won't matter too much. Even you ECs are gonna actually be valued less. They know that COVID impacted alot of people unfairly, and its difficult to benchmark you against them. As a result, only the most insane ECs truly matter that much. This, your GPA is absolutely insanely important. For me personally, I had a decent GPA, and great SAT, and insane ECs. I was hoping that the good GPA (not insane), and good SAT show me as a great academics student, and my ECs would carry me the rest of the way. Unfortunately, this year do be the exact opposite. AKA. I got fucked.   \n\n\nAnyhow, I think I took my rejections/waitlists pretty well. Mostly because early on, I commited to my safeties in my mind, and tried to get rid of all my expectations. When I first applied, I lowkey was mad confident I could get into HYPSM with my stacked ECs, but when the rejections started rolling in at targets, I just gave up hope for mental damage control. So naturally I was super hyped when NYU accepted, and would be entirely okay if they didn't.   \n\n\nI've spoken to alot of people who've really gotten fucked this year. Its okay. Keep you head up, depending on your major, this barely matters lol. Its just a clout thing. If your dream is still your dream, fuck all this lol. This sure as hell isn't going to stop you from making a difference. The greatest minds of all time mostly didn't come from insane undergrads (mostly grad school). Do what makes you happy, and keep going because you will make it.",

You still have a chance. \n\nBut then if it's the latter, don't consider it such a big loss: the college you go to shouldn't define your self or worth. You as a person are so much more than where you hoped to get admitted.\n\nI'm not saying that the only reason to go to an ivy is if your friends are there, but my point is: don't be super bummed out about it. Like, consider the one big loss to be the fact that you won't be with your friends in uni. But that doesn't even matter, because you're gonna make amazing friends in uni, regardless of where you go. \n\nI have a friend who also got rejected to not only ivies, but every school in the US that he applied to (they were all prestigious schools). I think he'll have taken 10 APs by the time he graduates, SAT score like your's, participated in more than enough actives (and was the president in clubs & societies) that he legitimately told me that he ran out of space while filling out the Common app section. He didn't even get waitlisted. And it's not just a couple people who are in this situation. There are so so so many. You're not alone.\n\nLastly, I'm sorry you have such toxic parents. A ten point difference is practically nothing; in fact, I actually heard that Harvard was more likely to accept a non-perfect SAT than a perfect SAT score. Don't let your parents bully you like that, and don't let yourself bully you by trying to find a fault or the underlying reason on why you didn't get accepted.",

      "text": "I definitely didn't think I'd get into a top 20, but I did apply to a few reach schools like Emory, UMich, and UVA. Besides being OOS everywhere, my grades and SAT weren't amazing either. I just wanted to take a chance. As expected, I was rejected by all three, but it still hurt like crazy. In fact, I felt numb when I opened the third rejection (Mich). I can't relate to your expectation, but I definitely understand what it's like to have impossibly high standards. I struggle with generalized anxiety and perfectionism, and it is a terrible combination. One thing I have been trying though is to reframe my acceptances. I was accepted at my two safties and my target. My disappointment has made it difficult to get excited about my acceptances, but reading this blog helped [https://admissions.umich.edu/explore-visit/blog/how-deal-college-application-rejections](https://admissions.umich.edu/explore-visit/blog/how-deal-college-application-rejections). I am still hella salty when I see people posting about UVA and UMich, because those were my dream schools, but I have found a few ways to redirect myself: \n\n\\- write cons about the schools that rejected you \n\n\\- remind yourself that the quality of your education depends on how you use the resources available to you. \n\n\\- you can THRIVE at your safety \n\n\\- college rejections can feel personal, but please remind yourself that they definitely aren't. \n\n\\- you can still form a strong network at your safety. it's up to you! \n\n\\- your hard work didn't go to waste. you still have the wonderful knowledge and work ethic you acquired \n\nwe are all here to support you! in case no one has told you, I am proud of you.",

      "text": "HEY THERE it's okay you got this, same shit happened to me! rejected from 17 schools, waitlisted at 6, and accepted at 3. sometimes that's life but hey remember that you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. was utterly disappointed at first because I thought that with everything i've done i would have gotten into at least one T10 but now that i think of it, it's just, whatever. at the end of the day it just boils down to your application (which isn't even a full or proper representation of who you are as a person) and the admissions officer reading it. and i get it when parents are so fcking unsupportive. my mom let all hellfire loose when I finally got the guts to tell her my college results ; now she acts as if i'm not even going to college at all (despite having gotten into UCI and UCSD then committed to UCSD for chemical engineering -\\_- and hey there's still a chance i could get off of the uc berkeley CS waitlist right -\\_-maybe not imfao). i guess that's just how some parents are, they really gotta stop fking idolizing t20s. regardless of which college you choose, i'm pretty sure they're all gonna teach you how to take the derivative of a function the same way. parents (especially \\*some\\* immigrant parents) just love to worship t20s to the point where it's toxic and places unrealistic expectations on a 17 year old teen that can't even control what goes on in the admissions office. anyways sorry for the long comment but remember. it's okay !! when you look back at everything in 10 years you'll most likely just have a good laugh and know that everything did end up working out. it might not end up working out the way you imagined, but hell yeah it's definitely gonna work out one way or another. fingers crossed. OP you're doing fucking amazing and you're gonna go far in life !!!",
