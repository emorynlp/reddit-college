If you are talking about a school that has a shortage of housing,  it is a school you are very interested in or you want a specific dorm that you know is highly desirable, and you can afford the deposit (usually like $50-75), I say go for it.    Some you apply to housing to \"save your place in line\" while you wait for news of acceptance.  Some you don't get the chance until you are accepted.  Good Luck!",
