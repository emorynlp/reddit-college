  "text": "Yeah so it\u2019s kind of concerning how un-nervous I\u2019ve been for my decisions. Like all my friends are freaking out and checking their portal every ten minutes while I\u2019m just here chilling. I\u2019m more stressed FOR THEM then I am about my own decisions. So yeah someone help make me realize the magnitude of college decisions because I feel like I\u2019m not anxious enough.",
