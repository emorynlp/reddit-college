  "text": "I mean college look for 'demonstrated interest'. Sure. But I feel like these helicopter parents do ruin it. I know kids from my school who won the school 'coding olympiad' or whatever they call it and are part of some coding club but are objectively bad at it because they just learn to answer some questions. I mean they're miserable doing what they do and literally say it out loud, but their app does look pretty. Like bruh I spend all day in a dark room coding and messing around on github and other forums. That's my whole life now. Learn about some language, networking, security, recreating something I like. I do it because I love it. I don't do that shit for apps. I've been doing it before I even wanted to go to college or knew colleges gave a crap about these things.\n\n\nEnd of rant.",
