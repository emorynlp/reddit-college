  "text": "I took a physics test the other day and I got an A on it. I feel like I'm really turning my life around and I'm finally starting to feel confident. I took the ACT a year ago and I got a 14, but like I can do it again this month and I'll probably get a 36.\n\n\nOh yea my GPA is also a 2.0, but I heard colleges love a good comeback?",
