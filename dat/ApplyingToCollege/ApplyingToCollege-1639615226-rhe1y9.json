You tried your best and that\u2019s all you can ask for. The universe and world is so beautiful, don\u2019t waste precious time competing in this rat race. You can\u2019t control your feeling - cry if you need to, but everything truly does happen for a reason. Trust me and mark my words. You\u2019ll be okay. Much love <3",
