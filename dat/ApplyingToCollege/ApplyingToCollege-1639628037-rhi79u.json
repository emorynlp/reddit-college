  "text": "throwaway account unless i decide i like it\n\nmy counselor submitted my mid-year report on the common app at like 1pm but i didn\u2019t get my final grade for one of my courses until thirty minutes ago. it\u2019s a core course i\u2019m only taking senior year because of covid-related academic disruptions and colleges will absolutely expect to see it. not only that but i did well in the course and it made my uw gpa go up 0.01 points\n\nmy school has a three week break from the end of today until january 9th so that\u2019s the earliest the report can be updated. i emailed all the colleges i already applied to and put an explanation in the additional information section for rd apps but i\u2019m still worried",
