  "title:": "Question on U Chicago Essay Prompt",
  "text": "I really like this essay prompt:\n\n\"Due to a series of clerical errors, there is exactly one typo (an extra letter, a removed letter, or an altered letter) in the name of every department at the University of Chicago. Oops! Describe your new intended major. Why are you interested in it and what courses or areas of focus within it might you want to explore? Potential options include Commuter Science, Bromance Languages and Literatures, Pundamentals: Issues and Texts, Ant History... a full list of unmodified majors ready for your editor\u2019s eye is available here.\"\n\nBut as it says \"describe your new intended major,\" if I am interested in Geophysical Sciences, can I only write about typos for that course? Or am I free to write about any course, no matter what my actual major is? \n\nSorry for the odd question, thanks for any help!",
