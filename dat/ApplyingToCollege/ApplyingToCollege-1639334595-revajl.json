Eventually you'll get on track. Thats what I did and it worked. You're just too comfortable in your home where you've been procastinating for a long time and eventually its become a habit. Its always just that starting trouble, so get creative and do something about it cause A BEAUTIFUL LIFE AWAITS YOU BRO SO STOP WASTING TIME RIGHT NOW.",
