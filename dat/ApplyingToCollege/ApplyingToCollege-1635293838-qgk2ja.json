  "text": "I\u2019m getting ready to get rejected from all of my ea schools so I\u2019m looking for some safety schools to add to my rd list.\n\nMy stats are 3.8/4.5 unweighted (upward trend grade and rigor wise). School doesn\u2019t weight or rank. It\u2019s a private Jesuit school with a good reputation.\n\nI have a 1380 sat but I plan on taking December.\n\nI would say my ec\u2019s are definitely better than my stats (research, internship, commitment, international outreach project, all the bases) and my essays are also good (according to teacher)\n\nI want to study finance\n\nSchools should be on the eastern side of the U.S. (for conext, I\u2019m applying to Tulane and umich; they are the farthest I will go)",
