      "text": "Are you a national merit finalist? There's a lot of full-ride merit scholarships for them at certain schools, like UCF, UT Dallas, and FIU. If not, no biggie:\n\nAs for merit scholarships for a high stats student: Non-selective, not super well-known, public universities like **Montana State, Old Dominion University, Louisiana Tech, Boise State, U of New Mexico, U of Wyoming, and South Dakota State, etc** would all likely cost like $10,000-$20,000 to attend as an out-of-state applicant with high stats. (1450+, 3.8+ UW, but if around that 1350+, 3.7+ UW range, the cost of attendance would be a bit higher.) They're still solid schools, with lots of paths to success and many amazing professors and students, but they don't come with that level of prestige that many applicants seem to desire.\n\nAnd small, not really well-known, non-selective private universities like (random list from the top of my head) **University of Lynchburg, Albion, McKendree, Indiana Tech,** etc would likely have similar costs of attendance as the above category schools I mentioned, for someone with high stats.\n\nAnd if you're a domestic applicant, DO NOT RULE OUT lesser-known public universities in your state that aren't flagship universities. They tend to be really inexpensive to attend, and because they're not flagship universities, they try to entice high-stats students with merit scholarships, honors programs, research grants, etc. Here's some examples:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|State of Residency|Flagship Universities|Lesser-known, non-flagship public universities :)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Texas|UT Austin, Texas A&M|Texas State, UTSA.|\n|Virginia|UVA, W&M, maybe VT|Old Dominion, Mary Washington|\n|Georgia|UGA, Georgia Tech|U of North Georgia, Georgia State|\n\n\\-----\n\nBest of luck. :)",
