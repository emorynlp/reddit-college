  "text": "On the common app, I\u2019m not sure where to list Science Olympiad awards. I placed multiple times at different levels, so I\u2019m not sure if I should list them with the Science Olympiad part of the \u201cactivities\u201d section where it asks you to describe \u201cwhat you accomplished and any recognition you received\u201d or if I should list them all in one Honors slot. \n\nCould I say I placed at both state and regional level in the activities section and go into more detail by listing the actual awards in the honors section or would that be redundant?",
