That's based on rate at which they produce Ph.D. recipients.\n\nYou can also look at GF%: percentage of each school's US-based CS alumni on LinkedIn that are employed at Google or Facebook.  For reference, MIT's GF% is around 6.2% and Georgia Tech is 4.3%.  Here are  the above LACs plus some other highly selective ones, in descending order, along with total US-based CS alumni and GF%:\n\nHarvey Mudd:\t1286\t9.41%\n\nWilliams:\t794\t6.55%\n\nSwarthmore:\t778\t5.91%\n\nCarleton:\t940\t5.32%\n\nGrinnell:\t670\t4.48%\n\nBowdoin:\t490\t4.29%\n\nHaverford:\t402\t3.98%\n\nAmherst:\t587\t3.92%\n\nMiddlebury:\t769\t2.73%\n\nHamilton:\t526\t2.28%\n\nColby:\t471\t1.91%",

Also possible they got graduate degrees elsewhere before landing at G/F.  West Coast schools tend to have higher percentages by virtue of geographic proximity.",
