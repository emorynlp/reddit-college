  "title:": "Do you think it's too late for me to apply to the University of Richmond?",
  "text": "I'm currently on my personal statement and Im feeling hesitant to apply to this school. It already passed the early decision and I honestly wish I focused on more schools past few months. Past few months I was too focused on one school and I end up getting accepted. I am happy about it. I honestly wanted to explore more colleges and didn't think it would be worth applying to more schools at that time due to my family's financial issues atm. With the University of Richmond being 28% acceptance rate, I'm not sure I should bother to apply during Regular decisions. My GPA is 3.0 atm. My grade average is an A- so far. I'm unsure about continuing my application for the school. I'm almost finished with my personal statement.",
