You know what, it still feels bad to remember it. Everything turned out great and I wouldn\u2019t change a thing, but rejection is rejections and it hurts. The real kicker is that the better applicant you are, the more it hurts. I have great respect and sympathy for today\u2019s applicants. Best of luck.",
