  "text": "So filling out my common app activities list over the last few days, I realized that some of my activities might look a little odd to AOs. Technically, I'm in leadership for 4 clubs (2 President, 2 Co-President). In each of these clubs, I have put in a substantial amount of effort and time, and my leadership positions are legit ( I've been a 4 year member in two, am the founder of the third, and was elected by a group of 60+ students for the fourth). I've heard that AOs aren't too big of fans of people who just randomly join clubs or activities, and was wondering if so many leadership positions would make me seem like I'm not devoted to one or two places where I can make an impact.",

      "text": "I guess if that's your 'spike', then you should go with it.  Every student has something they bring to the table from an AOs perspective, and who would argue that being the active community member/leader isn't it for you?  Every college knows that a lot of kids get there and become apathetic and don't necessarily contribute to the student community. Someone with the energy to motivate other students to join clubs and sustain that momentum can be a huge asset on campus.\n\nYou'd have to thread the needle between this-is-my-superpower vs yes-i'm-trying-to-get-into-college, but with a well-crafted supplemental essay weaving together all your leadership positions as a consequence of being an enthusiastic leader, it could work to your advantage.",

          "text": "I wouldn't say that this is my \"spike\", rather it just ended up this way because I'm passionate about many activities. My \"spike\" (if you can even call it that), is more related to my science/research related activities. \n\nI'm asking if it would be more advantageous to not include one of my leadership positions because it make me seem wishy-washy about my commitments.",

              "text": "In that case, I think you're right to be considering what to list on your app.  I personally would agree with you, and take off at least one of the leadership positions. An AO might look at all of your achievements and think 'is this person REALLY doing all that research AND leading 4 clubs? Are there enough hours in the day/week/year?  Are any of those 4 leadership positions actually meaningful?'.  Good luck!",
