      "text": "A number of reasons:\n\n1. The data from your school might be flawed. For example, at my school (in Virginia, for context) it says that no one applied to Virginia Tech in 2018, but that \\~175 applied in 2017 and 2019.\n2. Tulane has an application fee of $0, and their supplemental essays, while strongly recommended, are technically optional, so a lot of people probably apply last-minute because there's no reason not to.\n3. Their ED acceptance rate is around 35%, while the RD acceptance rate is 2%. Maybe the people from your school applied ED and got in.\n4. Maybe your school is in Louisiana? Probably not if only 5 people applied to Tulane but they're really trying to expand their outreach to Louisiana communities because of the stereotype that Tulane is in a \"bubble,\" attracting rich kids from the Northeast to come to a wealthy pocket of a financial-hardship-ridden city, and thus their Louisiana acceptance rate is probably pretty high.",
