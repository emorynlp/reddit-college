  "text": "I'm a junior in high school in Canada. Because of this, our guidance counselors are really only focused to Canadian schools. I have good grades, and I think I can get into one of the top American schools, and am looking for a private College Admissions Counselor. I was wondering if anyone here has worked with any of them and if they are any good, and if so, which ones are the best.",

      "text": "I generally recommend finding ones in your physical region so that they\u2019re familiar with your specific school and the opportunities offered there. They\u2019re more likely to have an idea of what colleges are realistic for applicants coming from similar backgrounds as you. If people from your area still apply to US colleges, try asking around (especially current seniors as people in your own grade may not want to talk about it) about who they know to be good consultants. \n\nOtherwise, there are consultants on this sub as well. Admissionsmom, scholargrade, McNeiladmissions are all some who are also mods (you can find them on the list).",
