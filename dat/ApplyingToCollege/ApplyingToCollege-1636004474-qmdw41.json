  "text": "One of the UW Seattle supplemental essays is as follows\n\n Tell a story from your life, describing an experience that either demonstrates your character or helped to shape it. (650 words)  \n\nBut the thing is my main Coalition app essay is about a story that shaped me. \n\nWhat do I do?\n\nThe application is due in 11 days and I have really really important exams coming up that account for 40% of my final grade",
