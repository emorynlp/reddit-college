If you want ideas you could look through linkedin or r/collegeresults \n\nSecond for awards: international> national > state > regional (assuming regional is smaller than state) >school awards. Basically the more people you compete with the worth of the award increases\n\nYou also need rec letters eventually but I assume you would get those from your junior year teachers. Your counselor, unless they change on a yearly basis, will be giving you a rec letter so you should probably talk to them and have them get to know you.\n\nThats the best advice I can give, keep in mind I probably don't know more than you  and i'm just parroting the other members of A2C",

It looks like a lot but it steps you through and won\u2019t let you submit unless everything is completed. \nSome colleges don\u2019t use the common app so they have their own application portals on their websites - basically the same info reformatted. \nIn addition you need to fill in financial aid info called FAFSA which you may/will need a parents help with ( it needs their tax return details from 2020).

Not everything in the Common App rolls over from year to year - in particular, the college list does not - but personal info should. That said, most of the app takes a couple of hours to fill out, with the exception of essays.\n\nIt sounds like you are concerned about the Activity section. Take a look. It's not hard. When the time comes, in another 20+ months, there are lots of blog articles with advice. There's nothing wrong with jotting things down, but your most important activities are likely to come junior year and summer after, and may be activities that you haven't even considered yet.\n\nThe one thing you can do this early (besides getting good grades and exploring your interests) is to sit down with your parents and talk about budget, look at costs of some colleges, get an idea of what will be affordable. You will run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. You can run a few now, just to see whether you are likely to be eligible for need-based aid. If you will need to seek merit money, that changes your college search a bit, and the sooner you know this, the better.",
