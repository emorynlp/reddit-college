      "text": "Tulane is without a doubt an excellent school, but I cant help but think there are some other factors going into its low acceptance rate. Firstly, it is is the South, which has an overall less competitive applicant pool than somewhere like the Northeast. Also given that its application is free and the essays are \"optional\", there may be a significant amount of applicants that just do the bare minimum as a hail mary application, especially considering they are currently test optional.",
