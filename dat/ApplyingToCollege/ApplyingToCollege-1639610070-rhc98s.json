      "text": "I got deferred from Yale and got in regular decision last year. I didn\u2019t write an email, but I\u2019m sure it can\u2019t hurt. The only application update I made was that I won Best Delegate at a Model Congress conference, but I doubt that made much of a difference. Ik a lot of people here who got deferred and then got in regular from a bunch of different years. Yale takes a hard look at all of the deferrals and considers them equally to RD applicants. Definitely don\u2019t lose hope",
