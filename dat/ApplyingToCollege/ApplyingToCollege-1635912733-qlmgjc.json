  "text": "For the last few months, applications have been a major part of our lives. For many of us on this sub, they've been our primary focus. I'm sure you've all given up certain things that are important to you to make time for applications. For me personally, starting from around mid-August, I've been spending way less time on my interests. Interests that, before I started working on application, were really, really important to me\u2014as in, the first few ECs on my Common App. \n\nEA/ED deadlines were supposed to be the first major milestone. After last night, I was supposed to be able to celebrate for a few days. I was supposed to spend some time on the stuff I enjoy, have fun with my friends, and generally just enjoy not thinking about applications. \n\nExcept... it doesn't feel that way. \n\nEver since I submitted my last early application yesterday, I haven't been able to have fun. I didn't have school today, so I decided to try. I tried going back to my interests, and I couldn't enjoy them. I tried talking to some friends, and I had some fun, but we mostly only talked about relief from the first deadlines being over. I even tried working on RD supps, but couldn't write anything good. Applications have become such a huge part of my life in the last few months that, despite being relieved to be done with the first round, I genuinely have no idea what to do now that I can relax a bit. \n\nLet me rephrase that: I've become such a prisoner to applications that, now that I've been temporarily released, I don't know what to do. I almost want to go back to applications. You might call it Stockholm Syndrome. \n\nI'm rambling. I don't know, maybe I'm overthinking it. Maybe I idealized November 2 too much. Maybe I didn't enjoy my interests as much as I thought I did. Maybe I'm a loser who has no life outside college applications. \n\nA2C, I'm going crazy. Just for a few days, I want to have the fun I haven't been able to have for the last few months. I want to waste some time. Do something. Talk to someone. Stop thinking about all this shit. \n\nBut I can't. Soon, I'll have to go back to applications. I'll have to go back to researching schools. I'll have to go back to writing essays. And even these few days after EA/ED deadlines\u2014which were supposed to be a short period of fun and enjoyment\u2014are colored with the stress and unhappiness that's characterized my life since mid-August. \n\nI feel empty. \n\nI hope I'm the only one, because this is the worst and I wouldn't want anyone else to feel this way, too. But I thought that if anyone could relate, it'd be A2C. Is it just me?",

If you constantly feel like you have to worry and only focus on the next important task you will suffer in life. Bc after apps, you have to fight for research, then for internships, then jobs, then better jobs, It never ends. Fill your time wisely, organize yourself so you don't lose focus of your goal, but so you aren't only focusing on that goal so that you can live your life.\n\nObviously, there are times where you have to lock in completely, and this last week has been like that, but the times outside of that doesn't have to be that way.",

And now I don't even want to play golf even though I have few days before I'll start writing apps again lmao. During the apps, I would only watch a few episodes of the office to relax but now that apps are done, I don't want to watch them. Idk what it is about apps but you just lose interest in everything. Im guessing its the stress but it's nice to know that its not just me or just you going through this. At least most of are going through this so it's nice to know that we can talk to each other and hopefully feel better.",
