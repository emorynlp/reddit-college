  "text": "The only English tests/essays we\u2019ve written at my school are timed literary analyses that we handwrite in class and hand to the teacher for comments and marks, so I only have handwritten samples to use. Is it fine to submit a scan of one of such essays (about 5 pages long), considering it also has my teacher\u2019s handwritten notes and comments on it?",
