And we are all so excited to chat with you! \n\nBut we can\u2019t do that if you don\u2019t reply to our emails (fully acknowledging that it could have fallen into Spam, which you should also check!) \n\nWe are asked to interview you within 14 days, so please make sure you\u2019re watching your inboxes, even on (longer-term) vacations :) Best of luck friends!",
