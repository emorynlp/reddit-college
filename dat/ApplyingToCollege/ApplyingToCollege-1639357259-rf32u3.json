  "title:": "Should I attend college?",
  "text": "So I've been in a dilemma for a while now and its either to attend college or continue working. I graduated 2020 and been working for almost a full year now. I'm currently working within my career choice and getting paid well above minimum wage but it just feels boring. I work at a desk job with no one my age and it's almost depressing in a way. I know attending college just for the experience/social aspect isn't worth the money but I've always liked school in a way, I kinda miss it. So I wouldn't be wasting money just to experience college, I'd leave with a degree (most likely lol). I'm 20 years old right now. If I were to attend college, I would only be 21 so I still have some time to think about this.\n\nTL;DR pros are social experiences and a degree, cons are money struggles.\n\nPros\n\n* Better social life\n* Surrounded by people my age\n* Unique experience\n* In state\n* Money saved up\n* Clubs to join\n* Living in my own space at campus\n* Learn to be more dependable\n* College activities\n* Creating relationships\n* Have a degree to fall back on\n* The campus is fucking awesome\n\nCons\n\n* All the money needed\n* Need to pay off loans\n* Wont live with my parents (they provide a lot, so it's pretty convenient)\n* Have to worry about money while attending\n* Classes and homework\n* Leaving my career job (only temporarily, I'm certain they will rehire me)\n* Most likely need a minimum wage job\n* Stressful nights of studying\n* Big change from how I'm living now, for better or worse",

Oftentimes I find that outside the scholarships organized by non-school affiliated organizations, whatever school one applies to will also have a page dedicated to scholarships they give (in addition to financial aid).",

      "text": "Try going part-time at a community college and see how it goes. You\u2019ll get a taste of the college life, can still live with your parents, won\u2019t have to pay a lot as it\u2019s much cheaper than a 4-year university, and can still work your career job. \n\nIf it goes well, you can see if continuing part-time or going full-time is right for you. Maybe you\u2019ll decide you want to transfer into a four-year university.\n\nYou can make friends and meet people your age without relying on college, although it is a massive help. I wouldn\u2019t choose to set aside a good job and take out loans just for \u201cthe college experience.\u201d Think about the financial and professional aspects first and foremost.",
