  "text": "What's the point of a T20 university education if you don't have a job/field you're genuinely interested in working with? So many people are so unsure on which area to go with and yet they're here still trying their best to get into a top university. And for what? To brag? To get into debt?\n\nUniversity is a step in your life not a destination. If you don't get accepted into a T20 or if you do- it shouldn't drastically alter the end result of your career. It'll just shift the path it takes to get there.\n\nYou keep working yourself to the bones in the name of education, but not for the career itself. If a T20 university was as important as this sub made it seem, 90% of the planet would be in poverty. You're building a ladder of education on top of education on top of more education, with literally nowhere to go after. I don't get it.",

Many of em are liberal arts colleges that educate you in a lot of different subjects and don't admit by major so that you can figure out what you like. I agree that you shouldn't go into massive debt to attend any college, even a T20, but I don't like how this post makes it sound like you *must* have a career path before attending college. That's just as mindlessly ambitious as the prestige chasing you're complaining about. Most people have no clue what they're doing before going to college, and that's totally okay.",

They're not going to simply attend and give up future aspirations--in fact, they're probably more committed to long-term goals than people who are \"big picture guy(s)\" but fail to make the intermediate steps to get there (i.e. try to get into a good college)",

Sure, top schools tend to attract people with larger goals, but the majority of students who apply, and get in, do not have \"long-term goals\" they are chasing. Most students have no idea what they want to do in the future and like 80% change majors in college. \n\nIf what you mean by long-term goals are generic value statements like making money or changing the world, then that is by no means unique.",

I don't define long-term goals as dogmatically sticking to the vision of your life that you dreamt up as a 16-year-old, but more so as acknowledging that you have long-term goals that you expect to evolve with the goal of finding the institution that will best give you the resources to not only follow said goals but shape them as well.",

OC just said that \"some people\" are mindless strivers, he never implies that those type of people are the majority. Your argument is on what the majority of students who gun for these schools are like. OC is specifically comparing people with T20s as their terminal goal vs people who have a bigger picture mindset. You are comparing people who have a bigger picture mindset with T20s as a stopping point vs people with a bigger picture mindset without T20s as a stopping point. \n\nAnyway, I think you can see why OC's argument makes sense. It's about innate drive and a person who is solely focused on T20 admissions will only do things for their resume, not activities that actually interests them.",
