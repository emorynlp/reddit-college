  "text": "May be an odd question, but was hoping to drop an elective class with not much merit for an AP psych class 2nd semester of my senior year (this year). Although it will look good to have another AP class, I am worried at the simple prospect of a dropped class looking poor to colleges. Anyone know the answer to this question? Thanks!",
