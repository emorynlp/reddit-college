  "text": "Hi! I\u2019ve basically done a research program that I had to pay for (I have 2 other more significant research opportunities as well). Wrote a paper through this and worked with an advisor.\n\nWill the program be looked down upon because I had to pay to get in? It\u2019s not competitive (at all), basically a pay-to-get-in program. Wondering if I should just not include it in my application?\n\nThanks!",

Idk if it\u2019s going to be looked down upon, that\u2019s what I\u2019m wondering and if so, not sure if I should include it?\n\nLike the research was kinda cool, but AOs are ultimately gonna evaluate the profile, so not sure??? \n\nThis is for the UC app btw",
