  "text": "Especially for people like me who don't come from a lot of money, it seems like CC would be the go to for most people out of high school. And while we're here, can someone explain what the college experience is? It's usually the main justification for someone choosing a particular university.",

If you\u2019re the average poster on here with a 4.3 weighted applying to 5 t20\u2019s, a school with a bunch of people who usually had GPA\u2019s on the lower side or are non traditional students is going to sound a lot less appealing than a vibrant campus with a bunch of fellow overachievers and a x million/billion dollar endowment where there\u2019s always stuff to do and ways to interact with classmates",
