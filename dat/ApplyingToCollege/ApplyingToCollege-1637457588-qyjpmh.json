  "text": "I have no experiences, stories, or ideas to start my personal essay with. I keep seeing that its about what shaped you, what makes me who I am, and telling the colleges who I am. How can I even do that if I don't know my goals, beliefs, whatevers. I tried making a list like some guides had and had like, 1 mediocre idea for each. So frustrating.",

      "text": "Start by writing an autobiography in third-person. It'll help give you psychological distance and view yourself more objectively. \n\nI have helped well over a hundred people with their essays and this helps a lot.  \n\n\nYou are the collection of your life experience. Your experiences inform your beliefs, values, and goals.   \n\n\nI've read so many college essay guidance books and most of them are gimmicky shortcuts.   \n\n\nThe essays are kind of a right of passage. After all, you should have a good idea why you're going to college and if you don't then maybe college is a waste of time and money. College can wait till you do have a reason to go.",

      "text": "One idea is to think of things that have happened to you that you think you'll remember forever. Like what are some of your memories of when you were in elementary school? Middle school? Doesn't have to be a high emotional impact necessarily, just things that stand out for you.\n\nWhat kind of work do you imagine yourself doing? Something in an office where you're running things? Doing something creative with art, advertising, or writing? Working with kids? Performing music or theatre? Working outdoors? Designing or repairing cars? Building a house? Being a paramedic? Do you like cooking or baking? What sounds cool to you? \n\nOr what doesn't sound like something you'd like to do? Sometimes just knowing what you *don't* want to do can lead you to some ideas of what you do. Like do you think that no way do you want to sit at a desk all day? Do you want to travel? \n\nDo you want to do something where you're helping people? Do you like making a difference in someone's life? \n\nWhat motivates you to do more than the bare minimum for things?",

Now I have even lower chances at a school list already full of reaches while also being an international who needs aid \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\n\nWhatever you do, don't do what I did.",
