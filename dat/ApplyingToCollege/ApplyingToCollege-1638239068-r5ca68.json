  "text": "HELLO IM DESPERATE\n\nI procrastinated. UC deadline is 11:59 PM tomorrow. I'm an out of state applicant as well.\n\nI am mostly confused about how to self report my transcript. My counselor is unavailable, and I have no friends also submitting the app, so I have come to reddit to ask my fellow degens in my journey to please my mother by probably not getting into Berkeley.\n\n1. As for course name, some of the courses I took do not match what is listed on my transcript (e.g. sophomore year I took **IB applications 1**, but on my transcript it is listed as **Algebra II**). I do not want admissions to think I'm a weaselly little liar, but I want the GPA boost if I can get it, so...which one should I list? Also applies for Pre-AP/IB classes not being listed as Pre-AP on transcript.\n2. Are Pre-AP courses approved by UC for HL listing? I've gotten mixed messages on other forums and such, or maybe I'm just bad at looking things up. Either way, I'm confused.\n\nThat's it...for now. Thank you to anyone who is willing to help me out. I love you, have a great day.",

And pre-AP should not be listed as AP courses (since they aren\u2019t) but you can include that in the title (assuming it matches your transcript).  \nGood luck!",
