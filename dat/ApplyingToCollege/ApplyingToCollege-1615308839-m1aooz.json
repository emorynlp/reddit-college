  "text": "It leads to false expectations, and ultimately hurts like a bitch when you get rejected. And manifesting doesn't change your app in any way, like the decision has probably been made and you're just digging your own grave by looking at your dream school's dining halls and meal plans. \nI think it's best to avoid being emotionally invested in colleges until you've received your decisions. And then allow yourself to fall in love with the ones you've gotten into.\n\nEdit: I'm not shitting on the concept of manifestation as a whole. Manifesting when it comes to things that you have complete control over makes sense, but college decisions are anything but predictable.",

Expecting to get into a super selective school is only setting you up for extra-crippling future disappointment in the event that you get rejected. Additionally, when manifesting doesn't work, the blame is put on the manifester. This doesn't sit right with me because it's essentially saying that if your \"manifestation\" (which most likely wasn't gonna come true) doesn't happen, it is your fault for not being \"high-vibration\" enough. It is not necessarily your fault if you don't get into a top college. Perhaps your admissions officer was having a bad day, or perhaps they liked you but decided to admit another candidate. There are 100 different reasons why you might have gotten rejected, and many of them are not in your control, so it's illogical and unhealthy to automatically blame yourself.",
