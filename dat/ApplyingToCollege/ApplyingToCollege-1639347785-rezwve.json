  "text": "GPA: 2.43 UW can\u2019t find weighted but I would assume it is 3.0-3.1. But I have a 3.7/4.4 for first semester this year. Brought down heavily by 1.2 junior year (school I was at last year used +/- system).\n\nSAT: 1490(790M, 700R) \n\nECs: 5+ significant leadership roles\n\nBefore junior year I was a very mediocre student but I took fairly rigorous classes and had solid extracurricular involvement. But junior year I did very poorly because of anxiety and some personal issues. I was at a very competitive private school. Needless to say, I did not come back after that year. After junior year, I decided to turn it around and actually apply myself. I am confident I am ready for college but obviously my cumulative GPA says a lot to admissions. \n\nI\u2019m not gonna be unrealistic and pretend like I\u2019ll get into a top school. Hence, I\u2019m mostly shooting for tier 2 or 3 LACs and Universities.\n\nOther info: \n- Full pay\n- From a non diversity state\n- Caucasian male\n- Looking to study finance\n\nThis is literally the worst feeling bc I\u2019m doing everything I can now but I\u2019m still screwed over over.\n\nWould it be worth it to apply next year when my senior year grades will matter more?",

                  "text": "To an extent, yes. \"Diversity State\" is more a phenomenon found with the preppy North-Eastern boarding high schools and colleges (IVY+ et al). In these schools, there is generally a higher proportion of people from states like NY, NJ, Penn, Cali, etc. so they are considered geographically \"overrepresented\". Other not-so common states may have a slight boost -- although it's not enough to be considered as a \"hook\" by any means. Think of it more as a complement to a high ranking app as opposed to something boosting a mediocre app into the school's gates.",

Most colleges allow you to contextualize your grades because they know a GPA can't tell the full story. Holistic review and all that. However, it remains realistic to realize that many of the colleges may still not accept you even with an explanation. If application fees are not a problem for you, then I would consider applying to a few and explaining your situation. Worse thing that could happen is a rejection letter.",
