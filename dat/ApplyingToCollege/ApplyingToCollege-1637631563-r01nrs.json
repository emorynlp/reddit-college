  "text": "I just received a nice \u201cswag package\u201d of sorts from a Top 50 LAC.\n\nThe package contained a personalized letter encouraging me to apply ED II, some school merchandise (hat/pennant, etc.), some candy, and a fee waiver.\n\nI visited the school a few months ago, and when I did, I had a conversation with my AO. However, I\u2019m surprised that I made that large of an impression.\n\nConsidering that the school has an acceptance rate of around 30-35%, should I take this to be an attempt by the college to drive up their yield, or does a package like this mean they genuinely want to see my application?\n\nI want to say \u201cboth,\u201d but I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself.",
