  "text": "Imma keep this short cuz last time I tried to make this it turned into 900 words. Basically my whole life I have been bad at soccer since I have always been comparing myself to my neighbor/friend who is a D1 soccer player. My teammates would constantly scream at me which made me even more anxious to make a mistake and a big game led to me quitting for a few months. One of my friends asked me to practice with him and that led me to love the game again. While practicing for varsity tryouts I played with those same people who ridiculed me but ended up forgiving them as I learned to care less about what others think. While training one morning I heard a pop in my knee abut doctors said it was prolly just a muscle sprain. 3 weeks later I went to tryouts and am playing through the pain, but when I get my mri they said I tore my miniscus and can\u2019t play anymore. This taught me to focus on other interests in life(I\u2019m in different engineering clubs and ecs).\nA few weeks later my friend who is dating the captain of the team sent me a message between them where he said saying, \u201cI was dogging at workouts\u201d which is bittersweet. There\u2019s more details but Do you think this will stand out enough or is another generic injury story?",

      "text": "From an outsiders point of view, it does seem like a generic sports injury essay at first glance. However, if its truly what you want to write about and can put a personal touch on it, then go for it. At the end of the day any generic essay can be extraordinary with the right writing and phrasing.",
