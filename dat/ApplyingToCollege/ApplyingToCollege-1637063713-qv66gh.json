  "title:": "Duke Alumni Interview",
  "text": "So yesterday, I got an email from a Duke alumnus who's going to conduct my Duke alumni interview. However, I was confused when I looked him up on LinkedIn and found he's actually a Princeton alumni, not a Duke's. I tried to look for other people who might have the same name as his, but nothing came up. \n\nHas this ever happende before with somebody else? Should I be upfront about this during the interview? And you have any tips for me that could be helpful as I prepare for the interview or during it?\n\nBesides that, it was kind of intimidating to learn he's a researcher assistant at freaking CERN!",
