  "text": "Looking online it seems that basically all cal state schools are commuting schools, aside from San Diego State and Cal Poly SLO\n\nIm ideally looking for a more traditional college with dorms like most of the UCs and the two previous cal states i mentioned\n\nEdit: in the same thought, are any of the UCs commuter schools? Id still apply but its nice to know. I think Irvine is or at least has a decent amount of commuting students, but other than that im not sure",

Just make sure to look back at 2018-2019 or 2019-2020, as COVID skewed the numbers a ton.",
