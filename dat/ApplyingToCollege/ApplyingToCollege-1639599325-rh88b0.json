  "title:": "looks like I\u2019m going to be opening my ED decision in front of my family and family friends in one of the nicer restaurants in town",
  "text": "Title says it all. My mom asked what we should do to celebrate my ED tomorrow, and I said \u201cWe should go to eat at (favorite expensive restaurant), and honestly we should go regardless and it\u2019ll be a consolation dinner if I get rejected LOL\u201d\n\nMy mom agreed. Yay!!\n\nBut, well, we need to take another family out to dinner. so now they\u2019re invited. And of course, this family has one child who is exactly my age, also AP-crazed, and goes to my school. Just hoping he didn\u2019t ED anywhere or at least already had his decision.\n\nAnyways, the reservation is for 6:30pm. Decisions are at 7. No way am I waiting, the anxiety\u2019s been running high for a week, ever since my friends\u2019 decisions started rolling in. \n\nNow, I have to ~not cry in the restaurant~.\n\nEdit: didn\u2019t cry, got deferred though so arguably worse than rejection, I did submit all my other apps with my phone under the table though LMAO",

WashU decisions came out on the 9th, and I wasn\u2019t expecting that (thought they would come out on the 17th) so my family is out for dinner with friends and I just nonchalantly check. Thinking that if I get rejected, ima just slide my phone back into my pocket and act like nothing ever happened. Fortunately I did get in and I broke the news when the dessert menus came. Perfect timing lmao, I got treated well.",
