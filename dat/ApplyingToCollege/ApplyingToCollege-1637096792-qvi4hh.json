  "text": "I have no faith that I will get into any prestigious colleges, but freshmen-junior year I have gotten straight A\u2019s (one A- in AP Bio only). I was in 2 AP courses freshmen year and 3 junior year (that\u2019s all that is available). This year, I am in 5 AP Courses and am struggling a bit. I have 3 A-\u2018s, but I fear one of those A-\u2018s will turn into a B by mid and final semester. But it\u2019s also possible one A- will turn back into an A. If I do somehow get into a prestigious university, if these colleges see my senior grades and see that I had a B and a few A-\u2018s, will they rescind their acceptance? I know it\u2019s happened before, but idk if that\u2019s mainly for drastically low grades like C\u2019s and D\u2019s.",
