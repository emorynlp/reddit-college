  "title:": "UC PIQ #2 Question",
  "text": "Prompt: Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem-solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.\n\nI'm kind of struggling with this prompt and how to go about it. I've already written three essays but they are all kinda about one topic and I don't want to seem too one dimensional and write about the same thing for four essays. I looked at the other remaining prompts and I can't really come up with anything for those. I was wondering for this prompt if I could talk about snowboarding and finding creativity through tricks and stuff like that even though I have no awards to go along with it and it isn't listed in my activities section.",

The fourth one I wrote about creativity on a subject that was totally out there, a hobby with no awards etc. I figured I can for once show some non academic side of me. So if you want my vote, absolutely go for it.",
