      "text": "Hi there. I love helping create college lists  but to do so, I need a little more info from you. \n\nWhat are you looking for in terms of: \n\nFinancial needs for you and your family:  do you need and qualify for a ton of financial aid? Do you need a lot to merit aid bc your family makes too much for financial aid but you still can\u2019t afford the ridiculous price tags of many colleges? Is money not a problem for you? \n\nSchool Type: are you interested in HBCU (historically Black colleges and universities)? PWI (primarily white institutions)? MSI (minority serving institutions) or a women\u2019s college? \n\nGeography:  where do you want to be? What part of the country? \n\nLocation: Urban, Rural, College Town, City Campus, Enclosed  Campus, distance from an airport? \n\nWeather: Are you a sun worshipper? Or do you want four seasons? Do you hate rainy cloudy weather. \n\nSchool Size: small intimate classes or more large lecture style? Do you want to know your professors or slide through college anonymously?\n\nSchool Vibe: rah rah school spirit? Quirky intellectual vibe? Coffee house and hanging out? Partying and football games? Or more studying and library time? \n\nPrograms: anything specific for your major? \n\nYour Stats: where do they fit in? \n\nAlso you might want to check out my post filled with my college lists: https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/p871lc/lots_and_lots_of_college_lists_for_you_to_check/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",

          "text": "Financial Aid: My family\u2019s income is pretty generous so I\u2019d either need merit based scholarships or take out loans. I was looking mostly at colleges who meet full demonstrated need like BU, Brown etc\n\nSchool type: I would prefer urban or close to a city, so definitely not urban.\n\nSchool type: I would say I am interested in PWI and MSI as well\n\nGeography: I\u2019d prefer to stay in the North East or East Coast\n\nWeather: This isn\u2019t a big concern of mine\n\nSchool size: I would prefer that most classrooms have 30 student or less \n\nSchool vibe: I\u2019d like it to have an intellectual vibe and have rigorous rigorous curriculum\n\nProgram: I believe I want to do premed with a concentration in Physics or Biophysics\n\nStats: I\u2019m having trouble with this. My family has been suggesting I ED to brown but I\u2019m not sure if my stats are competitive. I was looking at T20s-T30s since most meet full demonstrated need, which is important for me.",
