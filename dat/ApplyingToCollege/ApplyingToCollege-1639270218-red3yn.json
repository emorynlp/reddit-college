  "title:": "Is it better to request a letter of rec from a STEM teacher?",
  "text": "Yes, I am applying for STEM schools and to engineering programs. But the problem is that all my pre-junior year STEM teachers retired/moved and my entire junior year was online. I had asked two teachers (English and APUSH) from my sophomore year for my early schools but should I instead ask a teacher from this year or last year online (admittedly was not engaged last year). The STEM teachers I can ask don\u2019t really know me outside of class and just being a good student in general.",

      "text": "Depends.  Definitely go with teachers who can speak about you the best and with whom you have the best relationships.  I used a letter from my math teacher (she\u2019s the advisor for almost all of my clubs and calls me her favorite kid), and my English teacher (had him since freshman year and I really shone during virtual school last year).  But, I applied to Hopkins for Biomedical Engineering with close to 0 STEM EC\u2019s, so I thought I should\u2019ve sacrificed quality and submit my chem or bio teacher.  \n\nI got in with the English and Math combo.  So, I think connection really is the most important. \n\nThat said: some schools require you get a math or science teacher, so you should look into that and make sure (if it\u2019s going to be weak) you put your strongest other letter with it.",
