  "text": "Hi! I\u2019m already a college freshman, but one of my senior friends today told me that she was deciding between MIT and CalTech, as she has \u201cgotten accepted into both\u201d already. She won\u2019t show me her acceptance letters. After navigating the college process last year, this made me really confused bc I thought the two schools only did EA and RD? Do they have some kind of rolling admission that would make it possible for her to already be accepted or should I break some unfortunate news to her?",
