So I\u2019m confused.\n\nIs there any special cases when Amherst accept more in RD? Will my request for financial aid affect anything? \n\nThank y\u2019all in advance",

      "text": "On average about 180 students (give and take a few) are accepted during the ED round.\r  \nOf these recruited athletes are around 67 - the number of recruited athletes are controlled by NESCAC, the athletic conference Amherst belongs to. Removing these athletes and considering the fact that around 500 students apply ED, the acceptance rate is around 21%. Still considerably higher than RD - about double.\r  \n\r  \nWhile there is no way of knowing the exact numbers, the ED round also involves other so called 'tips'; children of alumni, questbridge and athletes that are not recruited. Even considering all this ED does provide a higher acceptance rate than RD.\r  \n\r  \nAlthough Amherst no longer publishes this information, Amherst along with a lot of Ivies and top tier LACs use some form of academic ranking (AR) when reviewing students, particularly in the early stages - which is a composite measure of GPA and standardized test scores. Students with AR rank 1 will probably pass the first round of selection. Rank 2 will generally get through as well. Students below AR rank 3 will require something 'extra' to make the cut, and the AO in charge will have to make a case to the committee (i.e. special situations or a particularly strong application). The AR system was developed for NCAA as a general rule for athletes...but is more widely used today. This link to an article (http://ephblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Academic-Rating-Details.pdf) written at Williams college has some insight into the mechanism, although the scores/methodologies may have changed. According to other sources, AR rank 1 students have an acceptance rate of around 50%, which is significantly higher than both RD and ED.\r  \n\r  \nSo in conclusion, if you think Amherst is the school for you...applying ED will help give you a bump. But only if you have good academic credentials. It makes sense since yield is a big issue at schools like Amherst that compete with Ivies that have better name recognition.",

              "text": "Oh nice. I was the national exchange controller for my country for AIESEC, when I was in college.\n\nYour specs are solid...but so are a lot of students that apply there. Comparable to both my kids and their friends.\n\nI can't tell you whether you should apply ED or not...that is  completely up to you. You have as good of a chance as any...and applying ED will give you a slight boost over RD.\n\nI will give you some tips (some are pretty obvious):\n\n1. The Amherst school motto is 'Terras Irradient' - bring light to the world. Looking at your ECs I can easily see how you can weave your story with this theme.\n2. Schools like Amherst try to fill a 'rounded student body', but that does not mean they are looking for 'rounded students'. They look for 'spiky students' that when all collected become part of a diverse community. Academics aside, design your application so that you come through - your ECs, the classes you take, your recommendations and most importantly your essay. What makes you different from all the other 4.0+ gpa 35+ ACT students...and how does that fit into the framework of a Mammoth?\n3. Academics are tough at Amherst so they definitely look for students that can hack it. Show that you can push yourself academically and not crack under the stress.\n\nThere is a pretty large community of Asians at Amherst (like other leading US colleges). The Asian Student Association is not only quite active, but also one of the largest on campus. You will find friendships that will last a lifetime and a support system that goes along with it.\n\nGood luck.\n\nOne last note. Amherst is truly need blind for all students; domestic and international. With $2,5 billion in endowment and only 1,800 students, the school is quite generous in its finaid...and proud of it.",
