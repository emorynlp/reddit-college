  "text": "I have already filled out FAFSA on Oct 1 and submitted. There is a university that I would consider one of my top 3 for which I want to go.I did not put that school on my FAFSA. As far as I know financial aid is first come first serve. How do I add this school without harming myself for other schools. Is there a way I can only send it to this school without sending it to all ten schools again? Their priority deadline for FAFSA is Dec 1 so I have some time still.",

      "text": "Others gave you the right advice for correcting things, but I want to clarify that most aid is NOT first come, first serve.  \n\nMost federal aid like pell grants, subsidized loans, etc. never run out of funds - it's really only the FSEOG program that runs out of money where being early matters.  For aid from the school, that priority date the school has is really what matters.  \n\nWhat can be first come, first serve is grants directly from your state -- often the funds a state budgets for those grants isn't enough to cover every student who would qualify, so submitting early can help.",
