  "text": "Hello to everyone reading this,\n\nMy APUSH teacher entered my grades incorrectly for both semesters last year (giving me a B when I got an A both semesters). It took a while to finally get fixed on my transcript because our school's old data technician retired this year. My counselor has already sent my school report/transcripts to all the colleges I am applying to. However, the one she sent doesn't reflect my most updated grades.\n\nSome of the colleges I'm applying to have all documents due November 1st. Which is apparently this Sunday at 12:00 am. Sadly, My counselor doesn't read her email on the weekends, can I still send an update of my transcript to colleges even after November 1st?\n\nAlso, my counselor even told me that it wasn't worth sending the most current transcript as it only really moved my GPA 0.02 points up (4.32 instead of 4.3 now) and it isn't really a make or break deal for colleges but I still really want colleges to see the grade I've worked hard for.\n\nI've been stressing out about this since august ( literally cried myself to sleep so many times haha) since my teachers and the new data technician are very not responsive, what should I do now?\n\nThank you so much for your time.",

      "text": "My Tiktok feed has been full of college admissions personnel the last couple weeks... the last few days a few of them have emphasized that (for the most part) the deadline is 11:59 Monday night in whatever your time zone is. One or two also did videos about NOT contacting the college to beg for your life and your app if you experience a glitch in submitting and get your app in sometime super early in the morning (in your time zone) Tuesday 11/2. They said they don't flat out refuse to read or consider ones that straggle in.\n\nYour mileage may vary, but that's what I've been (somewhat) inundated with on Tiktok:/",
