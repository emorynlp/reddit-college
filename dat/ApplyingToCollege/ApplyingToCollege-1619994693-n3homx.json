  "text": "My interviewer for Georgetown was absolutely INCREDIBLE. She emailed me in all caps congratulations the day after I got in & she even said she could offer me an internship this summer. I absolutely love Georgetown but (financially) it wasn\u2019t meant to be. I know that of course she\u2019ll understand but part of me just feels so heartbroken! Ah well i know it\u2019s a wonderful problem to have and that she\u2019ll be super excited to hear where I will go but, still...",

The pandemic made it/makes it so hard for people to connect, so one good good and genuine connection between two people can go a long way.",

                  "text": "Hmm...interview tips from me..sure, why not! \nI\u2019m going to try to make this different from the initial google search results on how to do well in a college interview. \n\n1. I have a lot of experience talking to adults like they\u2019re actual people, like we\u2019re two people having a conversation. So my biggest tip would be to get in the habit of talking to adults and having actual meaningful conversations with them. \n\n2. What do these conversations look like? They can be about what you think you should major in, your favorite book, what place you\u2019d love to travel to or do study abroad in, even politics if you\u2019re comfortable (and can back up your claims, coherently), stuff like that. The dad that I babysit for is super nerdy, and one time when he drove me home we spent ten minutes sitting in his car outside my house talking about literature, and it was great. \n\n3. Pretend your interviewer is like that adult. For me, these adults are my favorite English teacher and my rabbi. I\u2019ve talked with them about passages in texts and perspectives on politics, but I\u2019ve also made funny jokes. \n\n4. Know your context! I googled my interviewer beforehand, and I knew that she had lived in my city for at least the past decade, so I felt comfortable mentioning area-specific things whereas I wouldn\u2019t have mentioned a local scandal to my Tufts interviewer, who was in Massachussets. My interviewer was also Jewish, so I felt comfortable talking about issues related to Judaism and my own Judaism and connecting it to my academic interests.\n\n5. Do your research. This is self explanatory. \n\n6. Keep yourself flexible while still adhering to the rapport the interviewer is establishing. You\u2019re allowed to segue into conversation shifts \u2014 a good way to do so is mention a class you\u2019re interested in taking, or ask a question \u2014 but don\u2019t interrupt the interviewer. It\u2019s good to know when to follow the interview\u2019s lead, though you can direct the flow of the conversation. \n\n7. Know that it won\u2019t always be perfect. One amazing interview doesn\u2019t guarantee a series of amazing interviews. I practiced a lot for this Georgetown interview after having had a just okay one a few weeks prior that I hadn\u2019t prepared for. I learned my lesson. It also depends on the interviewer\u2019s social skills. You can\u2019t control everything and that\u2019s okay. \n\n8. Let your inner nerdiness shine through. This is where I did my best, talking about my favorite books. Something really cool about zoom interviews was noticing how in the little camera box, that as I spoke about my favorite books, my hopes and dreams, my smile just got bigger. \n\n9. Be yourself! I believe that I got in because I was myself throughout the entirety of the application.",
