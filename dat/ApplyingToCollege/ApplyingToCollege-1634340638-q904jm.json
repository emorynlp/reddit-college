  "text": "I told my parents I was going to major in Biochemistry(mainly because I did a summer internship that involved Biochem and I enjoyed that), but I've just recently began to consider film studies. \n\nWhat I've come up with so far:\n\n**Biochem Pros:** \n\nmore job security, higher avg. pay, more colleges I can apply to\n\n**Biochem Cons:** \n\ntougher courses, not sure if I will enjoy the jobs I can get with this degree\n\n**Film Pros:**\n\nI feel like I'll do better in film classes than chem/bio classes, something I'm genuinely passionate about\n\n**Film Cons:**\n\ncan't apply to any top universities cause no portfolio, not a lot of jobs, smaller avg. pay, film industry pretty risky in general\n\nIt just comes down to what I'll enjoy vs. what'll bring me more \"success\"\n\nI know a lot of people on here pick majors just for the job security and the pay rather than because they genuinely enjoy their major. Not sure if this is what I should do. \n\nAny advice is appreciated.",
