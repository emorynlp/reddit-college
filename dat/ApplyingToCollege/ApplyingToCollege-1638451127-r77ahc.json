My question is , I'm applying through common app and I haven't seen any university asking for my toefl scores, So do we have to submit the scores through the toefl website or just typing in the scores on common app is sufficient?",

India has fewer English-speakers than the US.\n\nRegardless, if the college requires TOEFL (or similar) results, the will almost universally require official reports. But each university has its own requirements, so you would need to check.",

In all instances, you can submit TOEFL scores after the application if both are sent before the deadline. It's when sending scores after the application deadline that may be a problem for some colleges.",
