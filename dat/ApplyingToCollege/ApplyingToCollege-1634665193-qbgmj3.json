I would not be that worried about the cold, it's a quite small campus so you don't have to walk for miles, as long as you pack the necessary things the cold will just be another part of the day.",

In addition to this even as a prospective student the professors are easily accessible if I have any questions.\n\nI also really love the fact that there are 'basically' no required classes. The campus is beautiful and the food is amazing.",

But the visit made the decision easy.  I was looking at a lot of small schools but they felt small and had limited academics and majors.  UR felt big. It has a nice campus, small class sizes, a seemingly endless syllabus, and only 1 required class for most majors.  It was pretty unique.   A few schools had \"make your own major\" options but still had a core of classes for any major.",
