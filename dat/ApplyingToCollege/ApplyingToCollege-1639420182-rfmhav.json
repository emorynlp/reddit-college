  "text": "1. Harvard - not even close.  It's not even a school but more of an idea.\n2. Stanford, MIT, Yale, Princeton - most people have heard of these and know they are good schools.  \n3. Rest of the Ivy League - most people can't name more than 2 schools that are Ivy League but know they are good schools.  Bonus points for explaining the difference between Penn and Penn State.\n4. Good Schools that Play Football - Duke,Vanderbilt, Northwestern, Berkeley, Notre Dame\n5. Any other school with a D1 football team or a basketball team that regularly makes the NCAA tourney.  Although some ding here if the football team is real good, like Alabama, because the assumption will be that the school is easy to get the football players.\n6. State schools they know nothing about but assume exist and therefore better than an unknown school - examples would be Alaska, Montana and NYU.\n7. Pretty much everything else.\n\nNOTE:  EDITED TO REFLECT FEEDBACK ON DUKE\n\n&#x200B;",
