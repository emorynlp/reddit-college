Rather than read it for the story, think about their writing styles and commonalities between how different authors write. From there, you can essentially synthesize your own creative writing style and make your essays sound like stories. Facts tell stories sell!! Good luck.\n\nEdit: if you can't help but be drawn into each story like me(oops), just read them until you find one or more that you absolutely love. After reading over a couple times, you can focus on the writing style and less on the plot itself.",

Speaking allowed all of his words to come out organically instead of him trying to find the right word or the best way to phrase a sentence. He went through and edited multiple times when he was done but he felt like his voice really came through. He advised my high school junior and sophomore to do the same when they are applying for colleges.",

I really struggled at first, but I think what helped me when I was applying last year was making a list of the different things that defined me - culturally, ethnically, what I'm interested in, family story, etc. - and then trying to weave it into a story about myself, and how all those things inform my ultimate career choice instead of focusing on just one event or one hobby or one thing that I'm super duper passionate about (those essays are kinda tacky imo).\n\nIt's definitely hard to pull off this method with a limited word count, though. If I don't make sense you can always dm me and I'd be happy to share my essay with you so you can see what I mean.\n\nGood luck!",

Someone recommended this once how that specific font just makes you want to write \u201caction-packed/adventurous\u201d stories and after trying it out for my Common App draft, it worked pretty well. Another tip is to just give yourself time. Obviously not too much but sometimes you just need to go away from your essay and give yourself peace. Good luck man.",
