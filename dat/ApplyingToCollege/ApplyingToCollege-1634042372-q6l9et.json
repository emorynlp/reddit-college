  "text": "I\u2019m in going into engineering, so I thought it would be best to assign my engineering elective teacher to my letter of recommendation because she knows me well and can write about how I would be good for that major. Well, now I find out that one of the schools I\u2019m applying to only accepts 1 letter and it must be from a core subject teacher (went to a talk from the school and they said this. The core subject teacher part was not on the commonapp). \nI have another recommender which is a science teacher, but since the engineering one is already submitted through the common app, I can\u2019t switch it. Should I call the admissions counselor and ask how I can send another recommendation and have the first one disregarded?\nBtw this is my top school.... I really don\u2019t want to give off a bad impression. Sorry for making this mistake :(",
