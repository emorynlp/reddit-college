  "text": "FFS. Maybe think a little bit outside of prestige. I know it\u2019s a novel idea but still. Think about fit. Think about career interests. Think about the vibes. I have plenty of friends not enjoying their current T20 because they prestige-whored too much. On the other hand I have a friend who turned down most of HYPSM to go to a lower ranked T20 and he\u2019s really happy. Y\u2019all just suck. \n\nFor example, if you\u2019re thinking about career interests, if you wanna work in Finance is go to Cornell, Notre Dame, Georgetown, Dartmouth, and Duke are your best bets outside of HYP and Wharton. Notice how none of them are in the top 10. (Also Duke is overrated in Finance before dumbasses here start hyping it up).\n\nIf you want to be a weird nerd always doing homework no one likes, apply to Uchicago, JHU, Caltech\n\nIf you want to go to the strange hip pothead liberal trust-fund kid school Brown, WashU or vandy.\n\nIf you want to be a conservative frat bro Dartmouth, Duke, or Notre Dame. Stanford has too many sexual-assaulting frat bro\u2019s.\n\nIf you want to be in the south and marry your cousin go Duke or Rice. \n\nIf you want to start a holy war Georgetown or Notre Dame.\n\nThere\u2019s options outside of T10 people. \n\nWhen your asian parents ask you why you aren\u2019t EDing to HYPSM, ask them if they\u2019ll pay 70k/year for you to go to Berkeley instead since that\u2019s the only other school asian parents have heard of but not even a T20 according to this list.",

Not to mention that Duke still maintains T10 on Forbes, Niche, and Times Higher Ed/WSJ. People don't understand that US News may be the most referenced ranking but public opinion doesn't change year to year \u2014 no layperson or even employer is going to argue that Northwestern or JHU are more prestigious than Duke, or that Duke is less prestigious than Penn or Columbia.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople are reactionary, and if this is how they judge top schools, they don't deserve to get into one.",

How the presenters act and what kind of information they present can give you a good idea whether it\u2019s your fit or not\u2014plus you get to learn about unique programs they might have that you might like. For example, Yale in particular was a bit *too* polished for my liking, but that\u2019s because they\u2019re a super elite school.\n\nAlso helpful are the student panels, since you can ask students specific questions on what is important for you personality wise in the student body. E.g., what is the typical student like, what kind of student would succeed here, is it easy to make friends, etc.\n\nAlso I recommend U of Rochester\u2019s virtual series of college application advice (interviewing, essays, and more) if you feel like you want some extra advice for your app.",

Yale and USC for example explicitly said not to screen record sessions since they do them basically everyday and they want students to attend live. Harvey Mudd did it prerecorded though and it\u2019s on their website\u2014I highly recommend watching their prerecorded version and not a live session if you\u2019re interested in learning about the school (the presenter seemed very enthusiastic and partially contributed to why I fell in love with the school).\n\nI really liked Harvey Mudd because personally I go to a small high school (~400 students total) that is situated in a community college. The environment has been a great fit for me (compared to going to a large middle school, which had been overwhelming). Harvey Mudd, being a small school (~800 students total) situated in the larger Claremont consortium is pretty much a direct parallel to my high school experience, so I know that the environment will work great for me.\n\nAnother reason I want to apply is because it\u2019s a liberal arts college\u2014even though it specializes in STEM, it still values the importance of non-STEM subjects and requires participation in them. I plan on minoring in music since it\u2019s been a huge part of my life, so this would work well for me.\n\nThis comment has gone on long enough lol. Basically, if you just watch the guy that recorded the info session on their website, pretty much everything he says is what made me want to apply. The Core, the fact that the first sem is pass/fail, 100% financial aid met, the Honor Code, the 50/50 gender ratio, and so much more. If you are able to take the time to watch info sessions and other virtual events I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to find a college to fall in love with as well.",

I visited LA and just didn't like it. The culture felt too pretentious and I didn't feel like I belong - same for Berkeley, it didn't come close to what I was expecting and Berkeley was the DREAM for me throughout high school. Georgetown was just too expensive LOL. \n\nTLDR: choose the campus that vibes most with you.

It matters because of networking and alma-mater-nepotism.  Eg. Yalies give more attention to the job applications from other Yalies - and the same is true for all other big name schools. Having H/P/Y as your undergrad on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 won't matter nearly as much when applying somewhere that isn't run by H/P/Y grads.\n\nYour undergrad can have some effect on grad school placement, but not as much as you think - they're more interested in your actual academic and work history.  And once you've gone to grad school, your undergrad alma mater matters even less on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 - except, of course, if you're applying to a place run by T10 grads.\n\n**If your desired career path does not include scrambling up the soulless corporate ladder, but rather working towards something meaningful and fulfilling, go to whichever school has the professors, department, courses, or student culture that will enable you to thrive academically.**\n\nMy anecdote: I went to (at the time) the no.1 ranked undergrad school for my major. Hated it. HATED it.  Never worked a day in the field because of how that school soured me on it all.  Seven years later, applied to grad school in a related field - was immediately accepted to one of the top 3 programs in the country and offered a scholarship, seemingly on the merit of having attended my undergrad (those T10 schools care WAY too much about prestige) even though I had done poorly there. Visited, saw it would have been exactly like my undergrad education, knew it wasn't for me.  Went to a less \"prestigious\" program that had more of what I was looking for, and excelled.  Finally enjoyed academia for the first time in my life.  Ended up staying on with a great professor as a research fellow for a bit after graduation.  Published two papers.  Best academic decision I ever made.\n\n**TL;DR** You won't be getting a \"better education\" at a T10 school than if you attend a lower \"ranked\" school. You may even be getting a worse education if the academic environment is hostile to you.  Attending a T10 school *can* give you a sort of ticket to the front of the line when applying to *certain* jobs at *certain* firms in *certain* industries.",

Any opinions/tips/advices will be much appreciated :) ik not all T20s are great at STEM majors, and many schools that are STEM oriented are not part of the T20s, and idm the rankings, as long as the money I invest into the school is worth it uk",

I'm a professional resume writer, and university prestige means a LOT for my recent graduates. \n\nGoing to the top school for [insert any major here] or the only school that offers [unique degree program] is important and something that I feature prominently on my clients' resumes. A graphic designer who went to Parsons will inevitably have an easier time finding their first job (and will be higher paid in that job) versus one who went to any state school. \n\nA degree from a #200 ranked school is not equal to a degree from a #20 ranked school, even if the major and GPA are equal. That's just not the way the professional recruiting/hiring world works, at least for your first job search.",

Putting \"Duke\" or \"Berkeley\" on your resume is a factor that has measurable impact for your entire career. Attaining a higher paying first job or a better job title means you will earn more over your entire career. For those who care about money, it's one of the best things you can do. \n\nNobody needs to beat themselves up because of this fact and I certainly don't want anyone to choose a prestigious school over one that's the better fit for their needs. Obtaining a degree (any degree) will open doors, compared to those who choose not to pursue college or only complete some college. \n\nI just need to level with you that this is an element that recruiters and hiring managers are actually looking for. Applicant tracking systems will usually rank a candidate higher if they attended a prestigious school, meaning that it's more likely a human will look at their application. I talk to HR folks every day; I know how recruitment decision-making works.",
