  "text": "Hi thank you\nSo, tonight's the UT Austin deadline for extra materials for priority deadline and I received a LoR from my science teacher who knows me rlly well and since I'm going into a STEM major it's even more perfect. The only problem is that I emailed my counselor, bc they're the ones that are supposed to upload my rec letter, about the rec letter today bc that's when my teacher finished it but my counselor has yet to respond. If she doesn't respond, is there any other way I can upload it? If it doesn't get uploaded, how badly will it hurt my chances of getting in? PLEASE HELP. \n\nAnd thank you for taking the time to read this it does mean a lot.\n\nedit: MY COUNSELOR RESPONDED",

          "text": "yea it says Nov 8 on their website but you can still ask and get one for the Dec 1 deadline (idk if the extra materials are due on Dec 1 with the application or if there is a grace period). Also I think LoRs are optional for UT Austin, but they do help if the letter is good.",
