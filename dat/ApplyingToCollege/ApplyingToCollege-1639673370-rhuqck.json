  "text": "I am a veteran who is applying to a few top schools, and I believe I have a strong application. Recently, I have seen videos of students reading their essays that got them into ivy league schools. I\u2019m confident in my writing skills, but the essays I have heard online poetically describe some sort of trauma the applicant has experienced. I do not write in such a way and it has me questioning whether I am capable of writing an essay that will result in my acceptance to some of my top schools. Has anyone here gotten into an ivy without writing a paper like this? Should I reevaluate my approach to writing my essays?",

Certain types of essays tend to get more attention online, but that\u2019s not necessarily representative of all essays. I\u2019d recommend reading the essay wiki on here, it has good tips about what makes a strong common app essay (without involving those misconceptions).",
