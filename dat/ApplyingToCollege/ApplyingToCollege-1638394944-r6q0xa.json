  "text": "Ok, so I just got an email from a college I applied to (Early Action, submitted on November 1st), and they are telling me to apply to sum advanced program for \u201coutstanding students\u201d cause of my \u201cstrong academic performance\u201d and that I am an excellent candidate. I know this might and most likely is for every single student, but you never know. I also got this email on my mail entry and not on my Junk entry as I\u2019m used to.\n\nPlease don\u2019t make fun of me. I\u2019m too innocent for this shit smh",

(Those people don't have enough resources to handle getting applications from everyone, nor do they typically do much marketing.) If it's \"Apply to our advanced summer school\" or \"yer smart, apply here!\" then, yeah, ignore that.",

For my application, I created a whole different email to use so I can differentiate between important college emails and random stuff. But I guess it might be too late to change your email.",
