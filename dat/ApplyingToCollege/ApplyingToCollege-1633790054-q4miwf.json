  "text": "I\u2019m taking my ACT on the 23rd so the scores will not arrive before the nov 1 deadline. The school says they do accept October tests scores for ED, but how do I self report them for my application if I don\u2019t have the scores by the time the application is due? Will they consider them if I send an official report without a self report? It\u2019s UPenn if that helps",
