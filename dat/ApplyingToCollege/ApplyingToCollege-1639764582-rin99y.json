  "text": "\nThis has nothing to do with me not being able to live out my dream of following in the footsteps of Miley Stewart and Paris Geller (and I guess Teddy Duncan?)\n\n*beginning of \u201crant\u201d*\n\nDon\u2019t worry! I didn\u2019t apply ED or REA or whatever, so I\u2019m not feeling bitter right now over a rejection/deferral. This definitely isn\u2019t a \u201cmake me hate school x/school y post.\u201d (although, originally, it was.)\n\nWhat I DID do was read over the essays/short answer questions that I wrote for both schools (first mistake) and man oh man, these are hot garbage. Like I knew I\u2019d be taking a (HUGE) chance applying to both schools, and I truly just applied to see what would happen, but I did want to present myself as best as I possibly could. But after reading over these essays\u2026 \ud83d\ude2d I don\u2019t know WHAT I was thinking. Yes, I understand that re-reading essays can be somewhat deceiving because \u201cthey\u2019re not as bad as you think\u201d (liars). And these aren\u2019t the worst things I\u2019ve ever written, but they\u2019re absolutely not going to make me stand out in a sea of applicants who are actually qualified and actually deserve to go to these schools. So please, make me hate Stanford and Yale, because any bit of confidence I had in my applications has now been shot. (My entire thought process for applying to both schools was a complete mess, btw. Next Wednesday, I plan on sharing screenshots of the conversation I had with my friend when I was deciding to apply to both schools).\n\n*end of \u201crant\u201d*\n\nActually no. I may not get into Stanford/Yale, but I\u2019m absolutely grateful that I\u2019ve had the opportunity to both apply to schools and receive acceptances from some schools that could really see myself enjoying. Plus, I ended my semester with Straight A\u2019s, so that\u2019s cool. Okay that\u2019s all. I just didn\u2019t want to leave things on a negative/ungrateful note because I\u2019m genuinely excited to have to opportunity to go to college, and I don\u2019t want my messed up inner demons ruining this whole process for me.\n\nOh! And on another note, my best friend got into Princeton ED today!! Genuinely so proud of him, and congratulations to everyone who was accepted into their dream schools today/recently!\n\n**real** *end of \u201crant\u201d* | thank you for listening to my irrational thoughts :)\n\n\u201cI want to live my life so that I\u2019ll be able to read an in-depth biography about myself in later years and not puke.\u201d - Paris Geller",
