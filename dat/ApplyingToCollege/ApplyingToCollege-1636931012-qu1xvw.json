  "text": "Basically the title, I answers the fourth prompt,\n \u2018Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.\u2019 \nIn it I basically talked about how my Ap Chem teacher hated online school and kind of gave up on helping students with anything. I explained how I had to find outside sources to learn stuff and organize study groups. But I was wondering if this is ok because I\u2019ve heard that when people read essays like this they think that the student is just blaming the teacher instead of themselves for a bad grade the got but I ended up getting an A in the class so is it alright?",
