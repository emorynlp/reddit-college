  "text": "Hey guys I\u2019m new to the college application process, been trying to figure it out myself. Is it possible to submit the same essay across the board to the universities I\u2019m applying to or do I have to write a special essay for each, in addition I have the same question regarding recommendations.\n\nPs. If anyone has any tips on application essays or about the whole process I would really appreciate your input, thanks.",
