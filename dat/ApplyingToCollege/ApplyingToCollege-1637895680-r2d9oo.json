  "text": "So I applied Yale REA, and so far I haven't gotten an interview so I probably won't get one. And I know that people get accepted without them, and that they're for \"finding out more\" about applicants and it doesn't mean I am instantly rejected BUTBUT I don't think I am anywhere near an instant yes, so I am probably in the \"we don't need more info we will just reject the guy\" pile. Which makes me kinda worried and anxious ARGHHH",
