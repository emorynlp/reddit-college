Take JHU for example. It is listed as one of the worst ROIs, on par with lame religious studies schools. Why? Because a) it eliminates the effect of grad school (and most of JHUs students are premed)\nb) it calculates salaries too soon (most JHU students are premed and in residency/required hours).\n\nSo what this means is that college becomes what you make it to be. You can \u201cmaximize your ROI\u201d if that is what you want. But objectively speaking, you wouldn\u2019t turn down JHU versus your average state school, despite the fact that JHU has \u201cterrible\u201d ROI.",

To stay with the example of JHU students who become medical doctors: they have tremendous debt when they leave residency, but they're still able to buy houses - which would normally be out of reach for people with lots of debt who have spent a long stretch on a relatively low income - because banks know that, as doctors, they're *going to* have high incomes, so the banks issue something called a doctor mortgage. Home ownership is a big deal, and it isn't something that ROI calculators take into account when they look at salary alone.",

One huge caveat:  this is extremely crude analysis, and doesn't even attempt to account for differences in student characteristics that aren't contained in the data.  Such as, for instance, high school GPA, career goals, and \"ambition\".  For instance, I suspect that's why certain top schools have earnings that exceed what their SAT and % STEM would otherwise predict.  It's not the value of the name brand, but the fact that the most achievement-focused students tend to select into these schools.  If true, that implies two things:\n\n1. If you \\*are\\* that kind of person, then not getting into, say, Harvard, isn't going to tank your future earnings, and\n2. If you \\*aren't\\* that type of person, then getting into, say, Harvard, may not magically guarantee future earnings on-par with the median Harvard grad.\n\nIn general, Catholic schools come out looking amazing on this measure (with the exception of BC and Gonzaga). I highlighted them in yellow.",

Dartmouth and vandy has solid rois as well as long as you\u2019re going into finance/engineering\n\nEdit: I would cross reference the Forbes rankings because they prinarily take into account salary and stuff.

The average loan debt for top 20s is probably double that. There are plenty of students that graduate with $100k+ in debt. That is almost certainly above the rule of thumb to not exceed the first year\u2019s salary with debt. \n\nThe reason I bring this up is that every year strong students, the type that get into T20s, have a choice between paying for a T20 or taking a significant scholarship to a T50. I\u2019d say 90% of the time, the student would be better off taking the scholarship. Obviously, lower income students benefit the most from wealthy schools, but those schools tend to skew towards upper class students who can pay more. \n\nAs for not knowing much about college admissions, I know a little.  The students I\u2019ve counseled over the past few years have gotten into a dozen or so T20s and even a few at the very top. I can\u2019t wait to learn more, I\u2019ll be dangerous.",
