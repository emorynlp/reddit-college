  "text": "Hello there! I'm applying on a gap year. I'm filling out the gap year essay on the Common App, but there's not a lot of space. Would it hurt if I also used the additional info section to describe what I've been using my time for? (Maybe I could put \"Please see additional info\" or smth). That way I could just dedicate the gap year essay to explaining why I took a gap. Thanks!",
