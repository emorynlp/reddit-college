  "text": "Okay so this is my first time posting on here. I just submitted my REA application to Yale. I feel like my application is pretty strong and honestly was just glad I finally submitted it. A huge weight off my shoulders. I was reviewing my application just now just cause (I was being annoying and stressing a bit) and I realized to my horror I made a mistake. In my most recent course spot in the common app I wrote that two of the classes I was taking were honors which I genuinely thought they were, but they weren\u2019t. My transcript says they were not, and so I don\u2019t want them to think I\u2019m lying or anything. It was just a dumb mistake on my end. I\u2019m not sure if a mistake like this is detrimental for a collage application to a school like Yale. Should I email them to try to correct this? Is there something I could do?",
