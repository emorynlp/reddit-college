  "text": "For the financial aid section in the Yale portal, there are the required CSS fafsa and the parents tax return. i have completed the css and fafsa but have questions for the tax return: if my parents are married, i would only need to submit one tax return right? does it need to somehow be signed? and i do not need to submit anything right? also, would i just submit it using the \u201cupload financial aid documents\u201d tab in the portal or use the college board idoc service since that is what it says on yale website.",
