  "title:": "ED wednesday challenge to prevent me from thinking further about this bs",
  "text": "Early Decision results coming out this Wednesday AAA!! \n\nThe school I applied for is in Canada and they aren't as generous as the US when giving money away to foreigners, which is why they give out only one full scholarship per year. It's a real gamble. As unlikely as it is, if I am in fact the lucky winner I will learn 1863 (the year uni was founded) new words in my non-native language and make a list to prove it.\n\nIf not I'll just take a gap year as planned, but fingers crossed, good luck to everyone!!",
