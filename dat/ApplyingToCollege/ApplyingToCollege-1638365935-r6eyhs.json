  "text": "So I have to write this essay for this university and how I got to learn about the college. The reality is that since I'm international I just found it in a college list online for universities that were good for my major, but I really came to love the school. I was thinking of saying sth similar to 'In search for an institution that offers an unparalleled program in water resources engineering, I came across X, and soon became fascinated with..'. How can I write about the way I learned about the university in a way that sounds interesting (without obviously lying)?",
