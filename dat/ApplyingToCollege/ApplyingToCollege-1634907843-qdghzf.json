  "text": "Hi. I am debating on whether I should mention how my social anxiety prevented me from spending more time on extracurriculars, and then talking about how I overcame it in the past 2 years and how I plan to be much more active during college. Aside from ECs, I have good grades and a good SAT score. Any advice would be helpful. <3",
