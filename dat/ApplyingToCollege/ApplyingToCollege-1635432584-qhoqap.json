  "text": "For my personal essay, I chose to write about my growth during Covid 19 and quarantine which I improved in myself a lot over those two years. However others are telling me that it\u2019s gonna be overused, and I should use something else, like the fact that I came from Ukraine or survived Hurricane Sandy, or moved around the country a bunch. Could anyone give any insight on this?",

      "text": "There is a Covid essay question that you can use to talk about your growth \n\nBut really it\u2019s going to be about you and where you\u2019ve seen the growth and if that was because you used the last two years to your benefit I think it can work. \n\nAs long as you write about what\u2019s important to you and what you value and care about and believe the vehicle you use to share your message doesn\u2019t really matter. Just stay focused on high school\nyou",
