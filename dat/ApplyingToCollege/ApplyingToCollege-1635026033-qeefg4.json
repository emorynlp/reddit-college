      "text": "Hope you're doing well, OP!  You unfortunately cannot edit your Common App or supplemental essays, and it isn't necessary to resend your LORs since they already have them, but you are allowed to write a Letter of Continued Interest.  Admissionsmom has some amazing posts about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/kh2foz/so_you_were_deferred_what_to_do_now_its_time_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mmzmpz/more_waitlist_psas_faqs_and_loci_fun_write_that/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), but it allows you to affirm your interest in attending while also talking about any new extracurricular activities you've been a part of, new awards/honors, any new jobs you've started to hold, etc.  Admissionsangle also wrote an awesome post about the Letter of Continued Interest [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ksen04/the_letter_of_continued_interest_2021_edition/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)!  You also are allowed to send in a new LOR if you have one from another person, but usually, if you decide to, it won't be from another teacher but usually someone you were close with, such as a supervisor of one of your clubs, a boss at a job, a coach if you're part of a sport, etc.\n\nHope this helped, and good luck!\n\nHave a nice day!",
