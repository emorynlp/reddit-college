  "text": "I was taking a massive shit, and then I heard the words that changed my life. \u201cHey! Don\u2019t shit there, there\u2019s no toilet paper!\u201d But it was too late. I had shit. \n\nI had to think, how can I clean my shit. With hours of pondering, I questioned the philosophical implications of my conundrum, Why do we shit? What is shit? Who is shit? \n\nAnd in doing so, I realized, I couldn\u2019t leave myself like this, I had to find the answers to these questions, I needed to! So I quickly ravaged my bathroom, looking for substitute toilet paper. And there it was, the holy grail. A stack of tissues. I vicously wiped my ass with huge relief.\n\nHere, I learned to be innovative and inquisitive, as I traversed this gastrointestinal journey, and found a solution.\n\nI hope to bring these qualities I\u2019ve procured to my endeavors at college and beyond.",
