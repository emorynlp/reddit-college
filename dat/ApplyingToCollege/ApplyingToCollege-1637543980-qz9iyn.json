  "text": "Right now, I have about six EC's on my applications. I feel like I need more, but I'm struggling to find anything. I read that hobbies can count as EC, but my hobby is a little weird. I enjoy foraging, and since I live in an area with a lot of wilderness, I like to find different plants that can be used for food. Kind of like Bear Grylls. Would this hurt my application if I put it there?",
