  "text": "So I\u2019ve not been having too good of a time because I\u2019ve been stressed about my college apps and the fact that the early deadline is right around the corner\u2026 \n\nThe biggest factor of my stress has been the fact that my teachers haven\u2019t filled in my recommendations yet. I had asked them for the letters in September which they said they had written by the end of September\u2026 I invited them on commonapp on 1st October and I sent them a couple of reminders but that yielded nothing. UNTIL TODAY!! I woke up and saw that 3 of my teachers have done it! Still have 3 to go but I feel so much lighter\u2026\n\nLooking back I feel that I didn\u2019t need all that stress because 17 days is not a lot, but honestly applications cause so much anxiety and these LORs were something I had asked for 2-3 months in advance, and it was something I couldn\u2019t really control\u2026 I think I annoyed my teachers to the point where they just uploaded it to get me off their backs; still I think they\u2019ll have good recommendations for me. Here\u2019s hoping!\n\nDamn, these apps are super draining",
