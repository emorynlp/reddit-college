      "text": ">more grade inflation + more time for ec\u2019s\n\nDefinitely not true for many students in many places.  A lot of students struggled with online school in my area and in a lot of places in the US.  Specifically looking at my kids' school and district, grades were down overall.  The number of students who got an F in a class last year set a new, bad record for the district. \n\nECs in general were much harder to come by.  A lot of the places/activities that are typical ECs were either canceled or cut back pretty severely.  Band/orchestra was a joke last year. My kid marches and they went from nearly 2 dozen events throughout the school year to 3.  Volunteering was really hard, especially for students that relied on public events - all of which were canceled.  My kid has a regular gig with an animal rescue but we still ended up having to buy hours (i.e. bring in 30 cans of food to earn one service hour).",
