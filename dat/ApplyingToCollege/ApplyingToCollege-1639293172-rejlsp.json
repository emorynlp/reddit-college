  "text": "can't really think of anything else except that my ED school might not accept me just because I asked for fin aid. Like, I obv do need fin aid (wouldn't have applied for it otherwise) but the mere prospect of the school not accepting me just because i asked for aid, and that they might've taken me in if not for the need-aware policy.....  \nThen again, idek if i'm good enough for the school, they might just not take me in because of my stats and i might be overestimating myself and think that they aren't considering me because of fin aid.....jsksjjjskkskskksks i'm overthinking  \nThe days leading up to the decision are going to be LONG (and to top it off, I have board examinations, pray for me lmao)",
