  "text": "Yes, I know that I shouldn't send my personal essay to strangers, but I'm desperate and need some external opinion. Could anyone give my two personal essays a look?? On one I've worked for the past five months, but find it generic and ridiculously cliche now. The other one I wrote in like 3 days so I'm unsure as to whether it's a good idea, but I feel much more connected to it. \n\nThank you everyone in advance!!",
