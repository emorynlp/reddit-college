  "text": "I see a lot of college list posts of usually T20 schools but I wouldn\u2019t even consider it bc of how expensive it is. Like when I was younger, I rly wanted to go to NYU (lowk still do) but it\u2019s so damn expensive. I would rather not put my mom in debt \ud83d\ude2d \n\nI\u2019m a Junior so I\u2019m planning my college list now and I do like some of the colleges I see, but the cost always deters me away first. What is some advice when making your college list? :(",
