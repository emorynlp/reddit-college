  "text": "okay so this might be controversial, but it rlly annoys me when people say college admissions for top schools are a lottery.\n\nis the process weird? yes.\nis it unfair? absolutely yes.\nis it unpredictable? yes.\nis it a lottery? no.\n\nnobody (and i mean nobody) should be entitled to admission into a top school. chances are you aren\u2019t the only 1600-scoring-nonprofit-founder-international-competition-winner applying to top schools. if there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve learned throughout this process is that personality and fit are key. if you are an amazing student but an absolute robot, you will likely not be competitive in admissions. on the other hand, if you\u2019ve come from a difficult background and have a vibrant personality, you are competitive. \n\nthere\u2019s nothing random about college admissions. i\u2019ve noticed that most people that call them a lottery have been privileged throughout the process, as in advisors, counseling, etc. most people that they look at for evidence of said lottery happen to be low-income minorities. \n\nanyway, moral of the story is: college apps aren\u2019t the end of the world. if you don\u2019t get in to your dream school, you will certainly thrive at an amazing school. there\u2019s no need to deflect onto people who were admitted. there was a reason why they were admitted and you weren\u2019t, but it wasn\u2019t random.\n\nedit: its true\u2014legacies that just get admitted because of their legacy statuses do not deserve it more than students who actually worked their asses off.",

Supposing the same application was submitted two years, it's possible that one would get in and the other wouldn't, just depending on the context of that incoming class, what the admissions office wanted for the incoming class, and a bunch of other things.",

AOs recognize these students as well and don't treat them as \"robots\".\n\n>there\u2019s no need to deflect onto people who were admitted\n\nUnfortunately with legacy admissions and the semi-recent college scandals surrounding bribes, Asian students etc., people have a severe distrust with the college admissions process and target privileged students who didn't have to work as hard as them. It's the honest truth.\n\nThis post is incredibly arrogant, obnoxious and close-minded.",

      "text": "You\u2019re wrong for the simple fact that it is luck based, you even said it yourself\u2026 If the applications are unfair or unpredictable then it is luck based. Also the universities constantly talk about having specific applicants that fill a very specific \u201cneed\u201d to make a well rounded class. Whether that be a specific niche such as a trombone player or a fencer, but this need changes year after year. How will you know what each university is looking for if they never state what niche they\u2019re looking for, and if it changes year after year? If you\u2019re lucky and the college you applied to needs a niche that you\u2019re focused in then you got lucky, but if they don\u2019t need it that year but may need it next year then you got unlucky, it\u2019s merely that simple. If that\u2019s not luck based then you clearly need to brush up on what \u201cluck\u201d means, as you clearly don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.",
