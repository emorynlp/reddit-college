  "text": "When I was creating my common app activity list I listed the number of hours I spent on each activity but looking back I exaggerated some of them by a couple of hours. I already submitted my application so I can't change it now. Should I contact the admissions office and send them a new version of the activity list with more accurate hours? Or is this a minor thing that shouldn't really be worried about",
