  "text": "*Dear Rayyan,*\n\n*Your academic accomplishments have attracted our attention. We believe you have tremendous potential and are just the type of student who would be a great fit for Seton Hall University. Based on your profile, you are a very promising candidate for both admission and scholarship at Seton Hall University and you may be eligible for a University Scholarship which, over four years, could total between $85,000 - $100,000.*\n\n*To be automatically considered for this scholarship, all you need to do is apply to Seton Hall University no later than December 1. You can apply for admission by submitting the Common Application or the Seton Hall application found at admissions.shu.edu. We are also offering you the opportunity to apply for free - just enter the fee waiver code \u201cSFW\u201d on your Seton Hall application or on the Common Application. Unfortunately, if you have already applied, we are unable to refund your application fee.*\n\nGot this email from Seton, it goes on with some generic stuff about them. But my god it seems so deceptive to make it seem like a mass email is about an applicants specifics. I imagine a good few kids are gonna apply because they think it's specific to them.\n\nFor context: I haven't added my grades to CA yet so I can't imagine there's any way for them to know my grades and send me any form of specifically directed email.",

              "text": "Weird cliquey environment, overly expensive, and the freshman dorms are awful especially for the price.  They also gave me a hard time transferring credits from another school, I took science courses and the school will only let me transfer it as an elective so it doesn\u2019t go towards my major and I wasted a bunch of time taking classes at another college lol That\u2019s just my experience but I don\u2019t really like it. Plus the kids are snobby",
