  "title:": "I wrote a cluster fuck of an application essay, and now the dean of admissions wants to schedule a phone call with me.",
  "text": "So to start off, this is in California, i\u2019m a high school senior boy (17). This is my senior year so I started applying to colleges, ordinary stuff y\u2019know. Well i applied to all my top schools in the state and i saw that a certain christian/religious school was letting people apply for free. So me being the good little Mexican mormon boy that I am, I started the application, since i heard good things about this school. So I started my application but left a few things unfinished, most notably the section where i needed to submit and essay.  \n\n One day, I was absolutely pissed off by something i don\u2019t remember what, I was just pissed, and in my infinite wisdom and because i didn\u2019t really care all that much about this application, I wrote out the most fouled mouth, shitstorm of an essay my two brain cells could muster. It was the closest thing to a therapy session I have ever experienced. Couple days after that I went back to it and said \u201coh it looks like I did my essay, good job past me\u201d and proceeded to submit it. \nNow the dean of admissions herself has sent me an email asking to schedule a phone call, should I ignore her, and move on, or should I take the phone call? if i ignore her will their be consequences? \n\nTLDR: I submitted a cluster fuck of an essay filled with profanities to a Christian/religious school, Now the dean of admissions herself wants to have a phone call with me, somebody help me please.  \n\nUpdate: I have scheduled a nice leisure chat with the dean next Tuesday\n\nUpdate: I just finished the call with the dean, he somehow despite it all, approves of this essay. In fact he loves it, he simply wants me to rewrite it a little and email it to him, So now heres where i need help, how do i rewrite this cluster fuck?",

Colleges generally do not take kindly to people making a mockery of their application.  They usually just deny them and move on.  But in some cases they may wish to verify things before doing so.\n\nI do not think there will be any fallout from this either way, as long as you are not interested in attending.  You shouldn't have submitted an application just to waste their time and mock them.  That's disrespectful and part of the reason colleges have to charge application fees.  Too many cases like this and this school might stop giving people free applications - and that hurts everyone, including the people who actually might want to go to the school and the school itself (because they can't use free applications as a recruiting/marketing method as freely).\n\nSo probably she will ask you if the essay was legit and if you submitted it.  Then when you say yes, she will explain what I just said.  Then you'll get denied.",

I basically only read the tldr but having said what I\u2019d already said, I imagine it\u2019s either a call for to accept u or just to ask for a bit of clarification for what exactly was going through ur head when u wrote that thing (which u appear to already have prepared), and the latter would only be done if they thought u were a student potentially deserving of an acceptance.  Anyway, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what goes down!  Best of luck!",

I am sure the board is curious about you, so curious that regardless of being rude, they felt the connection to what you wrote. Not sure if you will be accepted, but just be direct with them, own the interview, but be professional this time.",
