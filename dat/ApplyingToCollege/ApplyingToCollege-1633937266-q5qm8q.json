  "text": "(short version) - Do colleges like partial IB? im in 11th grade. I\u2019m 7 weeks in and have the option to switch to full IB, but know it would be very challenging because it\u2019s so late. \nI\u2019m very worried that no colleges will want to accept a partial IB student.\n\n(long version) \nHello anyone who feels like helpin my sorry self out today,\n\nI am doing partial IB\u2026 \n\nfor some reason i had thought that my school would have me take the IB classes, and take the AP exams at the end of the year (why\u2026 i don\u2019t know, i realize that doesn\u2019t make any sense). regardless, that\u2019s what i thought. Had i know that wasn\u2019t the case, i would have done full IB (I\u2019m already taking 5 IB classes, i\u2019m missing a foreign language and TOK, ES, And CAS.)\n\nI have the option to switch, 7 weeks in. it\u2019s very late, and it would be very complicated. should i Switch? Does partial IB look good on college applications?  I\u2019m very stressed about this. I wanted to go to college in the Netherlands, but the schools i\u2019m looking at require either a full IB diploma, or a certain amount of AP classes. I feel like i\u2019m screwed, i\u2019ve never even heard of \u201cpartial IB\u201d, and cant find any useful information on if that will look good on applications.\n\nThank you,\n\nMwah \ud83d\udc8b",

      "text": "ib is ib i would recommend taking full ib for course rigor and considering the class you aren\u2019t taking is a language one if you already have taken one of the languages it won\u2019t really be too much more work. Basically i recommend taking it im a second year ib student and it\u2019s deff a lot of work but i think it\u2019s worth it in the end dm me if you have any questions",
