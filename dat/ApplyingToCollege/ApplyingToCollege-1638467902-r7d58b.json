  "text": "Hey there, I am a 17 year old senior graduating in 2022! I have really wasted all of high school and I put myself in a terrible situation. I never tried on my grades\u2026 I never put effort in. I quit my sports team junior year. I am very smart, I just put in no effort and got by with the minimum. I made my grades SUFFER! I am about to graduate in February and I have met all benchmarks on ACT, but I have a 2.6 GPA. It\u2019s so embarrassing and I am truly ashamed of myself. I became pretty depressed sophomore & junior year and I just barely got by. I feel like scum for having a GPA this low\u2026 it cuts off so many scholarship opportunities I could have had. My family is middle class and I have no scholarships, college is going to put me in serious debt. I really want to go into a nursing program at University of Kentucky\u2026 but I feel like I won\u2019t even be admitted to UK based off of my high school experience. I am so confused on what to do with college. I am so scared of being in HUGE debt. Anyone have advice? (BTW when I graduated in Feb. i\u2019m going to have the \u201cCollege readiness diploma\u201d",
