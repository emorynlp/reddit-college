  "text": "My EFC is very high because of my parents income, because of this I do not qualify for any type of fin aid. My parents are not paying for anything related to college, room/board, etc. \n\nOutside of paying for college on my own (I can\u2019t afford it) what are my options? \n\nWould a gap year be a good decision or is there a way I can talk to an counselor at the college about my predicament?",

      "text": "If need-based aid does not make college affordable, then look for merit scholarships. ***Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves.*** Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college.\n\nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: [https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/](https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/); see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable.\n\nIf you get a full tuition scholarship, it is challenging, but possible, to come up with room and board on your own, unless you earn a lot over the summer, work during the school year, and/or attend a college with a relatively low cost of living. (Federal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow. Larger loans require a parent signature and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow.) Room and board tends to be in the neighborhood of 15k/yr.\n\nAnother alternative would be to start at community college while living at home.",

Once you've been there a year, getting a job as an R.A. (Resident Assistant) can be a good deal; you get free room/board.

Most colleges allow this, but you can\u2019t defer and take classes for credit at a community college or anything like that. \n\nIf you have AP credits, apply to schools that accept them so you can finish school in 3 years.
