  "text": "After doing more research I realized I really REALLY want to go to Northwestern but now my chances feel very skewed because I can only apply RD.\n\nAny advice from people that got into Northwestern through RD? Or anyone with stories getting into competitive schools through RD (for mental support)? \ud83d\ude2d\n\nAlso good luck to the current ED applicants! I heard the decisions are coming out really soon.",

At least that's what the AOs told me at an information session. So, you should definitely try your hardest for the RD round! Good luck with your applications!",
