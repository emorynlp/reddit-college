  "text": "I'm deciding on ED'ing to either one of these schools. I've already written all of their supplemental essays and cost isn't an issue, since I'm first-gen and low-income (QuestBridge).\n\nWhich college would be better or pre-medicine? If I decide to opt out of pre-med, which college will provide me with better job prospects? I know Swarthmore is ranked higher, but is the difference that significant? I prefer the social/academic environment of Haverford, but I prefer the academics/opportunities at Swarthmore. Both are difficult to get into.\n\nI'm thinking of majoring in biology or chemistry.\n\nMy stats are really good and I have strong EC's on the weird side. I was a QB finalist but chose not to match. I also attended both Haverford's and Swarthmore's fly-in programs.\n\nWhich college would you choose, and which college should I choose?\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: added stuff",
