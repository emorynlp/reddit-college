IDOC took around 8-9 days to actually process my parent's tax forms. This won't affect your admittance most of the time but it's something good to probably keep in mind!",

      "text": "Very few colleges have such a requirement - check your colleges' admission websites to make sure you are following all instructions for applying. If your college is one of these few that has an application requirement to do something in the portal and it needs to be done prior to the deadline, applying a week ahead should be more than enough time, if you are trying to be extra careful.\n\nMost colleges have no such requirement, and so for most it is fine to apply on the deadline date, maybe a day ahead is nice in case of app crashing etc.",
