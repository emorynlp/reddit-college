  "text": "Back in September, my teacher asked me if i wanted to provide a few things for him to include in my rec letter and I told him that i wanted to major in Biomedical or Chemical Engineering in college, and he likely put it in my letter.\n\nBUT fast forward to now, I decided that I\u2019m not going to apply for engineering for all of my schools, but i\u2019m still going to do Biomedical science/Chemistry for all.\n\nIs this going to look bad on my non-engineering apps?\nWhat do you guys think an AO would think of it?",
