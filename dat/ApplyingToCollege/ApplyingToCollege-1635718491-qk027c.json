  "text": "Ok, my lack of knowledge about applying to college is laughable I know, but the whole process makes me so mf anxious that I\u2019ve been avoiding doing proper research. \n\nBasically: wtf is up with college interviews. \n\nAre they required? Do you have to apply for one? Do you do it before or after submitting an application? Is it IRL, or over zoom? What kind of questions are even asked\u2026 is it like a job interview? If I don\u2019t do an interview, can I still get into a school?\n\nSorry for all the questions, any help/advice is super appreciated!!",

      "text": "to my knowledge: interviews are optional. you usually have to apply for one (basically just clicking some stuff that says \u201cyes I want to do interview please\u201d). sometimes you won\u2019t get an interview even if you do say you want to do one. can be either irl or zoom, but idk what the situation is now - last year (when I applied to college) they were all virtual, but some have been in person prior to the pandemic. they ask you questions that gauge who you are, your interests, and how you would contribute to the school (stuff like that). if you opt to not do an interview you can still get into college, but I\u2019ve heard that opting to do so shows more interest.\n\nedit: forgot to add, but make sure to check out the wiki info on interviews and search through the subreddit for more interview-based questions",

      "text": "The interviews are often done by an alumnus of the school you applied to who volunteered to do interviews. Schools do it differently, but I know that a lot of them will send you information about interviews after you submit your app. Sometimes they have you sign up for a time slot; other times they will connect you with your interviewer directly. It depends on where you are, since interviews are often conducted by an alumni organization in your area. \n\nThey will ask a lot of basic questions about you. Some will have you fill out a paper with info about your grades, classes, and interests. If you get something like that to fill out, do it for sure. It\u2019s not optional. The interviews are usually pretty casual though. Coffee shops are popular locations. It\u2019s not like a job interview. \n\nAnother very important point is that an interview is a great opportunity to ask questions about the school. You\u2019ll most likely be talking to someone who went there, so you can get an inside perspective of the college\u2019s environment. \n\nInterviews aren\u2019t required, so if you aren\u2019t offered one don\u2019t worry. If you are offered one though, I\u2019d definitely do it anyway.",

      "text": "Look up some colleges that interest you and see if they offer interviews. Some are IRL and some are Zoom. Not all colleges offer interviews. For those that do, it\u2019s very rarely required except for special scholarships or programs. But if a college that interests you offers interviews, it\u2019s a nice thing to do to personalize your application and demonstrate your interest in that college. At the same time, if you don\u2019t do an interview, it won\u2019t affect you negatively. \n\nIf you do any interviews, be able to talk about why you\u2019re interested in that college and what majors and clubs you\u2019d get involved with on their campus. Also, be ready to talk about academic and extracurricular highlights from high school and something you\u2019re proud of and what you\u2019re passionate about.",
