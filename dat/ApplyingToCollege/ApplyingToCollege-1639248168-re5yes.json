  "text": "(not exactly a \"rant\" but closest flair I could find)\n\nI finished sophomore year with a 3.5 uw GPA, 24 on the ACT, and with absolutely zero direction of where I wanted to head after high school. With no ambitions and zero motivation, naturally, I wasted a bunch of time with video games, social media, and reddit. As you may have already guessed, it was also around the end of sophomore year that I discovered this subreddit. With no prior knowledge of the college admissions process, I was instantly hooked. I literally spent hours a day surfing through a2c, chanceme, and college results. At this point, I was obsessed with the thrill of college apps and I was determined to sell my soul for admission to a t20.\n\nFlash forward almost two years later to a week before my ED school releases decisions. I ended up applying with a 3.7 UW gpa (all A's jr year) and 35 on the ACT. I picked up like 3 leadership positions, won a couple of state awards, did bio research at a local uni, and so much more. Reflecting on my high school experience, I genuinely don't know if this sub changed me for the better or worse. I was certainly not unhappy with my lifestyle pre-a2c. I messed around in school, played hours of games with friends, and generally just didn't care too much. Post a2c, I poured hours into studying, stepped way outside of my comfort zone for the sake of my ec's, and I think I developed anxiety. I'm still uncertain if I will even get in anywhere (Asian with 3.7 uw...). Of course I'm grateful for this community and everyone who's helped me along the way. But at the end of the day, I can't help but wonder if would've been better off oblivious to this entire process.\n\nI realized that I may have just typed all of this out for like 15 views and 3 upvotes, but this is something that I've been thinking about a lot lately and it feels good to get it out. It's not something I feel comfortable sharing with friends/family, so naturally I took to strangers on the internet. Thanks for reading.",

      "text": "I feel kind of similar sometimes. I used to care only about the sport I did even though I knew I couldn\u2019t go pro. I just loved it so much I didn\u2019t care about schoolwork. The sport took all of my time, but then senior year, I stopped doing it for various reasons. Now my grades are all A\u2019s, and since I study so much, I\u2019ve turned into one of those people who is upset with an A-. But I miss my sport so much. Sometimes I wonder if I would have been happier continuing it and getting average grades.",
