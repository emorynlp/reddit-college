  "text": "On a lot of the colleges on my Common App, it asks me to \u201clist all contacts you\u2019ve had with X school.\u201d However, most of these schools I know about just from internet research & stuff like that. \n\nIs it bad if you don\u2019t really have anything to list for that? Do they take it into consideration when thinking about whether to accept you? I thought most of these schools didn\u2019t consider demonstrated interest\u2026",
