  "title:": "Can I send additional honor-related info to unis post submission??",
  "text": "Alright so I submitted my EA/ED apps a while ago. And one of my honors was:\n\n* IMO National Round: \\[*countryname*\\] rank X(Opens), rank Y(Finals); honor as finalist\n\nNow there are 2 olympiads offered here: SOF and the ones through which the country selects candidates to represent at IMO. While I did not make it to the national team, I placed in the ones held on behalf of the govt. to select who represents the country. I think it appears ambiguous as to which one I appeared in due to the tight character limit. I forgot to mention this in the additional info section.\n\nCan I just mail the different unis w/my app ID or whatever to let them know? Or do I just let it slide? I'm pretty sure I need to let them know... Is there another way to let them know other than just mailing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny help would be appreciated!\n\nThanks : )",
