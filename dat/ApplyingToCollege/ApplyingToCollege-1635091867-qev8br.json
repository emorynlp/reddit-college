          "text": "Ah alright. Is it better if I publish my book on e-reading platforms like amazon kindle because I think people would be more inclined towards reading that (because it would be free, as opposed to the physical book which would cost money)? Is virtual publishing with more readership less noteworthy than publishing a physical book with less number of readers?",

              "text": "I don\u2019t know, my original comment was mainly just saying that it is not a good idea to publish a book just to say that you published a book. The expectations are different for each version. So 100 purchasers of a physical book is as impressive as 400 readers of an online one since the scalability of online is much higher.",
