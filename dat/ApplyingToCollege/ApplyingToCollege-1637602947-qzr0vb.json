  "text": "Wtf, my parents say getting into a top tier school for undergrad (e.x. Stanford) is far more prestigious than going to a no name undergrad and then top tier school for masters (e.x. Stanford). And ofc I got yelled at for not getting into one during undergrad. Do your parents have similar views?",

              "text": "It's not that such programs *aren't* prestigious. It's that acceptance into them is numerically less impressive than getting into undergrad at the same institution. \n\nUndergrads at HYPSM+ are fighting to be among the 3-5% of students admitted to a class consisting of every intended major that the school offers. Future engineers have to be that much better at engineering to win out against artists, humanities students, and finance folks who are each at the top of their respective game. \n\nDivinity masters' students at Harvard are surely great at what they do. But they only need to be among the [top 50%](https://worldscholarshipforum.com/harvard-acceptance-rate/#:~:text=Harvard%20Graduate%20School%20Acceptance%20Rate,-At%20this%20point&text=The%20Havard%20Divinity%20School%20has,an%20acceptance%20rate%20of%202.7%25) of applicants to a program that already receives far fewer applications than Harvard College. Similarly, the masters program in East Asian Studies at Columbia takes over [20%](https://marsea.weai.columbia.edu/content/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#:~:text=For%20Fall%202021%20Admissions%2C%20the%20acceptance%20rate%20was%2022%25) of applicants. Those odds are more than five times greater than one's chances of getting into Columbia undergrad. \n\nAs someone in law school at Stanford now, I certainly don't think that Ivy+ grad schools *aren't* impressive. However, for the reasons noted above, I would argue that getting into Stanford or its peers for college is a shinier star.",
