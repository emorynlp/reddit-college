  "text": "For the USC question about your \u201ctheme song\u201d I wrote the title and not the artist. Looking back, there\u2019s like 5 songs with this same title and I\u2019ve already submitted. Should I do something about this, like email? I don\u2019t know lol, its a small detail, but the other songs give off a very very different vibe than the one I was referencing.",
