      "text": "Not really because all top schools will have so many applicants with top grades and extracurriculars that they can choose to care about both. I have heard that before they went test blind UCs were pretty stat-based for in state, but that doesn't really matter now. Also there's a statistic from a book somewhere that Duke admits the largest percentage of perfect SAT score applicants out of several top schools. But once again, that's probably changed.",
