I take DE classes there and go to a few clubs there with friends for fun (spikeball and board game). So fun lol. Pretty great school and would recommend to apply to. It\u2019s only like 10k in state and 30k oos which I don\u2019t think is that bad compared to other public schools.",

To be clear, Northeastern is definitely prestigious, but I guess it's not up to the standards of this sub.",
