  "text": "hi, so I am panicking and worried cause I'm about to get my first ever F lol. Anyway, I'm an immigrant and will be the first person in my family to attend college, and because of this, I don't really have any guidance when it comes to the college admission process other than the internet or my counselor. I'm hoping I can get some help here. \n\nSo basically, I've never gotten an F before. I've had good grades, attendance, GPA, and decent extracurriculars in the last 3 years. But ever since we returned to in person teaching after over a year of online instructing, I've been sick a lot. Nothing life-threatening but bad enough I'd have to stay in bed a lot, not to mention our school wanting us to stay home if we're sick in any way. in short, my grades and attendance this year started plummeting and now I'm getting my first F and I'm scared shitless lol. It's calc 3, which is a one-semester college level course run through a university in my state. \n\nI'm mostly worried about my UC schools since they don't want to see any D's or F's. I know I can report this F to UC schools and contact them about the circumstances, but do you guys have any other advice? I'm pretty blind on this situation so it'd be great if I could get some help or just general advice on what I can do, or how this might affect the admission process? \n\nthank you",
