  "text": "Like if you\u2019re joining as a staff member of a magazine created by your classmate or as a secondary helper in your friend\u2019s initiative to help underprivileged students.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this - is this something students should be doing? Should you join another initiative in addition to having your own initiative? Should you just stay away from them?\n\nI feel like it\u2019s getting more and more popular to recruit people to work with you on your initiative so I was wondering what A2C thinks about this",
