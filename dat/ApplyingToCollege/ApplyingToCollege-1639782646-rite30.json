  "text": "Hi all \nI am a student at uc berkeley and Im legit so tired of people saying negative things about my school to the point where I am mentally exhausted. I love the academics at my school but I cannot get past the public perception. I am afraid I won\u2019t have a job because i go here and i read so many negative things on Reddit and online and it worries me that future employers will feel the same as the redditors or articles. I literally don\u2019t know what to do and I have been going to therapy. It is so difficult to constantly hear people shitting on my school, treating it like a safety, etc. Like the public opinion makes me feel like I made the wrong choice and I  cannot get a job because I go here. How do I cope with this and is this school really that bad to the point where I should transfer in order to get better employment prospects",

I have seen many comments here that are simply not true.  If you are concerned about job prospects, talk to career services and seniors about their experiences.",

There is not a single fucking person out there that would not want a cal graduate because they graduated from Berkeley. I\u2019ve literally never seen a person on here shitting on Berkeley (at least outside of joking about it because they got rejected or something) so I have no goddamn idea where you\u2019re seeing this. If people talking shit about your school causes you to literally need therapy you need to delete all social media immediately. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to come off as harsh as I probably sound but please get that fuck off whatever platforms you\u2019re seeing this on because random comments about your school should never effect a person to that extent",
