  "text": "I was planning on ED'ing to CMU before going down a rabbit hole of negative reviews and CMU hate trains. I'm now doubting myself and looking for other schools with more laid back environments and greater emphasis on social life. When I visited my friend it seemed like the culture was more uplifting and they said the workload was manageable (they are a bit of a freak of nature when it comes to schoolwork, however). I got good vibes when I was there and I really like their interdisciplinary programs and Information Systems major. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on what to do? I don't really have any other schools that I fell in love with at all. Alternatively, what other mid-size schools have decently strong computer science with a more laid back environment and stronger social life?",

      "text": "If you're looking for a laid back school, then I would agree - CMU is not the place for you... But if you're looking for an exciting environment that will challenge you regularly to come out of your comfort zone, then CMU would be a great match... As for ED, I wouldn't do it if you're not sure - plus, ED doesn't actually give you much of a boost at CMU, so RD may be a better idea... And if you're not sure about any other school, don't do ED anywhere, but try to EA to a few schools that you like.",

SCS is challenging but really fun and we've had plenty of free time. Professors and TAs have been great. I would recommend to anyone.\nMost say ED has no advantage but I loved not having to fill out any other applications and not having to think about it after December. Good luck whatever you decide.",
