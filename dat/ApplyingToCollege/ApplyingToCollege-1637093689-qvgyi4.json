  "text": "So for one of my extracurriculars, I listed \u201cArt\u201d which is my biggest hobby and I plan to note underneath that I have an art account with around 40k followers. Should I just leave it as a statement or actually give the @ of my account? \n\nI\u2019m sorta in a dilemma since the account is more for fun and doesn\u2019t show my serious work which I submitted in my portfolio (I\u2019m applying to most schools as a design major so I have an art portfolio \u2014 which means they\u2019ll get to see my artistic ability anyway) but I\u2019m like kinda scared they\u2019re not gonna believe it if I just state my following :/ am I even allowed to add an @? Have any of you guys done something like that? Any comments would help!\n\nMore about the art account itself and why I\u2019m hesitant:\n- my art account has some manga drawings on it so idk if that\u2019d be off-putting to see. \n- I deleted a lot of posts so it looks kinda bare\u2026..honestly that might make it seem more unbelievable that I have so many followers\n- it\u2019s a tiktok account\u2026.so it may look like less of an achievement?",

      "text": "one of my friends had a very large tiktok following (her account was also just for fun, nothing serious) and representatives from colleges reached out to *her* to discuss it further, so i definitely think this is something that they see as a valid and interesting use of your time. unless you have something super inappropriate on there that you wouldn't want them to see, link it! it'd likely only help, if anything",

I\u2019m glad to hear your friend\u2019s account was received positively! Maybe I\u2019ll consider putting mine.",
