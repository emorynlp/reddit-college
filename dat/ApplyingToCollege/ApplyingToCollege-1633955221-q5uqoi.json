  "text": "I'm thinking of writing about a natural calamity which me and my family were caught up in 2013,is it a good idea? I'm gonna write about how the destruction that I witnessed motivated me and got me interested in sattelites and imaging technology etc.? \nMany people claimed that writing about death is not a good idea, (i didn't lose anyone from my family) and it can hurt your essay? What are your thoughts?",

      "text": "Yes it can be just fine.  But make sure:\n\n1.  You don't depend too heavily on the calamity to make the essay distinctive or interesting.  It needs to be about YOU, not about disaster.  Remember that the goal is for the reviewer to finish the essay and think \"Oh wow, dabkarlo seems like a really neat kid and a great fit for our community!\" Not, \"Oh wow, natural calamities are terrible, our society should do more to help with those!\"\n\n2.  Don't get caught up in playing the victim or focusing on negatives too much.  As a Wellesley AO once said, \"show them the phoenix, not the ashes.\"  [Here's a post with some tips for discussing tragedy in essays, why it can work, and when it doesn't.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/n413dc/trauma_in_essays_why_it_can_work_and_when_it/)\n\n3.  Remember that 2013 was 8 years ago.  You are a different person now than you were when you were 9.  The reviewers care about the student who will be stepping on to their campus at age 18, not the 9 year old from 2013.  So make sure you show them that.  I read a TON of essays and sometimes I see students focus FAR too much on a view of themselves from elementary school.  While formative and important things can happen at that stage of life, you generally don't want the entire essay focused there.  For example, last year I had a student who wrote all about something that happened to her in 3rd grade.  I went through all of this with her and we expanded it so it was more about how she has grown since, the ways it impacted her current outlook on life, and who she is today.  She was admitted to 8 T20s and currently attends a T5 - but I doubt she would have gotten into any of them with her original essay because it ultimately would have been mostly irrelevant, at least as far as an admissions officer is concerned.  Again, this is not to say you *can't* write about old events or things that happened when you were young - it's just to say that you need something that explains who you are today and shows more of what the college will be getting next fall by admitting you.",
