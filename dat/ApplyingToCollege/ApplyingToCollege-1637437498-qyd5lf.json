I've heard that some people said that volunteering is a waste of time and others say that you need it for t20s. I'm currently dry on good ec's so my mom says just do it.\n\nIs it worth it or should I spend my time on something else?",

      "text": "who the heck is saying volunteering is a waste of time. volunteering was my main EC, with over 1000 volunteer hours. i did it because i was passionate, and wouldn\u2019t have cared if it got me into college, but for your point, i got into every T5. The harvard AO i did an interview with actually had a poster of the org i volunteered with on the wall that i could see during our zoom meeting. T20s want change makers, and helping out your community is a great way to demonstrate your ability to make an impact. These kids deserve someone that is passionate about helping them though, so if you\u2019re only doing it for college it might not be a good idea .",
