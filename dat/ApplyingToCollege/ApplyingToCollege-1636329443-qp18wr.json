  "text": "I only just noticed, long after the early decision and action deadline, that my high school messed up my transcript. I do the IB program, they put a 7 for my economics and 6 for my English (predicted grades), while they should actually be vice versa. What can I do to fix this problem? Will the universities see this as a forge? Thanks.",
