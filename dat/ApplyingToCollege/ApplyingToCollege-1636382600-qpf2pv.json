  "text": "so i've been told 29374563294723945 times that guidance counselors are important and to get to know them throughout highschool but my issue is that i didn't really do that freshman or sophomore year because:\n\ni am very introverted and would rather not talk to adults unless i absolutely have to :-)\n\nmy thoughts are that my gpa and ecs should be enough to stand by themselves, and my guidance counselor knows enough about me to figure that im a tryhard, and that should be good right? maybe im just coping LMAO",

      "text": "It\u2019s time to take a deep breath and make an appointment to stop by and meet your school counselor.  You can send an email or use whatever method they use to set up appointments. It\u2019s nice if they can put a name to a face.  And they are helping you create opportunities for your life so you want them to have some kind of idea who you are and why they should card. \n\nIf nothing else, thing of it as life practice. Getting comfortable with the uncomfortable. Talking to people you really don\u2019t want to will be part of your life from now on \u2014 professors, employers, interviewers. It\u2019s all part of the next stage of life. Starting in a safe space will be helpful for future you. \n\nFirst step. Take a deep breath. Second step. Send an email and ask for a quick meeting to say hi. You can do this!!",

          "text": "THIS, AdmissionsMom strikes the golden truth again...as the advice you received when you began HS was spot on. Most students do not know their CC if they are staying under the radar and staying out of trouble at larger high schools; The College Counselor is expected to be your intermediary, your advocate and your advisor. He/She is in a unique position and you need the assistance. If a college just computes through the stats without any human input, you may or may not be judged fairly. Otherwise, some others have to speak for you from their perspective. And, while you are introducing yourself to your Counselor, please get to know your teachers. Make an appointment (don't squeeze it in between class periods...not fair!) to spend 10-15 minutes sharing your plans, hopes, and generally shooting the breeze. It's hard I know for you, but 99% of your life will be spent on mindless, sweet dialogues",
