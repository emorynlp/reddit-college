  "text": "Ok, so I was accepted to Vandy ED1 and have spent the last few months pulling hard for all my friends to hit their college acceptance goals. \n\nLast night my parents had a business dinner at our house.  My father\u2019s firm does this quarterly, where about 25 employees and their spouses show up to one of the principles\u2019 homes and the company brings in a caterer, etc. This was the first time it was at our place in a few years. \n\nAnyway, while it\u2019s not the field I\u2019d like to go into, my parents encouraged me to socialize during the cocktail hour. I\u2019ve known a bunch of them for years, but now they were all asking where I was going to school, etc. Here\u2019s the thing....These are all extremely successful businesspeople. Advanced in their fields, ranging from about 30-50 yrs old. As they asked me where I was attending, most also shared their alma maters.....\n\nEverywhere. A few Ivy, a few other t20....and then a whole lot of \u201cnormal\u201d quality schools. State schools, \u201cparty\u201d schools, regional schools to where they grew up. At the end my mother and a guy who went to Penn were talking with me and I brought up the fact that the makeup was literally all over the map. He laughed. We all know this inherently, but he reiterated that outside of a very select few industries where you go to school isn\u2019t particularly relevant once you hit the pavement of the real world. He pointed out a woman who went to community college for 2 years, then our state school to finish. Said she was the best negotiator in the company, and had a Stanford and a WashU grad reporting to her. He then made a point that they don\u2019t particularly like to hire \u201celite\u201d school interns. Said over the past decade or so, there has been a lower work ethic from them. He\u2019d rather take the relationship they have with a few regional or state schools, get their best and brightest, and go from there. \n\nSo....for everyone stressing about the prestige of schools you want to get into.....it legitimately doesn\u2019t matter. It was really good for me to see that, because it reminded me that getting into the school I wanted to isn\u2019t the end game. That comes in a few years when I capitalize on what I make of the next four years.",

My husband and I are attorneys, and our T10 law school classes included students from every kind of school: state flagship universities, regional colleges, LACs, community college for two years + university for two years, etc.   While I know most of the attorneys recruited by the large DC firms where we began our careers did recruit primarily from the T10 law schools PLUS the local regional law schools, no one cared or inquired about undergraduate institution.  And our clients \u2014 representing Fortune 100 businesses \u2014 generally went to state schools, like the great majority of college-educated America.",

I was just agreeing with the original author that successful individuals, whatever their fields, are valued for their drive, skill, intellect, and personality, not the name of their undergraduate institution.  Once you get an advanced degree or begin work in the field, undergraduate name becomes as meaningful as your high school credentials.\n\nAlso, be glad some of us don\u2019t find STEM appealing.  The last thing you want in your STEM classes are students who don\u2019t love or aren\u2019t skilled in STEM, but who are there only because they\u2019ve been told that\u2019s the way to get a job.  So many of my sons\u2019 peers are studying STEM and are miserable because they don\u2019t actually have any affinity for it.  But students who do have my absolute respect.  \n\n Good luck to you!!",

They sold their house and used the equity to pay off his loans. They then moved in with him where they still live today. This is a 100% true story.

It will also give you more resources, as super elites have a tendency to have way more resources for students and faculty for anywhere else(like at MIT its way easier to do research, especially influential research, because there are way more of those projects at MIT) Do you seriously think that it doesn\u2019t make a difference to be taught psychology by Steven Pinker?",

Your GPA represents how hard you worked over high school and to have to go to school with people who slacked off is almost infuriating. Then you wish you had fun and partied over your high-school career because you could have gone to the exact same college. Now you could just say, well if you are at this state school with people you call lazy, then it should be easy to go to a good grad school, if you want prestige. But not everyone goes to grad-school and even then it means your high-school grades mean nothing. The investment (your high grades) is almost thrown away.

Nobody should define their self-worth based on the college they attend but regardless of what your stance on this issue is, I'm sure you'll agree with me that an acceptance from a college like MIT or Stanford is indicative of an exceptional application; while an acceptance from a 'safety' school or a low ranked school *may* be that of an exceptional applicant but it could also be that of a mediocre applicant.\n\nAt the end of the day, getting into a top school is a qualification and validation of the work one has put in over their high school life, which is not to say one from a lower ranked school isn't; just that it's to a lesser degree.",
