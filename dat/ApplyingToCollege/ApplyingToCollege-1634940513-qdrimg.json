  "text": "I\u2019m taking AP Physics C and AP Statistics and I\u2019m not doing too hot in either of them right now. I have an 85 in stats and an 80 in physics, though my teacher said she\u2019s willing to give me extra credit to get me up to a B. \n\nI have As in all my other classes (AP Psych, French, Orchestra, Health).\n\nShould I still apply EA? I really want to and I have all my supplemental s and applications ready, but I\u2019m really worried about these two grades.\n\nFor reference I have a 4.45 GPA, so I usually get As, so I\u2019m really worried about these grades as I don\u2019t have time to make a comeback if I apply EA, and I really want to apply EA.\n\nMy top choice is UMASS Amherst as it\u2019s close to home, cheap and has a good CS program (I\u2019m majoring in CS).\n\nMy GPA for November 1st will be a 4.2, whereas my usual is a 4.4. I\u2019m worried about the trends this will show, am I screwed?",

My counselor said my school will send grades on November 5th, but UMASS requires a mid-year report as well. \n\nUMASS is a safety generally, but I\u2019ve heard for CS it\u2019s a bit more selective which is why I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s a target, so I\u2019m a bit worried about that. My GPA is going to go down to a 4.40 overall after November 1st so I\u2019m really worried about that.",

(Sorry my school doesn't do weighted I have no idea how to convert) \n\nThat's unfortunate and almost seems unfair that they'll see the B's, I was under the impression from other posts on A2C anyone who applied EA/ED got by easy on the grading aspect for the start of school because most schools would just provide a list of the courses you're taking on your transcript, not the grades until the mid-year/semester report. :( However, AP Physics is a notoriously hard course, and it's understandable, same with Stats. People apply to Top20s with B's on their transcript and get accepted because their overall GPA is good and the courses they took were vigorous. I think you should go for it unless you really do feel applying RD and maybe a boost in your GPA would make a significant difference in the quality of your app!",
