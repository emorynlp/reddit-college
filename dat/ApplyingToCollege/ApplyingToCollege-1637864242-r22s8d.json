      "text": "Yes, they often are.  This is one reason why I recommend going outside of your school and joining organizations for adults in your community.  Instead of existing to pad resumes or soak up two hours of student's time each week, they actually have a mission, vision, and purpose.  And they'll probably welcome you with open arms, mentor you, and give you an amazing launch pad for impact, investment, commitment, and engagement - all things that AOs care about WAY more than titles or positions in clubs.\n\nAs an example, when I was in high school, I joined the local chapter of the International Brotherhood of Magicians.  There were like four old guys in that club who took me under their wing, taught me some insane stuff, and helped me launch a business doing magic shows for parties and events.  One of those guys even gave me a giant box of his old magic stuff that he didn't use anymore - seriously like $1000 worth of gear.  He then went through the box with me to teach me all the tricks.  I was able to make more from magic shows in half an hour than I made from an entire week of work at my minimum wage job and I was able to scale back my hours immensely because of it. \n For the impact on my college applications:\n\n1.  It gave me way more time for school and my other activities since I wasn't working as much anymore.\n\n2.  It gave me a really cool and distinctive EC.  I did some charity/volunteer shows as well as paid ones.  I also did magic tricks in about 80% of my college & scholarship interviews.\n\n3.  One of my friends knew a newspaper reporter and she wrote an article about me, which helped legitimize and massively grow my business.  This also led to me winning a major award from one of Gannett's largest US newspapers and a ~$1500 scholarship from my local newspaper.\n\nThe point isn't that I was somehow awesome - literally any A2Cer could have done this exact same thing with the mentorship, direction, help, and support I received.  I have tons more examples of this over the years with my students.  It's one of my biggest \"trade secrets\" and if you're young, energetic, humble, and kind it will probably work wonders for you too.",

But I strongly agree about adults' organisations. If you've picked the right place, courses/clubs/[other informal stuff] can be a lot more no-BS, and genuinely fun. While I was the one responsible for having/creating a techy interest, I owe it to a handful of companies (who were kind enough to offer me support typically reserved for employees and customers) for many of the skills, tools, and close friends I have today.",

      "text": "I think this kind of thing carries into College as well.  The best clubs are meaningful whether or not you are the leader of the club.  Contribution is more important than leadership.  You can be a great contributor without being a leader and hopefully you can convey that when you apply to college. Also, there are other pursuits that are more meaningful IMO than clubs. I believe having a job, even if it is babysitting or working as a cashier in an ice cream parlor etc. is a better experience than President of the disadvantaged group that codes club that meets once a week, to appoint leadership and assign projects that are hardly ever completed.  Don't worry about it, find more meaningful things to do.  Volunteer at the YMCA or hospital, tutor junior high kids...",

Not because extracurriculars don\u2019t matter - but because it renders ECs and Clubs into checkboxes for colleges. ECs are no longer a platform to actually do something you\u2019re passionate about, and have fun, and learn, because people are more obsessed with how it can be milked for college. \n\nIn my (international) school, we have a mix of people applying all over the world. I\u2019ve observed that people intending to study in UK/EU/Australia may take on fewer or less \u201cimpressive\u201d ECs than US applicants, but do each to a much higher standard and with much greater commitment. \n\nI feel especially bad for the people who are actually passionate about the club and are surrounded by people who don\u2019t give 2 shits about the activity beyond how it\u2019ll help them in college applications. I guess this is the reality of life tho. For everyone who gives a shit, there\u2019ll be 10 others who don\u2019t.",
