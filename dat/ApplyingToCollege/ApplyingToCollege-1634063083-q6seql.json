      "text": "Prepositions phrases are often a modifier. E.g. school of medicine = medical school.  I would like to go to the school of medicine because... = I want to attend medical school because...  \n\n\nPassive verb phrase. E.g. The grades I got were poor because I didn't study. = I didn't study and received poor grades.  \n\n\nHigh school students and most non-professional writers construct wordy sentences. Wasn't something I was taught till my master's in journalism.   \n\n\nI could take a quick look. Most of the time I can cut 1000 words to 650 and students don't understand what was cut out. It's like a disappearing magic trick, lol.",
