      "text": "Given you're international I guess a 3.8 GPA is very high since intls rarely have the same grade inflation as  US schools.\n\nHaving few ECs is essentially problematic, but unless you come from an underrepresented third world country with a rather disadvantaged background (for whatever reason), chances are low.\n\nI come from a third world country with a bit of representation. I know someone in the same school as me with a low 1400 get into an Ivy full ride. ECs are decent, academics pretty well (top 10%) considering they're in the top HS in the country. The deal breaker? An immaculate essay.",
