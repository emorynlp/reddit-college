  "text": "I\u2019m a hs junior and wanna study Comp sci at Berkeley, but heard it\u2019s super competitive. What can I do to raise my chances?\nI have a 3.7 UW and 4.3 W GPA. I\u2019m president of a lot of STEM clubs, have done a lot of volunteer work, done a lot of STEM projects, and have done a summer internship. This is just an oversimplified version of all my ECs though. I\u2019ve also taken 7 AP Classes and part of distinguished scholars. Any advice to increase my chances of getting into a top CS school?",

      "text": "There is a way to get into EECS indirectly via school of engineering (I.e. you get admitted as bioengineering, mechE, etc, you take specific courses for 2 semesters and then petition to switch; you have to achieve a certain GPA) but it\u2019s still risky in that you\u2019re not guaranteed anything. If you want EECS, directly apply to it, otherwise nothing is guaranteed. Engineering alone is very competitive as a fair warning\n\nGet good grades and do passion projects, the CS department loves personal projects where you put your skills to use! There\u2019s no single thing however that guarantees you\u2019ll get in\n\n(source: am Berkeley engineering student)",
