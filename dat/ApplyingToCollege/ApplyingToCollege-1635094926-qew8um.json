      "text": "As long as the CSS profile is in by the school's financial aid priority date it's fine -  that is often later than than the early application deadlines.\n\nFor the FAFSA - if you are looking at in-state schools and are in the kind of financial position where you would qualify for need based grants directly from your state government, earlier can be better.  Other than that, it's like the CSS profile - just be in by the school's financial aid priority date.",

      "text": "The majority of the FAFSA is demographic and parent info, your parents can do that for you to take a load off.  If they use the IRS data retrieval it goes pretty quick.\n\nMy 17yo and I did it yesterday and it was 10 minutes?  Most of that time was her setting up her FSA account and entering college codes.\n\nCSS is even heavier on the parent info, so start it, give them the save key and let them enter your college codes and then start the financial inquisition it's going to put them through.  \n\nAlso, check your dates.  11/1 is the app deadline for my 17yo's ED school but she has another 3 weeks for FAFSA and CSS.",

Though I don\u2019t recommend waiting until 11:58p.\n\nThe FAFSA took me about 20 minutes.\n\nIt might also be a good job to offload to a parent\u2026",
