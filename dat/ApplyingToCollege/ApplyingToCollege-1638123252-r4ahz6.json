Bruni's is different; its main thesis is that people put too much stock in \"prestige\" and success is more a factor of the student than the name on the diploma. \n\nMartin's is different yet again.  He mixes in a ton of autobiographical info and his philosophy on life and work.  It's less polished than the other two, but it's also very frank, and directly confronts some of the views and characters you'll find on A2C.  (Which should not be surprising since he was a mod.)\n\nThe bibliography if you get time:\n\n\"Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be: An Antidote to the College Admissions Mania\", Frank Bruni\n\n\"Who Gets In and Why: A Year Inside College Admissions\", Jeffrey J. Selingo\n\n\"Surviving the College Admissions Madness\", Kevin Robert Martin\n\n\"The Price You Pay for College: An Entirely New Road Map for the Biggest Financial Decision Your Family Will Ever Make\", Ron Lieber",
