      "text": "I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re an international but considered in-state for Texas? The difference doesn\u2019t matter for most private colleges like Baylor or Rice because private colleges usually do not consider state residency for tuition or admissions, so there\u2019s no distinction between in-state vs OOS tuition or UT Austin\u2019s in-state quota. That said, you might want to email some private colleges or check their CDS to see if they care about residency for some things, such as scholarships, that you could be eligible for.",
