      "text": "My spouse attended Harvard.  While he loved Boston and felt fine about Harvard, he wasn\u2019t even remotely interested in encouraging our two eldest to apply there even though they were solid applicants.  They wanted to be close to home and enjoy big-time D1 sports, and since grad/law school is likely for both, it made more sense to attend a less expensive undergraduate university and save money for grad school.  My guys are about to graduate from a public Ivy, have excellent jobs/grad school admissions in hand, and while my husband has several sweatshirts for their public Ivy, he doesn\u2019t own a stitch of clothing with the Harvard name. Harvard is a fine school, but one can have a terrific college experience at numerous other private universities, LACs, state flagship universities,and international colleges.  Very best of luck to you!",
