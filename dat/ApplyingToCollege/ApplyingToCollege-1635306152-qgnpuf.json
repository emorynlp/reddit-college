  "text": "I\u2019m a little freaked out because I don\u2019t have my common app essay done. I\u2019ve literally written like a draft a day for the past week but all of them just didn\u2019t feel right, so I kinda scrapped everything I had. Now I just came up with a new idea and I\u2019m so excited for it except I\u2019m really scared to start writing it because I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll turn out bad like the others. I\u2019ve been sitting here staring at this one sentence for an hour. Can anyone give me some advice on how to get over this ;-;",
