  "title:": "Why does my Common Application PDF says \"There are no test scores to report\" for CU Boulder?",
  "text": "Hey all, I just submitted my application for CU Boulder and as I was reviewing the PDF of my application I noticed it said \"There are no test scores to report\" in the testing section. I know CU Boulder is test optional, but I self-reported my scores and indicated that I wanted them considered anyways (it also said my application would not be considered until scores were received, which made me nervous). I was wondering if they require *official* score reports only, until I saw this on the CU Boulder admission FAQS:\n\n> If you would like to have them considered, you should indicate this on your Common Application. To submit scores, you can self-report in the application, upload an unofficial score report to your application status page, **or** submit an official score report to CU Boulder. \n\nI'm stumped as to why it says I have no scores to report, although I did. I even sent an official report through CollegeBoard. Is anyone familiar with this problem? Thanks for any help :)",
