  "text": "Seriously, there's still plenty of time to apply. I keep seeing posts about people saying they're not getting anywhere because they only applied to super elite schools and didn't get into any. There are other colleges, you know. \n\nApply to safe colleges, if you still really want to go to the one you got rejected from, go to the safe college and get really good grades, reapply, and transfer. The only way that you can be a failure after getting rejected from all of your choices is if you choose to literally not do anything else. \n\nAs long as you get a degree, people really don't care where it came from as long as it wasn't a trash college. Also, just because it isn't ivy league doesn't mean it's trash. There are plenty of schools that are better and have better outcomes and aren't ivy league, ivy leagues are essentially the brand names of colleges. It's the same thing, packaged differently, and harder to get.\n\nEdit: excluding the jobs that require an ivy league degree (stuff like Wall Street), most jobs won't not hire you because you didn't get an ivy league degree. \n\nMoral of the story: if you got rejected from all of your colleges, life isn't \"over\", apply to a school you CAN get into and either get your degree there or transfer. Transferring is hard and unlikely, but it's not possible at all if you don't try. Even if you don't get in, you'll still get a degree.",

          "text": "I would be careful about this. Some colleges are leery of folks like this, especially very rigorous colleges - a year off from school and then coming back into a rigorous curriculum can be quite a shock. And there will always be another big crop of students coming along the next year. A gap year might make you stand out if you really make something of it, but it's not guaranteed that that'll work. And for me at least, I'd think it would feel worse to get denied a second time *after* having taken a whole year off for the purpose of reapplying than just working through the emotional hurt, applying RD, and moving on.  \n   \nI'm not saying I'm anti-gap year, per se, but \"I want to reapply to X college\" is not a great reason to take one.   \n\nAnd as a transfer admission counselor (one of my hats, I do first year as well) I must say that the most compelling students are ones that have gone somewhere else, kicked butt there, and then come to us with a record that says \"I made the most of XYZ institution, and now I'm coming to you, Preferred institution, with a great track record of academic achievement, community participation, and evidence that I'll do the same at your school.\" After all, the best evidence of someone being successful in college is...being successful in college.  \n  \nYou can get a really excellent education at a lot of schools outside the band recognized as \"\"elite\"\" (perhaps better in some ways, considering the class sizes and whether you're actually being taught by faculty vs grad students) if you're willing to embrace the experience and make the most of the resources available.",

                          "text": "There\u2019s a pretty shocking amount of stuff you can do for a gap year that looks good on an application and doesn\u2019t cost a ludicrous amount of money. I paid for my own gap year so I\u2019m pretty familiar with it and I\u2019ve been thinking about making a post but I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be applicable to many people in the sub :P\n\nFor one, your job itself can be the shiny new addition to your application. I almost did CityYear, which has a ton of partnerships with some fairly prestigious universities (albeit mostly with their grad schools\u2014think Claremont, American University, Brown, Colombia, Cornell....) to get its alumni scholarships and, from what I\u2019m aware, it looks really solid on an application.\n\nWhat I ended up doing was quite a bit more expensive, but still was an extremely cheap way to travel and survive for a year. I did WorkAway in South America and, in exchange for volunteer work, I would receive room and board. I guess it may not be Ivy-tier (although it did _significantly_ boost my application, based on how much better I did my second application cycle) but it was an awesome experience and, depending on what jobs you take on, it probably won\u2019t hurt you. Plus, it cost me like $5k, total, to survive for an entire year.\n\nAlso, I think you\u2019re a little off on how much time you\u2019d need for activities. For one, high school takes up a pretty surprising amount of time, more than some full-time jobs I\u2019ve had, especially if you\u2019re a student shooting for an Ivy League and taking all the most difficult classes. Entry-level jobs (like waiting tables) often take up roughly the same amount of time as a school day, but they don\u2019t expect you to take work home like is the norm in high school. Working full-time or nearly full-time in a crappy, low-level job and taking on a research position would very likely be easier than doing the same research position while in high school. I say this as someone who\u2019s done the same activities during my school year in high school and over the summer, while working a full-time job.",

My parents are constantly trying to control my life and a part of that includes what college i get to go to and what my career would be. They wanted me to do forensics and when I told them that I really wasn't interested in it and wanted to do computer science they lashed out at me. Arguing that I shouldn't even study anymore if that was the case. It was horrible, I'm not really allowed to have much of a choice in my life...which is why I'm planning to leave before college starts in august and I'm going to apply to schools without them knowing (I'll apply to the one they want to get them off my back, but I'm not going there) so yeah...I agree with you.",

While I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s strictly true, it\u2019s better than the alternative.

Acceptance rates even vary greatly from year to year - a top school may switch from a 6% acceptance rate to a 15% rate the next year, and then down to 0% the year after that because they cant take any transfers for the year. It can be terribly unpredictable. I didn\u2019t realize it until after the fact, but I was very lucky with the way my transfer experience turned out. There\u2019s no harm in trying, but don\u2019t believe anyone who says that transferring is easy.\n\nApply to safeties, everyone!",

Then, another ~10% or so have significantly *higher* acceptance rates for transfers (just eyeballing it). The rest are about equivalent. Still, even an equivalent rate does not represent equality of difficulty to get into. Many colleges prioritize in-state CC transfers over out of state transfers, so it may be easier or harder depending on your situation.\n\nHowever, looking at only one year\u2019s transfer acceptance rate is misleading. Most colleges heavily prioritize freshman admissions over transfer admissions, so the amount of transfers they let in varies greatly with how much room they have. If you want to know how difficult a school may be to transfer into, I would strongly recommend looking at every transfer class\u2019s stats for the past 5-10 years.",

      "text": "Usually top 100 National Universities/ LACs are enough to get you the job that you want. If you do a little research, you\u2019ll see that people from these colleges enter Wall Street, top grad schools, Silicon Valley EVERY year. I stress the word \u201cevery year\u201d in case some of you may think that these schools\u2019 graduates only got the job for some years. Even schools outside top 100 can have students like this. I met of a lot of them. Recently, I even talked a Sewanee: The University of the South grad who got Knight-Hennessy Scholarship from Stanford. (Google past Knight-Henessy Scholars in case you want some verifications). Of course, you should not treat Top 100 colleges as safeties, but do apply to a lot of them in a serious manner. That means writing thoughtful essays and applying by the deadline in order to increase your chance of actually getting into a college. The college which you go to does matter somewhat, in terms of the resources available for you. Otherwise, it depends much more on how you utilize your resources and network to leverage your chance in the career/grad school market. Statistically, more people from top schools are represented at top companies, but that is because top schools have more outstanding cohorts of students than the rest. Yet, that never means that if you attend a non-T20, your chance will be doomed. If you are an excellent student after 4 years, you can get into nearly everywhere. \n\nI discourage against the notion of transferring. Transferring to top schools is more challenging like it actually is. Harvard and Stanford have 1% Acceptance Rate for transfer. Other Ivies have below 4% for transfer. You can try, but do not concentrate 100% on it in your college, as other things matter more. ALSO, KEEP IN MIND THAT MOST OF THE TIME, THE MAJORITY OF US ARE NOT AS SPECIAL AS WE USUALLY THINK OF OURSELVES. Everyone of us, including me, would love to think that we are 1 out of a million, but that simply is not true. Yes, many of you are high-achieving students, but not the really best ones (You know it right?). Compared to most of your peers from your school, you are creams of the crop, but you are not big fishes in the sea. There will always be someone who is much better than you out there. These facts are very brutal, but it is true. A lot of you, just like me, don\u2019t like them, but that is how life is. Therefore, BE HUMBLE AND VALUE WHAT IS GIVEN TO YOU. If you do not get into the school(s) of your choice, work on yourself and your profile to make you as competitive as possible after 4 years. If you already got or will get into the colleges/universities of your choice, congratulations ! Keep on the great work, but remember to be humble. If you do not get into the colleges of your choice, utilize what is given to you as much as possible, make friends, go out of your way to find opportunities, and turn everything into your favor by the time you are a senior.",

If you go to a place like that and seek out the right classes, clubs and jobs, you can certainly get roughly the kind of experience you'd get at a big, selective school like Northwestern.\n\nLast spring, various publications published long lists of schools that still had slots to fill. Some had already used up their financial aid, but some of the schools said they still had financial aid available.\n\nSo, one strategy might be to apply to a place Arizona State or Iowa State as a safety, or to just apply to a school like that if you see you've been shut out of your dream schools.",

Here in FL, with an AA from any state college (of which they're are many) you're guaranteed admission to at least ONE of the universities in the state system, depending on how qualified you are as a student you could either get into UF (highest ranked school in the state) or into one of the lowest tier universities. It all depends, but my community college (College of Central Florida) where I'm dual enrolled sends hundreds of students to UF annually and we're a lower tier college.

      "text": "I\u2019ll just say it- People in these comments are why so many say A2C is a toxic environment. There are thousands of colleges in the US, you can\u2019t cut off what decent schools are at top 20 or top 50 or top 100. There are so many amazing schools out there that aren\u2019t in the highest rankings. Also, it shouldn\u2019t matter while applying to colleges what the best schools overall are, what about the schools that have the best program for your major? Personally I\u2019m going for a very common major, and most T100s don\u2019t even have a program for it. Imputing your major changes things drastically. Personally, in my state when you look at what the top schools are for my major, one of the top 5 is a community college. I wouldn\u2019t want to go there anyway, but all colleges, even if you might not expect it to be a good school overall, can have amazing programs for your major. Stop acting like college is only worth it if you go to a name brand school \u2014 most people don\u2019t, and most people also do just fine. And personally, I think this attitude is very pretentious, and it\u2019s so rude to everyone who (voluntary or involuntary) isn\u2019t going to a T100 school. \n\nHigher education is such an important thing. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re at Harvard, your local community college, or somewhere in between. You should be proud to go for your degree. As long as you\u2019re going somewhere that has a decent program, and most importantly, a program that you like and will be happy at, rankings shouldn\u2019t matter. And in reality, a lot of students come out of lesser known schools and do so much better than they would have at a T20 school. Going to a competitive school does give you a bit of an edge with jobs, but other schools also offer their own kind of competitive edge. The list of decent colleges doesn\u2019t begin and end with whatever has the highest rankings. In the end, you have to make your own list looking at schools with good programs for your specific major, and figure out where you will thrive. And no one wants to admit it, but some people just aren\u2019t meant to go to an Ivy League, and that\u2019s not where they would do best. Some people will flounder under pressure, or be too overwhelmed to take advantage of their school\u2019s opportunities, or a billion other things that might actually make going to a lesser known college better for them than an Ivy League. Your life isn\u2019t over for not going to a top tier school, and it might actually be a better thing for you in the end. \n\nThis attitude so many people have on A2C that other colleges are trash and there\u2019s no benefits to them compared to T20s is not only pretentious, but it\u2019s also very plainly incorrect. That name brand edge might help you in the future, but there\u2019s also a lot of other things different schools offer than can help you as well. And again, being a top school doesn\u2019t even mean it has the best program for your major. Just because a school might not be a place that everyone in the world knows about as soon as you mention it doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be a well known and respected school in your field. And hell, even if it isn\u2019t, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t go there and thrive and do well, and then in the future, stand out more to potential employers than the kid who went to Harvard and got an okay GPA and was too stressed out in college to do any internships, research, etc. \n\nStop acting like top tier schools are the only decent schools. That\u2019s completely untrue, and it\u2019s also a very unpleasant attitude to have.",

The only thing that attending Harvard tells us is that some admissions officers 4 years ago thought you were a good bet based on your high school work. Maybe they were right and maybe they were wrong, but either way you are no longer the kid you were in high school. \n\nApplicants are evaluated based on what they accomplished in college and how well they can present it and themselves. When reviewing CVs I might think \u201coh, good school\u201d - that does go in the plus column - then continue on. Some of my best hires came out of schools I wasn\u2019t familiar with and whose rankings I wouldn\u2019t bother to guess. The superstar of my PhD program came out of a public university in a state nobody ever talks about.\n\nThe advantage the elite schools provide is networking opportunities. Those are very important in some professions, not at all in others, and probably a small advantage in most. But at most they help you get the interview, not the job. That\u2019s not nothing, but maybe your fraternity will end up being a better source of networking opportunities. You only need one first job, so any contact that helps you land it is equally valuable.",
