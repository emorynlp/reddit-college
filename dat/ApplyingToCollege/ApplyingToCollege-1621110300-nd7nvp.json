People keep on caring too much about just prestige overall. I think that prestige overall is a nice bonus, but if you're graduating from Yale in CS it won't have nearly as big of a impact as graduating from UC Berkeley in CS despite Yale being more prestigious overall.",

Currently making ~380k with 5 YoE\n\nYou're school choice is completely irrelevant once you get an email back from a recruiter. After that is _all_ leetcode\n\nUnless you want to start a company, going to UC Berkley, Yale, or any Ivy is a complete waste of money\n\nEdit: I'm a Google L5.

Nice heard they did pretty decent in football this year. Anywayssss need this emailed to me by Friday and we getting sushi or taco bell for lunch?\". In my experience working in industry(im a data analyst), those that tie their whole personality and existence to the school they attended are some of the most annoying and hated people among their coworkers.

                              "text": "Music not so hot at Berkeley so I\u2019d agree. Education, I actually minored in it at Berkeley and have opinions. And my opinion centers around the fact that schools like Berkeley, Northwestern, UCLA and Harvard don\u2019t actually teach how to teach but are overwhelmingly studying pedagogy. So if you want to be a teacher, go to schools like SFSU.  I\u2019ve known enough people who got their Masters or EdD degrees from Berkeley and Harvard that I know northwestern is not on the national conversation.  Not that that\u2019s a bad thing since SFSU isn\u2019t but is in so many ways a better school for education. \n\nFor business, I don\u2019t know. I think I\u2019m a bit biased since I know too many well placed business people who went to Berkeley because i went there and not northwestern. My sibling went to Cal for undergrad business, went into investment banking, Harvard mba and is making bank as upper management at big companies. As someone who hires and fires, sibling has said people who come from private schools (most likely Stanford) drop out faster because they\u2019re used to being coddled. Anecdotal and clearly opinion. So I dunno. But in my mind, for business, I think  Northwestern equates to USC in the midwest. Alumni are tight and can get you a job. Not a bad thing but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m sheer numbers that they\u2019re more or less able to get into financial jobs because east coast will still look down on them. \n\nBut I hear you when it comes to picking a school that is more caring and less of a big corporate farm than Berkeley. But I thought the conversation was more about reputation and whether a school is considered better overall.  I still haven\u2019t been convinced that Northwestern is equal to or better than Berkeley overall. Now I\u2019m remembering dorm life and the drug-dealing chick on my floor being prom Queen at her Chicago high school. She was a nice person. I like Chicago (not in winter).",
