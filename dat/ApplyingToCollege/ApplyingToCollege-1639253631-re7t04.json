  "text": "I got rejected from my ED college today and I've never felt so heartbroken. I feel like a complete failure and I keep seeing people talking about how they got accepted and it's so crushing. I know it isn't the end of the world and that there are better opportunities out there, but I worked super hard for this college and it sucks to know that all the work I did was a waste. I have finals starting Monday and I can't even bring myself to study I'm just so incredibly upset and disappointed.",

Right now, it's so difficult to think: \"oh, hey, this is for the best!\" It doesn't feel like it is. So I think I'll try to tell you a little story.\n\nThere's this girl a few years older than me. She got rejected from almost every college except for 2 colleges that weren't even close to being her top choice. She was so upset. But she committed to one. She went. Today, she works at one of the top companies in her desired field of study in one of the most prestigious internships out there.\n\nIf you're asking how to cope, in my perspective, you can't. I haven't experienced that type of rejection yet (though I'm sure I will in a week), but I don't know if it's possible. But give it time. You need to let it hurt\u2013nothing you do is going to make the pain go away. Just have a little faith that in time, things are going to work.\n\nI'm sorry that you're experiencing this. I'm sorry that you got rejected. Best of luck in the RD round, I'm truly rooting for you.",

The fact that you had some level of confidence or hope in being accepted mean you are likely a deserving student and they would have been lucky to have you.",
