Obviously I know there are better schools for CS/Eng out there but I wanted to apply to at least some Ivys lol\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated. Also if you\u2019re reading this good luck I hope December 15th will be a great day for you :D",

Columbia is a great option too, but it doesn\u2019t have the same strengths that H and P do and I don\u2019t think Columbia is quite as good of a college experience.",
