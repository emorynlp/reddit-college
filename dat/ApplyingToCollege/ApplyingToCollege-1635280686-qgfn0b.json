  "text": "I only know one other person who applied to this school, and it doesn't seem to have much of a presence online either. Why not? It is ranked very high in most rankings and it is not too expensive, so why isn't it more well known? I know that it is small and exclusive and is known to be very challenging, but are there any other bad things? I am considering applying ED to Cooper, so I am curious to know if there are any other factors I should be wary of.\n\nThanks",
