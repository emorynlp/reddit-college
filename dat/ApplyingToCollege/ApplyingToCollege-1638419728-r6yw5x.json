  "text": "So, I was submitting my UC app and the credit card payment screen glitched out, so I wasn't able to pay for the application.  I ended up just submitting my application, hoping to pay in a few days as advised by the application status page.  I really hope it doesn't hurt my application because it's going to be after the deadline. \n\nDid this also happen to anyone else??",
