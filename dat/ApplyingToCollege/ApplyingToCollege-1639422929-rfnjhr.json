I'm pretty sure just like in the states, they dont care where your from, they just care about your \"story\", goals, and the amount of determination and drive you have.....  I think grades and extracurriculars probably count more for international students as well.\nBut I doubt they will judge you for where you are from, if anything it will help...",

Basically all of trumps bullshit has been reversed or is.\n\nPlus: just for context. It was a compound situation.  Trump was using the excuse of the pandemic to deny people entry. But it was honestly less because of the pandemic,  and more  because of his personal discriminations.  But it was under the guise of pandemic safely. Now that he's gone and the pandemic is basically over. You definitely wont have the same issue.",
