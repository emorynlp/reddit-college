  "text": "I made two riddles that point to an university in the US as a game I played with my friend. Here they are:\n\nDownstream from the valley of beginnings, lies a crown jewel, and a gateway to a new world.\n\nOf all the great hurdles from Columbus to the Channel Islands, we are the greatest. As the vanguard of the new age, we are seekers of freedom, and pursuers of truth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHint: I'm a stem student, and I have above average grades and ecs, so consider T50 and above\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnswer:\n\n>! Its washU!<\n\n>!\\- The valley of beginnings refers to the the Mississipi!<\n\n>!\\- The crown jewel refers to the best school in the region, which in this case, is st louis!<\n\n>!\\- Gateway to a new world is a hint to the location of st louis, as it's known as \"Gateway to the West\", and has \"independent frontier-town roots\" (google)!<\n\n>!\\- If you were to draw a line from columbus to the channel island, st louis, and hence washu would be on it. Great hurdle is literal; it is a reference to the gateway arch in st louis, since it is literally the largest arch, or \"Hurdle\" shaped structure in the world. So this is another hint towards st louis!<\n\n>!\\- Vanguard of the new age means research university!<\n\n>!\\- seeker of freedom, persuer of truth is a false lead, since it hints to Caltech's motto, which is \"The truth shall make you free\"; this line technically applies to any research university.!<\n\n>!You you guessed Caltech, then it meant I succeeded in deciving you, the riddles were designed with misdirection in mind. Valley could be interpreted as sillicon valley, and downstream as southwards.!<\n\n>!\\- Caltech is also on the line in between columbus and channel islands!<\n\n>!\\- Greatest hurdle could be misinterpreted as low acceptance rate, as in caltech is a great hurdle to get in.!<",
