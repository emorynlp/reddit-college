  "text": "I\u2019m transferring to a university as a community college student. I\u2019m putting my classes in the common app but my SLS First Year Seminar isn\u2019t on there and it\u2019s required for me to put the type of class. I thought of maybe putting \u201ccounseling\u201d but SLS has nothing to do with that, it\u2019s just an advisement course for first year students. Does anyone who has done this common app process as a transfer and had the class know what to do?",
