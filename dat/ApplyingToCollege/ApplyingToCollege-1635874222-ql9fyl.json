  "text": "I submitted my UMich EA application on 11/1, my school uses Naviance and submitted my supporting materials in October. But today I found that the common app shows that my materials were downloaded today 11/2. I didn't know there is a delay in that. UMich says in order to be eligible for EA, they must receive everything by 11/1. Will I still be eligible for UMich EA?",
