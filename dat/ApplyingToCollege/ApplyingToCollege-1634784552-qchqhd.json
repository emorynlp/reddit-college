  "text": "I thought all colleges allowed self reporting for the SAT but turns out they don't and I now have three colleges with a November 1st deadline that need official score report sends. Is it too late to send scores now? Is it even worth it to send in the scores or should I apply test optional ? My score is way higher than the 75th percentile for two of them and 50 away from the 75th percentile for the other which is my top choice. I was really counting on these scores but idk if it's even possible or worth the $31 rush shipping fee.",
