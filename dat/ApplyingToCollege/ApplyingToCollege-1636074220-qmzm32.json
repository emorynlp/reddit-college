  "text": "Hi!! I'm filling out the UC app and had a quick question. I want to apply as a biology major for primary major and put ethnomusicology as my alternate. Can I put a ethnomusicology major as an ***alternate***?\n\nBecause on the website for the ethnomusicology major, I see this \"UCLA only considers first choice majors at the time of application (not alternate majors). If you selected a School of Music major as your *alternate* major choice on the UC application, please do not submit a Supplemental Application, as it will not be reviewed. \"\n\nLink to site: [https://app.getacceptd.com/herbalpert](https://app.getacceptd.com/herbalpert)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPLEASE HELP!!! kinda stressed LOL\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthank you :)",

      "text": "Yo I'm also applying to UCLA as a bio major lmao. So I'm not 100% sure but normally if you want to major in music you have to send in a supplemental audition/performance to get in. In this situation, I think it means that if you send in one, they won't look at it because music isn't your top choice for your major. If I'm wrong then someone feel free to correct me. Also I do music stuff too so that's pretty funny. Good luck to you though!",

      "text": "So UCLA will not consider you for a second major. Just pick one. You can double major or switch if you get in and don\u2019t like what you start with. \n\nIf you have extremely high stats and are top 10% of your class with an interest/hobby/skill you are good at/passionate about, you fit the L&S profile. Maybe go with biology? They don\u2019t consider major in admissions but like to see you\u2019ve a track of success at something. \n\nBut that arts supplementary application gives you a chance to show a lot more about yourself than your stats. They\u2019ll often let you upload creative work, you probably submit recommendations and a bunch of other stuff, right? It can work in your favor if you are a great fit for their ethnomusicology  program in some way. My daughter was a solid student, but maybe just top 25% and had 2 Cs. She submitted an arts supplement that included a cute video and very personal graded research paper that I guess they really liked. She is also very good at her art form. She showed up at an audition and they basically spent most of the time trying to persuade her to come. The top students at her high school and the counselors were shocked that she got in because she was accepted for her personality/story and her artistic talents. Same for her friends in areas like trumpet and voice. If you are a good fit and have time to work on that supplement and maybe can find an accepted student in that major to give you advice on what they look for I\u2019d vote for that one. Even though the acceptance rate probably isn\u2019t that different the criteria are.",

She had a friend who turned down Princeton for a music scholarship at UCLA. Majored in voice and is finishing up at a pretty good med school. But cross that bridge when you come to it. For now focus on that supplement and how you are an excellent fit for specifically their program.",

              "text": "PS it was pretty clear at the initial group audition that they had picked out certain people to watch and basically had decided to accept them based on the things in the written application. My daughter was definitely a good dancer, but not the best. Definitely a good student, but not the best. Her solo audition piece did not showcase her abilities but rather her interest in other forms of ethnic dances. We both think they just found her to be a good fit for their unique take on the major and liked the way her essays and videos were creative, honest and a breath of fresh air in a kind of stuffy application process. So show them who you are - your fun side, the challenges you have overcome, and why you fit there better than anywhere else. And if you e done things to make your community a better place highlight that.",
