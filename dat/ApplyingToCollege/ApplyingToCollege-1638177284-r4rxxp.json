  "text": "This may be dumb but at my school, almost everyone I know has already taken the SAT and I feel so behind :(\n\nI've been studying for it during the last months, but it's been sporadic studying and I didn't start studying seriously until late October. I'm currently floating around a high 1300s.. my last two SAT scores were 1400 and 1370. \n\nI want to aim for a high 1500s to stay competitive but I'm so stressed out. I feel like I'm falling behind and getting nowhere. Everyone keeps telling me that it's also possible for my SATs to cancel. Do I still have enough time to get a 1500+ in before admissions?",
