  "text": "i am a full time dual enrollment student this year so i take 0 classes at my own high school and thus i dont have any classes to input for the 12th grade section. when i try to get rid of 12th grade in the HS info section, my only option is to select \"i skipped this grade\" even tho i didn't. when i leave 12 grade in the HS info section, it wont let me submit unless i have a class inputted there. how do i proceed?",
