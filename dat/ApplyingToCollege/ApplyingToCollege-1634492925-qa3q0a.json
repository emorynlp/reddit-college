He has a fair amount saved, but I don't want to put it in the wrong box.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: clarification - do I put the amount he contributed in 2020 or in the account total?

      "text": "Untaxed income and benefits would include non-Roth 401k contributions (if your dad uses a Roth 401k that is already taxed and accounted for in the income box). It would also include any kind of employer match.\n\nThe savings plan section is asking for total current value - just like it does for savings accounts and things like that.\n\nSchools can have their own methodology for how they use this info, so don't assume they will treat either the way they would regular savings.",
