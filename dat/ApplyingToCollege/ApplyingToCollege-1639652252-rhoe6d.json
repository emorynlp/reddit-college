      "text": "Computer Science is ONLY focused on Computer Science  \n\n\nComputer Engineering is focused on mainly Hardware (Electrical Engineering) and Computer Science. It's 60% EE and 40% CS of those majors into one major. I'm majoring in this field because I love working with hardware so much, but it would be very benificial for me to also learn the software aspect aswell. You can basically still get a job for CS if you major in Computer Engineering",
