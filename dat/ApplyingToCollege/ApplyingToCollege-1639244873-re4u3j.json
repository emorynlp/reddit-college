  "text": "I'm debating on either volunteering at a pet center or a library. For context, I'm in two book clubs and one poetry club, so I'm guessing enlisting at a library would look more consistent for my college application. These are both things I'm interested in doing, not for the sake of getting my hours in. Does anyone have advice for my situation? Thank you so much.",
