  "text": "My common app essay has a part where I described my dad teaching me long division in 2nd grade(which is actually true). \n\nProblem is that most kids learn long division in 4th grade, which suggests that I would need to be 2 years ahead in math classes for that to be true. \n\nHowever I\u2019m a first gen so my parents didn\u2019t know that I could skip a year of math when I was younger. I asked my parents and they did say that my elementary schools said I was a 4th grade math level in 2nd grade but my English level was that of a normal 2nd grader. In other words my parents didn\u2019t know I could just get ahead in math and only knew about skipping a grade altogether.\n\nWill AOs suspect I\u2019m lying or am I just way overthinking things. For reference, I\u2019m in Calc AB senior year. Skipping 2 years of math would have me clearing out all HS math by now.",
