You may have to break out of being an introvert a bit -- get involved in clubs that fit your interests (both academic ones and non academic ones).    \n\nLarge state schools often are going to have learning communities associated with their housing too -- so an honors dorm, an engineering dorm, sciences dorm, etc. where it may be easier to find students who have common interests.",
