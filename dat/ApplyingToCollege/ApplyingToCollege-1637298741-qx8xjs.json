  "title:": "Help with PIQ 6 and 7 topics",
  "text": "Yes I know it's due in 2 weeks and I've only written a couple drafts lmao\n\nI'm thinking of writing for PIQs 6 and 7, but idk if my topics are iffy\n\n6 (academic topic) - Physics, I want to understand how the universe works because everything is so absurd and we know nothing, it lets me view the world thru a different lens, pushing the boundaries of science/tech is the primary thing advancing humanity\n\n**my problem with 6:** I haven't really pursued any opportunities concerning physics. Literally none. I just like the topic and find it fascinating. I'm taking all 4 AP Physics tests this year, but I haven't even taken them yet so writing about that doesn't really show any authentic drive to learn about physics\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7 (improve a community) - mechanical keyboard community, youtube channel got 300k+ views, created a discord server using my online presence to help beginners to the hobby build their first keyboard bc I felt information was scarce, taught me how to manage a group of people, leadership, and moving forward I hope to design and produce a beginner friendly custom keyboard\n\n**my problem with 7:** I feel like writing about me forming an online sub-community dedicated to mechanical keyboards to help beginners sounds trivial when compared to other people who raise suicide prevention awareness or research insomnia",

      "text": "6 any reason why you have not done any physics classes ? Not available at your school? If available, then I would pick a different subject which you have furthered in or out of classroom. The second topic is fine and shows your real passion - all need not be Gandhi.",

          "text": "Honestly, I just never thought to. I've always found it interesting, but only really started deep diving into it and self-studying these past few months bc I've found AP Physics to be really fun. Sadly, I have not pursued any academic subjects outside of the classroom. (my main extracurricular interest is jazz). I was thinking of just not doing this prompt, but I'm applying as an engineering 1st major physics 2nd major and I heard it's highly recommended to choose prompt 6. Thanks for the advice!",
