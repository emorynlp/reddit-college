  "text": "So at first I was planning to apply EA to all the schools that had EA but early October I realized that it wasn\u2019t the best for my mental health to completely push myself and half ass my applications. All my friends are applying early and it makes me feel like I\u2019m not going to get into any of the schools I want to go to.",

But if you aren't ready, you aren't ready.  And that's okay.\n\nIf you haven't already done so, I highly recommend you spend this time, right now, making your list if schools, asking teachers if they'll write LORs, and starting your Common App essay.  These are all things which could alleviate your stress later.",
