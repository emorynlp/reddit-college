      "text": "Students accepted ED will need to withdraw their other apps shortly, though if they applied for need-based financial aid, they should wait until they receive the ED financial aid package before withdrawing from their other schools.\n\nHowever, ED-accepted students withdrawing from these EA schools is not going to suddenly cause these EA schools to accept more applicants in the coming EA release. These colleges already accept more applicants than will attend.",
