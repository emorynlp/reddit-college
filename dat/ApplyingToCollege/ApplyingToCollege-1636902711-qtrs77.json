The delta between those two schools is not so great that it will approach other factors in importance that pertain to you as a person (as opposed to the school you attend).\n\nWith respect to CS, one very crude stat is the % of a school's CS alumni on LinkedIn that are employed at Google or Facebook.  Last time I checked, the delta between UVA (3.4%) and Wisconsin (4.2%) was not so large.\n\nAlso, the caliber of their student bodies may not be so far apart as you think.  Some stats from each school's CDS:\n\nWisconsin:  SAT 25th: 1300, SAT 75th: 1440, Top 10%: 51%, Top 25%: 88%\n\nUVA:  SAT 25th: 1330, SAT 75th: 1490, Top 10%: 89.6%, Top 25%: 98.3%\n\nNote that these numbers are for *all students*.  Since Wisconsin is \"known\" for having a strong CS department and UVA is not, it is likely that the set of CS majors at Wicsonsin is stronger than the set of all Wisconsin students whereas the same may not be true at Virginia.",
