  "title:": "Just a warning, the Duke ED Admits Group chat is a shit show rn",
  "text": "Apparently, some guy who wasn't going to Duke found his way into the group chat and lied about having BONE CANCER. The dude really sold it too, he had been VERY active in the chat for 2-3 weeks before dropping his \"news\" and changed his insta bio too. All of this was just to get sympathy from girls, and he also tried getting some of us to buy and send him merch and raise money for him for \"surgery\". We have a student intern from the admissions (or some other thing through the school) department in the group chat (shoutout babu) who got his hands on an admitted students directory and he exposed him to everyone and now the group chat is in shambles. So be skeptical of the group chats. Also, be suspicious if a dude named Lawerence joins your chats.",

      "text": "So back when people used Facebook there was a real problem with people infiltrating Facebook groups. Not just trolls/brigades either -- there was a whole shadow economy of fake Facebook profiles that only existed to join admitted student Facebook groups, run scams, spy on teens, etc. Or even just lots of weird parents with no boundaries.\n\nIn 2010, what we started doing was having delay-entry students (students who had been on a gap year, but 'of' the admitted class) create a group, then add the senior bloggers as mods. They had access to a spreadsheet of the admits and would manually check every request to join the group against the actual list and block anyone who wasn't an admit. Then, after May 1, the senior bloggers would resign as mods and hand over control to an elected triumvirate of the given class. \n\nThis worked really well for years and years. It's still what we do. But the last two years have seen a real decrease in how many people use Facebook at all. Instead, people get into the group and then immediately split off into chaotic group chats. \n\nFunctionally, I think this is fine if people use the Facebook group as a sort of identity verification system and then enter the groupchat from there, to avoid brigading and trolling and such. But in practice, a) people don't want to go through Facebook and I don't blame them, and b) most of the students aren't sophisticated enough to think about these concerns ahead of time and troll-proof them. You also run into issues where the EA students start up all these splinter group chats and then the RA students never find them or other ways that cliques (and attendant anxiety) form. Groupme\u2019s 500 person limit is a perennial problem. \n\nWe've thought about just skipping Facebook and setting up a Slack for each class with individual invites to admitted student emails, which would solve some of the verification problems and also give visible channels so people can see what they can join. but we also worry that maybe students wouldn't want to use such an 'official' space if centrally administered by admissions (even if we weren't present in the spaces). And it seems like most high schoolers don\u2019t have Slack, maybe? \n\nIDK. Curious if anyone reading this thread has informed opinions and considered thoughts on what a good approach would be. I'm pretty happy with and proud of what we did with admitted student Facebook groups for the last 10 years, but it's pretty clear we need a new strategy for the next 10 built around group chat technology that respects student boundaries while also preventing trolling and scammers and solves certain coordination problems. I've asked the bloggers to think about this too but would like to hear from A2C",

Most big discord servers have a system where when someone new joins they only have permission to one channel, so you could do something similar so people have to be verified before having access to the rest of the server. It also allows you to transfer ownership of the server and have different levels of moderators so you could set up something very similar to what you do with changing ownership with the Facebook group.",

What about sending an invite to a Discord channel (moderated by those same delay-entry students and then senior bloggers) along with the admit mail, which states that each person will need to be individually verified (via some unique identifier) by the admins to join the channel? \n\n(I'm guessing that MIT doesn't provide a handle until students are actually committed to attend?)\n\nThere might be a positive aspect to encouraging admitted students to use the 'official' channel - if marketed correctly, it could feel like another perk (sorry). \n\nI'm sure you've thought of this kind of thing already....",
