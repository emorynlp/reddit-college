                      "text": "Prestige I would say is pretty much the same level. Maybe you could argue Harvard over Oxbridge and then Oxbridge over Yale, but then again that depends on region and it\u2019s pretty much negligible, nobody from Harvard / no employer is gonna seriously laugh at you for going to Yale or Oxbridge, and in some regions Oxbridge would probably be more prestigious than Harvard, like in East Asia or parts of the Middle East where people study Cambridge A levels or have a Eurocentric worldview. \n\nThere are people who bring up acceptance rates as an argument against Oxbridge (which hovers around 15%) but that\u2019s disingenuous since the acceptance rate is doubled given you\u2019re only allowed to apply to one, and also there are only 5 choices on the UCAS application so you can\u2019t shotgun. Furthermore students who don\u2019t meet the grade requirements (which off the top of my head is like 5 5s in AP, and 2 750+ SAT IIs for Cambridge) do not apply since it\u2019s literally impossible to get in without those scores, as those are baseline requirements. And obviously there\u2019s the conditional offer system where you have to get high enough grades in senior year so some people are put off by that as well, and the fact that the UK is way smaller than the US, hence fewer applicants. So acceptance rates are pretty misleading for the UK, and if they had a similar system to the US, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you saw acceptance rates in the single digits (but obv this is all conjecture)\n\nElitism id say is more prevalent among Oxford and Harvard, given Oxford\u2019s ridiculous amount of private school students and Harvard\u2019s being the \u201cbest\u201d school in the US (though I\u2019d say Oxford > Harvard elitism). Cambridge is like 70% public school kids so it\u2019s honestly less elitist (that being said, I am an international student who went to a private school going there lol, so I\u2019m not exactly helping with the perception of the school at all). Yale I have no idea though I have met some absolute scumbags who think they\u2019re the shit who go there (but in reality got rejected from Harvard and Stanford and cope by saying they\u2019re worse schools), but obviously sample size is important and that\u2019s how some people are, so I can\u2019t exactly use a wide brush to paint everyone there. Then again I\u2019ve met assholes from all these schools so who am I to judge lol.\n\nTL;DR Prestige pretty much equivalent. Harvard and Oxford probably have more \u201celitist\u201d cultures but ultimately it\u2019s the individual people in the schools that shape them so there\u2019s no way to generalise. Obviously every unis gonna have assholes who look down on others, but there\u2019s gonna be chill people too.",
