  "text": "I'm trying to fill out the fafsa and im supposed to use my moms information because my parents are divorced and i mainly live with her, but my stepdad argues with my mom saying I should put in my dads info because he makes less money than my mom and if we put in my moms information it could affect his kids who are already in college because hed have to put in his info since they're married. I don't know what to do, if i put in my dads its fraud and what it my parents or i get in trouble for it, but if we put in my moms what if his kids lose their stuff.",
