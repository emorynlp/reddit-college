  "text": " I wrote my essay about the topics (MULTIPLE 3) that i am interested in, my experiences with them, EC's, and what they mean to me. Its kind of like three short essays fused together (there is a good flow through the topics ). IS THIS OKAY i'm scared because this isn't about a single topic/story/experience.\n\n this is my prompt (Tell a story from your life, describing an experience that either demonstrates your character or helped to shape it. ) \n\nIts kind of 3 stories forced to become one AM I IN TROUBLE \n\nTHANK YOU IN ADVANCE",
