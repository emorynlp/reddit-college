  "text": "I've been using [College Navigator](https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/), but the data is so generalized it is almost meaningless. \n\nFor e.g. University of Seattle Washington has a [50% admit rate](https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=university+of+washington&s=all&id=236948#admsns) on Navigator, but in reality [only 4%](https://admit.washington.edu/apply/freshman/by-the-numbers/) of International students are directly admitted to Computer Science (my major). \n\nIs there any place I can get reliable, official data where I can filter by:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. International students (or even just out-of-state)\n2. Gender\n3. **Major** \n4. SAT score quartiles (lowest 25% and highest 75%)\n5. GPA/equivalent for international students\n6. All this data for the sample of applicants and the sample of successful applicants",
