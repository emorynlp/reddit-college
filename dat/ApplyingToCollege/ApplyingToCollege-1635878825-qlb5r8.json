  "text": "Since almost every student in the class of 2022 took their junior year online, I struggled immensely. Frensham and Sophomore year I was able to maintain a 4.0 GPA, but come my junior year and I ended it with 2 C's, 4 B's, and 1 A which dropped my GPA to a 3.8 Weighted. Do you think colleges will understand the reasoning for the grade drops as I am trying to apply to UC schools and USC?",

      "text": "I'm just guessing here.  My gut is that some colleges are going to be more forgiving than others and for some, the rest of your application package will make up or mostly make up for those grades.  That said - the UCs are generally VERY focussed on GPA and since they are now test-blind, they are probably going to care about junior year grades.  So what I would suggest for you is to make sure you have some schools on your list beyond what you've mentioned in your post.  Assuming you live in CA and want to stay here or close by, check out a few Cal States, maybe U of Arizona or AZ State, UN Reno, U of Oregon/ OSU, and maybe some more private schools like LMU, SDU, or Willamette and Lewis and Clark in Oregon.  Good luck!",

They might help, but ultimately make sure you apply to some solid safeties that match your gpa/ scores.",

I had all A\u2019s up until junior year which is where my gpa and rank dropped because i was online all year because my parents were hesitant due to covid .

We had the option to go to teacher conferences though but it\u2019s not the same.",
