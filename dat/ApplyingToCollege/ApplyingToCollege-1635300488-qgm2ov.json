The cost of attendance at Cornell for you after financial aid is within reach for you. *(My friend from crew goes to Cornell; she got a lot of need-based aid and it ended up being cheaper than our in-state schools like William & Mary.)*",

Cornell Hockey is pretty awesome, other sports are ... well ... we did make NCAA a few years back - that was a big deal, but it rarely happens.\n\nBut Michigan is an amazing school. It's just as strong in EVERY subject. AA is a great college town and the UM Campus is great. It is our #2 choice (after Cornell). Socially UM is a better school. Every alum I know - swears by it. (Every UIUC alum I know for example advises to NOT go there).\n\nIt simply makes no sense to pay 80k for Cornell when UMich costs you 1/3. Similar academically, similar prestige, and arguably better college experience.\n\nin NYC (where I live and work), noone would look \\_down\\_ on a Michigan grad.",

You are comparing a undergrad population of 31,000 students at Michigan vs 14,000 at Cornell.. The more the students the harder it is to stand out and also get personalized attention ( if thats what you are looking for). Resources for students get strechted thin and opportunties get watered down. Take a look at the carrer statistics for CS majors at Brown for instance  its  public information- almost  half the class went to Facebook, Microsoft and Google.\n\nCS is a very niche subject and the opprunties that you get in college determine how and where you start your carrer..  You can do well at both schools but  Cornell could give you a bigger advantage...",

I do think Michigan is a tgt school for all Quant Trading Firms, and Wall Street won't slight Michigan Grads.\n\nUM CS seems overcrowded, but so is Cornell CS program. Sure, they have the money - setting up the new school of CIS and building ANOTHER building, hiring more professors, but that will take some time.",
