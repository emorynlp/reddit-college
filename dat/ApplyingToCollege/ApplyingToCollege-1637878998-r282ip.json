It is an organization that prides itself on teaching values, yet one of its \"values\" is to discriminate. I would view someone putting this on their resume as either a homophobe or someone without enough integrity to leave an organization that dehumanizes a class of people.",

In fact, having good morals is one of our most important principles, which is very contradictory to discrimination.",

Would you be proud of being part of an organization that bans leaders who are not white? Why would you be proud of being a member of a group that bans people on the basis of their sexuality? As far as how much good Boy Scouts do for their community, one can do just as much good without being a member of a group that teaches hate. Before you dismiss my comment, just be aware that not everyone has a rosy colored view of the Boy Scouts.",

And in all my time as an autonomous person, my being an Eagle Scout has only ever been an asset\u2014that includes my admission to Reed College, one of the most liberal colleges in the country, where I was, you guessed it, surrounded by other Eagle Scouts. \n\nThere is no doubt that the Boy Scouts, now the Scouts, has had a long tradition of homophobia, which manifested itself in the banning of gay people from holding adult leadership positions.  But there has never been a ban on leaders who aren\u2019t white, and the Scouts changed its policy on gay troop leaders in 2015.\n\nYou have a fundamental misunderstanding of what Scouts is if you think its only redeeming value is community service.  And I don\u2019t see the point in trying to explain the role it has had in the social development of otherwise bullied or mistreated children to someone so obviously bigoted; nor do I see the purpose in explaining that individual Troops, including mine, have fought the BSA\u2019s regressive policies at the district level for years.\n\nYou *are* an idiot, and being \u201cin a hiring position\u201d, or finding that other people share your idiotic views, is not evidence to the contrary.",
