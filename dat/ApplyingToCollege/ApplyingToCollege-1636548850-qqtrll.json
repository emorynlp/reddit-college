  "text": "So I am planning to study to US as an international student and I have currently taken a gap year which means I have finished high school. I thought I didnt have to submit the the leaving examination so I didnt study for it at all and I got 76% from the whole test. Is that a bad score and does it actually play an important role in the college admissions?",
