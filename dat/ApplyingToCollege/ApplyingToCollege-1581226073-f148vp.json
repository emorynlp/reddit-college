  "text": "Sorry if this post comes off like word vomit but I need to get this off my chest because I haven\u2019t told anyone about it yet. I had my Dartmouth interview a couple days ago with a man who was probably 50 years older than me and he was being really inappropriate the entire time. We met in a Starbucks. He complimented me multiple times on my outfit, jewelry, hair, and was very insistent on telling me about the social scene at Dartmouth. I would try to ask about academics or atmosphere and he would steer the conversation back to what the dating scene was like there. He told me to \u201cstay safe at frat parties because God knows what those boys would do to a girl like you.\u201d He asked me if I was part Asian and when I said yes he said his girlfriend during his junior year was Asian. During the interview, he would put his hand on my knee/thigh and keep it there for a minute. He was also constantly staring at my chest. When it was finally over he said he wanted to walk me back to my car and I said that\u2019s okay I need to use the bathroom and he said he would wait for me. I didn\u2019t want him to say I was rude on his review of me so I just washed my hands and let him walk me to my car with his hand on my lower back the whole time. \n\nThe entire time I just felt like he was too close to me, he was practically breathing down my neck at one point. He wouldn\u2019t stop touching me even though I would shrink away from it, and he wouldn\u2019t answer any of my questions. After I saw him drive away I just sat in my car and cried for a while. I don\u2019t know if I can explicitly say it was harassment because I never told him to stop touching me or to stop looking at my breasts but I still feel so disgusting knowing he was looking at me like I\u2019m just a slab of meat. \n\nHe knows my name, email, and my phone number and probably lots of other information about me. At multiple times throughout the interview he said he was good friends with lots of people in the admissions office so I\u2019m scared he\u2019s gonna say something bad about me if I report it. I also just want it to be over, I don\u2019t ever want to have to see him or talk about him again. I have no proof that he was harassing me. I feel like if I report it they\u2019re gonna ask for proof which I don\u2019t have, or they\u2019re going to ask me what I was wearing, or just ignore me. I don\u2019t know what to do and I\u2019m getting really upset again thinking about it. Have any other girls had a similar experience? Boys, too?\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve sent an email with help from u/ScholarGrade and others. Thank you all for the encouraging me to say something and if this happens to you you should as well. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to remember your principles when you\u2019re caught in an uncomfortable situation, but there is nothing wrong with asking someone to stop touching you. Again, thank you all",

      "text": "This should absolutely be reported back to Dartmouth.  Doing so will not impact your application and if you phrase it properly it could actually help show your character.  If you want me to review what you send them I will happily do so.  PM me.\n\nYou don't need proof because this isn't a court of law.  Sure you probably wouldn't be able to successfully sue him or Dartmouth without evidence or proof of some kind.  But the burden of proof is extremely low for them to decide that was his last interview (which they likely will, if only from a liability standpoint.  Imagine he does something worse to someone else *after* you reported this?  Dartmouth would be held liable for that).  You owe it to yourself to do this.  And to the other students he will \"interview\" in the future if you don't.\n\nAlso:\n\n>\"they\u2019re going to ask me what I was wearing\"\n\nNo they won't.  And if the Starbucks employees didn't ask you to leave or change, then what you were wearing has nothing to do with this.\n\n>\"At multiple times throughout the interview he said he was good friends with lots of people in the admissions office\"\n\nThis is an important detail and needs to be reported as well.  It's a hallmark of quid-pro-quo sexual harassment and is 100% unacceptable.  If he admits to this, you would literally have grounds for a civil lawsuit against him (again, court is the only place where the proof matters).\n\n>\"He knows my name, email, and my phone number and probably lots of other information about me.\"\n\nThis is unfortunate, but remember that the admissions office has the same and more information about him.  If you report this, and he tries anything else, the police will be involved and it won't end well for him.  Certainly be careful out there, but I don't think you need to lose sleep over this.",

For Dartmouth, if you check the subreddits, they say the interview barely affects the chances of your admissions as it boils down to: SAT, ACT, ECs, and Essays, so I highly doubt it will have any affect. However, the experience needs to be reported for the safety of future interviewers. If anything, this man needs to be stopped from all future interviews.",

Just trying to help you and anyone else reading this (not saying you should have done these things, just reminding you that you have this power) - you can say no.  You can remove his hand and tell him off.  You can get up and walk away.  You can call the police.  You can go talk to the baristas and tell them you're uncomfortable or ask them to call the police for you (most retail establishments have a policy that if a customer asks you to call the police, you do it - again, liability management).  You can call him out and tell him his behavior is inappropriate.  You can call your parents or a friend.  You can fake an illness or an urgent call/text.  You can scream.  You can run.  \n\nWhatever happens, you can report it afterward.\n\nNo college admissions office is ever going to rate your application lower if you do these things.  It will not be a he-said, she-said case.  There will be no cross-examination of your story or attempts to pin the blame on you.  They will err on the side of caution and believe you.  You have nothing to fear from them.\n\nI don't mean to go overboard in this thread.  I just have daughters and am incensed right now.",

If you being terrorized by this person, it's likely he will be terrorizing other students in your area. \n\n2) They don't hold shit in terms of sway over the admissions processs. Most interviewers just fill out a detailed report/assessment of the candidate and then send it to the admissions office.\n\n3) You should report this sort of behavior. Not only would Dartmouth not penalize you, it would show them that they need to do a better job protecting their potential students. Don't worry too much about admissions but instead consider - Would you want to go to a school that is represented by someone like this? Would you want your family member to experience this?",

No I would never in a million years sleep with an alum to get into a college, not only does that go against my beliefs I just wouldn\u2019t want to either. I didn\u2019t say anything though because I was really scared he was going to report badly of me but I know better now. It\u2019s like I can repeat a thousand times over that it\u2019s okay for girls to be rude, it\u2019s okay to let them know they are bothering you, but in the moment all of that just left my brain and was replaced with \u2018don\u2019t cause a scene what if he says something bad about you\u2019",

Frankly, while Reporting this guy was the right thing to do, you wouldn\u2019t need to feel bad if you had decided to let it go. You are the victim here. And how you react and decide to move forward is your choice. \n\nEveryone has different reactions in stressful situations, and most women have been raised to be \u201cnice\u201d,  not just to be ladylike, but because we\u2019ve learned at some point that confronting or provoking men can be dangerous.  Unfortunately, we still live in a world where you have to make a judgment call to do what you feel is necessary to stay safe. You got out of there without further incident which is your number one goal .  I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve decided to report it, and I hope that gives you back some power, but don\u2019t spend a single second blaming yourself for how you handled it.",

However, I wasn't actually in an interview, I had just met the guy at a political event and struck up a conversation, and he invited me out to lunch at his country club. I was genuinely excited because I naively thought \"this is my way into Yale!\" But the guy seemed a little bit off-kilter, and the way he grabbed my arm throughout lunch was a little bit uncomfortable for me. He also warned me about recommenders backstabbing me (due to his experience in HS) and to tell my recommenders to send their letters to his address for a \"special scholarship\" so that he could check them for me. I felt this was extremely weird/unethical. He then said he would be happy to write a rec letter to Yale for me, but he needed to see me in action 1 more time and invited me to the pride march to volunteer at his tent (he's running for state rep). But honestly, the interview left me feeling very weird and his conversation sounded quite deranged and paranoid (apparently he worked at Goldman for Steve Mnuchin, so that could be an explanation), and I felt like he was somehow manipulating me using his status as a Yale alum. So I ghosted him. Whew this was smth I was holding onto for a quite a bit of time lmao.",
