While being willing to take the risk and believing you can make it is important - it\u2019s also important to recognize where your actually at. Sure it\u2019s good to shoot for high goals, but in doing so it\u2019s also important to take into account your starting point because that determines how you get to said goals.",

      "text": "Parent here agreeing with you:\n\nI can't recall the source but I've read an article in the past that referenced a study where they looked at the success of student who attended prestigious universities versus the success of students who were accepted to prestigious universities but chose to attend less-prestigious universities.  The study showed that there was no significant difference in the later success of the students who attended the prestigious universities vs. the students who were every bit as capable but chose a less-prestigious (usually cheaper) school.\n\nIn other words, one of the things that makes a \"good school\" better than other schools is the caliber of students it admits.  And a good student could get a reasonably comparable education and experience elsewhere.  \n\nAs a family with no financial need, we used this concept to our advantage, looking at colleges primarily in the T100-200 range, to find schools that offered merit scholarships.  We would have been charged $75,000 at any Ivy.  Instead, we paid about $35,000 for my daughter's freshman year at not-an-Ivy.\n\nAnd yet, the school she attends has almost all the same opportunities for an undergraduate student as any prestigious university:. good libraries, internships, research, honors program, study abroad, social activities, nice gym, Greek system, clubs, sports, transportation, tutoring, counseling, job fairs, etc...  In the end, whatever extra opportunities might have been offered at a more prestigious university just weren't worth paying another $40k a year for 4 years.",
