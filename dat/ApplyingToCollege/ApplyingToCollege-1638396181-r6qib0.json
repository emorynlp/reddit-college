  "text": "Okay so I know it\u2019s shitpost wednesday but I\u2019m genuinely confused :0. I applied to SUNY Geneseo yesterday evening, and today I got an email saying that I\u2019ve got a new message/important news in my application portal. I tried to go log in but apparently I need a temporary pin, which I never had in the first place. I checked everywhere in my email, including trash and Spam, and I couldn\u2019t find anything. The email came 30 minutes after the admissions office normally closes so I won\u2019t hear from them by tomorrow the earliest. Is there any way I could get in there within the next day (my aid is done so I\u2019ll be okay with that part), or will I have to wait with the anticipation of them telling me news that has absolutely nothing to do with my decision \ud83d\ude14\n\nedit: they just sent the pin for me to get into the account and damn i got deferred so quickly\ud83e\uddcd\ud83c\udffe",
