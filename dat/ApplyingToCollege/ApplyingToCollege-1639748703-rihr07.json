  "text": "I'm not even applying to Dartmouth but my friend is and when he told me about the peer rec thing this exploit was the first thing that came to my mind. It would require a person who has a huge crush on you and is also fairly proficient at writing.\n\nIt's pretty much an asshole move but has anyone thought about / done this before? I'm just curious lol",
