It\u2019s really a longer road\u2014 senior year + college. And toxic parents will threaten not to pay the next semesters bill. I know some others who would come to their kids dorms all the time and try to prevent them from going to parties etc. That being said, it\u2019s easier at least being away especially if you have supportive people around you, and now I have a job and am fully supporting myself so I\u2019m free. So in short, probably an easier time in college but the journey in many cases isn\u2019t completely over.",

The two close friends that are close by I've seen only about 2 times since graduation - way down from seeing them almost every day (minus summers) for years. College... I have my roommate and suitemate for friends. They don't match my personality at all. I'm friends with them out of necessity. I enjoyed the small town feel of my school a whole lot more. There were about 225 people in my graduating class. My college has about 20000 people, roughly. Maybe you'll feel that you can't wait to get away now, but trust me, once you get there, you'll probably feel a whole lot more isolated.",
