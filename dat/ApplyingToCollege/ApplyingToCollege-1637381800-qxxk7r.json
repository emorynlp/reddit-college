Honestly I\u2019m very glad to go here and it\u2019s been an amazing experience so far, with my professors being people who both inspire me and push me (small school things). It also just feels like on campus there is a constant flow of opportunities and activities with there hardly being a day without an event. It is in a more rural area, though Utica isn\u2019t too far (say 20 minutes) and is a small city. The one issue is that for freshman transport has been inconsistent, partially due to general hiring shortages. My absolute favorite part of campus had to be our orientation trips: I could talk about it on end. Life changing.",

Heard that the isolation is very apparent, which is something I like but I don't really want it to be like Williams drastic (I don't want a college that meshes with the city though)",

Syracuse is like 50 min away, Utica is like 20 min away, they aren\u2019t like nyc type of cities but pretty urban I would say, but by Hamilton being in a hill you are pretty isolated and there is clear distinction from Hamilton and city",
