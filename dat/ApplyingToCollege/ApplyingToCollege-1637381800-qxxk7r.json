      "text": "Hi current first year student here. Honestly I\u2019m very glad to go here and it\u2019s been an amazing experience so far, with my professors being people who both inspire me and push me (small school things). It also just feels like on campus there is a constant flow of opportunities and activities with there hardly being a day without an event. It is in a more rural area, though Utica isn\u2019t too far (say 20 minutes) and is a small city. The one issue is that for freshman transport has been inconsistent, partially due to general hiring shortages. My absolute favorite part of campus had to be our orientation trips: I could talk about it on end. Life changing.",
