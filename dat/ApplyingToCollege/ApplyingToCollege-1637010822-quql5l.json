  "text": "hii :)\n\n\nIt may be wrong of me to post this here, but I\u2019ve always found solace from A2C, and it won\u2019t hurt to try. I\u2019m an international student and so goes the roll (like almost every intl here) that I don\u2019t have a college counselor, my teachers don\u2019t know English and everything has been self-taught/done. I wasn\u2019t initially applying thanks to my mom, then I managed to convince her halfway through the year, and here we are. I\u2019ve been working on apps since what feels like forever. But the thing is, this means something entirely different to me, than it does to your average applicant. Because I\u2019ve had to learn how to do everything and then do it, sometimes twice or thrice. I haven\u2019t sent my apps, I\u2019m planning on doing so Regular Decision, at least by December 15. Yesterday I realized that it\u2019s exactly one month away. I\u2019m prey of the panic, fear, anxiety and troubled mind that accompanies applying to college. I feel as if what I\u2019ve done is nothing and like I\u2019m just the big dust ball that always appears in movies rolling in the end. I\u2019m finishing up my personal statement and moving on to supplementals, plus telling my teachers to complete their evaluations. Thing is, I have tons of extracurriculars, exams and just getting back to school after covid has been very hard. There\u2019s always an excuse or a reason. I know my feelings are valid but at the same time I can\u2019t allow myself to grieve for them because of time. I\u2019m giving this my all, when probably my mom won\u2019t even let me go to the us if by some bizarre reason I am accepted with the aid I need. Anyone feeling similar? I realized this was serious when posts started being urgent and about pressing matters. #itsgettingreal",
