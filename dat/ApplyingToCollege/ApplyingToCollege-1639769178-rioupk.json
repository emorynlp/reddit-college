      "text": "Intls are generally subject to explicit or implicit caps at American colleges, so it\u2019s not as good as being a domestic student in the same financial situation. But it\u2019s vastly better than applying for aid, which is a huge disadvantage. Think of it this way: if an intl needs significant aid, they have a solid chance of being rejected everywhere, whereas an intl who doesn\u2019t need any aid will certainly be able to get in *somewhere* that wants the money.",
