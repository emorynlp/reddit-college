  "title:": "Question About Requesting Transcripts",
  "text": "Hey everyone. This may be a dumb question, but my deadline for requesting transcripts is coming up soon and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. I am applying to three colleges, but that is subject to change. I may decide to apply to more later. So, should I request three transcripts or more than three to account for more colleges? Surely I only need one so that I can later upload it to more than one college, right? I'm not sure if that's how it works, so I just wanted to make sure.",
