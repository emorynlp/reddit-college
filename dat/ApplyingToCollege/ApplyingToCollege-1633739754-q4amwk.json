  "text": "Hey guys! I\u2019m a high school senior looking to apply for competitive colleges in the north-east region. To be frank, I\u2019m very much concerned with standardized test scores (SAT/ACT).\n\nI currently have a 4.0 GPA and am projected to graduate within the top 5% of my class alongside a plethora of extracurriculars and leadership positions. Unfortunately, I am naturally a horrible test taker and my scores definitely reflect that sentiment. This would mean that the colleges I would like to apply to, while perfectly fits my GPA, have students with test scores that are leagues above mine. \n\nTo remedy this, I am thinking of going test-optional for my applications. Is this an optimal solution to my dilemma? I\u2019ve been told in the 2020 fall semester that college admissions do not look down on a student that goes test-optional.",
