  "title:": "Should I send a \u201cgift\u201d to my interviewer?",
  "text": "Title is weird but let me explain. I did the optional interview with Hamilton College back in September. We spent a lot of time talking about journalism. I\u2019m the Editor-in-Chief of my school paper, and because COVID completely wiped out our budget for printing, I told my interviewer how I had to get creative by personally seeking out private donors to fund a printed issue. I got a personalized letter in the mail saying how impressed my interviewer was with my passion for journalism. \n\nOur printed issue comes out in a week or so. Would it look bad if I mailed a copy to my interviewer? I figured since she took the time to mail a letter saying she was impressed with my passion for journalism, it might be cool if I can send her something in return showing how my passion came to fruition. Hamilton is also a school that REALLY focuses on having a personal connection with applicants. \n\nWhat do you think?",
