  "text": "Okay so I keep hearing about how lots of schools other than Yale offer interviews based on availability. \n\nUPenn for example states that they can usually offer for 90% of applicants. But they received 56,332 applications last year. How can schools possibly have that many living and willing interviewers for around 50,699 (90% of 56,332) prospective students?! \n\nSomething is just not sitting right with me. \n\n[Source for number of UPenn applicants for Class \u201825](https://admissions.upenn.edu/admissions-and-financial-aid/what-penn-looks-for/incoming-class-profile)\n\n[Source for Interview Policies at UPenn](https://admissions.upenn.edu/admissions-and-financial-aid/what-penn-looks-for/interviews)",
