  "text": "Basically, the story goes; I'm 18, been graduated from high school for maybe 6 months or so? I kind of neglected every chance i had to go to college after high school, (i thought i was going into trade). never applied for any scholarships, didn't do the FAFSA, took the act maybe twice with a 26 as my top, ended up graduating with with honors. To make a long story short, ive come to a realization that i actually want to go back to school and pursue a higher education, possibly for something in computer engineering. Did i fuck myself? Can i still get scholarship and grant money? Am i allowed to contact my old counselors for information? Can i contact my old teachers about recommendations? you can probably tell im very uneducated with this shit, i just want to play my cards in the best possible way. i know i can always go to college at any time, im just wondering if i missed out on any of that sweet sweet government money. Thanks so much",

      "text": "My dude u can totally contact teachers/counselors tht u vibed with as they\u2019ll be happy to help.\n\nI didn\u2019t bother with apps bc of.... personal issues. I also thought my weighted GPA of 3.74 made me uncompetitive bc I was on track for 3.9 before said... issue, and resigned myself to studying in a uni quite ranked #1000 by QS (im not American). \n\nIt took me a couple months to realize I wanted more, and now I\u2019m applying for high reach schools. So like, u could totally do it my dude. ED and EA is gone, but RD is still there. Best of luck and don\u2019t lose hope!",
