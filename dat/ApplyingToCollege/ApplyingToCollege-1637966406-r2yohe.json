  "text": "Does anyone have advice for building extracurriculars? I\u2019m only involved in school clubs as a member and I want to do more. What are some steps I can take to show that I actually do things to help the community? I\u2019m kind of on the introverted side so I feel like the reaching out to people part is really hard. However, I truly want to strengthen my extracurriculars because I have nothing so far. I know that I\u2019ve still got time since it\u2019s only my sophomore year and I want to feel ready to build my college application. \n\nReally any advice about applying to college would be greatly appreciated!",

Also, if you don\u2019t mind sharing, how did you start a small business? I heard of people doing so and I want some inspiration as well as advice. Overall, you advice was super insightful. Thank you! :)",

              "text": "i started my small business making and selling jewelry in august 2020 and the process was super slow and seemed hopeless at first, but sticking with it is so worth it! i use tiktok as my main platform of advertising because it is a lot easier to go viral on there than any other social media platform. at first i posted 1+ video daily and tbh it sucked at first lol, almost no likes, no follows, etc, but i got super lucky and one of my videos went viral within a few months and i got 50+ sales pretty fast, which i would say is really good for a starting business! i haven't had time to advertise/do much in the past 3 months because school has been crazy, but normally i would post 2 or 3 videos a week and i would get 10+ sales a week from advertising. i use depop to sell my jewelry because it's primarily teenagers and that is who my products are targeted towards. etsy is good, but hard to start off on due to the fact that there are probably 1 million+ sellers and beginners get pushed to the bottom unfortunately.",
