  "title:": "Will gap years and homeschooling affect my ability to get into a good school?",
  "text": "\nI am thinking of taking a gap year before going onto higher education. I am wondering if that would negatively impact my chances of getting into a good college/university. I would still be working so there won\u2019t be a complete gap. I have been homeschooled so I just want to be able to gain a little more confidence in an environment with lots of people. My guardians have always been supportive of me getting into higher education, if a little bit nervous. They live in the middle of nowhere and someone could always look after me so it made sense. This might also be bad for some schools. I\u2019m not sure. I have decent grades (all a\u2019s except for a high b in mathematics).",

Colleges do ask what you did during your gap year, so you just want to be able to answer that question effectively.",
