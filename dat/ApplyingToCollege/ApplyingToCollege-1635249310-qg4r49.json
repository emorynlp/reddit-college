  "text": "I'm a senior high school student in the 11th grade in the Philippines who's very eager to go to BYU for college and I'm badly in need for any information I can get about international college admissions. How does the Philippine grading system transfer to the U.S. system? What should I be doing in senior high to get higher chances of getting in? What is a 93.250 average here converted into U.S. GPA? Any info would be appreciated :)",
