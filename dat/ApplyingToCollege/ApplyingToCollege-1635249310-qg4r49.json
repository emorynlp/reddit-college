How does the Philippine grading system transfer to the U.S. system? What should I be doing in senior high to get higher chances of getting in? What is a 93.250 average here converted into U.S. GPA? Any info would be appreciated :)",

              "text": "Gocha! So the first thing I'd like to mention is that BYU-I (and Provo) have a LOT of requirements for admission for int'l kids, and you WILL be spending a lot of money for it. English proficiency tests are required, and you can't waive it, so you'll have to spend like ~USD200 for that alone. Next, you also have to get your transcript \"translated\" using a third-party evaluator (IERF or SpanTran), and that's about an extra USD100-200. I'd also like to note you have to be processing these documents WEEKS in advanced. I never actually got to apply to BYU-I or Provo because of how expensive it was to just apply in the first place, so I'm not too sure of how scholarships or financial aid work, but taking a quick look at the website leads me to believe it's a bit difficult to find full-rides, although to be fair the BYU COA is pretty cheap compared to most.\n\nBYU-Hawaii has pretty different application requirements. While an English proficiency test is required and also can't be waived, you can take the Michigan Test, which I believe is significantly cheaper. If you're a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, you can take the test in your stake center, but I'm not sure if there's options outside of that. Note that the results are valid for two years so you can take the test this year and use it for your BYU-H app if you're applying next year. You also don't need to spend money on getting your transcript translated, since they're pretty familiar with a lot of non-US grading systems. Now, one of the things about the BYU-H app is that, as of the moment, you can't apply before you graduate high school. You have to have at least one year of college (or BYU-Pathway, their online course) in order to be eligible for admission, even if you're under K-12\u2014something I *didn't* know before I wasted USD35 for their app fee and like, hours of editing my essays :/ so there's that. For scholarships/aid, although BYU-H's COA is a lot more expensive compared to BYU-I, BYU-Hawaii I think is the most generous, and if you qualify for IWORK (work-study program) you basically have no worries about tuition + fees, although you'll have to work for living expenses and such. My siblings went to BYU-H and qualified for IWORK, so if you have any questions about that, I can definitely ask them.",

      "text": "Oh, I'll also try to answer the other questions raised in your post:\n- You can't really transfer the PH grading system to the US grading system. When you apply, all you can really do is send over your grades and let the colleges themselves do the recalculating.\n- Things you should do in senior high: focus on your academics\u2014get to the top 10% of your class if you aren't already. If you can take the SAT or ACT, definitely do it! Also, if you haven't done any significant extracurricular work, you should definitely be working on that too. \n- I don't know what your grade would specifically be in the US grading system, and frankly there's no accurate way. Like I said, colleges will do the recalculating themselves (unless they ask for a third-party evaluator like BYU-I/P does). However, if you want to have a ballmark estimate, you can use https://www.scholaro.com/gpa-calculator/Philippines \u2014 but again, it's not always accurate, and you should not report your grade like this when you apply. Report your grade as shown in your transcript.",
