Does this indicate anything in regards to admission?",

I submitted it in early November too, and it showed up as \"not reviewed.\" Like two weeks ago, it changed to \"received.\" \n\nMy ED school, Columbia, says that they don't review it until a decision has been reached, so I'm hoping it's a good sign. I never included my noncustodial parent in my CSS, though, so the noncustodial financial information never showed up in my portal.",
