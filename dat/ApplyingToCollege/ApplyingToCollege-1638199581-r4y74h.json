  "text": "So if the activities on the UC App are numbered, are they ranked? And does their order really matter? \n\nI'm mainly asking because I currently have two ECs I addressed in my PIQs put kinda low, and I'm wondering if that would reflect weirdly.\n\nside question, should I put school honor roll as my (only) award if the criteria for it is having like a B-average and I'm a straight A student?",

I don\u2019t see why it would matter if you can\u2019t really do it without deleting your activities & manually adding them in order.",
