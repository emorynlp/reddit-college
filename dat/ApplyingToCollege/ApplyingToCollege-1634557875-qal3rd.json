  "text": "I want to create a new common app ( I haven't submitted the old one ofc) so my teacher can send a fresh letter of rec (the old one had a typo it seems). I have already sent my SAT scores to a few colleges through college board, how are the two linked? How do I make sure they **match my common app with my SAT** (Is it my name, email, date of birth?)",
