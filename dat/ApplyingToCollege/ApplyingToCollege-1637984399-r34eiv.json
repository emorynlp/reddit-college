      "text": "Internationals usually ask for hefty financial aid (basically all my friends are asking for full tuition at least). This means that even the best international applicant can get rejected everywhere.\n\nSource: a few years ago in my school, this literally happened.\n\nEdit: also, internationals - and especially ones asking for lots of aid - are heavily disadvantaged in the college admission process, so an applicant who'd be a drop dead acceptance could very well get rejected. There's a reason most t20s have about half their usual acceptance rate for internationals. It can be easy to look at internationals' profiles through the lens of a domestic student and not notice the fact that the process is weighed against them.",
