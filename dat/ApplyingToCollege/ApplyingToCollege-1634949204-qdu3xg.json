  "title:": "How can I write down 'building a go-kart' in my activity list?",
  "text": "Hi!\n\nI would appreciate some help wording a project I did with a friend over Sophomore and Junior year. \n\nWe got a bunch of scrap metal, a frame, and a broken lawnmower engine, and with the help of power tools and elbow grease, we managed to build a go-kart with electrical components, such as a push start and killswitch capable of 40 MPH. \n\nThe project had lots and lots of challenges such as supply chain issues, engine issues, and when we added electrical components, we of course had electricity issues as well. We managed to troubleshoot and fix them all, however. We eventually sold the Go-Kart for several hundred dollars of profit. If I had to estimate we worked about 4 hrs/week for 12ish weeks total.\n\nHow can I write this in my activity sheet? Thanks in advance!!",
