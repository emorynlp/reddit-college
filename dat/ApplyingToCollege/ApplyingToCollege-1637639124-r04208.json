And acceptance rates correlate with academic qualifications. \n\nWhile people do get in to top schools with low sat scores, they usually have other hooks (eg legacy/recruited athlete).

      "text": "Yes. My guidance counselor told me that during the pandemic they accepted way too many students and overestimated how many students they could admit (hence the fiasco at Purdue), so some colleges won't have the physical space to accept more students this year. \n\nHe also said that the amount of space they have is generally fixed. So if more students apply, then it looks like the acceptance rate is lowering, because they can't accept the same percentage of people as the previous year. He also said that during the pandemic, a lot of the counselors think that since everyone was home, there were significantly more college applications than previous years, which is why it messed up the acceptance rates a little.",
