  "title:": "Unpopular Opinion: A2C is a toxic sub",
  "text": "For context, I'm a freshman in college who spent a lot of time lurking in this  sub last year. There's so much anxiety and fear over the college application process and honestly so much of it **doesn't fucking matter**. If you don't get into that prestigious-ass 1-10% acceptance rate university? You'll be fine. Seriously. Would it be great to go to a crazy good school? Sure. Definitely.  If you don't get into your \"Dream School\"It's not the end of the world.\n\nI feel like this sub pushes the elitist mindset that, \"you must get a 33+ ACT & have 20 different ECs & have a 5.6 GPA (how do you guys even do this? I don't think that was even possible at my school but okay?)\" and I'm not here for it. This sub seems inaccessible to people with lower scores or different situations because it's very intimidating posting your stats if they are less than everyone else posting.\n\nIt also seems like this sub fosters a sort of anxious and dramatic tension. You can get lost in the worried haphazard posts talking about essays and applications, and it's draining.\n\nI even cringe at the term \"Dream School\". Honestly, y'all have no freaking idea of what your dream school is like (I sure a s hell didn't going into orientation) and I've met so many people who regret their choice.  One thing I've realized in college is **how important fit is.** you should not go to a college just just because it's \"the best school you can get into\" because at the end of the day you need to put up with the environment you will be living in.\n\nLearn as much as you can about the school you want to go to, and don't stress too much if you don't get into your first choice. The end of senior year will come earlier than you expect, so fucking enjoy your last year in HS.\n\nFinally, getting into your \"Dream School\" over a less attractive school won't alleviate your problems. I had this mindset and boy was I in for a nasty surprise as I had to face academic hardship and a new college social scene at the same time.\n\nEdit: misplaced words",

When actually some students get into this specific school with 1300s and even less. Anyways, we\u2019re all high schools and we know nothing about what these admissions officers think.

It has qualities, some of which matter and some of which don't. Chances are, if you're already traveling for school, there are other options within range that are just as good or at least good enough, to start at if not for a complete degree. \n\nThere's only one dream school, but there are dozens of schools that fit. Will you find the one that fits? Maybe, maybe not, but it's not healthy to put all of your eggs in one basket, even mentally. Finding out your dream school is a bad fit devastates a lot of people because they've put it on a pedestal higher than every other school. So if that doesn't fit, what could? Accepting that it's just a possible fit like all others is much better for your mental health and ability to plan. \n\nThe only caveat I'd give to this is if you can't go to school away from home or something else limiting your options. I couldn't, but even so, there were still plenty of schools within my state that would provide me with a good enough education.",

              "text": "Well, we can break this into four categories: fine arts, non-STEM fields, specialist fields, and law! \nWith fine arts, where you go to college matters a lot if you want the best connections and influences, for a lot of great musicians or dancers with are attending schools with big names in the industry (Eastman School of Music at UniofRochester, Julliard, USC, Berklee, etc). Job placement for fine art careers are generally pretty low, which is one of the reasons why we often hear the term 'starving artist'. When the job placement is that low, be it for top tier orchestras or dance companies or landing a good film production job, the higher your prestige in the industry the more likely you are to get it over someone from a school that isn't known with a dance/music program that isn't known. Many times, you won't even get accepted for an audition, much less callback. \n\nWith non-STEM fields, it really depends. But with majors where there is already an firmly established, almost over-saturated, market, the university that you attend would transform your resume. This is true for cases of Anthropology, philosophy, history, or English Lang. The job market is almost non-existent besides, well, teaching. The jobs that are open are research jobs, and the selection for those are most achievable and abundant at top tier universities. Just recently, Cornell just had a 6 million dollar donations towards their department of history. And for the past who knows how long, they offer 10 sets of awards and grants for their undergraduate history students for research. When students are trying to find a job later on, that prestige of research and opportunities that were available at an upper tier school will help them land further research jobs. It's not like being a doctor or an engineer where you could go anywhere and get a job. People on this sub sometimes forget that those careers and CS aren't the only ones out there. \n\nThe specialist category is similar to the one above, but this one is to talk more about any niche research topic , STEM or not. If you want to go into a very specific subject and do research in it, many of the times you will not find the right equipment, right company, or in general the right resources to delve further into it. With very specific subjects, I guess it's not necessarily the college itself that you have to look for but which colleges have ongoing and strong research in that area. In my college search, I was looking for some place with niche research in sleep deprivation studies , and I found two things: 1. much of the articles published about the topic that has come from a university sleep center happen to be those with big names. 2. big universities offer all of the tools and people required to do what I want in the field. If a student is wanting to continue their research into , let's say, Trisomy 18, then the best place to research is Dartmouth where those resources are there and faculty is there with experience. \n\nLastly, Law. This one is iffy and has conflicting viewpoints from lawyers themselves, but law is one of the highest paying jobs that actually see the importance of a top degree. Some companies pay more to newbies if they have a degree from a T14 Law school. A friend's mom is a great lawyer, but she would speak of how because of her degree, initially when she was looking for a job, it was harder on her than it was for others. Albeit, her education was still awesome and she's an amazing, respected lawyer, it's necessary to understand there is a difference. \n\nNow, obligatory: no matter where you go, if you put in enough work, you can do whatever you want. But the point in question is that some places make it easier for you. Some places provide more niche-opportunities for you. Some places provide a boost for you in fields where job placement is low. \nI hope you understand what I'm saying!! I'm not claiming to be an expert or anything btw :D",

I don't even need to read the rest. Do not spend so much fucking time on this subreddit and you won't have any issues.\n\n> There's so much anxiety and fear over the college application process and honestly so much of it doesn't fucking matter. If you don't get into that prestigious-ass 1-10% acceptance rate university? You'll be fine. Seriously. Would it be great to go to a crazy good school? Sure. Definitely. If you don't get into your \"Dream School\"It's not the end of the world.\n\nYou know what this is? You're projecting your own fear and anxiety and saying the sub caused it. False. \n\nGuess what: some people have different goals than you do. Maybe for some people, it actually does matter to them what school they go to. Who are you to tell someone else what matters? You're a freshman in college.\n\nLiterally no one is on this sub thinking that if they don't get into Harvard then their life is over, this is just a strawman that people use to attack A2C. I challenge you to find one person that really thinks this, besides yourself apparently. \n\n> I feel like this sub pushes the elitist mindset that, \"you must get a 33+ ACT & have 20 different ECs & have a 5.6 GPA \n\nYes, look at that, yet another strawman. This sub is not a person or organization or entity with some agenda to push, it is a collection of individuals, many of which happen to be intelligent and talented and are applying to elite schools. And these individuals do have high grades and test scores and strong extracurriculars: what the hell do you expect? \n\n> I'm not here for it\n\nYou said you were here for it.\n\n> This sub seems inaccessible to people with lower scores or different situations because it's very intimidating posting your stats if they are less than everyone else posting.\n\nThis criticism gets levied all the time, but there are tons of people on this sub that are not applying to top schools and they are not met with any hostility. Sorry you felt intimidated but that's really a you problem. It's like going to the gym and complaining that there are weightlifters there.\n\n> It also seems like this sub fosters a sort of anxious and dramatic tension. You can get lost in the worried haphazard posts talking about essays and applications, and it's draining.\n\nSo don't spend all your time here...\n\nThis sub is what you make it. Admissionsmom and scholargrade and the other moderators work extremely hard to provide valuable advice and foster a sense of positivity in the community, and I consider this type of post to be just insulting to those efforts. Come back in may for all the posts from people thankful for the advice they received from this subreddit. Even now, people are posting how A2C helped them get into their dream school. I'm sorry you were not able to use this sub in a healthy manner but it's not anyone's job except you to regulate your internet usage.",

          "text": ">You know what this is? You're projecting your own fear and anxiety and saying the sub caused it. False.\n\nHow is it even false, exactly? Sure, it may not be the sub, but there are other outside forces, whether it be other people such as parents, college prep businesses, or even colleges themselves with their \"admissions requirements\" that even fulfilling them won't make a difference. Of course, A2C isn't responsible for that, but blaming the OP for a system that cultivates fear, anxiety, and stress about the admissions process is unjust because said system is out of OP's control.\n\nIt seems like the point the op is making or trying to make is that there is nothing you can do to change or alter ones chances at getting admitted, and yet the sub seems to play it out as if it is. And in doing so, it assumes that an applicant getting rejected is due to an individual flaw on part of the applicant instead of the fact that the college admissions process is completely random and indeterminate. Thus cultivating the fear, anxiety, and stress as previously described as the applicants are held responsible for a system out of their control.\n\n>So don't spend all your time here...\n\n[How the OP should spend their time is independent of whether the sub is toxic or not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergo_decedo)\n\n>This sub is what you make it.\n\nAnd what others here make it too.

                  "text": ">I would respond to your first paragraph but I don't understand it; please rephrase.\n\nThere are plenty of people and businesses out there that cultivate fear and anxiety in teens about college - take US news' college rankings and/or institutions like the Princeton Review. Just google \"how to get into college\" and you will come across multiple pieces of false information telling you how to do it in all of the wrong ways by telling you to do this task and that task. When in reality nothing - or at least no specific task - will guarantee you admission into college. In short, the OP's sense of frustration they're currently having is justified, because said businesses and people appear to cultivate a sense that college admissions is a responsibility placed upon the applicant, even though the decision of whether the applicant gets admitted is out of the applicant's control.\n\nThis rephrase is probably the best I can do of that paragraph.\n\n>Not so: video games, for instance, are fun in moderation, but can have a profound negative effect on someone who plays them for some excessive amount of time. Lots of positive things corrupt in excess quantities.\n\nSure, and how are all of those related to the claim of whether the sub is toxic or not? My point right here is that [the source of claim is irrelevant to it's truth.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy)\n\n>Well that notion is frankly ridiculous and I'm not going to address it. And no, the college process is not completely random, lol, I'm not going to address that either.\n\nIt's the college's decision of who or not they let in, regardless of what the applicant does. If it wasn't the college's decision, then who is it that is in charge of this so-called \"admissions process?\" And evaluating who is \"worthy\" enough for applicants to enter into their college (in other words, whether the applicant should get into their college) is subjective - so when I said random, I meant that the process is uncertain and indeterminate and the outcome of the applicant (in this case, whether they get admitted into the college they're applying to) is relative based on who is the person or group of people admitting the applicant, and since it is subjective, bias plays a role. So it is possible that people who could make a positive contribution to the university or to society are rejected while some people who won't make any sort of contribution to the university or to society are admitted. But your not going to address this - oh well. Then my point still remains.\n\nedit: wording",

Do not spend so much fucking time on this subreddit and you won't have any issues. \n\nBut you still read the rest, it seems.\n\n>You know what this is? You're projecting your own fear and anxiety and saying the sub caused it. False.  \n>  \n>Guess what: some people have different goals than you do. Maybe for some people, it actually does matter to them what school they go to. Who are you to tell someone else what matters? You're a freshman in college.  \n>  \n>Literally no one is on this sub thinking that if they don't get into Harvard then their life is over, this is just a strawman that people use to attack A2C. I challenge you to find one person that really thinks this, besides yourself apparently.\n\nYeah, sure. I wasn't the best student in high school, and so maybe part of my anxiety had to do with the fact that my scores/GPA were not the best. What I'm saying is that just because I was stressed out, it doesn't mean that others who are going through the same thing need to.  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af \n\nAs a freshman in college, I thought I had a perspective that some high school seniors probably did not. Forgive me if I was wrong...\n\n> Yes, look at that, yet another strawman. This sub is not a person or organization or entity with some agenda to push, it is a collection of individuals, many of which happen to be intelligent and talented and are applying to elite schools. And these individuals do have high grades and test scores and strong extracurriculars: what the hell do you expect? \n\nWhat I'm saying is that I've seen way too many desperate posts of people crying that they don't have the stats or what not for some elite T20. I'm trying to put it into perspective that it doesn't really matter as much as some think it does, I'm not demonizing smart and intelligent people who put in their work and reap what they put in.\n\nIf you're smart and successful and get into the school you want, congrats. I'm fucking proud of you.\n\n> This criticism gets levied all the time, but there are tons of people on this sub that are not applying to top schools and they are not met with any hostility. Sorry you felt intimidated but that's really a you problem. It's like going to the gym and complaining that there are weightlifters there. \n\nI know what you mean, it's unfair that those who did well should have to keep quiet. I'm just stating the truth here, Regardless if it should be the case or not, it's still hard to put yourself out there if you think others would put you down for your stats (even if that usually isn't the case).\n\nI get what you mean though, and you're right on this point. \n\n>So don't spend all your time here...  \n>  \n>This sub is what you make it. Admissionsmom and scholargrade and the other moderators work extremely hard to provide valuable advice and foster a sense of positivity in the community, and I consider this type of post to be just insulting to those efforts. Come back in may for all the posts from people thankful for the advice they received from this subreddit. Even now, people are posting how A2C helped them get into their dream school. I'm sorry you were not able to use this sub in a healthy manner but it's not anyone's job except you to regulate your internet usage.\n\nI don't spend all my time here anymore, I don't like this sub.\n\nI do admit that users like Admissionsmom and scholargrade are great resources and wonderful assets to this community, and I'm not bashing them at all let alone trying to insult them. They're great, and if it did come across like I was going after them, then I'm apologizing to them here. \n\nI still don't see the \"positive community\" here, though. Despite wonderful mods and AOs, this sub is still laced with a lot of scared kids afraid of screwing up in the process, and I promise you that I wasn't the only person. \n\nLook, I don't wanna argue. \n\nPeace out.",

It's like gambling - the same guarantee (that being none) goes to you and everyone around you. \n\nAnd plus, there is no difference between attending an \"elite\" school with a \"less attractive\" school - style does not imply or correlate to substance. No evidence suggests that \"elite\" schools are \"better\" than \"less attractive\" schools. And I put those words in quotes because [elitism is bullshit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitism). There is no objective quantitative or qualitative assessment one can make of a university other than your own personal subjective experience, which is different for everyone. And the ones that do or at least claim they do use [subjective pseudoscientific measurements to determine \"which schools are best.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQyO93DO-Q)\n\nIMO I personally disagree with the idea of admissions - and think it should be abolished - because only you can evaluate what is best for you and what you are worth since you are the liver of your own life. This isn't to \"hold you responsible\" but to prove that others trying to objectively evaluate what you have learned and what you are worth is near impossible - because there is no way to at least so far. Hell, there are [theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_theory_(education)#Criticism) that try to understand how it works, and I'd argue that it's quite unethical, because it assumes that your own evaluation of your worth (self-esteem) is meaningless and worthless.",

I\u2019m going to college because I know it will help me get somewhere. I\u2019m going in, doing what I need to, and then I\u2019m leaving and moving on with my life. Done. I\u2019m going to my local community college, and transferring to the local state school for a BA. With said transfer program, the SAT is not required, and they only ask for me to pass with a 2.5 GPA. I can do that, I hope. I never even took the SAT, too! \nSomething tells me the majority of this sub wouldn\u2019t be too kind to me. But idc bro I\u2019m going with da flow u feel me dawg",

In addition, I wish more schools were talked about except the same 25-30. The reality is that such a slim percentage of people go to schools such as these, the rest of us go to decent-good schools such as Syracuse, Pitt, Villanova... I wish more schools like those were talked about. I think people forget how rigorous some of these top schools are, you go to a top tier school and major in x whatever and half the people drop out/ switch major cause they can\u2019t handle that course work, where as if they went to a less competitive school they\u2019d still be studying what they wanted to going into college.

It's the difference between making enough money to make ends meet and making so much money you can invest in yourself, your business, your hobbies, your family, and dare I say, your **Future.** When your student loans come, you start making car payments, and insurance, and rent, and expenses, raining day expenses, things will start to pile up.

I feel like if I had the mentality I had now  would have approached the entire process in a more healthy and sincere way. \n\nIt's fair to voice concerns, but I feel like A2C is sometimes a pit of negativity and it's really easy to fall into a super negative mindset about the application process and build yourself up after reading many people's stories. I suppose it can be good to vent sometimes as many students work super hard to get into top-tier schools, but getting into college should not be the only thing holding someone together and it shouldn't degrade mental health (even if it does in so many cases, rip). Venting can be good in a lot of cases, though! I don't disagree there. I guess I see a lot of vent posts and that highlights the more pertinent issue of how sucky and unpredictable college apps can be.\n\nI wish you the best when it comes to your college application process! It's gonna be fine and if you ever need someone to talk about it with you I'd be more than willing!",

I participate because there is a lot of misinformation out there and some of these questions / issues need to be answered with someone more experienced rather than a current student. \n\nIf this is toxic to someone then they need to refrain from being on this and other sites. Sit back and think about what you're trying to get out of being here. If it's constantly comparing yourself against the competition for your T20 school, then you're not here for the right reason.\n\nIt is a tool and it needs to be used correctly.

What you do there does.\n\nBut I would like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that you don't need to have a 3.5+ GPA or a 1300+ SAT to be here.  There are no prizes for being the smartest person here.  You don't need to be aiming for T20s or Ivies to benefit immensely from /r/A2C.  \n\nEvery year many of you learn about amazing schools that you might not have otherwise considered (like Trinity, Rose Hulman, Harvey Mudd, Colorado School of Mines, and many top LACs).  But many of you also find less selective colleges that are a perfect fit for you. \n\nEvery year many of you find out about massive scholarships [like these](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/azu8o2/change_your_trajectory_full_ride_scholarship/) that change the trajectory of your life.  SO. MANY. top students miss out on those because they have earlier application deadlines.  There is a Scrooge McDuck vault of scholarship gold just waiting for you to go for a swim - so go get it.\n\nEvery year \"mediocre\" students with a 1200 SAT get a near full ride to a less selective school because they were well above that school's 75th percentile and this sub helped them [build an outstanding application](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bktw1k/how_to_do_a_chanceme_and_improve_your_chances/).\n\nEvery year seniors move on and leave wholesome posts thanking this community for helping them with the process.  You don't have to be perfect.  You don't have to compare yourself to others.  Just focus on being the best possible version of yourself.\n\nFinally, remember that this sub is not representative of all college applicants.  Most people who engage with a community about college admissions are going to be highly organized and motivated students with outstanding stats.  It's sort of like how you almost never see 3 star reviews.  If it was awesome or horrific you take the time to leave a 5 or 1 star review, but if it was Applebees, you just don't bother.  There are about 144,000 subscribers and ~10 million monthly pageviews on this sub, but just a small percentage of them comment and post things.  Don't let the 5 star students posting here make you feel like Applebees by comparison.  Instead, take advantage of the vast knowledge and resources available here and make yourself better.",
