  "title:": "*HELP* officially sent AP scores, their cancellation, etc.",
  "text": "here\u2019s the thing: I got six 5s and one 4 on my APs, and I self-reported those scores on common app while completing my EAs and EDs. however, I also got a 1 and a 2 in the year 2020 (fk covid), which I didn\u2019t report having on commonapp. because my counselor urged me to send my scores to college (which, as I literally have just just found out today, is not necessary for most major unis), and because my stupid self didn\u2019t know that AP scores can be cancelled, I sent my 1 and 2 along with my 5s and 4. \n\nmy ED school is really academically rigorous and selective, so I don\u2019t want my 1 and 2 to be considered by the AOs. so my question is, do AOs actually refer to my officially sent AP scores when reviewing my application? Is it possible for them to only consider my 5s and 4, the only scores I filled in on my common app? do I need to email and tell them to disregard it?\n\nalso, I had just requested a score cancellation to prevent similar incidents from affecting my UC application. but I wonder if colleges that have received my scores will be informed of the cancellation, and if it\u2019ll impact my eventual decision?\n\nsorry if the description seems long and redundant. I might be just overthinking bc I\u2019m stressed, really anxious, and love my ed school too much for my own good\ud83d\ude22",

I had really completed other parts of my application with perfection and my profile isn\u2019t bad, so I\u2019d really not want a 1 and a 2 to impact my eventual decision \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

If you do want to reach out, it would need to be a calmly, well written email explaining that you had not intended to share these scores, but since they were sent you wanted to give some context. Don\u2019t make it long or drawn out. Short statements.  \n\nAnyone else have thoughts?",
