  "text": "I know this is bizarre, but I honestly don't know what my GPA is and while I could look at it, I could also just look at it as soon as I apply to college and just... not look at it. Any reason I should see it? Knowing what college I'm \"likely to get in\" isn't reason enough for me. And I know it's most likely shit, so idk if I really even want to see. \n\nI'm not joking btw",
