  "text": "I don't have a lot of ecs, and im not sure what to do on the application page about this. I have two extensive volunteer positions that apply closely to my major that are very strong ec's, but other than that i dont have a whole lot. Should I add several weak ec's and 2/3 mediocre ones, just the mediocre wins, or leave it with the 2 strongest. Im not too stressed over this because i killed my sat, essay, ap exams and classes, but i don't know what to do about this. also i have no LOR's and I don't know if I should get them, and also who to get them from. Please help lol",
