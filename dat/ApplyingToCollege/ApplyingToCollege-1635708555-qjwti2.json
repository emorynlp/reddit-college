  "text": "Hey everyone, I'm currently a Sophomore in High School and started extremely early on my college applications. I plan on using my athletics (XC & Rowing) in my application as well as my AP classes. My absolute dream College is Stanford but here's where my problem lies. On the questions I'm answering right now (Why us, Historical Event, How would you affect the community) I struggle to find the right words to use. I'm worried I'll come off as self-centered or rude. I experimented with Show don't tell but I still struggle with that. So my question really is: How can I stand out with my wording and ideas?\n\nEdit: I realize I'm extremely early. I'm not losing sleep over not finishing them. I realize I have years to make those academic experiences. I really only work on the essays if I don't have a football game to go to or if a practice is canceled. I just want to make ideas and answer the questions I have a deadset answer on.",

You can teach yourself how to express identity and ideas by simply sublimating from your favs. And yes, to echo everyone else - go live your life for another 1.5 years.",

But I would say that now isn\u2019t the time to be focusing on essays, simply because you have a lot of growing to do\u2026 I read an essay from 3 months ago and can\u2019t believe how I ever thought it was good. Imagine what your future self will think of an essay you right today, not saying that you\u2019re a bad writer, just letting you know that you\u2019re likely to grow a heck of a lot in these couple of years. I think your time now would be best spent figuring out what you want to do and building a repertoire towards that with your ecs and other activities\u2026 so that when senior year rolls around, you\u2019ve actually done things worth writing about, you\u2019ll have a lot more experiences to draw from. But honestly, kudos to you for starting so early!! All the best for stanford I believe in youu",

Passion, dedication, commitment is something that seems plentiful, but its something that I\u2019ve always admired in people. I don\u2019t know how helpful this will be for you since I\u2019m a senior myself and I have no clue what AOs find appealing, but hopefully this helps somehow",
