  "title:": "I'm retaking the SAT December 4th, am I taking it too late? How will it affect my scholarships?",
  "text": "So I am applying to a community college and I want to use my SATs for scholarships. My old score is pretty above average at a 1270, but I think I can go higher.  The thing is I'm not sure if it's gonna be too late to affect my scholarships. If my score changes could I send the new score to them after applying to change their decision? \n\nAlso, should I submit my old scores now and then send the new scores again when they get released?",
