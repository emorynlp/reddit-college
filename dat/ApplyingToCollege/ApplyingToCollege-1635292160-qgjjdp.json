  "title:": "Lack of Humanities in Portfolio?",
  "text": "Hi everyone! I am an international applicant who is keen on applying to Harvard, MIT, and Stanford.\nMy current portfolio is essentially 95% tech (i.e. internship, research projects, courses etc.) and 5% finance.\n\nWhen I reached out to students who got into Harvard and Stanford, some shared that I may have a better chance at MIT compared to Harvard and Stanford because of how my portfolio is so tech heavy and lack any humanities.\n\nMay I ask if Harvard & Stanford prefers more well rounded applicant who also respects humanities? I am keen on exploring humanities but didn't have a chance to. Now that it may (arguably) my biggest gap in my profile, do anyone have any suggestion for me to build my humanities portfolio in a short period of time? \nP.S. Humanities is very board but the one that caught my eye is Philosophy!\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "I don't think you can predictably \"game\" admissions to a top school. No one has any idea what they look for, not to mention that colleges look for diverse classes. Admissions change all the time, and people who have been accepted in previous years might very well be rejected if they apply again. \n\nAs an international, I definitely wouldn't say you have a better chance at MIT. Yes, MIT traditionally looks for STEM heavy profiles, but as an intl. your chances are drastically low. \n\nThat is, of course, unless your 'tech' portfolio is at the ISEF/International Olympiad level. In particular, it's virtually impossible to gain admission to MIT/Caltech without international olympiad medals. Whereas, I would think a strong narrative, good essays, and great ECs (but not at the International Olympiad level) would net you 1 of HYPS with a LOT of luck. \n\nThat said, this is the US we're talking about. Any school would appreciate someone who has dipped their toes in different fields. It makes you a little less one-dimensional. It's a little late to do anything meaningful in the humanities, but you could write an essay about your interest in philosophy (but connect it to your overall theme, for example).",

          "text": "Hi! Thank you for your comment! I definitely am not trying to \"game the system\". I am merely looking at what gaps my profile may have and look forward to improving it. I understand it is very competitive in MIT and I definitely don't expect the journey to be easy.\n\nOn my end, I am really intrigued by the opportunities available in top US Colleges and thus I'm looking for any ways possible (within reasonable limits) to improve my profile\n\nThank you for commenting!",

              "text": "Sure. \n\nI'm not quite sure how much you think you can do in 2 months. Colleges will see you started something for the purpose of college and not out of genuine passion. It's not a good look to be frank. \n\nAre there any essay competitions you could join near you? Maybe start a blog about certain humanities topics? It's more than likely going to have to be a personal project as many competitions have closed already. I think your best bet would be a personal project that is meaningful to you, and which you can elaborate on further in an essay. It would be best if your teachers can describe you as someone who loves to delve into different subjects too. \n\nKeep in mind you're likely not going to be able start a meaningful humanities EC in 2 months. It's going to be extremely hard to get decent recognition in 2 months. It's way way way too late in the process. Not to mention, a humanities EC should fit into your profile to an extent. You don't want it to seem out of place. So spend a short while thinking really hard on what's a good humanities EC and go straight into executing it. \n\nIf you're really keen on MIT, then sure, go for it. Generally speaking, MIT is very self selecting. The only guy I know who got into MIT in my country had gold medals in IMO, IChO, IPhO, and IOI. I had a friend with IOI silver and 3 patents get rejected (on top of perfect academics/stats). I would love to study at MIT but I'm not applying simply because I'm not at that level. If it's your goal, then by all means, go for it. I hope you prove me wrong haha. Good luck!",

And frankly speaking, as much as I am exploring humanities because I see a humanities gap in my profile, I am also looking this as an opportunity for me to explore humanities subjects which is very foreign to me!\n\nA win win situation if you ask me haha. I also don't think my profile is comparable to international olympiad but I'm trying my best! Thank you so much \ud83d\ude04\n\nAs for philosophy, I'm thinking to do some phiolosophy courses and perhaps some famous books. I'm not sure if I have time to join a competition but writing blogs about my thoughts sound like a great idea! Thank you for that haha.\n\nApart from blogs and competition! If you have any idea of fun (and short) humanities project, I'm keen to hear haha",
