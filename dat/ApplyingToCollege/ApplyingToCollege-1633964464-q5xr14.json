  "text": "Most colleges will have 2K+ students, so how the fuck could you not be a good fit somewhere at the school. Your telling me that unless your application makes you out to be a \"good fit\" personality wise your gonna do bad at that school? That's so many people! You'll meet people who you mesh with and will growth with!\n\nit feels like each college has Schrodinger's student body that's at times really diverse and has many points of view and personality types but at other times is all one cookie cutter good standup person who helps their community and is smiley and happy. YOU as an applicant need to fit into this mold of the perfect X college student while also showing your unique and bring something new to this school!\n\nThis is crazymaking.\n\n Why would they try to assess personality it just seems useless and silly?\n\nLike I get you need to make sure your not admitting assholes but even that isn't really readable in an application if your just a nominally smart asshole who can conceal their bad nature a little bit.\n\nGahhhhh just let us write about our academic interests it would be so much more fun!",

If a school is a very collaborative, engaged community, service oriented, etc, but you prefer to stay in the library studying 24/7, then you\u2019re not a good fit\u2026 even though you might do very well there academically.",

      "text": ">Most colleges will have 2K+ students, so how the fuck could you not be a good fit somewhere at the school.\n\nBYU has more than 2k+ students.  Would you be a good fit there?  What about Liberty University?  Point being:  while large, some schools' student bodies have a definite \"flavor\" which may clash with certain students.\n\nAlso, many people include things besides the student body when assessing \"fit\".  Some students may feel (perhaps wrongly) that they would not do well in large lecture classes, so they prioritize schools where they will never encounter such a class.  Or they might feel they'd be miserable in a rural setting vs. urban, or vice versa.  Some students really prioritize participating in Greek culture, so they want schools where that is a big thing.  Other students hate it and want to *avoid* schools where it is a big thing.\n\n>Your telling me that unless your application makes you out to be a \"good fit\" personality wise your gonna do bad at that school?\n\nGenerally, no, that's not the claim being made.  The claim being made is that you might be *unhappy* at a school where you're a poor fit.  Or if not unhappy that you might be happi-*ER* somewhere else.\n\nI'd add, though, that \"academic fit\" is also kind of a thing.  If you get into a school where you are legit one of the *least* gifted/driven people there, then the odds of you doing poorly are somewhat higher than if you went to a school where you're among the *most* gifted/driven students.  Something to consider.",

          "text": "okay i get what you saying, and i agree that it makes sense to try to find  a school that \"fits\" in terms of location, class size, political/religious lean, greek life and all that other stuff you can find on the website. For sure take that into account when choosing schools that is a totally valid measure of fit in my books! \n\nAnd yes also you for sure need a school to be an academic fit, being the worst student there would probably make things rough!\n\nI'm just frustrated with how college websites make it seem like their students all have some special intangible personality trait that the AOs are able to sniff out in applications. It doesn't seem to me like that personality trait exists outside of the schools website, so why does my supplemental essay have to explain how I have that undefined personality trait. \n\nidk maybe i'm just really sick of hearing idealistic descriptions of students. Like this one from the brown's makes me want to vomit. \"At Brown, undergraduates are creators, leaders and doers who are not satisfied with merely raising questions \u2014 they learn to confront, address and solve problems facing society, the nation and the world.\" \n\noh my god please shut up not every one of your students is that ideal and its silly to think they are!\n\ngahhhh im just being driven crazy by colleges!!!!",

              "text": "It's marketing.  That Brown prompt in particular.  Every school wants to project the image that its students are uniquely academically strong, intellectually curious and exciting people to be around.  Many students would prefer not to attend a school whose students are all money-grubbing prestige-whore grinder types.\n\nNow, whether or not their prompts actually allow them to select for students who are intellectually curious, exciting people to be around...yeah, that's an option question.  To a degree the prompt probably helps, but the main applicants who get selected out are the ones who are either too clueless to intuit what sort of response the school is looking for \\*or\\* who aren't capable of crafting a response that checks the right boxes.",

However, it requires you to be self-aware (and honest) about of your needs as a person and a student. AOs are looking to admit a cohort of students. Their decision to admit you is based on not only your one sense of \"fit\" but also how well you fit into the cohort they are crafting.
