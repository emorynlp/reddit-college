  "text": "This was it! The baseball finals. It was the bottom of the ninth. I got up to bat and bang! Wow!!!! My leg was shot off. Then another BANG! My other leg gone too. Legless I lay on the floor like a worm, then I remembered a quote from my favourite movie \"life is like a box of chocolates\". \n\nNo! I said. I wasn't going to be just another chocolate but break out from the box entirely. I spent my high school years breaking social norms. I cheated on every test because I am outside the box type guy. Determined, I got up to bat again and Bang! HOME-RUNN! I did it I won the world series. I am the best ever. Thank you for listening.",

      "text": "OMG reminds me of the deliberately bad essay I wrote \"for\" Brown a while back\n\nAs Forrest Gump once said, life is like a box of chocolates, and Brown University offers an amazing variety of chocolates. From the white chocolate of the humanities to the milk chocolate of the arts to the dark chocolates of the sciences, I want to eat all the chocolate Brown has to offer without being restricted. So although I will be majoring in classics, I also want to study more than it. I want to learn about other, different things. For example, languages. I want to take courses on other languages, like Ukrainian, so I can have a better knowledge of languages and understand them better and thus understand Latin better. Secondly, history. History is really interesting and I\u2019d like to know more about it beyond just Rome. In contrast, I also have interests unrelated to Classics. I really like science and math and would like to know more on them, and I also do a lot of art. I love those things and if there were classes I had to do at Brown, like in most schools, I would not have time to explore them as much as I want to.",
