  "text": "Hi everyone.\n\nI am currently applying to universities in America, after taking a gap year. I need recommendation letters, however I feel like it would be rude to ask my teachers, again. Last year I asked and apparently all their comments were combined into my testimonial. Also, I contacted my careers advisor from school, but she doesn't want to be my 'counsler referee' to attach my testimonial for each application. Furthermore, I don't need to ask my high school for my transcripts, because I can find all go mine online.\n\nWhat should I do? Should I just create another coalition account and add them myself?",
