  "text": "With all of the ED/EA coming out, it\u2019s hurting my soul to see all of these kids I\u2019ve known for years have their dreams stomped on. I know they\u2019ve worked hard, they\u2019re in my classes and I see how much effort they put in, and it just isn\u2019t fair that all of us are killing ourselves over this to have them send out a prewritten letter telling us that we weren\u2019t good enough for something we worked so hard for. Everyone deserves to get into their dream school. I get my ED back tomorrow, and I\u2019m generally not sure how to address it or how to feel. This is the school I\u2019ve been hyper fixated on since I was 13 years old, the school I\u2019ve poured every ounce of my energy into for months. And all of that effort and energy gets a quick, thoughtless response tomorrow. It\u2019s a pre-written email that they put my name in, that\u2019s it. My life, my achievements, everything was evaluated in 10 minutes by a board of people where maybe one of them has actually met me. Honestly, seeing so many people get their hearts ripped from their chests makes me wonder if it was even worth pouring all of this effort into this.",
