  "title:": "I moved out from my abusive household after graduating in May and have been living on my own ever since working and paying my own bills. How do I explain this to colleges and fafsa?",
  "text": "After graduating last May, I moved out of my house from Oklahoma all the way to my home state in Michigan after saving up money from working in part time jobs for two years. I secured a room for rent and have been working in light industrial jobs through a temp agency ever since. \n\nI did apply for fafsa and to other schools last year but realistically I knew I wasn't able to go to college right after graduating because I just didn't want my family to have no involvement in my adult life, and I didn't want to be dependent on them to get through school (they were gonna help out anyway).\n\nI am reapplying to schools I applied to last year, but I don't know how to explain my situation to them since most of their requirements needs parent information, which I don't have since I moved out. My family don't support me so I don't know how to explain this to schools or fafsa, because I know they don't consider students under 24 to be independent unless under certain circumstances.\n\nWhat should be my next step in applying for schools/financial aid stuff?",

      "text": "You could contact the regional admissions counselors for your target schools and explain your situation, in detail. Many aspects of your situation make you a more desirable candidate. You showed tremendous strength, initiative, and resilience in going out on your own after coping with an abusive home situation that did not offer much support. Having a job and arranging and managing your own housing and survival speaks volumes about you, even if it seems normal or not special within your own experience or context.\n\nTry to communicate openly and directly and make sure you include the basics of your academics.\n\nYou can also ask for referrals to other schools or resources as the person you speak/write to is likely to have knowledge and experience in education in your area (or target area). You can also ask if they can refer you to organizations that work with people in your situation.\n\nAlso check out the Coalition App, an alternative to the Common App. Maybe their site has some useful info or referrals.\n\nI'd also suggest that you not allow social discomfort or shame or anything else to allow you to fail to communicate the planning, saving, work, and just general wherewithal you needed to even get this far.\n\nGood luck and don't drop the ball!\n\n*edited a typo",
