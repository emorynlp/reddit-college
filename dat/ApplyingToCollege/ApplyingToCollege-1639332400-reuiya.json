  "text": "this is for all the people who ,,know\u2019\u2019 that they\u2019re gonna be rejected from their ed school and will be devastated (including me!)\n \nfutureme is a site where you can write a letter to yourself and have it sent to you sometime in the future, so i wrote one to be sent on my decision date prepping myself for the oncoming sadness and reminding myself that my ed school isn\u2019t perfect\n\nthis is super pessimistic but I know that I won\u2019t be able to listen to other people\u2019s condolences so I\u2019m putting it straight in my letter and hopefully i\u2019ll be less sad that day (and the following days too)\n\n\u2026or you can write a congratulatory letter for if you get in but imo that just pours salt into the wound if you don\u2019t",
