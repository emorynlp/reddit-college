  "text": "Every time I write a \"why us\" essay, I obssess over the school, fall in love with it, make my essay a romantic love letter...until I have to write another essay for another school and I move right on to my next true love.\n\nAnd since I'm so finicky, I can't even remember why I liked my ED school in the first place. Like let's compare:\n\nUChicago: it has so many amazing traditions that are time-honored and it comes off as intellectual but eccentric and I love it\n\nColumbia: NEW YORK! I love their engineering and humanities approach, specifically their mission to use engineering to help the environment. Also their emphasis on arts through their museums is amazing\n\nStanford: I hate Cali but I love how Stanford looks at intellectual vitality and how it tries to actually know the applicant (not saying the other colleges don't, but Stanford gives me warm loving vibes until I get hit by the rejection letter)\n\nPenn: \\*\\*\\*crickets\\*\\*\\*\\* their mascot is a Quaker :|  \nHonestly, I would love getting to Penn cuz I know that once I get there, I'll fall in love again but I'm looking forward to not writing any more essays more than the actual getting in part LOLLL\n\nI think it has to do with the fact that I wrote Penn supps so long ago that I rlly don't remember what was so magical and captivating about it",
