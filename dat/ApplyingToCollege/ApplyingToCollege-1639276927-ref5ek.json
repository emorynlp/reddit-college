      "text": "Depends on where you live and other parts of your application. If you live in rural North Dakota where grades are (usually) inflated, a 33 would've def positively impacted your application IMO. If you have a lower than average gpa, a 33 would've positively impacted your app. If you go to a school with known grade deflation (like a prep school or competitive bay area public) AND have a 3.9+ gpa, you'll be fine for UChicago. Essentially what they've said is that the SAT is just another part of your application to showcase your academic ability, so if you truly showed that then ur fine.",
