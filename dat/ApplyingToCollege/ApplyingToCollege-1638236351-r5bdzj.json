  "text": "I live in a very small country, one of the smallest in the world by land area and population in fact. We don't have any accredited colleges or even high schools for that matter. My dream is to go to uMiami. Can the admissions office like the idea of bringing me as someone from a very small country to their school almost to help their image and that whole idea of \"giving everyone from every demographic a chance\" type thing?",

              "text": "You'd actually be grouped in with other international applicants, regardless of their race. Any student studying in the USA on a temporary basis is considered a \"non-resident alien\" or \"international student\" *for diversity/demographic reporting purposes.*\n\nIf you see the UMiami ethnic diversity pie chart here:\n\n[https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/university-of-miami/student-life/diversity/](https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/university-of-miami/student-life/diversity/)\n\nInternational students are grouped into their own category, regardless of their ethnicity or race.\n\n**Being Latino/a as an International applicant:** If I'm not mistaken, I don't think being Latino/a as an International applicant is going to have any effect on your application as it would if you were a US resident, because of the point I made above.\n\n**Being from a very underrepresented Caribbean country:** Being from an underrepresented country could be a boost among other international applicants, and it could make for a good essay topic. But the most important factor as an international applicant is actually being able to pay in full/not needing any financial aid. As for being from an underrepresented Caribbean country for UMiami, idk, who knows; maybe it could help. I'm really not sure.\n\n\\----\n\nDon't fret too much about this though, just focus on your application and what you **can** control. You can't control some things like your country of origin, your ethnicity/race, or your GPA from previous years of high school. I really hope you get into UMiami. It's a really fun school with a really amazing campus and warm weather, and I feel like you'd be a great fit.\n\nBest of luck. :)",
