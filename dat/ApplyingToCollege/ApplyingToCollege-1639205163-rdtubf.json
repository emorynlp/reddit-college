  "text": "I got into Dartmouth ED. They want me to pay 30k a year but my family makes less than 20k. I can at most pay 10k and even that's gonna be hurt. I was wondering if any of you who appealed had their aid change as dramatically as I need to rn.\nAlso, I'm a bit confused over the appeal process so can someone help me please)",

They are very reasonable people. \nDo not hesitate",

      "text": "First of all let me say congratulations on such an achievement!\n\nMoving on, don't hesitate to reach out to them (usually by emailing the financial aid office) and say that your estimated cost of attendance is too high and that you need more financial assistance. I recommend that you do it ASAP before they close for the holidays so you could get a quicker response.\n\nIf, however, they refuse to provide enough money to cover your needs, you can be released from the ED agreement, but I recommend not cancelling any of your future offers and your Dartmouth one unless everything is settled. \n\nAdditionally, if you do get a better acceptance + aid offer from another school but would rather attend Dartmouth, you could use the amount of aid you got from that other school as leverage to help you with your case on financial aid. \n\nGood luck and once again congratulations! Even if you dont end up in Dartmouth, I have no doubt that you can get into other great schools and do well nonetheless",
