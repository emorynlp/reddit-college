  "text": "Hey parents!!!\n\nI know this time of year can be SO difficult for your children. Here are a few of the things I did that I think were most helpful for my daughters: \n\n-Checking in on if they were meeting their deadlines\n\n- Reminding them to ask teachers for letters of recommendation\n\n-Encouraging them to apply for financial aid sooner rather than later \n\n-Reminding them that they are more than just their college application success! \n\n-acceptance rates are only low if you want them to be :) \n\nAnd yeah, that's about it! Hope this helps, y'all \u2665\ufe0f\nDon't stop working! You don't get anything in this life if you don't work for it!",
