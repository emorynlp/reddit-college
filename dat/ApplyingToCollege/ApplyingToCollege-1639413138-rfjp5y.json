              "text": "Kinda, it\u2019s what most used before wholistic with schools like GA Tech using it at least in 2003 but many solid schools like Iowa State or UIowa still use it. It\u2019s where they plug your numbers into a spreadsheet and if you come out above a certain number you are in. So not quite the opposite.\n\nMost schools switched because they are receiving more applicants than they have spots. So they have to consider things like character or what your favorite thing about every school is.\n\n[this might explain it better](https://sites.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2016/01/13/holistic-admission-the-struggle-is-real-part-1-of-3/)",
