  "text": "Since it's Thanksgiving, take some time to reflect. \n\nLook back on your high school career. Really look back and examine how much you've accomplished and just how much you've grown. \n\nWhether you're applying to community college, your state school or Harvard, applying to college is difficult. You should be proud just for pursuing any form of higher education. \n\nHappy Thanksgiving everyone!",
