  "text": "Can you call an acitivity something else on the common app? At our school it's called Scholastic Bowl, but I wrote it down as Quiz Bowl on the common app. Quiz Bowl is more descriptive, and I'm already tight on words to explain it in the common app activites section. I feel like if I put Scholastic Bowl, ao's would not know what I am talking about.",
