  "text": "**So next Wednesday is the deadline my school set for me to finish all my essays. I got a personal and 5 supplemental to finish, and I need to learn how to write an interesting narrative, so I am going to practice here until Wednesday:**\n\nThe color blue has to be the most mundane and independent color. It shows up on yoga mats, as blue socks, or just simply on your fat face when you finish eating a blueberry pancake. It is without question that blue accompanies us as we move on through our daily lives, but there\u2019s no reason to believe it should.\n\nA self-proclaimed Harvard student (me, a 17 year old in high school) had done a study with a random sample of 2 strangers on the colors they see in their daily lives. The 2 strangers were hesitant to share their answers as the researcher ask questions hastily and with great question, but let\u2019s not talk about that. In the study, the Harvard student concluded that most colors one see in life constitutes of orange, red, green, and a light shade of black. No respondents included the color of blue, and this conspires the hypothesis: Did humans made up the color blue?\n\nAs a teenager my mind has always been filled with the fantasizing of the universe. The expansive dimension available for us to discover has always been right over us, yet it is with difficulty that is humans learn to stop and appreciate the beauty all around us. We create the market, destroyed natural habitats, and cumulated all our intelligence for the establishment of the color blue.\n\nHumans start calling out the color blue on all things not blue. The ocean, the sky (which in itself-is not a thing, this self proclaimed Harvard student claims it is a frequency of the light you are perceiving. Which light in itself cannot be defined as one \u201cthing\u201d), and whenever humans start to feel sad. It is without a doubt that this greatly affects the way humans has believed in the existence of colors, as in reality, blue often never shows up.\n\nJust like the color blue, I wasn\u2019t natural to the world itself. It was through my experience in life that had co stricter my personalities, and it often includes a lot of struggles through life\u2019s difficulties and pursuits of my passions. I find the mysterious world around us overwhelmingly difficult to process, but just like the color blue, maybe it\u2019s meant to be so as I have long felt the urge to create my own path.\n\nI picked up a camera and start shooting the world around me, adding meaning to the small details that isn\u2019t often highlighted. I went to charities to find a way to use my passions for other\u2019s benefits, as I believe we all have unique talents to give to the table. Just like the color blue, the mundane in the details of the world and in the tiny acts of actions in fact stand out in a crowd of red, yellow, or green colors. The independence of blue has always been what defines me, and one day I believe just as how blue has dominated the human world, my independence will allow more creativity to sprawl in a world of endless possibilities.\n\nWriting time: 15 minutes",
