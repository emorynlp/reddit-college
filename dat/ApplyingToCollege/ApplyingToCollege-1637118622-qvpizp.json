  "text": "Hi! So I'm currently applying to college right now (already got accepted to Duquesne!) As a computer science major. When I was in 10/11th grade, before COVID hit, Carnegie Mellon was my dream school.\n\nWhen I did my AP CompSci A exam, I got a 1. A 1 when I nearly got 100 in the class. And I accidently sent it to Carnegie Mellon.\n\nAdmittedly, I'm still waiting on my second SAT score and my GPA is a 3.68. Did I ultimately screw myself over with sending this score or do I still have a chance? Did well with all of my compsci classes in highschool. Sorry if wrong flair!",
