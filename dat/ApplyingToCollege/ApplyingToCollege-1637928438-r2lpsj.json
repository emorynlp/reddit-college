  "text": "Hi, I'm an international applicant. My intended major is Computer Science. Because of COVID-19, I couldn't take SAT, so I'm going test-optional. I'm considering Smith, Carleton, and Middlebury for ED2. Which one should I choose?\n\nAbout Smith, everything is perfect. The only thing is that it's a women's college. And I have absolutely no ideas how life would be in single-sex education. Most of my best friends now are boys :)). I'm wondering if I can fit in easily.\n\nCarleton and Middlebury are great as well, but I'm afraid they're a bit out of reach. However, if their Computer Science program is way better, I'll take a shot.\n\nMy efc is about $20,000/year. Can you give me some advice?",

      "text": "All 3 offer great access to professors. All 3 are great schools.\n All Carleton classes are taught by professors,  no TA's, instructors,  etc. Not sure if Smith and Middlebury are the same. \nSmith is considered an elite school.. Carleton and Middlebury are generally considered among the *most elite* LACS. Carleton is often singled out as having the best undergraduate instruction of any school. \n\n It's very difficult when you can't visit. But any of these schools will provide you among the best educational opportunities in the world. Go to sleep happy if you are accepted to any of the 3.  Bring a good Winter jacket to Smith. Bring a better Winter jacket to Middlebury. Bring the best Winter jacket you can buy to Carleton!\n\nMine chose Carleton over several ivys. He couldn't be happier there.",
