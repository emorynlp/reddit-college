      "text": "Need blind would be for admission purposes. These schools may or may not be need blind (you can google that). This is different from meeting full need. PSA, public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more.\n\nAmong those in the list, U Mich may give some need-based aid to low income out of state students.\n\nRun the *Net Price Calculator* on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.",
