  "text": "Hi! I'm debating whether to put my Scholastic Arts & Writing national medal under the honors list or the activities list (under the description of \"Creative Writer\"). Putting the award on the activities list would give me space to write one more honor. On the other hand, I'm worried admissions officers may miss the award if it's under the activities section - is that a valid concern?\n\nthank you so much :)",
