      "text": "No. I\u2019m a Vanderbilt student, and anecdotally from my own experiences and my friends\u2019 experiences, a large portion of ED applicants are offered an interview, while a random minority of RD applicants is offered one. That said, I\u2019m pretty sure geography is a limiting factor for in-person interviews, even for ED applicants (i.e. I know a current student from the Deep South who got one but another from the West Coast who didn\u2019t). Most of my friends here from RD weren\u2019t offered interviews.\n\nAlso, you absolutely are special. Good luck if you applied ED to Vanderbilt! \ud83d\ude01",
