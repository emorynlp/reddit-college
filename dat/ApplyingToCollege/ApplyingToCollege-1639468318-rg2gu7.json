  "text": "I took one year of foreign language. It was Chinese at the AP level and got A\u2019s (6th year level), but regardless, still one year. I scored 5 on the exam.\n\nLooking back, I probably should have asked to go into a lower level to get more years. It would give me more honors credit too.\n\nI\u2019m not a native speaker. My parents are Chinese, but I mainly speak English at home. It was not only until late elementary and middle school that I studied Chinese a lot and able to make it straight into AP.\n\nI\u2019m looking to go into CS, and a lot of universities will have less foreign language requirements in their engineering college.\n\nFrom the common app, they will be able to assume from my parents\u2019 Chinese names and my Chinese last name that I\u2019m Chinese, even if I don\u2019t check the race box.\n\nI still have time left before applying, but if I continue on my strong academics and continue with my activities and awards I\u2019m going for, I feel like this will be one of my big weaknesses.\n\nIs this a red flag in my application? Should I use the additional info section to describe my situation like I do here? And since a lot of schools don\u2019t view AP scores for admission, should I add in additional info that I got a 5?\n\nNote: UCs will be fine, it explicitly says on their website",
