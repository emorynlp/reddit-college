  "text": "i got a 2.9 due to family issues and to moving. i was in. pretty bad spot and my teachers for freshman and sophomore were not really understanding about it, i\u2019ve moved schools almost 4 times due to me being hospitalized for a couple of months. i have some extra curriculars at the schools that i had went to like soccer, cheer, and i was the last stugo prez at my last school. i had to move high schools three weeks ago halfway across the state due to my family moving again. i like my new school and i finally feel happy and safe for now at this school. i feel like i won\u2019t get into any of my former dream schools now, plus once the schools see my major of choice being physics i feel like they\u2019ll think i\u2019m too stupid to be at their school. im having major doubts because i feel like i could\u2019ve done more and i could\u2019ve been more able to really show off my skills in highschool if at the time i had the stability and support. the thought of me going to a  state school here, being so close to my family makes me miserable and i think the state overall makes me feel like i\u2019m in a hell pit everyday. i don\u2019t really know where i should be applying or if i should even apply at all. help pls",
