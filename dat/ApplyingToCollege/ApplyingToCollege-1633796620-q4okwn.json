  "text": "Does anyone know any affordable college application review services that offer to review the whole application? The ones I\u2019ve come across so far either only offer to review essays or have insane pricing. I\u2019ve finished my application to Yale (single-choice early action) and need someone to look over it all, from the activities section to my essays. My budget is around $400.",

It costs around 185 USD per application, and I\u2019ve heard a lot of good things about them. But I do have some reservations and rather prefer to have professionals with solid experience to do the work. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve settled for Veritas Prep (and bumped up my budget to $500). :)",
