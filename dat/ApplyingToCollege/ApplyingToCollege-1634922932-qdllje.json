  "text": "I need advice regarding a math grade transfer. A little back story. I took college credit classes in highschool and am now going back to school for my second college degree. I'm getting ready to schedule my final semester for this degree. All of my transfer credits are in my account and showing up. \n\nHowever, my math credit from my senior year is showing up as a Pre-Calculus grade. The math class that my current degree requires in Business Math or College Algebra. When I went to schedule my previous semester of classes the person I talked to (we schedule them over the phone because it's an online degree) said that if it doesn't transfer as one of those two I'd have to retake it. But the Pre-calc credit is technically a higher math. Is there any way I can appeal or test out? \n\nThe college is Eastern Gateway Community College and the math credit is from Ohio University btw!",
