  "text": "\"When I started, I could only make pieces with eye-bleeding colors and malformed figures. ***Hell***, I didn\u2019t even know the difference between pencil and watercolor. \"\n\nThese sentences are in my personal essay for the common app. I've heard that cursing in personal essays is risky but I feel like its use here both emphasize how new I was (to give contrast to my current accomplishments and show progress) and also gives the essay more personality, as If I was directly talking to them. I can't think of a way to do both of these without using the word hell.\n\nThank you for any feedback.",
