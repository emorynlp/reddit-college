  "title:": "Northeastern CS is underrated\u2014FAANG Feeder",
  "text": "As a senior at Northeastern University that's already accepted a Software Engineer job at a FAANG company in Silicon Valley next year, I felt obligated to explain why A2C is fast asleep when it comes to Northeastern's computer science program (I used to lurk often way back when I was applying to colleges).\n\nFirst of all, let me make the following quite clear: Yes, everyone and their grandmother has read the ancient 2014 article in Boston Magazine about Northeastern gaming the college rankings. So what? To \"game\" the rankings, we:\n\n- Became [one of only 37](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_research_universities_in_the_United_States) private R1 research universities in the world.\n- Grew our endowment to over a [billion dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_University)\n- Became of the [best universities](http://csrankings.org/#/index?all&us) for Computer Science in the world.\n\nWith a little googling, you might be surprised. Turns out life is a little more complicated than some online rankings. If you're one of the people willing to let USNews decide the course of your life for you, my condolences. I wish you the best of luck!\n\nTo everyone that prefers to make decisions based on evidence, here's why Northeastern is criminally underrated for Computer Science:\n\n- Northeastern's unique approach to teaching Computer Science has been adopted by many \"more prestigious\" universities, including: [Brown, University of Chicago, Northwestern, Waterloo, etc.](https://felleisen.org/matthias/Thoughts/Developing_Developers.html), but we're the one's learning from those that invented it. It turns you into a truly great engineer.\n\n- Northeastern is among the top 15 feeder schools into Big Tech/FAANG companies by total number of graduates employed, [with more grads in these companies than schools including MIT, Harvard, Brown, UPenn, Duke, etc.](https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/top-feeders-tech)\n\n- Adjusting for total undergraduate enrollment at these top tech feeders, Northeastern is still among the top 20 feeder schools into Big Tech/FAANG, [beating out schools including Yale, UIUC, Hopkins, University of Michigan, University of Chicago, UCLA, etc.](https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/top-feeders-tech)\n\n- Obvious from the above, companies like [Facebook](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/event/nu-alumni-learn-about-working-at-facebook-software-engineer-and-alumni-panel/), [Apple](https://calendar.northeastern.edu/event/apple_on_campus_undergraduate_networking_event), [Amazon Robotics, SpaceX, Tesla, etc](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/) actively recruit on campus.\n\nYou get the idea. USNews might not think we are great for computer science, but the FAANG companies constantly recruiting our students sure do. Most of my friends and I co-oped for these companies and got return offers.\n\nI think it's safe to say the rankings have been successfully gamed. Best of luck with your apps!",

But nice post nonetheless.\n\nedit: a tad bit obsessed with rankings ngl tho. for cs especially, as long as you go to a decent school with decent name recognition, all you need to do is tailor your app to said company (like do projects in whatever language they use) and ace the interview. leetcode every day baby.",

I don\u2019t exactly see why producing employees for a specific set of companies is an indicator of the quality of education when half of getting an interview is having referrals at the company? I also don\u2019t get the creepy obsession with working for FAANG when these companies are typically top of the list of companies responsible for exploiting employees, undoing the fabric of society, and writing  and writing the book on how to flaunt user privacy. So many more cool things to do in life that be Bezos or Zuckerbergs busboy.\n\nFuck rankings, go to a school you vibe with and that gives you what opportunities you want. Prestige is meaningless",

          "text": "Definitely agree with this. It\u2019s unfortunate that it\u2019s become common thinking that getting into FAANG is any indication of academic quality at an institution. It may be more of an indicator of the pressure students put on themselves applying, in hopes of success to fulfill an idealistic vision of security. Financial security is a great thing, but I\u2019ve come to realize that the role of top institutions is to get students more deeply invested in bettering humanity. This one precious life we have is not a race to FAANG or other big tech companies. With that said, Northeastern is a good university. It attracts talented students.",
