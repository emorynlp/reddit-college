  "text": "hi, i\u2019ve been really interested in a lot of liberal arts colleges lately, and a lot of them tend to be in more random locations and have a smaller student body, which i like for the most part. my only concern is that, being gay, there\u2019s less acceptance at those schools than somewhere in a city\u2026 also the fact that it would be hard to find a boyfriend LMFAO but that\u2019s less important (although it does make me a little bit sad). does anyone have more information on what it\u2019s like, or could someone who is lgbtq+ and attending an LAC share part of your experience of you\u2019re comfortable? thanks :)))",

      "text": "A lot of small liberal arts schools are really accepting despite the area around them being more conservative -- they attract a lot of students who are from all over the country/big cities. I had friends who attended Oberlin, Wooster, St. Olaf, Gustavus, Luther, and Grinnell (yes I am Midwestern) and said the schools had very liberal/accepting atmospheres. Your biggest problem with finding a boyfriend at some of those schools won't be lack of other lgbtq students but the fact that there's only like 1000 people there lol \n\nIf you're still nervous about it, you could look for an LAC closer to a city? There are definitely some LACs that aren't rural, like Macalester, Occidental, Davidson, & Lewis & Clark.",

This is what a senior and a junior currently  attending the LAC told me - \n\n\u201cI have never felt more safe to explore my identity than I have here. I cannot guarantee that if you are a member of LGBTQIA+, you will be safe a 100% of the times on campus. But I do think you will find plenty of people who will support you.\u201d \n\n\u201cThere are obviously very different groups of people who attend LACs, especially ones who are generous with aid.some groups are more progressive than others. But in general, the student body and the faculties are very progressive.\u201d\n\nI think you could look up if the LACs you\u2019re applying to have resource centres for LGBTQIA+ communities or get in touch with students who currently attend the college by emailing them. Good luck!",
