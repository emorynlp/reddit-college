  "text": "I am a junior right now and I am taking three APs (APUSH, AP Chem, AP Comp Sci A). I am also taking precalc honors and I literally don\u2019t get trig. I got my quiz over graphing trig functions back today and I got another C. It\u2019s the fifth C in a row. I have a B- rn in the class overall. I also took the math chapter test today and I didn\u2019t get the last problem. But I think I did okay. But I keep thinking I did okay on the tests and I get a C so idk anymore. I also want to go into computer science so my math grade is kinda important. \n\nThis year has been such a struggle for me so far. I had all As in 9th and 10th grade but this year, the only solid A I have is in English. Even my extracurriculars are overwhelming me rn. For example, I am part of a research lab rn and I got assigned a task to get a part of a project done. And it\u2019s a lot of work and takes a lot of time/effort. On top of all that, I have been dealing with some health issues. I just feel so drained and stressed.",

Ask for after-class sessions, for extra examples. Anything to develop a relationship with your teacher. This is crucial not only now but when you get to college. One of the best relationships you can nurture.",

They\u2019re slipping and idk how to get back on track. My ECs take up so much time ta I could be using to improve my grades and idk. In 9th and 10th grade, I was a perfect top student lmao. I\u2019ve been told to break everything down and focus on one issue at a time, and to use my holidays wisely. I hope that advice can help you. Wishing you the best!",
