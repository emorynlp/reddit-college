  "text": "I submitted my ED application on November 15 (yep, in my case the deadline was not November 1) and my counsellor approved my common app fee waiver. However, on the school portal the Fee Waiver results \u201cNot waived\u201d. I\u2019ve been waiting until today bc it is written that it might take some days for the various parts of the application to result on the school portal, but now what should I do? \n\nPs: I\u2019m an international student.",

You can also use this same form to ask them for a css profile fee waiver. You'll ofc have to fill it all again tho.",
