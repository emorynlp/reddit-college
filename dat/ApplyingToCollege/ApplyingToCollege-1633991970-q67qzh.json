  "text": "What do I put down for the activities section if I plan to keep doing it? For ex. I started one of my ECs senior year and if I put 20 weeks (when I've been doing it for 6 weeks) I don't want AOs to think I'm lying but then again, it is something I am going to continue doing after i submit my application.\n\nI wish common app had a button that said something like \"to present\" so that they know  I'm still doing it",
