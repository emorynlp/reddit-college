  "title:": "Is a selective college even right for me?",
  "text": "Basically, I\u2019m having serious doubts - not about whether I\u2019d belong at a selective college, but whether I\u2019d even enjoy it. I hear about intense academia, competitiveness, and just an overall intense focus on school. \n\nI just can\u2019t imagine myself doing this since I don\u2019t have a subject I\u2019m passionate for. I\u2019d love to learn about the world and myself, and those around me believe I have serious potential to create change, but I can\u2019t imagine focusing so hard on academics when I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing it for. \n\nI want to have fun in college. I plan on doing sports. I want to go to sporting events and party. I want to go out with friends every weekend. I want to socialize and have fun.\n\nI care about school, and want to learn, but can I get those things as a T20 school? I\u2019m scared of videos like \u201cThe Unspoken Reality Behind Harvard Gates\u201d. I\u2019m scared that students in the \u201cAsking ____ students _____\u201d seem to know so much about what they\u2019re doing and where they\u2019re going, and that I won\u2019t survive there if I don\u2019t have the same drive to succeed and stay on top of it. I\u2019m scared I don\u2019t have the ability to balance athletics and academics if the academics are too intense. \n\nHow do I know if I would even survive at a T20 school?",

I guess most T20s don\u2019t really have that but the schools I have down currently in my Questbridge rankings are BU, USC, Duke and Rice for those reasons. D1, decent (BU, Rice) - very good (USC, Duke) sports culture, good academically. I\u2019m really just worried if I end up matching to any of these I would regret it because of the academic culture. I want to make an impact and believe I can but my workload throughout high school has been really moderate compared to a lot of other smart kids and people on this sub. I\u2019ve never really struggled so hard and I feel like this would change and I would probably have to adapt my time management and stress tolerance at a T20 because I have no other choice. I just don\u2019t know if I feel this way because I\u2019m a slacker or if I\u2019m just able to do things that people struggle with, I have no basis to compare myself because my situation is entirely unique.",

Or do you just want to go somewhere where there is a sports culture, go to football games etc?   All I would add is that if you are unsure at all, I would not go to a T20 school.  They all have acceptance rates in the single digits and everyone there is both super smart and very dedicated.   No one really goes there because the financial aid was better than the state school option.  It\u2019s hard enough even if you come in 100% committed.   I would talk to your guidance counselor and maybe do some research on lots of schools and look at the costs and potential aid.  I\u2019m sure you will find a good fit. Maybe apply to several and compare the aid options when deciding.  If you have he scores and grades to get into a T20, you probably have the goods to get a full ride somewhere else that wants you.  Our state has a Governors scholarship that pays 10g a year to any state college here with a certain SAT, GPA and/or National Merit.",

It\u2019s all coming together pretty quickly since I have to decide by Nov 1 whether I want to apply to all 4 or not. If I don\u2019t match then I\u2019ll be able to apply RD and compare FA options. \n\nI don\u2019t know. It sucks. There\u2019s no one that\u2019s so stuck in the middle like me. There\u2019s plenty of hard workers that are smart. There\u2019s plenty of smart kids that are slackers and don\u2019t have a chance at a T20 because of GPA and ECs. I haven\u2019t ever met anyone that\u2019s T20 smart with the stats and ECs to back it up but not confident in their own stress tolerance. \n\nMy whole life, I\u2019ve always heard it gets harder at the next stage. Middle school is harder than elementary, high school is harder than middle, college is harder than high school. None of that has ever been true for me. I feel like my lack of struggle will bite me at a T20, but I\u2019m exactly the person that you\u2019d think would go to a T20. Does that make sense? I feel like I\u2019m smart enough to handle everything that comes my way but I just don\u2019t know because I\u2019ve never been pushed to that point ever before. \n\nI hope this doesn\u2019t make me come off as cocky. It\u2019s frustrating to not be able to talk about it without sounding so.",
