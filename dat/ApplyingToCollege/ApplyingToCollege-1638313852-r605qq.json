  "text": "I tried looking up how I'm supposed to add the classes I took at local cc for college credit, since the FAQ common app website says to only put DE courses in the Courses & Grades section, and I have seen to put them under the colleges & universities section but there's no option to input courses there? Am I missing something or is there another place where I can put them in?",
