  "text": "I\u2019m switching into an independent study and I need to give up either Environmental Studies or Spanish 5 Honors to fit it into my schedule.\nOn one hand, keeping Environmental Studies would give me a fourth year of science, keep me in a class with a bunch of my friends, and allow me to take an ethnic studies elective with even more friends of mine that is co-taught by two teachers that I know very well. On the other hand, staying in Spanish 5 would be more applicable to my life (I grew up in a Spanish-speaking household/family but do not speak fluently), give me college credit, and boost my GPA to keep my class rank up. I would also be able to take a public speaking class with my old English teacher. My intended major is Economics, and if you couldn\u2019t tell, I\u2019m in my senior year.",
