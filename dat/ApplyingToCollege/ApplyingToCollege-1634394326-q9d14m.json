      "text": "If it's competitive then I'd classify it as an award/honor.  In the activities section you might list something like, \"Music Performance - Flute\".\n\nThe activity is that you play flute.  The honor/award is that you were named to the NAFME orchestra.\n\nI don't have a ton of experience w/ this, though- will defer to others.",
