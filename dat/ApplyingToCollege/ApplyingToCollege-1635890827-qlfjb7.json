  "text": "I suggest your read through the forum today and observe:\n\n\\- Dozens of \u201cOMG, my application was x minutes late, what happens now?\u201d posts, despite the repeated \u201cdon\u2019t wait until the last minute\u201d advice (and common sense)\n\n\\- Dozens of \u201cI didn\u2019t know X school required official test scores\u201d, \u201cwait, do I need a CSS, what\u2019s that\u201d, etc. posts (also over the last week). If you\u2019re applying to a college, reading and understanding what they require, and by when, is a really, really good idea.\n\n\\- Dozens of \u201cI forgot to put x\u201d, \u201cI put the wrong y\u201d, \u201cI found a grammar error/typo etc\u201d, \u201dwhat do I do now?\u201d posts. (again, common sense says you should get this right)\n\nWhile there is zero chance that we won\u2019t see this again on January 2 - don\u2019t be one of them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(and read the footnote on the Common App describing why your scores don\u2019t appear. Or at a minimum, read the many, many, many other posts with the exact same question and believe that the answer applies to you too).",
