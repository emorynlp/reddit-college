  "text": "Hopefully, this doesn't count as a chance-me post. If it does, then maybe the mods can refer me to a place that'll allow me to discuss it.\n\nI'm a veteran transfer student that'll be in my mid-20's when I start my junior year next fall. I'm a decent writer, and I think I can write compelling personal statements based on my experiences as a veteran. I have an extensive work resume that placed me in leadership positions in multiple locations. I have a lot of volunteer hours, which include helping various organizations. Overall, if I can execute it properly, I think I can display my life to be a pretty well-rounded and experienced one (truthfully, it is).\n\nMy biggest concern is my GPA. I could have a 3.71-3.84 GPA, depending on how well I do in my last remaining courses. Holistically, most people I've talked to (current grad students and mentors) have said that I should be considered by the top 20 schools. I have the story and experience for it. My worry is that my GPA will turn them away. Assuming the worst GPA of 3.71, is that good enough to get me a second look at some of the Top 20 schools?\n\nAm I being too hard on myself? Any admission officers here that are willing to share what they can?",
