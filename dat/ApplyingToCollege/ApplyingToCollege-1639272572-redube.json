  "text": "I just got my email to l schedule a georgetown interview and I\u2019m suddenly so scared. I searched up my interviewer and I don\u2019t think we have any commonalities. On top of that, I don\u2019t have a great experience with interviews and I\u2019m so worried that I\u2019m going to make a bad impression since I\u2019m not that good at making small talk with strangers. I have no clue what to expect and I\u2019m so nervous right now just thinking about it. Any tips for the interview?",

Just prepare for the why us question, looking for specific programs classes mission statement etc. If you\u2019ve already written an essay like that you\u2019ll be fine, just refresh a bit. Otherwise, just answer naturally and tactfully honestly (obviously don\u2019t share anything problematic). You\u2019ll be fine and GOOD LUCK!! Also check out the interview thing on the subreddit",

I\u2019m definitely not looking forward to writing the supplementals. How long it take to get yours? Or did you mean that you haven\u2019t filled out the first one yet? But good luck with your interview!",

All the supplement stuff is easily available online so I think I\u2019ll probably just work on the essays now and then closer to the deadline submit both parts within a few days of each other. Good luck to you too!",
