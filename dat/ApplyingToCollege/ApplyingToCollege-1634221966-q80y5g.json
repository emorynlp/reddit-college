  "text": "I am from Mexico and I changed schools after finishing my freshmen year since here middle school is from 7th to 9th grade. I don't know if I should ask my old school for a school report . I don't know what to do. If someone knows please help me. My school wont help me at all. They have never used the common app so I have to research it for them.",
