  "text": "Hi guys. So for my personal common app essay/statement I had this idea about using a thing (trying to be vague) to describe  my personal struggles and then link it to my academic interests and hobbies. I even structured it and knew what to put in each para. When I was done writing, I went to Google and tried to find a synonym for my thing and saw an essay that was similar to what I wrote (thing was the same, the last sentence of the essay was more or less the same)..but i described it differently (though some words were same  because the thing could be described in just those words) but all my other personal stuff was my own and unique to me and how I used that thing to connect to me was different\n\nI checked it for plagiarism it nothing came up.\n\nBut still....am I in trouble?",

      "text": "Maybe, but not necessarily because of plagiarism. It sounds to me like your struggle is too generic, try and make it more personal covering personal stories and similar events. If it is so generic that another essay covers the exact same topic to a frightening degree then try and adjust the topic to focus on you.",

          "text": "The topic was very personal to me (used specific real life anecdotes and such) . \n\nWhat  was similar was the THING and me describing it (physical description, how it looked, the color etc) which i try to make it sound different but there are just some words that I had to use. .e.g. the crow was black, how it fluttered away it the sky...its pitch black eyes reflected my own \n\nSo I can't change the color of the crow or the sound it makes \n\nSame thing with the 'thing' I used \n\nMany people would have written the same stuff about it (used exactly words to show case its physical descriptions). My way i wrote it is different but some words and phrases are similar. Do you get what I am talking about?",
