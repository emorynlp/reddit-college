  "text": "Hello, I am looking for any non-profits that are already impactful for CS/STEM and wanted to help them by starting a local chapter for them. I don't want to make a fake, for the application, type nonprofit, rather help out something established by setting up a local chapter. Any ideas from anyone here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: for boys ",

      "text": "Hey, I\u2019m from VA and was looking for anyone to form a Super Position Chapter. (You don\u2019t have to be from VA, since everything we intend to do is virtual). If you would like to help out, please let me know! I believe some established and wide impact nonprofits for STEM include INTERSTEM, Super Position, and Girls Who Code. Some mental health nonprofits would be like Letters For Strangers. Look for nonprofits that seem to have well built up websites and social media sites that demonstrate their impact effectively. I think setting up a chapter is a decent idea and better than just creating an entirely new nonprofit. I personally like Super Position a lot and they do host a lot of good workshops and hackathons.",
