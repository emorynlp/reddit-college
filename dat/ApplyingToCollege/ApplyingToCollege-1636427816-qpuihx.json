  "text": "Covid really impacted me last year. In a bad way. It was my sophomore year of high school and my grades went down the toilet. I just can't do online school. I got mostly Fs last year, with one B and one C (in both semesters). Really bad compared to my freshman year, where I got only 3 Bs and the rest all As in both semesters. My GPA dropped to 2.5 unweighted and 2.8 weighted. Now I'm in my junior year, it's looking like I'm going to have 2 Bs and 6 As this semester. I'm repeating a class next semester and am going to attend summer school. I still don't think I'll get my unweighted GPA above a 3.3 though, and it's really stressing me out. \n\nAny advice on what to do to get my gpa up and what colleges I should realistically apply to? I want to major in mathematics but I don't think I'll get into one of the better schools and it's really stressing me out, even though college applications are a year away for me.",

      "text": "Most colleges will have a section where you can explain the impacts of covid. I have a 3.25 GPA (grades all over the place for all years of high school) applying to mathematics and I already got into two schools. Seeing how you had specific circumstances that affected your grades and you are now doing well and working to do better, you will have a better chance than me. I wouldn't stress about it so much. A lot of colleges look for a positive grade trend in your junior year and I'm sure they're sympathetic towards the effects of covid. What colleges were you looking to apply to? I assume you're currently a junior?",

          "text": "I'm probably going to apply to a few Ivies/schools like Ivies just because of my dream schools being Princeton and Stanford, even though I don't think I'll get in. Another reach school is UC Berkeley. For safety schools I'm thinking CU Boulder, UNR (cause I'm from Nevada). Haven't really found any target schools though, mainly because I have no idea what would realistically be a target school and not a reach school for my situation. Be honest - do you think there is any chance I'll get into a school with a <20% acceptance rate?",

For math the [top schools](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/search/?cip4=2701&cip4_degree=b&fos_salary=70000..150000&page=0&sort=completion_rate:desc&toggle=fos) (ranked by graduation rate) and sorted by salary do skew elite. If you are stressed understand that your grades just qualify for admissions. What actually gets you in is your story. You make your story through activities and essays so you will have to work on those.",

Right now I'm in Key Club, a science club, and a math club, along with a non-school-related religious youth group (it counts for extra-curriculars). Sometimes I feel like I'm doing too much but have to make up for not doing anything at all in the past two years",

My recent practice ACT scores have all been above 25 without studying though, and I've started studying so I'll hopefully score higher.\n\nI'm currently taking AP Research and AP Calc AB. I have an A in both classes so I think I'll get at least a 3 on the tests. Like I said, last year was horrible for me and I only got a 2 on the AP Seminar AP test. Next year I'm planning on taking Jumpstart English (I think that's dual enrollment) or AP Lang along with AP Calc BC and AP stats if I have an elective free (although I heard the teacher for stats at my school isn't very good...) If I don't take AP stats I want to take another AP class but idk which one to go with :/",
