  "text": "During my 9th and 10th grade years my grades were fairly average. Sure they weren't bad, hovering mostly around 87-88 / 100 (thats a 3.3 gpa I think?), but they weren't the best either. However in my junior and senior year, my grades have improved drastically, with my first quarter grades of senior year being at 3.9 UW. I'm really proud of how much i've improved, but i'm concerned that my earlier grades will hold me back. So will these grades hold me back, or is my freshman and senior year grades good enough already?",
