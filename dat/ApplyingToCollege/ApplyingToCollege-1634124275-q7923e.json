      "text": "Hi!\n\nThank you for doing this, I have a question about graduate admissions.\n\nI am a \"non-traditional\" student (28F). I am hoping to apply to some graduate school programs after I graduate from SUNY Empire. My GPA is currently a 4.0 and I'm aiming to achieve a similar GPA by the end of this semester. I volunteer as a court-appointed special advocate in my community and prior to returning to school I was the chef of a restaurant in Brooklyn. I would really like to apply to the University of Albany's PSYD program but I'm worried that SUNY Empire has a bad reputation or isn't taken seriously. I don't have any negative experiences with the school or my classes but I have read some concerning opinions online. \n\nPrior to attending SUNY Empire, I attended SUNY New Paltz (3.8 gpa) and Hofstra University (Honors College). I have legitimate explanations for the gaps in my resume. \n\nSo, my question is:\n\nDo you have any insider information or views on SUNY Empire? Does a 4.0 gpa at this institution hold the same weight as it would at another SUNY school? I would really like to become a school psychologist, and UAlbany is my ideal school.\n\nThanks again!",

      "text": "Hi sorry I\u2019m a little late to the party but I could really use some advice on transferring! It\u2019s a long complicated story so I\u2019ll be brief \n\nI applied to stony Brook and got accepted back in 2018 and only stayed maybe 3 months max then dropped out due to financial issues and incompetence of the admissions/financial department staff. They wanted to hit me with a 13k$ bill even though I dropped out a day after the cut off date for Tuition and claimed I was an international student even though I have lived here my whole life (only bc I am on DACA). Long story short , they sent my bill to collections then sent it to the attorney generals office who dismissed my case so I have yet to pay the school anything. I also never spoke to anyone there after the fact due to the depression and anxiety the whole situation caused me but am planning to talk to someone this following week. \n\nMy question is this. I am now ready to go back to school and wish to go to FIT this coming fall after having gotten my associates at SUNY Suffolk community college in 2019 but am afraid that I have been \u201cblacklisted\u201d from ever getting a SUNY degree since this was one of the threats they used when trying to get me to pay. Is this a possibility even though suffolk gave me a degree no problem? I just really want to move on from this SBU drama but not sure what to do.
