      "text": "Hi!\n\nThank you for doing this, I have a question about graduate admissions.\n\nI am a \"non-traditional\" student (28F). I am hoping to apply to some graduate school programs after I graduate from SUNY Empire. My GPA is currently a 4.0 and I'm aiming to achieve a similar GPA by the end of this semester. I volunteer as a court-appointed special advocate in my community and prior to returning to school I was the chef of a restaurant in Brooklyn. I would really like to apply to the University of Albany's PSYD program but I'm worried that SUNY Empire has a bad reputation or isn't taken seriously. I don't have any negative experiences with the school or my classes but I have read some concerning opinions online. \n\nPrior to attending SUNY Empire, I attended SUNY New Paltz (3.8 gpa) and Hofstra University (Honors College). I have legitimate explanations for the gaps in my resume. \n\nSo, my question is:\n\nDo you have any insider information or views on SUNY Empire? Does a 4.0 gpa at this institution hold the same weight as it would at another SUNY school? I would really like to become a school psychologist, and UAlbany is my ideal school.\n\nThanks again!",

Just because you\u2019ve read some bad things, doesn\u2019t always means it reflects your current college.

(Mostly B's, 3.3 GPA.)\nThere's not a lot of 4 year schools for this major, but I'm wondering how competitive admissions are. I want her to have realistic expectations. And I'm wondering if it's worth it to try to pad up the EC's.",
