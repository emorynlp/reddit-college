But there are a good number of terrible frat people at Wharton, a lot of entitlement, country club mindset, etc. I\u2019m from Philly and know some non-Wharton professors, and they groan when they see Wharton students signing up for their classes.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s still a great school and a great broader community. There are really solid people there too, and you\u2019d no doubt find your place both within Wharton and with other Penn students. I hope you get in!",
