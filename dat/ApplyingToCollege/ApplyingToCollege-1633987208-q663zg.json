  "text": "Okay this is probably dumb question but how do the college portals work? After we submit an application on common app does the school send specific log in info? Or would we just make an acc and then connect our common app or something? \n\nAlso, I indicated test optional on like all of my college apps. However, I\u2019m taking the SAT in like two days. If I get a good score, I\u2019d like for colleges to see it but the score will probably come past the EA deadlines. Would I be able to update the SAT info?",
