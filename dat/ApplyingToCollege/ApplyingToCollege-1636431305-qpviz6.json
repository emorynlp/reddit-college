Think of it as just a casual check in by the school and for you to ask questions.  Columbia sometimes even get existing students to do interviews.",

My kid's friend just had her interview, and told my kid that the interviewer said 'If it were up to me, you'd definitely be admitted.  But really, it's not up to me.'  Good Luck!!",
