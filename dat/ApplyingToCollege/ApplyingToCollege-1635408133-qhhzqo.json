  "text": "Currently I am looking to transfer to VT after two years in community college. I haven't met all my credits yet to satisfy my major. I need 60 credits and I only have done 44. There are few classes like Biology or Business Statistics that I have to do, which I was planning on finishing during spring semester of 2022. However, the deadline for Fall semester is March 1 of 2022, which is before my spring classes in community college end. Do I have to skip fall semester and try to aim for Spring semester in VT. I am very confused on how it works.",
