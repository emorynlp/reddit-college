      "text": "I\u2019m not an AO, so this with a grain of salt, but I think it definitely depends on how you spin it. Even if you don\u2019t list it as an EC, that can definitely be something for a college essay. I\u2019d rather hear someone talk about doing something new and interesting instead of giving the same old sob story. I personally don\u2019t use twitch, but if it\u2019s something you love, don\u2019t let anybody deter you from talking about it.",
