  "text": "i\u2019m 19 and graduated high school 2 years ago, i was planning on going to college for automotive technician but covid got worse and i pushed it for a year. next year rolls around and i was going to go to a college a couple hours away from home, just to get away and experience a new place. i had trouble moving to that area and i heard from some locals that it was a bad school so i decided not to go. now that i haven\u2019t been in school for a few years i don\u2019t know if i still want to go for automotive technician, i still love cars and it\u2019s a dream of mine to restore them but i heard that it\u2019s hard on the body and i don\u2019t want to ruin myself before i\u2019m 50. i\u2019m now in prep courses to take biotech, i love biology and i think i could make an impact through my future work. the only thing is that idk if i want to do it forever, i think after awhile im going to get bored of it. it\u2019s not just biology though, i feel like im going to get bored of most things. i don\u2019t want to put a whole bunch of money and time into something that i won\u2019t want to do my whole life. do i continue my path or wait until i figure out what i want?",

      "text": "Good for you for being so thoughtful about what you want to study.  Maybe study something that you could use in variety of work situations.  For example, nursing is very versatile.  You could work as a nurse in a hospital, school, or private doctor\u2019s office.  You could also work in field that requires a nursing degree but is not patient care, such as a claim reviewer for an insurance company or a clinic trial coordinator at a biotech company.  So, if you get bored of one job, you could switch to something very different that still uses your degree.",
