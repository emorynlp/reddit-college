  "text": "So I have an option to take maths undergrad degree at a well known university(in terms of placements,research) or a CS undergrad degree at a slightly less well known university(again,in terms of placements,research). I am interested in mathematics and have done a negligble amount of computer science(i did the most basic programming but thats it).But in financial terms a CS major is far more lucrative(atleast,I think).Also,almost all the jobs math people take on are virtually unrelated to maths,so is it worth studying maths in the first place?\n\nI have been trying really hard to come up with a decision,hoping you guys could help me.",

You can get a PhD in CS doing theoretical research with a BS in math. I seen this occur more often than you think.\n\nAlso, please don't pick CS just because I mentioned 6 figure salary. First, it is not as much as you think in bay area or NYC. Second, I know plenty of people (myself included) who gave up those salary to pursue something more interesting. Third, you can make similar amount of money (if not more) if you do decide to pursue the PhD in CS route.\n\nIf you are unsure, just remember that it is easier to go from CS -> Math in college than Math -> CS.",
