  "text": "I professionally translate Korean books and comics. My work gets around a couple hundred thousand to millions of readers. My clients are well known and are within the top comic/literary publishers in Korea. It's not an EC relevant to my major and I am bound to an NDA due to the nature of my work so can't disclose titles. How would colleges evaluate this EC? I can't tell if it's alright or not.",
