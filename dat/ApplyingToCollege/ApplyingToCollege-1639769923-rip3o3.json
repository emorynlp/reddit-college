      "text": "I would caution against reading anything into decisions from selective/ED schools. College admissions are largely random and selective schools get far more qualified applicants than they have space to admit. \n\nYou are more likely to get poor advice/feedback on your essays and change them in a negative direction than you are to make a positive change at this stage. It's hard, but the right thing to do now is to not worry about your applications and instead focus on the transition to college - wherever you end up.",
