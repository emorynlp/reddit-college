  "title:": "Is Making a Pc a good college essay idea?",
  "text": "So heres some background info. I have some semi supportive parents whove I've always tried their best to support me. Often by \"pressuring\"(support) to do things their way. Building my computer was the first thing I've ever done by myself without their encouragement. It didnt work, so i kept at it until i did. Which gave me the confidence to do everything that they said i wouldnt do good in, managing a job while in school, taking the bus by myself, repairing eletronics, getting an A in math etc. \n\nOverall just a college essay about how me taking a risk (400 dollars) and 6 months of planning into building a gaming computer that initally didnt work, but after another month of hard work, I made it work and ever since that I've done things with and without my parents support etc\n\nI wanna know if its a good idea?",

I can also post what i have in writing so far down to see if it is going down a decent path?",
