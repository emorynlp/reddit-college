  "text": "I'm finishing my final tasks rn and I'm a bit confused on a bit of it. On the HS Course Entry task do I put in my senior year even if I'm still currently enrolled? I don't think I do cuz you need to know your end of year grade and IDK that yet. I've also emailed my meningitis vaccination proof and my transcripts have been sent but neither of them says completed. Could anyone help me out?",
