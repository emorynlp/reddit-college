      "text": "The ones Ricky says. \n\nI don't do any work with scholarships, so I don\u2019t know a lot, but I know that the best scholarships come from the colleges themselves \u2014 either in the form of merit or financial aids or discounts. Beyond that, I've heard Pinterest and Instagram can be a great resource, with parents and teens doing a lot of research and pinning and gramming\u2014 who knew? Search \"college scholarships 2021 or 2022\u201d or \"college scholarships.\" Apparently, there\u2019s a lot of people doing a lot of sorting there.\u00a0\n\nI met with a rep from raise.me and that seemed pretty cool \u00a0 -- but it\u2019s more helpful for 9, 10, and 11 grades.\u00a0Note \u2014 any money you receive from them comes from the school itself, so it will be rolled into what you receive from the school \u2014 not on top of.  \n\nAnd, be aware that some colleges will reduce your financial aid if you bring in outside scholarships.\u00a0 So before you spend a lot of time looking for scholarships, make sure your colleges don\u2019t do that.\u00a0\n\nIn my college counseling groups, I\u2019ve heard people mention the following websites, but I\u2019ve never explored or used any of them. My best piece of advice is don\u2019t pay to join one of these.\u00a0\n\nMerit More\n\nTuition Fit\n\nGoing Merry\u00a0\n\nCollege Express\n\nwww.CollegeScholarships.com\n\nFast Web\n\nCollege Raptor\n\nhttps://myintuition.org/",
