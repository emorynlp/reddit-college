  "text": "So I\u2019m applying to college, and I have to send my SAT and TOEFL scores. I know these are sent through the CB and ETS websites respectively. However, will I need to confirm any details on the application or will the college match the score to the application?\n\nOne more thing, I read that the college uses name to match scores. I am an international student, and where I\u2019m from, we don\u2019t have first/last names. Our passport just has a \u201cname\u201d field. I am applying using the first 2 names and I used the same name on my SAT. On my TOEFL however, I had the option to use a \"name\" field as on my passport and so I typed in my first 4 names. I will give an example to illustrate (this is not my real name, nor do I know anyone with this name):\n\n* Passport Name: Liam Noah Oliver Elijah William James Benjamin Lucas Henry Alexander\n* SAT and College Application Name: Liam Noah\n* TOEFL Name: Liam Noah Oliver Elijah.\n\nWould they still be able to match the documents? I have already heard that they are fine with some variation, but is this too much?",
