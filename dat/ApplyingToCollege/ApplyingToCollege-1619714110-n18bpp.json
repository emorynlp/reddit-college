He was actually a really likeable guy and pretty funny, but I had him first period at 7:30 am when everyone was half asleep and we didn't learn half of what the other sections for the class learned. No one really gave a fuck (him included) because we were mostly seniors and it was technically an elective (I actually could have skipped my final and completely bombed the class and still graduated), but it would suck if it was for like algebra 1 or something else mandatory.",

If they pretend they know what the heck they are talking about and get into arguments with students who know better, then fuck that they are screwing people out of a real education.  My AP stats teacher was like that, he didn't know shit.  To cover up for it he wouldn't hand back tests ever and wouldn't let you see them until we went to the principal and it turned out he had graded the tests wrong and basically taken points off that weren't correct.  I had a solid B in that class and was one of the highest grades because of that BS, and he had the balls to come up to me before the AP tests and tell me that if I studied really hard I might get a 3.  Try fucking 5.  I had already learned stats from a previous research class so I knew he was full of shit but there wasn't anything I could do about it in his class.",

For example New York just released the pathway a year or two ago to accredit post secondary teachers in computer science. Thus many of the AP CS teachers are people who were hired to teach something else, and maybe never took any computer science courses.",

That sucks for the other 2/3 or other half to get thrown into the maelstrom, and you'd like to blame the schools/districts, but they're facing an impossible problem too, because that same paper cites another paper that says over the next decade there will be an unmet need nationwide of more than 20,000 CS teachers.",

Its my first year and had to learn Java on the go.  Also teach Javascript, and Python.  Only code that I have any proficiency on is HTML/CSS.  Teaching a programming language at a high level for folks that haven't created something in code is especially difficult.  I'm gonna have to say there is most likely a shortage of teachers who understand coding logic, let alone the syntax of a specific language.  I understand the frustration, but the resources to fill in the knowledge gaps for the CSA test are out there.  Know your classes, 2D arrays, and this test is going to focus a lot on inheritance.  Good luck!!",

I'm actually more convinced having a bad CS teacher makes better programmers because having a job in CS is finding resources and creative ways to find and fix problems with limited prior knowledge.  AP CS A is very academic, being a programmer isn't nearly as academic.  Funny thing is, folks I hired before becoming a teacher that had programming experience ended up using visual basic in Excel for most of their technical work...and a lot of pure development folks were math majors, not CS majors.",

I heard a rumor that he had gotten a 2 on the AP Comp Sci exam and I wouldn't be surprised if that were true lol. He was also incredibly rude and an overall dick. \n\nHe no longer teaches cs at the school I go to, but I have a friend who has him this year for precalc. Even though he would always talk about how he failed multiple math courses in high school and college.",
