  "title:": "This is so bad, but I kind of wish my friend hadn\u2019t gotten into the same school as me",
  "text": "I helped my friend with all her applications. She had no idea how admissions works for top colleges, and I wanted to help her since I had already gotten accepted early to my dream school. I helped her apply to my school and others. She got rejected everywhere except for my school, where she is now going to attend.\n\nI\u2019m really not sure I want to go to college with my friend. I was happy she got in, but then I realized she will now be coming to college with me. She is extremely needy and clingy. She expects me to help her with everything \u2014 scholarships, college apps, schoolwork. And she is very attached to me. I wanted to branch out in college and be my own person, but now I\u2019m going to be tethered to her. She\u2019s already talking about how we\u2019re going to take all the same classes and do all the same clubs, and I don\u2019t want to. She also is so fucking possessive and won\u2019t mind her own business. She constantly tries to figure out the password to my Instagram so that she can read my DMs because she says \u201cfriends don\u2019t have secrets\u201d and she says I\u2019m a manipulative bitch for \u201chiding things\u201d from her. She says it\u2019s rude and hurtful. \n\nAlso, she constantly wants to butt her way into things that are, well, not really about her. Whenever I win an award, she gets mad that I didn\u2019t tell her to apply. She copies everything I do. Applies to the same things, wants to do the same ECs, wants to apply to the same programs. Recently, I was asked by a local magazine to do an exclusive interview about my college process. She found out and butted her way into it by saying she\u2019s going to the same school, so she deserves to be in the magazine too, so now she\u2019s part of it to. I kind of wanted to have my own moment. I\u2019m sick of her invading my life.\n\nShe\u2019s also obsessed with my physical appearance. She always says I\u2019m beautiful, but she constantly points out my \u201cflaws.\u201d She says I have body hair (I don\u2019t) and that I\u2019m \u201chuge\u201d (I\u2019m not), which she claims is a compliment because huge is just another word for tall. She claims neither of these things is an insult.\n\nShe also says I shouldn\u2019t get financial aid and mocks me because my English ACT score is a point lower than hers, even though she and I literally have the same composite score.\n\nPlus, she\u2019s now convinced she knows everything about college apps, even though I had to help her with everything, and is kind of arrogant about it. Whenever she meets a younger student, even if they have no interest in going to a top school, she portrays herself as a college admissions expert god and sternly lectures them on how to live their lives in high school so they can \u201cbe successful like her.\u201d This coming from someone who thinks Northwestern, Berkeley, and UChicago are just \u201cshitty state schools\u201d and not that difficult or impressive to get into. She knows almost nothing about college admissions because she relied on me for everything.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten increasingly more irritated with her. I was recently having a bad day and scrolling through texts. She starting looking aggressively over my shoulder to see who was texting me. I wouldn\u2019t show her because I\u2019m fucking sick of my privacy being invaded because she thinks she has a right to see my phone. She kept hassling me and saying I\u2019m \u201cso nasty\u201d and why won\u2019t  I show her. I finally snapped \u201cBECAUSE I DON\u2019T WANT TO. BACK THE FUCK OFF.\u201d She was appalled.\n\nI\u2019m just sick of her and angry at myself for helping her, because now I\u2019m trapped with her, and she\u2019s going to be dead weight anchoring me to high school and keeping me from fully diving into college social life.",

      "text": "drop her. 100%. this is one of those things where it's 100% in your hands to decide what your future will look like. send her a note explaining that while you're happy that she got in, you don't think the friendship will work out in the future but that you wish her all the best and then just go no contact. \n\nher behavior is not going to change, so think about if this is what you want the rest of your life to look like (dramatic but you get the idea). this is your life, and you are in control of it. now it's up to you to decide if you want to live the life that you want to live, or to be tethered to someone who will only stop you from doing that. \n\nalso, doing so won't make you a bad friend (you seem like the type of person who really cares about being a good person). being a good person doesn't mean letting other people walk over you. you've done more than enough, now spend that energy on something else and making actual friends who reciprocate good person energy instead of her",

She doesn't sound like a very good friend at all. It doesn't have to be a dramatic confrontation or anything. Just slowly reduce your involvement with her. As in, stop replying to messages, stop telling her about your life, etc.\n\nAlso, it sounds like you tried to put up with her to avoid hurting her feelings or starting a fight until you snapped. This is something I used to struggle with, so I know it's hard, and this also isn't your fault. However, if you choose not to cut her off outright, you *need* to set very clear, firm boundaries with her\u2014and you need to enforce those boundaries strictly.\n\nBTW, regardless of what you end up doing, I would start beefing up your online security. She's already trying to hack your accounts and stuff now, and if you drop her or start enforcing boundaries, she might just take it further.\n\n* Make sure you aren't re-using the same passwords or usernames across multiple sites, and set up two-factor authentication on as many of your accounts as possible. Use a site like LastPass or 1Password to randomly generate strong passwords that she will never be able to guess.\n\n* Change the answers to your security questions so she can't use her knowledge of you to her advantage (your childhood pet's name is now Or@nge123, your mom's maiden name is now Rand!m91872, and so on).\n\n* Tighten up your privacy settings on social media (e.g make your profile private, don't share your location on photos, etc) and make sure other people don't share information about you online or tag you in photos.\n\n* Disable \"read receipts\" on messaging apps and any features that show when you were last online. Also, disable message previews completely (that way she can't read your messages over your shoulder).\n\n* Delete or deactivate old online accounts that you haven't used in a while and have no intention of using further.\n\nReally, this is just good practice even if you don't have a crazy friend stalking you.",

They kept on actively seeking me out, and I didnt really know what to do.  So I just stopped talking to him.  I didnt bring up anything. Most importantly I didnt bring up the thought of him to my family or any one else.  if hes gone, he should be gone both physically and mentally. Anyways, dont room with her, dont talk with her, and ya that kinda what i would say.  In the end, you will have you own unique situation to deal with.. BUT YOU WILL HAVE A GOOD SOCIAL LIFE :)",

Tell her you're considering getting a job and you want to do the job during your current classes. Avoid rooming with her. You can blame this on your parents. Say they're overprotective, want you to get a job, and don't want rooming together to ruin y'alls friendship. If you are close w/ your parents, tell them about this. \n\nJoin a club and say you saw a sign for it last minute. Try your best to hang out with new friends and encourage her to reach out to new people. Say you want to meet more people together. Meet up with these friends without her. \n\nAlso, if you try to give her the hint and she doesn't take it, explain to her you need some space. Be honest, but kind. Explain that you want what is best for the both of you. If necessary, explain that you are also not a perfect friend either and want her to branch out to get more out of friendships.

You don\u2019t have to tell her you dislike her attitude, you can cut her off from distance. \nIf you still value the friendship, you have to be clear. Call her out on her ego and tell her you can\u2019t babysit everything for her.\n\nIf you don\u2019t speak up for yourself, she might eventually get you caught in a major problem she did. What will you do if she is caught plagiarizing assignment that you gave her? What  do you think will happen if you are blamed for it? Are you willing to risk your integrity for this person? Is she worth your time/does she reciprocate. You will meet many diverse and interesting people do not let one person ruin your experience when many others can amplify your experience. \n\nDo not dig yourself into a deeper hole. Good luck",

Turns out he actually did get into Columbia after being deferred! **4.** My male friend is so manipulative that he pretended to like a girl only as a disguise to sabotage her college application process, but after dating her, he actually ended up developing a crush on her and didn't screw over her applications! **5.** 2 people making fun of one guy by calling him stupid and that he probably got a tutor for his ACT.

      "text": "Hey OP, firstly I would like to say that there\u2019s nothing wrong with you having these feelings towards the situation. From what I can tell by what you have written is that you are in the right here not the wrong. Secondly this friend of yours is emotionally manipulating you by doing all of these actions. She sees that perhaps you don\u2019t have stiff boundaries and now wants control everything about you, this is not okay. No true friend would ever treat you like this as she mocks you, is obsessing over you, tries to know everything about your social media, tries to use you as a tool for herself as much as possible and when you take a stand against her actions she makes it seem like you are the unreasonable one and that she is always the victim. These are classic signs of an emotional manipulator as clearly she doesn\u2019t respect you, your boundaries or your dignity. \nMy advice to you would be to drop her from your relationship. I know it\u2019s difficult but she is just leeching off of your time and energy, in essence this is a toxic relationship and these should be cut out from your life as it will continue to take a mental toll on you (as it already has). If you can, you could try option A, the direct approach, which is to basically tell her that I\u2019m happy for you getting into that uni but I don\u2019t think that our friendship will work out so I think we should part ways (or something akin to this). Option B would be to slowly to cut her out of your life by not responding to most of her messages, not interacting much with her, etc. In both cases she may again try to manipulate you by saying that you are a horrible person that wants to destroy this friendship and that you are completely unreasonable. If this happens then don\u2019t mind it as she is doing this because she feels that she can still control you and keep the status quo that you have going. She certainly wouldn\u2019t like it that someone who has greatly helped her get into a good school and constantly gives her almost everything she wants is now wanting to to sever this relationship and may try many manipulative things to get you back. If the above happens, just add it to the already growing pile of reasons and examples of why you don\u2019t want her as a friend and realize that she wants to keep leaching off of you and wants you to not be capable of having boundaries. If she doesn\u2019t make a big fuss about then it won\u2019t be very messy and hopefully that\u2019s what will happen. Best of luck to you OP and stay strong.",

These people get even more toxic and keep thinking they're entitled to you & your time, and get mad if you don't prioritize them over everything else. It's gotten this bad already, don't wait for it to get worse.\n\nI'm getting therapy and medication for severe depression now, and I'm getting better.I just wish I hadn't let anyone walk over me like that.  \n\nMy friend was constantly encouraged to go to therapy, but felt like it was a waste of her time, and thought very lowly about people who go to therapy. She didn't want to help herself get better, yet used the \"I don't feel good mentally, today\" excuse to consistently get me to do her work for her and basically carry her through high school. She was self-aware that she had problems, but refused to get help because she could just get me to live both our lives for her and take responsibility for all her assignments. It's left me traumatised. She would get her mother to call me and threaten me if I didn't do HER schoolwork for her, ,so I had no way out. I was trapped, manipulated and controlled, riddled with guilt for even feeling bad about doing this for her, because I felt like not wanting to do it made me a bad person. I still don't know why she did that to me, she claimed to love and care for me as a best friend.\nWe would've ended up in the same jni had I decided to stay back in my home country. I didn't. Because her mom had made it explicitly clear that she expected me to \"support\" her through college. I'm not going through this same sh*t again.",

Say your peace, don't indulge her arguments or please because i'm sure she'll have them and be done with it.",

      "text": "I mean, this is sorta why fights are necessary. Not the physical kind ofc. It's to lay borders, to show what something means to you, to prove a point perhaps. The fight would be for these things. For her to know you, you have to show her what it means to you by fighting.   \n\n\nIt's exhausting, it's annoying, it's almost pointless, but if ya want her as a friend, tell her to fuck off when ya need to. Tell her to get a life, tell her to stop bragging with no knowledge cause she might get called out and made like a fool. Not because you want her to stop having attention, but because ya think you would rather not have her be made a fool of by random strangers.\n\nWell, any friend I haven't fought with, I barely know their borders, what do they stand for? What do they like? Yes-people are agreeable but forgettable, they get trampled because their opinions don't matter cause it's whatever someone's saying at that point.\n\nIt's okay to direct your anger at her. Just make sure it's not for the wrong reasons. If she hates how you look or says weird words as compliments, it's really up to you if ya wanna explain why her words aren't exactly nice. Like, \"Ok, Tiny, so Tiny, what lunch we getting?\" The idea isn't exactly to hurt her but to have her empathize with that feeling you're going through.  \n\n\nThe final thing you really wanna remember is that there are people out there who've grown delusional. That because you haven't said anything for the past years that you've been together, that it's okay for her to be like this, that you are 'her person' that she can always use. Given the easy exposure of US citizens through the internet, your friend doesn't particularly come off as normal. Take care as you handle her, hysterics, denial, what-aboutism, dodging responsibility will all be things you will have to deal if she is who I think she is. Worst to worst, she might get physical or downright nasty as she breaks your stuff / goes behind your back to start spreading rumors maliciously.   \n\n\nAgain, take care as you deal with her.",

And just ghost/block her, \"oops sorry forgot to tell you when I got back\" etc. Realize that you've got a life of 60-80 years down the road and being nice now or worrying about seeing her on campus getting awkward is just a drop in the bucket. You're now a young adult and time for those in your life to stop the \"high school drama\" bs or you'll regret it. \n\nWhen I went to University the signup for classes was staggered by your year and then last name (seniors get to pick first, freshman last). There is no guarantee another person can get into the same class even if people show up on the first day to get on a waiting list for said class. If for some reason she is in one of the same classes, go to the teacher during office hours and explain that if there are any group projects, to not be put together. Also sit between others and ask them to not give up their seat if someone asks.\n\nOff topic: not all teachers are good / grade fairly etc. There are review websites that grade university teachers. Pick ones that meet your learning style for classes. Make sure, especially as a freshman, to make several alternative choices for classes. Prioritize 101 for your major, other 101s can be pushed to other semesters /years. Good luck!",

Talk to her first about how you don't like that she respects your privacy and other things that you feel are detrimental to your friendship. And if she doesn't do anything to change , drop her. Seriously, your mental health is not going to improve by you talking to her.",

It\u2019s very hard now because it feels like I have no one in my life, but the benefit from not having people taking from you without giving back is something I could never give up. I\u2019m looking forward to starting college and meeting new people, high school wasn\u2019t the best experience with that and I met some of the worst people I\u2019ll hopefully never have to see again. Best of luck to you, I hope you find some people to lift you up soon.",
