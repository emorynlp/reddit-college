      "text": "It's 9:46 PM and I'm reviewing apps. We obviously need to wrap the ED review up soon because it's less than two weeks until the middle of the month. I always, always, always post when I can share a specific date. I put the word out on my blog, Twitter, IG, the megathreads, and I'll add TikTok to the list this year. \n\nOh, and we have released on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays in the past. A Friday release is nice for some, but it's not a requirement.",
