  "text": "Today I had an interview with an alumn from my dream school and I think it went decently well. Should I write a thank-you email to him now that the interview is over? I don\u2019t want to annoy him so I am wondering if this is a good idea. Also, should I attach my resume to the email, because there were some things on my resume I didn\u2019t talk about? Or is this a bad idea?",

The role of the alumni interviewer is not to capture all of your ECs.  Presumably, they are listed in your application anyway.\n\nif there's something specific that you didn't mention during the interview, but you want your interviewer to know, feel free to include it in the email as well.  Again -- those things are not going to hurt you.\n\nAnd don't over-stress about the interview.  They are not that important (or not important at all) to your admission chances.  Unless you were rude to your interviewer or outright lied, don't sweat it.",
