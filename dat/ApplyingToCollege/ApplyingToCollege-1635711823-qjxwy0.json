  "text": "I'm not trying to burn my friend. I just think it's very unfair that most students have to write their own essay, when a majority (it's seriously a vast majority) of Chinese students use agencies in China to do all the work for them.\n\n\nThe way it works is, students (with enough money because it's expensive) find an agency that will help prepare their admissions to a foreign school. This includes writing CVs, Personal Statements, even fake letters of recommendation to be submitted to the school. These are typically written by an English native in America or some other English-speaking country. \n\n\nEvery once in a while, the students will attempt to write their own letters, and even those are edited beyond recognition, but the vast majority just submit answers to a template given to them by the agency (like academic history, internships, etc) and their documents are completely fabricated by the agency.\n\n\nIt's big business in China. And it must be because my friend who makes up PS statements for these students earns about $200 per 2-page paper he writes.\n\n\nFurthermore, these agencies know what it takes to get accepted into certain colleges, and the more top-tier schools they get their clients into, the more renown their business is in China and thus the more they charge.\n\n\nSo how can honest individuals compete with giant companies?\n\n\nUniversities have to know this, but they're not doing enough to stop it.",

      "text": "Everyone's aware of it, but what do you expect universities to do? The universities can hardly verify peoples' extracurriculars in the United States, let alone a country like China. There are many very strong candidates applying from China, especially from international schools, so it's not fair to disproportionately vet applicants from there. From my talks with admission officers, everyone is aware that this goes on, and they are a little more skeptical with students from these countries, especially with native, non-international competitions. Also, although these types of companies that do everything for applicants seem most prominent in China, they are all over the place, in not only India but also parts of Africa, Saudi Arabia, and so on.\n\nHowever, I would say that international admissions remains limited such that it's unlikely to result in domestic students being at an unfair advantage. The unfair advantage would just be for poor international students.",

Guess who are the sponsors of [Harvard crimson's yearly top 10 essays](https://www.thecrimson.com/topic/sponsored-successful-harvard-essays-2021/)?\n\nNow the good thing: International students and domestic students are not in same the bracket of consideration. The Chinese students are essentially in a hacker-only server.\n\nAnd the industry is extremely profitable but also very, very small. There's only a fixed amount of student's whose parents are rich enough to send them to international schools which the only outcome is to go to a international university (Chinese universities requires students to do Gaokao, which the international students cannot)",
