  "text": "The last 2 years of my life have been pretty stressful to say the least. Now that I'm finally getting back in touch with my friends and being invited to hang out, I'm forced to say no due to college apps (pressure from myself + parents)\n\nIf anyone is in the same situation as me, it will all be over in 2 months. I repeat. It will all be over in 2 months. Just gotta grind it out until then and have fun after.",

      "text": "I would be careful with this attitude, as I used to think this way as well. Don't say \"It'll be over in x and I will finally be at peace/whatever\". After one grind is over, another takes its place in my experience. Instead try to enjoy the grind, as it eventually gets harder (and you might find yourself wishing going back to the time where your main worries were school and college admissions). Obviously, there will be less grinding after college apps for a bit, but looking forward to those gaps doesn't work for me.",

But in between then I will do some apps in my downtime and just focus on my social life. consider cutting down if there are too many apps, but I cant tell you what to do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is your last year of HS, make some memories.",
