  "text": "I just had my alumni interview for Swarthmore College and I had so much fun!! I was really anxious about it, but we ended up talking for 54 minutes when it was supposed to be 30 min, and it was such a vibe. I got to rant about my favorite book! She told me about some traditions like the \"Screw Your Roommate\" (NOT what it sounds like)!! She also told me about how one of her professors snuck alcohol onto campus and their very small class had a late dinner and talked until dawn. I love this school so dang much!! I'm definitely going to cry if/when they reject me. But I'm really glad I decided to go through with this. Spreading the good vibes <3",
