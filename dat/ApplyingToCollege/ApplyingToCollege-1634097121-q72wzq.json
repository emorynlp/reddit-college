  "text": "A lot of good colleges list high school academic rigor as something they look at. In America (I think) that usually means taking APs and getting a good score in them, but how would that translate to international students doing A Levels? As a general rule you can take more than 3 subjects to make things harder, but do the colleges look at what subjects the applicants have to determine the difficulty level? Like, the sciences are generally harder (with a practical component, more challenging and lengthier syllabus). Harvard was the only college I could find with a dedicated site for UK applicants and they gave a fairly vague answer. Thoughts?",
