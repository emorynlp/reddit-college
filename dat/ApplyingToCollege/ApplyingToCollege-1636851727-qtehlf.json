  "text": "This is literally the worst application portal I've ever seen in my entire life. Sometimes it literally just decides not to let you move between tabs so you are stuck on personal information section for days and then even when it does let you navigate the application it randomly hits 404 errors and deletes all of your progress. The extracurriculars section literally doesn't even work properly, every time I save the page and refresh it literally deletes every single entry I've put in.  There is literally no reason why the application can't be in the common app and I'm seriously considering not applying at this point because of how bad this website is.",
