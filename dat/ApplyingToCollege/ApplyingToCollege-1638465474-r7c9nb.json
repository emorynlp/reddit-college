  "text": "USC offers merit scholarships to international students, and I really can't afford USC without it. \n\nOn my portal, it requires that I submit financial proof of my ability to pay the full 80k tuition. I don't have such proof. Should I withdraw? Or would I be able to leave that requirement if I'm looking for a major scholarship?",
