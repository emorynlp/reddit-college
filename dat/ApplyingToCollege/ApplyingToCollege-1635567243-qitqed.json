  "text": "so i requested letters from 2 teachers for 10 schools a couple months ago and they submitted the letters. since then, i have added more schools so i just now put in a request on naviance for them to submit the letter to the new schools. however, it automatically said that they submitted it. is this a glitch? i thought they had to send it from their end. Or is it that since their letters are in the system already, i can just send it to whatever schools now?",

Unless your high school has specifically turned this function off, which would be dumb.\n\nPlus, as you\u2019ve seen, the letter is now marked \u201csubmitted\u201d on Naviance.\n\nIf you\u2019re using the Common App, simply go to the school(s) you\u2019re applying to on the Common App and you should see the letters have been downloaded by the school.",
