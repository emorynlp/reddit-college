  "text": "I don't even know where to start. Basically I had to do a drop out prevention program because I missed so much school. I graduated with a 2.1. I'm afraid colleges won't accept me now. I don't know how to apply for colleges and basically spent my teen years being told I'd end up in prison for my entire life. I never had any family or friend's guidance. I'm 22 and I've waited long enough. These past few years I've tackled my trauma and I really want to better my future. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm interested in getting into a medical profession and currently I'm working in mental health care.\n\nEdit: thank you for all the amazing advice and encouragement. I really appreciate it. I was nervous about asking for help but I only feel more excited now!",

I just want to add that you go to community College to complete your general education units (GEs) before moving onto a 4 year. Many people (if not most) spend the first 2 years completing their GEs and then the last two years completing their actual major requirements. Going to community College first let's you get the GEs out of the way and if you did poorly in high school it gives you a GPA that looks nice on an application. Like you got a 2nd chance and made the most of it.",

He had like 5 or 6 years of community College because he did nothing but fuck around for the longest time before realizing he needed to do something with his life.

              "text": "The process will vary depending on where you live. In California (where I live), you can go to a community college, and as the UC's have agreements w/the community colleges here, you can do a certain sequence of courses and get a certain GPA, and with that, you're guaranteed admission to a good UC w/o any extracurriculars. This way, you can get into UC's like UC Irvine, Riverside, Santa Cruz, etc. To get into Berkeley/LA/SD/SB, you'll need more to offer (like EC's), but having a guaranteed backup (which is really good anyways) is amazing. \n\nI know that other states have similar systems; for example, University of Illinois has a guaranteed transfer system. If you enroll in these, you can get access to community college counselors, 4-yr-university counselors to help plan your courses and stuff. Depending on where you live, the process might be easier/harder. Good luck!",

They vary by state, but there should be a counseling department that will be able to help you. I'd say asap, before fall quarter starts, get on the phone with them. Check the local community College website.\n\nI know for California there is the Transfer Admission Guarantee program (TAG) which basically gets you an automatic acceptance if your college GPA is above a certain level and you take the classes they list on their site. Most states should have something similar.\n\nHonestly if anyone reading this is in high school I still recommend 2 years of CC and then 2 years of uni if you can stand to be around your parents 2 more years. You'll save like $60k minimum and you're honestly more likely to get into the state university you want since you're either guaranteed admission or at the very least not competing with the huge majority of people coming in as freshman.",

              "text": "(If I over explain anything, I apologize, I'm going off the assumption that you aren't familiar with the terminology)  So, in general, you'll pick a \"major\" (a field of study. For example, I'm a Philosophy major, so I study Philosophy), and the requirements for completing a \"bachelors\" (four year degree) in that major will be made up of three parts: general education, lower division coursework, and upper division coursework.\n\n General Ed is basically a sort of 'breadth' requirement: you'll have to take some introductory classes outside of your major just to give you the opportunity to explore different fields (for example, I started out as an Accounting major, and fell in love with Philosophy during an ethics course I had to take for my GE). Lower division courses are normally the introductory courses for your specific major, they give you a solid background to engage with the more in-depth material in upper division courses. And upper division courses are basically just more in-depth, major specific courses. Generally, you spend the first two years of college completing your general ed and working through your lower division courses, then spend your last two finishing up your upper division requirements.\n\nCommunity colleges are focused around getting your GE and your lower division courses done, so you'll spend around 2 years working through all that so that you can be ready to transfer to a four year school to finish your upper division requirements. Sometimes it takes longer: you might decide to change your major, or you might have to take some remedial courses if you aren't ready to jump right into college level math/english. \n\nAt least in California (I can't speak for other state's systems, since I don't have any experience in that regard), most community colleges have 'Associates Degrees for Transfer', which are basically 2 year degrees designed to meet the transfer requirements for the UC/CSU system. I would check the websites for whichever 4 year schools you're interested in, and look at their requirements/recommendations for transfers. They should list which courses/material they expect you to have completed prior to applying for transfer. Also make sure to speak with the counselors at your community college: they should be familiar with the transfer process in your state, and can give you guidance on what courses you should take/when.\n\n\nTL;DR: You'll mostly be working on prerequistes for your major courses/lower division coursework, general education, and transfer requirements.",

You can also get your general education out of the way and transfer to a 4 year college. \n\nSo spend some time looking at what your local community college has to offer then schedule an appointment to meet with and advisor",

Be sure you\u2019re taking care of your emotional and mental health as much as you focus on the academics.

They can guide you on which courses to take at community college as a pre-med and how many credits you can transfer (some colleges have limits on how many outside courses you can transfer and apply to a university degree)\n\nHope that made sense!",

Get your papers. You\u2019ll want to know your social, all your money stuff, etc. as you\u2019ll need a lot of that.\n\n3. Ask a couple people (not family!) who know you well, especially bosses or tutors or teachers at some point, if they\u2019d write you a letter of recommendation.\n\n4. Consider doing 2 years at a community college to get core classes taken care of. It\u2019ll be cheaper, and these classes you can take anywhere. They\u2019re thinking like English and algebra.\n\n5. If you want to get into med school, consider a \u201cpre-med\u201d background. This means picking a physical science that you\u2019ll deal with a lot in medical school as the background knowledge will be helpful. For example, biology or organic chemistry.\n\n6. Fill out the FAFSA for financial aid.\n\n7. Fill out as many scholarships as you can. Try to do 1 per week. Even if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get it, try! There are likely scholarships for people in situations similar to yours, as well.\n\n8. Call the nearest college/university or one you want to apply to and ask if you can meet with an advisor to ask some questions. Ask them about their financial aid program, how to apply for financial aid, what forms and documents you\u2019ll need to apply, etc.\n\n9. When you go to school, SEE IF YOU CAN GET A 504 FORM. Go to your advisor and ask for one once you\u2019re in college. They\u2019re legally required to give you one if a therapist or doctor will sign. It\u2019s basically a document that says \u201chey, I have an illness, neurodivergency, or trauma that sometimes makes things hard for me. I request the following accommodations:\u201d. This means that when you\u2019re having a rough time (or some things apply ALWAYS), your professors will be REQUIRED to fulfill those obligations, allowing you things such as extra time on assignments, alternative assignments in the case of triggering material, etc.\n\n10. Most schools REQUIRE that you take the SAT or ACT. If you haven\u2019t, register for one. There are a lot of online resources to study for each. Don\u2019t stress too too much, especially if you\u2019re going to community college that will accept lower scores and you can retake it again later and submit the better score.",

I know you want to go into the medical field but do you know specifically what you want to do? Like become a physician, nurse, dentist, etc? As there are different paths you would have to take for those. I see that you're into mental health care a lot, so maybe going to medical school and becoming a psychiatrist would be something of interest, obviously considering all of the debt first.\n\nFor the community college aspect, I would 100% try to go as soon as you possibly can, and even then you're not late by any measure at 22 years old! And also, as other people are saying please please fill out the FAFSA, given your situation you will save so much money on your education.\n\nThis is all just general stuff, and if u need more specifics I would love to try and help, I'm only a year out of applying to college so I don't know too too much but this is what I would do in your position. Go to community college, make sure you fill out the FAFSA to save money, and I know that colleges will definitely understand your situation and know that you deserve the chance there. Good luck!",

              "text": "You definitely can become a physician 100%. Yes it will be a long road and take a lot of work but it is always possible. I think you have a solid idea of what you want to do. I suggested psychiatry because I think you may have the flexibility of trying out your own unique ideas in terms of dealing with individuals with severe mental illnesses, after some time in the profession. Again I\u2019m not 100% sure and that in of itself would take time to figure out, and so it all comes down to looking into all possible professions, and determining which one would help you achieve the very well-defined goals you have. I think that should be a first step along with going to CC so you can have a more solidified plan and not just go to school for the sake of going to school.\n\nOn a more general level, being a physician would entail going through undergrad, applying and going to med school and then a residency in the field you end up taking on. It may take time, but I do believe that you will be able to implement your own techniques to deal with mental health once you are more experienced in the field, but for now it\u2019s all about getting through the pre med requirements, MCAT later on, and just getting involved in science through research and other things that will be nice to do outside of school.\n\nAnd you definitely can do this 100% and like for anybody it just takes a lot of time and work but it is most definitely possible for you to do what you want to do. If you need any more specifics on the path towards being a physician I\u2019d be happy to help too, but again make sure you find the right job that will fit the goals you have in mind and that will just take some time via researching careers, and once you know what that is it\u2019s all about putting in the time and effort to get to those goals, but you definitely will be able to manage for sure.",

Keep on asking questions and googling till you understand it on a spiritual level and once you do it becomes easy to memorize and you feel joy.

This horrible horrible thing has given you a new perspective and lens on life. Talk about how it changed your life, how you've worked to overcome and what you want to do to stop sexual trafficking. This could be crafted into a awe-inspiring personal statement (girl, you are a SURVIVOR so...). This might feel like you are selling your trauma to colleges,  but you might as well get something good about of this tragedy.\n\nYou're stats are pretty low, so idk about T40s for you (but I've seen crazier things happen so try for a few). And you can def get into some state schools. If fees are an issue, try for fee waivers as well. Community college could also be a good idea, but many state schools (with 4 year programs) are cheap and take in people with lower stats.\n\nLastly, I'm so so sorry this happened to you. I know you don't want pity but you do have my anger.",

Explain your situation to the advisors and ask about what kinds of extra tutoring or other support services you can get.\n\nIf at all possible: Apply for enough loans that you don't have to work your first semester. Your first semester, work really hard and get a lot of tutoring.\n\nIf the nearest community college offers the kinds of classes you want, and the support services you need, maybe all you have to do is talk to that one college. Maybe you don't have to worry about the SATs at all.\n\nIf the people at the colleges near you aren't helpful, try contacting this office and see if it has ideas about who to call: https://www.ovcttac.gov/\n\nYou could also contact the University of Toledo's Human Trafficking and Social Justice Institute: https://www.utoledo.edu/hhs/htsji/\n\nEven if places like that can't help you, maybe they know who to call.\n\nIt doesn't sound as if you're homeless, but maybe the kinds of agencies that help homeless young people would also have ideas about how to help you: https://nche.ed.gov/higher-education/\n\nStill another idea: See if there are cheap, no-college training programs near that could lead to decent jobs. Maybe, for example, you could start out working in a nursing home, take community college classes on the weekend, and eventually get whatever you need to get a medical support job that pays OK and doesn't require any math.\n\nFinally, if you try those places and they're no good, come back here, say what state you're in and what resources you've tried, and ask for more help.",

Take you Gen Eds (general education) courses out of the way for the cheaper price. Most Gen Eds will transfer to another university if you want to \u201cupgrade\u201d in a year or two. If you\u2019re not sure, ask your upgrade school ahead of time if they accept transfer credits from the community college you\u2019re considering. \n\nThe basic classes are just as good at any community college. In my experience most of my \u201c101\u201d classes at my 4-year University were taught by grad students (not professors), so why pay that price to be taught by someone that\u2019s not a professional (yet) in their field. \n\nPS - In my past life I was a career advisor at an unemployment center. Unemployment buildings (or sometimes \u201cCareer Centers\u201d) are a really good resource for information on the options in your region. Sometimes you can also enroll in some of their programs (for free). If you have an idea of what field you want to go into, and the program deems it as a highly employable field, there is sometimes funding programs to help people out with training programs or an associates degree (2 yr degree). That being said, sometimes a viable career doesn\u2019t need a college degree, but instead just some certification courses. Don\u2019t buy what you don\u2019t need when it come to you education.",

      "text": "Hello! First of all I\u2019d like to reiterate what everyone has said and say that you\u2019re so incredibly brave and strong, and that you never deserved to go through any of that. I\u2019m so glad that you\u2019re in a better place now though <3\n\nAnother thing is that I\u2019m just a rising HS senior, so I don\u2019t know much (so please feel free to correct me if I say something wrong!!). But I\u2019ll try my best to link my sources and be accurate .\n\nFrom your post and replies to comments, I see you want to be a physician. I think r/premed might also have some good resources for you, if you haven\u2019t checked them out already.\u00a0\n\nLike others have said, Community College would be a great start! Remember you can always take **remedial courses** (I think the PCC system calls them \u201c**developmental education\\***\u201d) that catch you up on certain subjects that you may have forgotten, like math. They often also don\u2019t count towards your GPA (but double check this with the specifc college), so if you don\u2019t do as well as you like on them, it\u2019s not a big deal. I mention this because GPA is pretty important for med school admission.\n\n\\*Here is a link to that webpage, if you are interested: [https://www.pcc.edu/prepare/developmental/](https://www.pcc.edu/prepare/developmental/) \n\nI see you live in the Oregon area, and while I\u2019m not too familiar with it, here\u2019s what I gathered via some internet research. I saw the PCC program and Oregon Promise mentioned in some of these comments, and you may meet the criteria for Oregon Promise. It doesn\u2019t state you have to be born in Oregon, just that you need to have lived there for at least a year. Still, there are some requirements that you may not meet, so here is a link to the Oregon Promise FAQ page, and if you scroll down it also lists eligibility requirements: [https://oregonstudentaid.gov/oregon-promise.aspx](https://oregonstudentaid.gov/oregon-promise.aspx). Even if you aren\u2019t eligible for this, you can still fill out the FAFSA and apply for scholarships, like others have said.\n\nIf you want to be a physician, you'll have to transfer to a 4 year university eventually (if you do CC first), so that means you\u2019ll do a major that leads to a bachelor\u2019s degree. It\u2019s totally fine if you haven\u2019t found which major you want, but here's a list of transferable majors I found on the PCC website: [https://www.pcc.edu/programs/#transfer](https://www.pcc.edu/programs/#transfer). Basically you start these majors at CC and finish them in a 4 year institution. If you start off at a 4 year university, then you can obviously do any major that leads to a bachelor's there. \n\nI think life science majors, such as biology, would be ideal since they offer some prep for medical school, and cover the pre-reqs quite nicely. You could also consider something like psychology if you\u2019re interested in mental health. But really, you can do any major and still go to med school! And of course you don\u2019t need to choose right away.\n\nIf you take a lot of med school pre-reqs at a community college, I  read that it'd be a good idea  to supplement that with some advanced courses\\*\\* in those subjects once you get to university. However, I also read on forums that many state-schools don't mind where you take your pre-reqs, so I don't think you absolutely need to do this! Also, you probably don't even need to worry about this for right now, it's just something to keep in mind for the future.\n\n\\*\\*Here is the link to a page for a med school (JHU) that I just found this information at (scroll to the section that says \"Required academic work from an accredited institution\"): [https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som/education-programs/md-program/application-process/prerequisites-requirements-and-policies.html](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som/education-programs/md-program/application-process/prerequisites-requirements-and-policies.html). Again, it's not a requirement, and you  don't need to worry at all about that right now.\n\n\\[You can ignore this next paragraph if you want, it\u2019s just a \u201cjust-in-case\u201d paragraph\\]:\n\nIf in the future you decide you want to do something else (not a physician) but still want to do something medical related, you could always explore options such as associates degrees that are in the health sciences, such as these: [https://www.pcc.edu/programs/#health](https://www.pcc.edu/programs/#health). I only mention this because sometimes for various reasons, circumstances make it difficult to complete bachelor\u2019s degrees, so it\u2019s nice to have back ups (and many health science associate's degrees are decently lucrative too). Also, sometimes you just change your mind. Most likely though, you can just ignore this part! I just wanted to provide some back ups, just in case (I personally like to always have back up plans, so that\u2019s why I thought you may too).\n\nI know this comment is kind of late and pretty long, but if you read it, I hope it helped in some way. No matter what, know that I (and many others here) am rooting for you, and wish you nothing but the absolute best in your journey forward.",
