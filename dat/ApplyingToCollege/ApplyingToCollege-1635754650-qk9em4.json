  "text": "I applied to UChicago about half an hour ago and have still not received my portal ID. I know portal ID generally comes through by 24 to 48 hours. The problem is, the UChicago EA deadline is literally 10 hours from now (where I live) so it's very much possible that I won't receive my ID before the deadline. \n\nShould I mail them regarding this or is the deadline only for the submission of the common app?",
