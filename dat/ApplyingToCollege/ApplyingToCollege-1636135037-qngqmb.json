  "text": "hi! i already have a college essay written, but im thinking of rewriting it for the better schools im applying to. im planning on writing abt the effects of colonialism n how even tho how hard i try to reconnect with my roots, i am unable to do so becoz of this large barrier (ofc im inserting an uber cool anectode to tie in with this idea). i was wondering if this is too risky?? or is this fine",
