  "text": "Hey guys! I really want to go to UPenn Wharton and I have the stats and good extracurriculars but my guidance counselor told me that unless I know a board member/top donor or my name on a building my chances are really bad because half the kids in my grade are legacy. How much does having a board member/top donor writing a rec like what some of these kids have, actually affect admissions chances? I really want to get in!!! She literally said my chances would increase so much if I went to a dif school in the middle of nowhere which sucks bc upenn is my dream school!",

Put your heart and soul into the application and submit it.\n\nDon't try and investigate obscure statistics like these as they only add stress to your thought process. Once you submit, the ball's in their court and all you can do is wait. Unfortunately, the elitism of this process puts some schools above others. But, there is little one can do about that.",
