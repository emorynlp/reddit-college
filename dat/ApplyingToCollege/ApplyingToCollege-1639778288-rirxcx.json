  "text": "During my application process I mentioned a previous college I went to that doesn't even transfer credits to the technical school I'm trying to get into. The previous college won't send me a transcript due a a hold on my account that I can't afford right now and I can't finish my application without the transcript. Should I just ignore this application, wait for the next one and not mention the old college? It's not like I'll get anything from mentioning them.",

      "text": "Unfortunately, you're required to provide a complete educational record as part of any application that you're submitting. Withholding information about a college you've attended will get an acceptance rescinded. \n\nYou need to get the hold at your prior institution lifted. You shouldn't need a transcript until you're accepted, so it's something that can wait, but you won't be able to enroll at a college or university without providing your past transcripts.",
