  "text": "Hi! I am a senior in high school planning on majoring in biology. With this, I ask if in a bio degree are you required to take any English classes? I have already taken ENC1101 and ENC1102 and I am currently taking AP Literature. Does literature even matter in a bio degree? Is it a waste of time to take this course? is it part of the requirements for the degree? Thank you so much.",

A bio major will not require English, but the general studies could require that or have a category like humanities that would include English. You can check the requirements for a particular university online.",
