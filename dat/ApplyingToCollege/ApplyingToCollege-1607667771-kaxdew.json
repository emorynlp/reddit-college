      "text": "Harvard is actually a pretty ordinary place. Go visit it a few times (I've been twice on school trips) and the magic disappears. Once, I even got to sit in on a class for an hour. I've got a few friends who go; they're very smart, but not \"special\" or \"destined from birth for greatness\" or anything. I'd say they're even more hard-working than they are intelligent.\n\nI myself go to a pretty unknown university with a 50% acceptance rate, my grades were nowhere near good enough to consider applying to Ivies.\n\nI just think people put elite institutions on a pedestal and think they're some far-off, impenetrable, magical place. Same thing with Congress or the Presidency: they seem elite and impenetrable, but once you go to a few public meetings and meet some Congresspeople, talk to them for a few minutes, you realize there's no such thing as a \"special\" person. I went to a rally in my hometown (Miami) the day after the first Democratic Debate, and I met like 10 Presidential candidates, one of whom is now the VP-elect, and you know what? Ordinary people. Guess they just have the gift of gab and a bit of good luck. (Kamala Harris has some fire sneakers. Iconic)\n\nSame thing with Harvard. Tough to get into, but a pretty normal place. The people there are normal folks with perhaps a bit of abnormally high intelligence, drive, and/or luck. Anyone is allowed to walk into a classroom and sit in on a class. If you ever find yourself in Boston during the school year, go for it and you'll see what I mean. When I did it, I talked to the professor for a minute or two after class and one of the Harvard students who was in there actually mistook me as a fellow Harvard student.\n\nA fun experiment if you live in Boston for an extended period of time would be to attend a Harvard class from the first day onward and do all the assignments and participate in class, and see how long it takes for the professor and other students to realize you're not a student there.",

That, combined with the facts that it receives some state funding and is the newest Ivy League school leads a lot of people to label it as a lesser T20 or \"fake Ivy\"\n\nMost of those comments are said in jest though.
