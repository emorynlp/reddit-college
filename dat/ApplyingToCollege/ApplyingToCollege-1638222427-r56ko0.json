  "text": "I just got home and my mom was jumping around the kitchen. Basically Penn State had sent us a post card and included ~someone\u2019s~ phone number which my mom decided to call. She called regarding a fee waiver (even tho I submitted a month ago) and the guy instantly gave it to her, then went on to talk about how \u201cmy name will hear back from us before Christmas, and she\u2019s going to have a VERY nice Christmas\u201d and encouraged me to apply to the honors college.\n\nHas this ever happened to someone? I feel like this is so weird, he was telling my mom how they think I\u2019m a great student and loved my application. What do you y\u2019all think lmao, I\u2019ll take this down if it dies in new but I don\u2019t know what to make of this situation\n\nUpdate: I got in! I\u2019m going to apply to honors like you all suggested",

      "text": "Congratulations!\n\nMany schools do this. Universities can be *very* bureaucratic, so sending an official notice or posting it on a portal may require certain people to sign off. (Imagine someone like the sloth in Zootopia.... Yeah.) So, many universities develop a work-around: they send you a note or an email or call saying \"it's looking likely!\" and encouraging you to make the most of opportunities. Doing that is also smart marketing because it gets you excited: you get a personal connection who complimented you on your achievements, they are encouraging you to achieve more, and you can think about that school for a few months before other schools get back to you. I'd bet they send you some swag too.\n\nI've made calls like those for a grad program where we knew someone was accepted and we didn't want them to take (or even consider) another offer -- so we call, get them excited, explain the timeline to an official offer, and see how excited they are (or if they are likely to decline). Getting a call is a good sign: it means someone is personally looking after applicants like you.\n\nDefinitely jump on that honors college sign-up: some honors colleges give you great perks -- like scholarships, being first to register (so you get the courses you want), access to better/quieter dorms, connections to great jobs and research opportunities, late-night study spaces, special sections of courses with a bunch of other smart honors college kids and the best profs, etc. It looks like Schreyer offers all that, so double Congratulations!",
