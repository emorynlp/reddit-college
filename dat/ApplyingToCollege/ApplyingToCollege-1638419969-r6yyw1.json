  "text": "More detailed instructions to how to submit:\n- right click on the gray loading screen, then click \"inspect\"\n- uncheck all the boxes that you see (don't bother scrolling down)\n- you should now be able to continue with the submission process on the screen\n- after payment and signature, when you get to the final submit button, it will come up as an error, but if you refresh a minute later, it should have submitted. If not, try again a few times.\n\nI was having issues too and freaking tf out. Tried this twice and it worked. Checked on dashboard after as well. Hope it works for y'all too. Good luck everyone!!!",
