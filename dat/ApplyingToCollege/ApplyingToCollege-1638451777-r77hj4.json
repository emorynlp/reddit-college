  "text": "I see so many posts from last year and probably gonna be even more from this year being like guys help I accidentally submitted at 12 instead of 11:59 or omg the website crashed I can't submit. Why do people always wait until the last minute to submit? Is there a reason or is it just to get a picture of you submitting at 11:59? If any junior is seeing this APPLY 2-3 DAYS EARLY NEXT YEAR PLEASE",

The electronic signature page, payment, returning to Common App after payment, watching the confetti for a moment, then the separate submission of a writing supplement afterward, etc. It can take several minutes to do these tasks carefully.\n\n(PSA: if the writing supplement is separate, you have to go back and submit! This is a common missed step.)",
