  "text": "I applied on October 31st and still haven't heard from Indiana University. I know that I should expect to hear from them by January but a ton of other kids have already gotten in who applied on the same day so I can't help but be worried. Does anyone know anything about how indiana does their decisions. Like do they go by state or region or by date or something else. Do they release them randomly as well? If anyone has any information that can help calm me down, that would be greatly appreciated.",
