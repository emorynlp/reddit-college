  "title:": "Quick question about recruiting and admissions from a sub par athlete",
  "text": "Hello! Just a quick question I figure some of the admissions consultants on here might be able to answer. So I've run (xc/track grind) for 3 seasons every year in high school and made varsity for every season I ran. I've been captain for some of the teams I run on and have gotten decent school/county/state level achievement. It's a massive time commitment, and is kinda carrying my ec section. However, I am still probably not quite good enough to get recruited at most of the schools I'm applying to. So I wasn't planning on filling out recruitment forms. I decided I would just try to walk on/try out wherever I got in if I still felt running for a non club team once I got to college.\n\nHowever, I was recently told that even if I'm far below recruiting standard (or just outside for some schools) I should still fill out the forms just to show additional interest in the school and show that I may be an athlete who's willing to walk on even if I'm not directly recruited which may help me in admissions. Is this true? Should I just fill out all the recruiting forms I can, even if some of the schools have standards way below the times I run? Any advice is appreciated thanks!",

      "text": "I don\u2019t think filling out the athletic recruiting forms is going to benefit you if your times don\u2019t meet what those coaches are seeking. At the same time, it can\u2019t hurt to fill out the forms.\n\nAlso, if running is important to you, I encourage you to continue it in college - if not on a varsity team then join a club team.",

          "text": "Alright then thanks! I'll just fill out the ones at schools where I'm close to their standards! Also yes I definitely intend to continue running in college on a club team if I can't make a school team, my post wasn't clear about that!",
