  "title:": "When should I tell my dad I plan on going to community college?",
  "text": "I brought it up last time and he got really mad. He would rather me pay 20k more for the same college than me go to community college first and save money. I have a feeling it's because community college doesn't sound like a smart ppl place according to him. + He probably doesn't wanna tell people I'm going to CC even though when I transfer I'm going to the college he wants me to. The college that he wanted me to go to is a safety school according to my stats so it's not like I'm not gonna get in if I go to CC first. I'm posting this just because I want reassurance on when to tell him. I really don't wanna make him mad and I explained to him why I wanna go to CC first but he's stubborn and won't listen. I just wanna go to CC first, get a bachelors degree from the same college he wanted me to go to, but save the money. He's not even paying for college. It just makes me extremely uncomfortable when he's mad.  \n\n\nEdit: I lied to him last time saying I'm not going to CC because he got mad asf. Dude was cussing and whatnot. However, I'd have to tell him I'm going to CC now that I actually plan on going because it's easy for him to find out. I just don't know when to tell him.",

      "text": "Does the cc have a transfer agreement with the school you plan to graduate from? At my local cc if you take bio 101 it\u2019s literally the same class as you\u2019d take at the closest in-state uni due to their arrangement. If that\u2019s the case for your school maybe show your dad the cc course catalog description compared to the uni course description. Then show the price difference. You can only borrow $5,500 for your freshman year any costs over that come from grants/scholarship, loans co-signed by your parents or cash out of pocket. Unless he\u2019s willing to be responsible for that then cc sounds like a great option. \n\nOn the other hand, sometimes you can\u2019t rationalize with someone who didn\u2019t come to their opinion in a rational manner. Good luck! Any school you go to will be the lucky one.",
