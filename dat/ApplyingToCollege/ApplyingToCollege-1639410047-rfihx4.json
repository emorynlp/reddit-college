  "title:": "In a weird situation with my IELTS results",
  "text": "hey, so, I\u2019m an international, and I took the IELTS earlier this year for applying to universities. A few days back I requested my test centre to send my IELTS results to two universities. While my IELTS portal says that the results have been sent, the universities say that they haven\u2019t received them (I emailed the admissions offices and everything). \n\nNow I know why this might be happening, my legal surname (Legal discrepancies between my passport and other legal documents) and passport number (I got it renewed) changed between the time I took IELTS and applied to universities.\n\nSo, universities may not be able to match my IELTS results with the details I\u2019ve provided in my application, since my surname is different. I can\u2019t take IELTS again, it\u2019s an expensive exam and I don\u2019t have the time anymore. \n\nCan anyone help me out here? What should I do? How do I make sure that the universities know that the results they\u2019re receiving are mine?",
