  "text": "**Location:** no preferred location but i'd love nice architecture, i just want to go to a beautiful campus\n\n**Region:** none preferred.\n\n**Major:** finance/econ/english/history/undecided\n\n**Curriculum:** flexible and wide selection of non-major electives\n\n**Size:** either small LAC or large public research uni. i prefer these two extremes, contradictory idk\n\n**Costs:** if i'm international then it has to be under 60k/year (including tuition+board+food+etc). but i'd like to see what the best case scenario is for if i do end up with a green card so pretend i'll get fin-aid for 150k/4 ppl household. *(read long text below for explanation)*\n\n**Other information:** must have good food nearby, or have good campus food. i wouldn't want a conservative area or a school that's more than 65% white. my stats are much better than my ECs, so stats-heavy schools over holistic maybe?\n\n**Schools I\u2019m applying to: p**retty much all the mid-tier and up UCs.\n\n**Stats:**\n\n3.9UW 4.3W \n\n7 APs, 10 dual-enrollment\n\n35 ACT\n\nLacks ECs\n\nCA Resident\n\nEast Asian \n\nFemale\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhello! sorry for putting so many majors in the title, i'm kinda indecisive and i might just end up applying undecided. so far on my list i only have UCLA and Berkeley for reach, all the other UCs for match, and CSUs for safety.\n\nis there a point in adding any more colleges to my list? maybe not quite the time to ask when this is already a reverse chanceme post, but still.\n\ni'm not opposed to going out-of-state, in fact i'd be pretty excited to, but i just feel like CA state system would be the best bang for buck. besides i already have quite a few transferrable CSU/UC credits. i might shotgun to the T20s nationwide just to see, since my parents would only be okay shelling out 60k+/year for those. is that unwise?\n\nmy situation is kind of complicated since i'm in the process of an h1b visa but i can't be certain if i'll have a green card by the time of applications.  best case scenario, i'll get some fin-aid. worst case scenario, li'll be applying as international but in-state for CA.\n\nthank you!!",
