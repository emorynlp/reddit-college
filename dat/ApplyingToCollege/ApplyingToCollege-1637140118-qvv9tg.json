      "text": "Start with less selective public options in your state, as those are probably the most affordable ones.\n\nAfter that, similar options in states that aren't as competitive - somewhere like Western Kentucky for example has an entry program for first year students that doesn't require crazy stats, and their NCLEX pass rate is still very good.\n\nPretty much every state board of nursing publishes the NCLEX pass rates for all the nursing schools in their state which can help you find good options.",
