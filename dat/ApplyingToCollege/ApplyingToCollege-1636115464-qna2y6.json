But my counselor already uploaded my foreign transcripts on common app. So why its there on the priority list ? \n\nCant we just self Report? \nI read that unless the priority tasks are cleared , my application wont be reviewed. What did you guys do? Also about the financial guarantee form, cant we submit it after getting admitted. It doesnt make sense to submit it now.",

There\u2019s a section called \u201cCourses and Grades\u201d in Common App that ASU needs you to fill out instead of sending a transcript. I\u2019d recommend reaching out to the admissions office if this continues as no one I know that applied to ASU had to send in a transcript \u2014 but then again maybe they all used CA, not the ASU application. For Barrett, you upload an unofficial transcript. I\u2019ve heard that the AOs at ASU are really responsive. Hope this helps.",
