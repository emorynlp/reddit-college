  "text": "i feel like i'm wayyy too much of a jealous person.\n\nlots of my friends got their acceptance letters from schools like brown, upenn, cornell, and nyu and of course i'm happy for them, but for some reason, i can't stop feeling like they don't deserve to have gotten in because their essays weren't great or their ecs weren't impressive or they're a lazy student yet somehow get good grades.. like my best friend got into her dream school but for some reason my mind immediately went \"how did she get in?\" instead of \"omg i'm so happy for her!\". and i rly wanna stop thinking like this because it's so toxic. \n\nif anyone else is dealing/has dealt with these thoughts, what are some ways i can combat them?",

There are more than enough stories of people getting into dream schools or highly-sought schools only to fail out, hate it, or transfer out. It's not that you should be wishing poorly on them, it's that you should remember what you make of college no matter where you go is most important. Some of the most successful people in the world didn't go to an Ivy.",

Maybe think about how you'd want them to feel if YOU were the one who got in.  \n\nActually, reading your post again, its unclear - maybe you did get into a T10 and you STILL feel this way.  If so, you've got to really work hard on changing your mindset.  Good luck.",

Well not ordinary in the general sense - they were all well above average in academics. They just didn\u2019t stand out as superhuman. You don\u2019t have to be prodigy to get in. You have to be good, and *lucky*. It\u2019s ok to feel jealousy. This may well be appropriate given the extreme unfairness and imprecision of the admissions process. Just try to rise above it rather than drown in it.",
