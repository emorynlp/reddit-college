  "text": " \n\nI hate to be the one talking about if I will get rescinded or not, but here I am.\n\nI recently moved into a different school in NJ, and I am struggling with Calc 3. It is so early in the year that this should not even my focus, but will one F or D along with A's in rest of AP/honors classes senior year as a final grade be a serious concern for state colleges like Rutgers to rescind admission.\n\nMy unweighted GPA is around a 3.9 and I have a positive GPA trend. I will be applying EA and hope to major in chemical engineering. Please roast me as well.",
