  "text": "For schools where I'm applying that offer merit scholarships, would it hurt my chances of getting these scholarships if I submit a FAFSA with a high expected family contribution? Would schools be more likely to think - we don't need to give this student a financial incentive to come to our school because they (supposedly) have enough money to pay full tuition?",

      "text": "It depends on the scholarship.  Many schools have scholarships that are \"hybrid\" need/merit.  That is, the decision is based on merit but having financial need is a requirement to even qualify.  If you don't submit a FAFSA at all then they will consider you have no financial need, so you will be no better off than if you had submitted a FAFSA w/ high income.",
