  "text": "Hi,\n\nSome colleges said that they wanted official college transcripts from students who've participated in dual enrollment/college courses (umich, umd). I have taken courses at my local community college, but these courses and their grades are already listed on my normal high school transcript and labeled as dual enrollment. Do I still need to submit an official transcript from the college, and if so, how can I do that?\n\nThank you",
