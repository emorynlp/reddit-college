  "text": "I asked my 10th grade English teacher if she could write me a letter of recommendation because she's also one of my club advisors and has seen me grow since 10th grade. I'm putting her as a \"classroom teacher letter of rec\" (rather than additional letter of rec) and was wondering if she is allowed to talk about me as part of the club, instead of just strictly me in her class.",
