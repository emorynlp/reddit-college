  "text": "I\u2019m in college, but my younger brothers applying to college this year. You guys know the deadlines a week away. \n\nHe asked his English teacher for a recommendation in early September, but she hasn\u2019t even started on it. What\u2019s worse, is that she completed two recommendations for the so-called \u2018teachers pets\u2019 and everybody else is in the same situation as my brother. \n\nThen she sent out a notice, saying that she didn\u2019t want to be \u2018pestered\u2019 \n\nLooking for any advice for my lil brother, it\u2019s mad infuriating.",

      "text": "There is nothing to be done unless he wants to choose a different recommender. Patience.\n\n\"She hasn't even started,\" \"didn't want to be pestered.\" This perspective is unreasonable. Think about this from the teacher's perspective. Do you complete all assignments weeks before the deadline? Would you enjoy having teachers ask why you haven't turned in an assignment when it's not even due for over another week?\n\nMost teachers complete recommendations right around the deadline. They don't need to \"start\" weeks ahead - this is not a research paper, it's a recommendation that they'll likely spend (far) less than an hour on.\n\nMost colleges have a grace period after the deadline for receiving teacher recommendations. At least in the US, teachers are WELL aware of this. Sorry your brother is stressed, but in all likelihood, if she said she'll get it done, she'll get it done. He can keep an eye on his admission portal to see that it gets received eventually.",
