  "text": "Hi! I was wondering if there are any colleges in the United States (or even elsewhere) that provide substantial financial aid/scholarships (close to a full ride) to normal international applicants. What I mean by normal is an applicant who has decent stats but nothing over the top like 7 internships or something. If it helps, you can take a look at my stats using the link below and let me know if there are any colleges fit for me. Thank you.\n\n[My stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/pv2tk9/where_to_apply_international_needing_aid/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)",
