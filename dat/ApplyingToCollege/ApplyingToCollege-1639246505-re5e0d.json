  "text": "I didn\u2019t apply ed anywhere because my parents weren\u2019t sure about it money-wise and wanted me to compare offers. Now I\u2019m seeing all these people already know where they\u2019re going and it\u2019s just so annoying. I wish I knew.\n\nI\u2019m mostly seeing kids from my town\u2019s high school\u2014which is wealthier/more \u201celitist\u201d than my catholic high school\u2014get into the ivies and top LACs ED. A bunch of these kids are legacies to LACs and it\u2019s crazy to see how much that matters. We\u2019re talking like <10% acceptance rates and they\u2019re getting in. Crazy\u2026",

Really wish I could have done ED for Uchicago because i love it and already have taken an astrophysics course there, but ultimately i need to be able to examine the financial aid offers from other schools i (may) get into in the future. I like the freedom it gives me to fall in love with other schools and I\u2019m prone to having second thoughts about everything lmao",
