      "text": "Smth similar happened to me in my previous class. They used to write down and start a wishing chain on everyone's birthday, but they purposely avoided mine cause I will b honest here, I was a stickler for rules. (They did it on purpose cause 1 person wished me a happy birthday but no one else did, and they alr had a collated list of everyones birthdays to update on the board)\n\nNeedless to say I was heartbroken. So the following year I entered a new class and took over the whiteboard duty, and ensured that nobody was forgotten. I mean, they hurt us so the most we can do is to ensure we dont hurt anybody the same way. Hopefully, when they grow up, they remember what they did and apologise to you.",

      "text": "At least you had a proper graduation? \n\nMy story is getting held back over a year IN highschool. \nIn a alternative school where people basically share Bars infront of the staff in the open.\nThen getting so burnt out by all of the drama, fights, arrest and other entertaining bs and random events being told you have to graduate cause of your age and youre let off cause they gave you online classes that included. \nBasic math, three digit division, addition, subtraction\nRandom history courses. \nWriting or reading or something. \nPassing with the worst gpa. \n\nHow idk. \nThere wasn't a class ring. \nThere wasn't a year book. \nThere wasnt a thing where I walked up infront of everyone and got a platter. \n\nBut I never really cared about rings or yearbooks. \nBut now looking at it I know with the few friends I kinda had. \nIf I got to old I would never be able to just look back at what once was. \nI wasnt allowed to socialize in highschool so I question why do I care.. \n\nBut ya know your feelings are valid. \nJust remember it's highschool what do you seriously think you lost or missing out on cause it seems like you're getting in to college if you're posting here. \n\nIdk when or if I will get into college don't know if I should cause I'm basically retarded.",
