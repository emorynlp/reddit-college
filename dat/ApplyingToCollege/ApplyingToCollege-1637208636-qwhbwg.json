      "text": "I transferred high schools two times. Once from another country, and once from one state to another. It\u2019s pretty weird, mainly because it was hard for them to transfer credits and figure out my transcript for my hs out of the us, but it was super easy from state to state. It shouldn\u2019t be a problem, dw. All my credits transferred, and I\u2019m still graduating on time lol",
