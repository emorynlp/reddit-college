  "title:": "possibly overthinking this, but i accidentally put my school name as my preferred name when i signed up for one of those like email subscription lists for a college??",
  "text": "it's because of autofill like i didn't notice that it had filled out my \"preferred name\" as ... the name of my school. and the name of my school isnt even a person's name like it's a random word (imagine it's like \"Southview\" or something) .... so now i just got an email saying Dear Southview, blah blah. and this school rly cares about demonstrated interest... should i email them and tell them it was an accident or will they not care LOL ?????",

If you're considering a specific school that sent you \"Dear \\[insert school name\\]\" then by all means correct them especially if it came from an AO and not *XXX college admissions office.*",
