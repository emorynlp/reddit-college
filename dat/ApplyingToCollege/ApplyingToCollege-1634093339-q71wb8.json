  "title:": "Regarding Impact of essay if I remove race",
  "text": "Hello everyone! So a little bit about me before I jump into my question. I'm a half Chinese and half Russian American who is super into politics and government.\n\nA college essay asked me about my identity and how it shaped my life. In the essay, I talked about being half Chinese and being a protestant. I lived in China as a kid for 2 years, and to worship, I literally had to go to an \"underground church,\" and only those who had foreign passports were allowed to enter. To summarize, this event was critical to forming my interest in politics and government. It was the first event that caused my 6-year-old self to wonder about the differences between the Chinese and American governments. I honestly really like my essay, but my mom told me to change it since \"being half-chinese hurts my chances.\" If I change \"being half-Chinese\" to \"being extremely interested in all things related to China\" in my essay, would my story make less of an impact?\n\nThank you for reading this!",

A good essay is more valuable than trying to pretend you are just Russian or not saying you are Asian. And if a place doesn't like your cool essay or you being part-Asian? \u64cd\u4ed6\u4eec \u3002 \u0431\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0443\u0440\u043a\u0438!",
