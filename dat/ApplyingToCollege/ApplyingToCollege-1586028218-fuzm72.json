  "title:": "UNPOPULAR OPINION : Being accepted to a T20 doesn't make you an expert on college admissions",
  "text": "Title is basically self-explanatory. I have followed the whole stat video/college reaction video genre for a while and though I believe they are largely unhealthy (story for a different time), I felt that in the past these had a decent amount of good information. Recently, however, this category of \"influencers\" has exploded. Especially with platforms like Tik Tok and Youtube, it seems quite literally everyone who gets into an Ivy+ has the \"SECRET FORMULA ON HOW TO GET INTO A T20!!!\" Here are some of my favorite soundbites...\n\n\n**\"What really got me into x university was...\"** - You literally have NOTHING to back this statement up. Unless you talked to your admission officer personally, you do not have any clue as to what got you into the university you chose. It is misleading and disingenuous to talk as though you have some secret insight into what made your application special. It is even worse when said person has a 1600 SAT and 2-gen legacy, and they then go on to say that their 300 word supplemental about learning how to swim is what got them into Stanford. Are you kidding?\n\n**\"What really matters is having good essays and extracurriculars!\"** - I completely agree with this point. The problem is who doesn't already know this? Who are the kids who think that academics are literally everything? You look up one guide on college admissions and it is probably the first thing on the list. Why do people think it is such a secret that you should \"focus on your extracurriculars!\"?\n\n**\"I got into x school with a 25th percentile SAT, so you can too!\"** - This just isn't true, and is one of my biggest gripes. It seems that these influencers want to think that college admission is this 100% holistic process and test scores are just some red herring. It usually turns out that said vlogger either has an extremely extenuating background or S-tier extracurriculars. If you think that you can get into an Ivy with a 1210 because you \"write nice,\" I have bad news. Statistics don't lie. For everyone with a 25th percentile SAT, there are 3 other people at the same universities with a better score. \n\nMore and more it seems like these admission-influencers are really not so much interested in actually helping and more so interested in bragging about their achievements (HOW I GOT INTO HARVARD PART 1????) and spouting meaningless talking points they have heard from others. These types of vids used to be so beneficial but now it seems every video sounds the same. Literally. Turn on two of your stereotypical \"HOW I GOT INTO X UNIVERSITY\" videos right now. Tell me their points aren't identical. I'll summarize it right now: \"Start your ~unique~ essays early. Have continuity in your application. Find something you are passionate about and pursue it. Demonstrate interest in your school.\" That is it.\n\n It is so sad to see people who go to truly amazing universities produce content that is so blatantly braggadocious and above all completely unimaginative. It is even more sad to think that kids who don't know better will follow this often misleading advice and start idolizing ivies for no other reason than a cool name.",

Every single video looks the same too, with the logo of the school in the thumbnail and its name in the title. I scroll through tiktok and see people outright bragging about their acceptances (while of course the caption says \"Scores aren't everything, you can do it too!) and every comment is just praising these people. These people got one acceptance and now they got a big head.\n\nAlso  I specifically hate \"The Kath Path\" on youtube. She had the worst application I have ever seen and every single video is \"How you can get into Stanford too!\" And before everyone says I'm just salty, I'm going to a T5.",

I've been a college counselor now for almost 4 years in the private sector.Once I started working in admissions, I realized that almost all college Freshmen and Junior transfers I had interacted with at Cal had \"advice\" for how to get in that didn't match up with the actual admissions guidelines at all. I broadly agree that getting into a T20 doesn't make you an expert on admissions. There are legit strategies, there are people who know what those strats are and can help you, there are just very few of them.  \nAs a general comment on anything regarding \"luck\", admissions is definitely more of an art than a science, but as far as \"luck\" goes, I'd say that's only about 5% of the process, max.

I'll give them that.\n\nAlso, be careful because a great many of these students have worked with private admissions counselors (like myself) and don't admit it. Some of them are quite unscrupulous. I know of one student with popular instructional videos on YouTube, view counts in the tens of thousands, who paid someone else to write her essays for her entirely.

I guess that esp in the bay area and extremely competitive communities (to the point where they're toxic), there are *so many* people who really do think academics are everything and will do everything for the sake of college \u2013 a common mindset that gets to your head due to the pressure among students and parents. i've known people who retook their 1530s, 1540s, and even a 1550 on the SAT (like seriously. what). sadly, I would say this is a common occurrence in bay area schools. for people not so familiar with the process, I do think there's some validity in stressing the importance of focusing on your extracurriculars (that you actually enjoy) & essays over taking another AP class, retaking your SAT, etc. it might seem like common sense, but it might be surprising to see how many people don't follow this.",

Students who shotgun T20s likely do not have the best ecs, stats, or essays. Everyone who gets into multiple T20s generally share the same characteristics of good stats, continuous/unique ecs, and well-developed essays. Even more unfortunately, a lot of these influencers have some inherent quality that likely played a large part of their admission and is thus completely unhelpful to those seekings advice (legacy, first-gen, URM, athlete, QB, etc...) I'm not saying that these students shouldn't give advice. I am saying that acting like you have some super-secret and enlightened insight into the college application proccess is simply untrue and frankly manipulative.",

Although it's important to take all these peoples advice with a grain of salt, by putting this content out there, it became easy for me to understand exactly what kind of tone they were looking for in essays, and what kind of activities I had to highlight more, and which I had to highlight less, and basically just how to structure my entire approach to admissions. For International students, with minimum outside help, even the seemingly simple advice that 'your essays really matter' can be the difference between us getting in, just simply because there's so much misinformation about the college process. Some advice that may seem obvious to a lot of people, is actually not always as obvious. I hope this makes sense! Thanks for the post btw, it was an interesting perspective :)",

I think we see so many college advising videos from students because they want to pursue their vlogging interest beginning with a video about college application of which they are most knowledgeable about. \n\nAt the end of the day, it's up to the audience to make informed choices about what to include in their application or not. But as far as I know, it's extremely rare that any of these videos lie blatantly about something. So, it's not appropriate to generalize all of them with a single perspective.",

Being an asian applying to elite schools from the Bay Area is tough but it was tougher that my parents didn\u2019t go to college and I didn\u2019t grow up with elite resources. I only needed the determination and grit to try my hardest.
