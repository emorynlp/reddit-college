  "title:": "Forgot to list two honors on common app",
  "text": "I submitted my EA apps several hours ahead of the deadline on Nov 1st, but I forgot that I was supposed to add in two extra honors in the additional info section. They're not overly big honors, one is the AP Scholar award but I think pretty much everyone gets that one. Should I bother trying to email any of my EA schools to inform them or should I be okay?  \n\n\nThank you for any help!",

      "text": "First of all, if you've put down your AP grades there's no real value in adding the AP Scholar award since colleges can see and infer from your results. If the other honor is not overly big, I reckon you should leave it out. Most colleges are really busy right now and sending them an email saying that you forgot something doesn't make a great impression.",
