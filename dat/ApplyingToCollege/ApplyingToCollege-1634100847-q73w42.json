  "text": "I know that one of the things you aren\u2019t supposed to talk about in your personal essay is any form of addiction you\u2019ve had, but I think I can write a really good essay about how I became addicted to stress after my sophomore year and how I was able to overcome that in between my junior and senior year. What do you guys think?",

Show them your Phoenix rising from the ashes.\n\nAlso avoid strong words when describing your 20%. If you\u2019ve never been diagnosed avoid the word anxiety.  And don\u2019t use addiction.",

What makes you a good leader? A good student? A good business person and maker of money. \nAll answers that speak to your skills, strengths and ability to develop yourself and others will get you admission.",
