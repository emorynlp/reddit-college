  "title:": "Should I let my guidance counselor send a thank you email to my Yale interviewer?",
  "text": "I told her how well the interview went, and now she\u2019s really enthusiastic about sending a thank you email to my interviewer, but I was pretty wary of this given that they\u2019re just an alumni volunteer and it might seem a little pushy. She also wanted to send Yale more information about me (an additional mini-recommendation of sorts) but I\u2019m not sure how this would be received.\nAny thoughts?",
