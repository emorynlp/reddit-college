Generally, the MBBS will only count towards the initial 4 year Bachelors degree that MD aspirants in the US take (you will not be considered a doctor with an MBBS). You will have to take a few licensing exams and you will need an additional 4-5 years of schooling before you become a doctor.",

                      "text": "Try going the pre-med route with hopes of scholarships & financial aid. Grind for the next 4 years, NEET's competition is way too high. However, I'd rather not suggest doing medical in the U.S for a typical Indian family due to the exorbitant costs! Med schools in the U.S have prices that are skyrocketing each day. However, if you do secure a good scholarship for pre-med, you might be able to cut down the cost a bit. Also, incase you're taking PCB, take Math as an elective/give APs. You can have an alternative incase things aren't on your side. And make sure your E.Cs are stellar. You could volunteer at a local hospital, do internships at pharma companies & working under a doctor. Being in 9th and being aware of the process as an international student is a blessing on disguise. You'll be 2 steps ahead of everyone & would know exactly what to focus on. I'd suggest starting with a potential college list, SAT/ACT practice on Khan Academy, making a schedule for the next 4 years and not compromising on your own life. You don't need to prove anyone but yourself, and if you do the hardwork, it's gonna pay off really well. Try maintaining a steady GPA/%age throughout the next 4 years. Give the SAT between 10th and 11th because you'll have ample time to reattempt if dissatisfied. You could DM me, I'll send you some stuff to follow, a few good ECs to do, a few skills to learn as well as a few awards you can apply for. These will help you a lot and I wish someone guided me when I was in 9th. Congrats on making it to this subreddit this early!",
