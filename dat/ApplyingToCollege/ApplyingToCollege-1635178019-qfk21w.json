  "text": "Did you guys struggled to write your personal statement and how long did it take to finish it?\n\nMy current personal statement has a 21,000 character limit, with each question having 3500 character limit. Basically, each question is as long as a typical 500 to 750 word personal statement. Should I come close to that 3500 character limit for each question? I\u2019m at the conclusion paragraphs and I do not know how to describe my short- and long-term goals in relation to my non-research base career path. Every personal statement sample I have read online has to do with some sort of research program. In case anyone is wondering, my master\u2019s program will be in school counseling and mental health counseling.  \n\nThank you",
