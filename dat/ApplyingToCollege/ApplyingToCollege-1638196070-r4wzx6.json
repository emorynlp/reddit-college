  "text": "So I've been trying to decide which one of these 2 is better for me. I have come to a conclusion, but I just need like reassurance I guess? I just wanna be sure..\n\nI don't think I like working with hardware that much... I want my main focus to be on programming, algorithms that kinda stuff. So first thing I've discovered that CS Engineering includes particular focus on hardware as well.\n\nI've also seen that you've required to take certain physics courses for an Engineering degree, and I DISLIKE Physics. \n\nDue to these reasons, I've come to the conclusion that CS is better for me. I'll eventually accept this too, cuz my brain right now is berrating me for even thinking about not doing Engineering (#IndianFamilyandRelatives)\n\nIf y'all have anything to add to the difference between CS and CSE, that'd be great. Or if y'all see any wrong information here, kindly correct me.\n\n\n(If you are confused about the purpose of this post, so am I tbh lol. I guess I just wanted to share this with someone.)",

However, if the jobs you want are mainly software engineering, and not low-level stuff, then Computer Science arguably prepares you better to acquire those jobs.  There may be some gaps in a Computer Engineering degree (for those specific jobs) that you might wish had been filled.  That said, you can absolutely get software jobs w/ a CompE degree.",

Like if those jobs are related to hardware stuff, doesn't matter to me. But I don't wanna miss out an software related knowledge and fall back in that race as well.\n\nAnother thing- I'd work in tech for like a couple years, and then I'm almost sure about going for an MBA and get more involved in management jobs. That's another thing that makes me feel like Engineering ain't the one for me.",

Ohio State is a good example of an institution that offers CSE, so do check that out... In terms of employability, you wouldn't have a problem finding a job with either major.",

The one thing I have heard is that CSE opens up a lot of jobs that you cant get with a CS major. However, pretty much all jobs open to CS majors are also open to CSE majors (maybe with a bit of self-study to catch up in terms of necessary programming knowledge). However, if you really don't like the engineering aspect of CSE you probably wont like the jobs opened to you anyway I think? \n\nAlso, I have heard from family in the industry if you do plan to go the CS route at least get a BS in CS not a BA :)",
