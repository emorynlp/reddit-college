Harvard\u2019s work-study student jobs were awesome and paid well for not much work. professors are great for mentoring. there are psych labs that pay nicely (sometimes 50+) for short studies. health services kind of sucked. proctors/RAs were great informal mentors. house life/culture was awesome. daddy Harvard has a big wallet so they end up paying for parties / food / retreats / EC expenses. Harvard heavily helps you apply to fellowships in your latter years. and SO many career fairs it\u2019s hard to leave college without a job (but this is not without its stress lol)\n\nunsure if I answered your question so feel free to lmk if I missed the target on that one",

Feel free to ask about anything more specific - \n\nthe good - Harvard classes were not as hard as I was scared of them being. Yes, you do die here and there, but there are good people you struggle along with\u2026 and Harvard rarely, from what I observed from those around me, gave lower than B\u2019s. Also, Harvard takes care of its financial aid kids so well\n\nthe neutral - Harvard\u2019s campus is pretty small.\n\nthe bad - Harvard had so many more mental health issues than I\u2019d have expected, and not a great health services center to tackle them. Harvard is also much more corporate than you\u2019d initially expect, we protested so long for divesting, paying their dining employees a fair wage, etc",
