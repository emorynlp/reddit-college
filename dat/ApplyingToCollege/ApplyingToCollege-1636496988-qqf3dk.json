  "text": "So basically today this morning one of the clubs I\u2019m in for the medical competition HOSA told me that the second round of testing would be on Dec 11. And that\u2019s also the day I have a rehearsal for orchestra, and just now the leadership in Mock Trial told us there will be a scrimmage on the same day. AND I just looked through my Science Olympiad Competition date, and out of all of the dates possible, it\u2019s the same date as the regional competition for Mock Trial. I\u2019m so angry at myself for noticing that earlier, especially since all of the clubs have been running for nearly two months. I made up my mind and I\u2019m going to decide to quit Mock Trial, but since all of the teams are decided and we already started writing prosecutions and defense documents, I have like no idea how I\u2019m going to tell them. I also don\u2019t know what to tell them, because I don\u2019t want them to think I\u2019m valuing one thing over another, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s the easiest way for me to get everything done. There\u2019s also people I know on leadership that I have to confront. I have absolutely no idea how to write an apology email telling leadership that I\u2019m going to quit, can anyone help me brainstorm ideas? I\u2019m so bummed and sad I don\u2019t even know what to say.",

      "text": "Don\u2019t think of it in terms of quitting per se. You\u2019ve got conflicts in the schedule and you need to focus on what\u2019s important to you. You can\u2019t do everything\u2026 no one can. Therefore, you just have to be straight and in a business-like manner state there are too many conflicts in your schedule which are not in your control, and because of this you cannot devote the required time to every activity. You\u2019re sorry to announce this so late. You hope they\u2019ll respect your decision.",
