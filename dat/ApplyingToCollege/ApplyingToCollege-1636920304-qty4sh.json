  "text": "Hey. Would it be worth uploading another additional material in the Harvard portal stating that the monthly visitors on my forum have doubled since the time of submitting my application? (25k monthly visitors to reaching 24k in only 13 days and predicted 50k across the entire month)\n\nthat way, i could also include a few screenshots of the updated statistics from the previous additional material i added before the deadline.",

              "text": "I am of the belief that the college has everything it needs to make its decisions. Every applicant to a selective college will have accomplishments which occur after submission. AOs know that, but they don\u2019t want to be inundated with minor updates from thousands of applicants.\n\nSo does that mean that one should not submit updates? No. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. But one needs to be judicious. If it\u2019s something that made the nationally-read papers (and not just the local free weekly) like an Academy Award nomination (or similar prestigious achievement), include on the update. If it\u2019s to tell them that you were elected softball captain, had another 4.0 quarter, or your website traffic doubled, don\u2019t.",
