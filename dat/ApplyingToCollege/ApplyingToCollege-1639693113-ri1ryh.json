          "text": "Best of luck! Remember to stay calm, do a lot of research and keep the notes open infront of you sneakily on your computer if necessary. Basically show them that you care about Smith, know about what they have to offer, and know how you can utilize those resources (show this by relating it to the current experiences, skills, awards, ECAs etc you have). Show them that you care about the community and are determined to make something of your degree. Bonus points if you can pinpoint a future ambition like working for the UN. At least that's what worked for me, everyone is different and unique in their own amazing ways. \nThe most important is to just be yourself, I'm sure you'll do great!",
