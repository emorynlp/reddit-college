  "text": "Ok so the ACE mentor program was brought to my campis, i went to the info session, thought it was pretty cool. However, i have some doubt on how useful the program is in terms of college apps and whatnot especially since there is no sense of exclusivity to the program i guess. I was hoping to have a discussion here about the benefits and drawbacks of the program, along with how it has helped people in the future(in the info session, they mentioned internships and scholarships that alumni get access to, and i want to know how true/fake that is) Also, is doing the program worth anything to colleges?",

We earmark some scholarships each year for selected students who were part of an ACE Mentor program who are offered admission to our Engineering or Architecture schools. \n\nBeyond that, ACE Mentor is just an outstanding program that will allow you to explore opportunities in the architecture, construction, and engineering fields. That\u2019s the primary reason to do it.",
