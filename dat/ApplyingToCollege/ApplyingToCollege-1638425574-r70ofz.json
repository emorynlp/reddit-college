  "text": "Hello! Today was a super interesting day, especially since it was the first day of december, and the first day of the inevitable countdown. I have started the habit of opening my portal back and forth, but I feel like I am starting to lose it myself. I applied early, and although decisions are literally around the corner- I can't help but overthink and ponder about what is going to happen in two weeks. How are you early applicant people dealing with this feeling?  It has been seriously wearing on me mentally, but I can't help but think about it.",

      "text": "Hi! I actually just had a mental check-in with my friend group because I was getting really mentally exhausted today. I think it really helped, so I would definitely suggest having a support group and just checking in with each other.\n\nI\u2019m awaiting a decision coming up soon, but I realized that at this point, it\u2019s out of my hands. I came to terms with that, so it definitely has helped me stop continuously open portals lol",

I am also on the endless rollercoaster of worrying greatly about my app, checking my portals, and researching the schools I\u2019m not even applying to, which takes up hours of my time every day.",

      "text": "Definitely agree with the other comments - taking a break from electronics and just doing something relaxing (go for a swim or read a book or play some games with family) can help a whole lot. Reading has really helped me get college apps off my mind! And Minecraft. Lots of Minecraft.\n\n(If you saw me comment something unrelated earlier, I am so *so* sorry, I accidentally commented on the wrong post \ud83d\ude2d)",
