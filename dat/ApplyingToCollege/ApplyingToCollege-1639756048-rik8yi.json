  "text": " \n\nHello everyone, I am currently pursuing my first year of LLB in India and I absolutely love it because I always wanted to do this. However, over the past few weeks, I've been having second thoughts of continuing it in my country.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still want to pursue a career in law but just not in my country.\n\nSo now that I will finish my first year in India, is there any way I can continue my studies abroad? Say the United Kingdom or do I have to start all over?\n\nDo any of you have any idea about the necessary exams that I have to clear in order to study abroad, the funding that would be required (fee and loans)?\n\nAny advice would be helpful, Thanks :)",

      "text": "You should probably think about going to law school and getting a JD. I\u2019m not too sure about the UK but my dad works in biglaw in the USA and they really only recruit people fresh out of law school from the very top law schools (unless you\u2019re #1 in your class at a less prestigious law school). I can\u2019t speak on smaller firms either but that\u2019s how it works for the prestigious large firms that pay 220k first year (plus 20-40k bonus) and $3-4m+ as a partner",
