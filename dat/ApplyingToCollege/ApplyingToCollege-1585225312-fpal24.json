Getting rejected shouldn\u2019t \u201ccrush dreams\u201d, I mean it might in a sense but remember that you can still make those dreams happen wherever you go. I don\u2019t believe OP had any ill intent, so calling him/her a \u201cpiece of shit\u201d and hoping that they \u201cgo to hell\u201d is overly harsh imo. \n\nI hope ivy day went well for you, fellow A2C member, but if it didn\u2019t (mine didn\u2019t either) remember that this is a small step in your marathon of your life. Be open to the opportunities that will inevitably be available wherever you choose to go!",
