  "text": "This is a ridiculous reason and question I feel like because I\u2019m 18 and stupid but this is how my logic is working atm. \n\nMy #1 choice is USC. Location is a huge factor, I\u2019m trying to go as far away from Indiana as possible for college lol. USC doesn\u2019t have ED. Pomona is also in California. I probably won\u2019t get into USC OR Pomona. \n\nApply Pomona ED?\n\nBasically, if I don\u2019t get into USC or Pomona, I\u2019ll regret not doing Pomona ED. If I do get into Pomona, I\u2019ll always wonder about USC.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m a Questbridge Non-match if that matters at all.",

      "text": "Short answer: No (and I'm a huge fan of Pomona).\n\n1. Echoing u/freeport_aidan, the Pomona AOs pretty consistently say you should only ED if a) Pomona is your \"absolute #1 choice,\" and b) you don't want to compare FA offers (I'm assuming/hoping you've run the NPC for the colleges you're looking at). It might appear that the ED admit rate is higher than RD, but it is heavily inflated by various recruits (athletes, etc), and programs like Posse and QB - to the point that one AO last year said basically that the only advantage to applying Early Decision is that you receive an early decision.\n2. I've spent a lot of time on both campuses personally and professionally, and besides both offering a great education - and being a long ways from Indiana, they really don't have a lot in common. I could go into more detail, but u/admissionsmom offers some really good alternatives that you should definitely explore if one of your goals is to end up in SoCal.",
