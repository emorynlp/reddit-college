You can sometimes live at home as well.\n\nPublic universities, main or flagship, run from about $22,000-$40,000/year in-state (IS). \n\nAdd $15,000-25,000/year to the above numbers if you are an out of state (OOS) student. Some have great discounts for neighboring states and/or offer merit scholarships, making the price comparable to in-state tuition. \n\nThe top publics (UMich, UVA, UC's all, etc..) are priced similarly to top private universities, around $60,000-70,000 and do not offer much, if any, OOS aid.\n\nJesuit and other religious universities are sometimes able to offer great tuition discounts (depending on their location). They start around $45,000 and go to $70,000 but can drop down to $35,000-$50,000. This varies, Loyola  New Orleans for example in general is much cheaper than Loyola Marymount (Los Angeles).\n\nSmall Liberal Arts Colleges and other small private niche universities can offer great tuition discounts or in-state tuition matching, but start from roughly $55,000-80,000. \n\nLarge privates and Ivy's usually cost from $67,000-80,000. They are just a financial crapshoot if your income is between $60,000-175,000. Lower than $60,000 they can sometimes be affordable (depending on the loan package), and over about $200,000 income you know you are paying full price.\n\nFun fact, while on the phone with an aid officer at a university the other day, they mentioned that they see the most issues with affordability for the 'doughnut hole' kids (the $60,000-175,000 range), it's who they are getting a majority of the phone calls from.\n\nI love that they know this but are still trying to wring out every living dollar from an already stressed and shrinking middle class.",
