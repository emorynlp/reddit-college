  "text": "this title makes no sense but basically:\n\nif i say smth like (acting is NOT my actual career goal): \"my career goal (acting, and, if im being ambitious, being the first \\[my identity\\] celebrity to star in a uhhh idfk horror film).\" the career is not acting but.. yeah.\n\nserious q, does that show that im like not confident in myself - like that i dont think i can get from being an \"actor\" to a \"celeb\" (pretend becoming a celeb is something that u just need like hard work and experience for... like not everyone in that career does it but yeah)??? or like wow so awesome that i have this concrete goal of becoming an \"actor\" but like i also have additional ambitions tacked on\n\nim so sorry if im overthinking this but LOL i wanna present myself in the best light",
