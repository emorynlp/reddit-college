They come into my office every once in a blue moon, I help them on a pretty basic level, they get into whatever UC's or privates and then they thank me profusely for all of the work I did for them and how they couldn't have done it without me. Super sweet, humble kids who I always remind that it was them that got themselves to their school and - often times - I just forwarded some random bit of into to them.\n\nThen I have the others who I metaphorically move mountains for and they're all \"kthxbye bitch\" lol I don't do it for the thanks but sometimes the amount of effort we put into some kids I think is lost on them. All gravy though.",

He also runs a D&D campaign with his real life friends, and records each session. He deserves only the absolute best.",
