  "text": "Saw the post about someone being nice and getting into Yale. I have a somewhat similar story to share that some of you might enjoy. You never know how much being nice really can pay off!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy sophomore year (two years ago) I was on the school tennis team, and one day we traveled downtown to an all-day tennis tournament between teams from all over the city. The parents dropped us off and we were on our own other than our coaches. Halfway through the day I noticed this freshman on another team forgot to bring a lunch. He was sitting by himself hungry and alone and I felt bad, so I went over and offered to buy him something. He politely declined but I knew he was hungry and insisted he eat. I went over to the snack stand and bought him a hotdog and some ice cream for $5 and brought him over to eat with my group of friends. After we went back to our own tennis tournaments and I thought nothing of it. \n&nbsp;\n\nAt the end of the day as I was leaving some woman ran up to me in the parking lot and greeted me by name. It was the kid's mother so I'm assuming he had told her about me, and she thanked me over and over again for buying her son lunch. I told her it was no big deal and I was happy to help. That was the only time I saw that woman...\n&nbsp;\n\n...until two months ago when I arrived at my Columbia interviewer's office. I walked in and she greeted me happily, as if she knew me, and it didn't hit me until I got into talking about playing tennis that it was her kid who I had bought lunch for two years ago. I didn't bring it up but I knew it was her, and I knew she knew remebered me when she brought up that day. It was by far my best interview. \n&nbsp;\n\nTwo months later, I was rejected from every ivy/ivy+ except one, and that was Columbia. I honestly can't believe that this happened and I really have no idea how much of an impact that event had on my acceptance, but I'm pretty sure she wrote about it in her interview report and that's what got me in. After I got in (literally like 2 hours after), she sent me a super ecstatic email about how much I deserve this acceptance and to keep on doing what I'm doing. Never thought something like this would happen in my life.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR** Went to a tennis tournament, saw some kid forgot his lunch. Bought him lunch for like $5 and his mom was super thankful. Two years later that mom was my Columbia interviewer and remembered who I was. Now I can proudly say #roar2022",

Sounds like an absolutely awful idea.\n\n> Under this system, something as innocuous as a person's shopping habits become a measure of character. Alibaba admits it judges people by the types of products they buy. \"Someone who plays video games for ten hours a day, for example, would be considered an idle person,\" says Li Yingyun, Sesame's Technology Director. \"Someone who frequently buys diapers would be considered as probably a parent, who on balance is more likely to have a sense of responsibility.\" So the system not only investigates behaviour - it shapes it. It \"nudges\" citizens away from purchases and behaviours the government does not like.\n\n>Friends matter, too. The fifth category is interpersonal relationships. What does their choice of online friends and their interactions say about the person being assessed? Sharing what Sesame Credit refers to as \"positive energy\" online, nice messages about the government or how well the country's economy is doing, will make your score go up.\n\nNot hard to see how that kind of information could determine admissions to universities.  Have a low social credit?  We don't want you.  Have a high social credit?  You are in!",
