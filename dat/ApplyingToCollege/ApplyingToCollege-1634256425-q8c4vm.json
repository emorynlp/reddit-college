  "text": "I know reddit isn\u2019t a place to seek therapy but I just need to get this off my chest. My parents are in real estate and one of their purchases backfired terribly. My family is in a $250k debt plus interest and I\u2019m just devastated right now. My mom came home and told me about it. I admit that I displayed frustration at her risky financial decision, and she started yelling at me. She called me a selfish bitch, and a bunch of other expletives, and she said that I was gonna have no choice but to attend a cheap college. I worked hard all four years of high school in my academics and extracurriculars and all of it has gone down the drain. I just finished my supplementals for my schools, but those don\u2019t seem useful anymore given my situation. I\u2019m expecting to be a National Merit Finalist, but the schools that give full rides aren\u2019t really the ones I want to attend. I\u2019m just so lost on how to continue in a household where emotions are considered signs of weakness and having been put in a position where my college choices have been taken away. Literally the last thing my parents said to me today was to deal with the situation and to get used to living a more painful life.",

Maybe on this subreddit people emphasize good schools, but there are many kids I know who actually choose colleges with aid. If you go to an easier university, get really good grades and accomplish well, it will be totally worth it. \n\nSorry about your situation bud, you're parents must be tense, but she should not have called you a bitch.",

You learned how to work hard and do well in school - that doesn\u2019t end once you get into college. Become financially independent ASAP because who knows what other risky investments your parents may make. Remember, undergraduate schools don\u2019t have a very large impact on life outcome. It\u2019s still in your hands.",

I hope you're keeping yourself safe and well, that kind of stress will really wreck anybody.\n\nI can understand that it's...very delicate with your parents at the moment, and you might want to back off on them for a while. It's really hard to get a good grasp on what to do when tensions are running super hot, so before you make any hard decisions I heavily recommend you take a few days to blow off some steam. The most important person right now (usually always) is you, and you should take care of yourself now. \n\nForget about the apps, get to them when you're better. You'll get into college all the same.",

Dream schools are great and all, but do not put yourself in debt just to afford it. It isn't worth it, and for many majors prestige matters not that much (finance/econ might be an exception). But I'm sure if you are doing pre-med or trying to get a nursing degree or anything else, then I think you will be fine no matter where you go.",
