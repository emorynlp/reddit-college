  "text": "Hello everyone! Application season has well begun and I find myself at a crossroads for which direction I'm going to take. This is my first post (ever) and I suppose one for the UNI schemers and strategists, or just anyone fancying a tougher nut to crack for the day. If nothing else, this will be insightful as to the thoughts in the mind of the EU applicant hoping to be US-bound. Let me reveal the problem to you..\n\nNow, imagine yourself to be an EU IBDP high school senior. You're applying to both the US and the EU, knowing that although EU schools aren't nearly as competitive in the application process they offer an equal if not better education with the benefit of low-cost/free tuition. Although, due to your school's partner organizations, you're entitled to at least -20k USD/year in scholarship aid in the US as an international (see UWC Davis scholarship). \n\nThen add upon that being the typical arrogant high school senior believing that they're somehow entitled to be enrolled into one of the top 50 US colleges and have entangled themselves with a handful of ivies (mine being Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth). \n\nTo add some spice, you're dedicated to taking a gap/deferral year of volunteering and learning that would allow you to apply again and potentially become even more competitive as an applicant. You can do this with the security of knowing that you'll be accepted in the EU next year without all the application stages there are in the US. (\\*\\*keep in mind that EU schools don't normally offer deferrals as in the US) So, if you're still keen on a gap/deferral year, that leaves you with an interesting choice..\n\nEither, you make a balanced application to both the US and EU where you're guaranteed spots at colleges you'd be happy to go to although you may decide to apply again. Here, you may have to reject your admissions if you're not given a deferral, as you're planning to continue in the direction of a gap year. Or, you apply this year to almost exclusively US colleges, based on the security of free EU admission, in the hopes of securing a deferral for next year. Failing the acquisition of a deferral, you apply again the next year with your improved application after a gap year fully utilized (\\*\\*detailed below) and follow a more deliberate list of both EU and US schools (including less prestigious ones). This time, you're picking the school that's best for you (not necessarily based on rank) and you've regained your stamina for the next chapter of your life. \n\nPlease, explain to me what choice you'd make and anything I may not be taking into consideration. All the best <3 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nContext when considering my app;  \n\nAfter long consideration, I've decided to take a gap/deferral year to recover from the especially intense last 2 years of school. Rest assured, I'll be planning this year out to do all the typical things to strengthen my now belated app for the class of '27, e.g. online programming courses, language immersion (finding a job near my family in Spain/France), applying for parliamentary competitions within the European Youth Parliament (EYP) of which I am an alum and the Model European Union in Strasbourg (MEUS).\n\nAlthough, (with my trusty EU Vaccine passport in hand) I'm really planning to spend most of the year volunteering for various EU institutions and NGOs spanning from local civic engagement projects to providing humanitarian aid on a regional basis. \n\n\\- Anticipating an IB 36 for this term's predicted (although working hard to go higher)\n\n\\- International IBDP High School Student (United World Colleges) with scholarship, eligible for the UWC Davis scholarship (i.e. a potential -20k USD discount/year)\n\n\\- Swedish national (also, Hispanic heritage and identity)\n\n\\- Languages; English (first language), Swedish (mother-tongue), German (fluent), Spanish (intermediate)\n\n\\- 385 hours of Lifeguarding Volunteering in Germany throughout the pandemic (stupid I know but for the sake of the overcrowded hospitals and the people I befriended along the way)\n\n\\- A point for any notable achievements in Sports/Student leadership/Academics/out-of-school experience not particularly important for this post (e.g. General-Secretary of my school's MUN club, Amnesty Vice-President, Beach Lifeguarding Team Captain, Student Council Representative, etc..)",
