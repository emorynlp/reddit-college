  "text": "Hey guys, I\u2019m submitting my application to Northeastern, and one of the fee waiver options is \u201cNortheastern Fee Waiver Mailing\u201d. I could\u2019ve sworn I got a mail with a fee waiver for Northeastern, but I can\u2019t find it in my drawer full of college mail. Should I still do it even though I\u2019m not 100% certain I got the mail, or is it better to just pay anyway?",
