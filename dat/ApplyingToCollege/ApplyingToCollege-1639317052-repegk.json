  "text": "I hate this week to be honest. Too much anxiety and unease. What\u2019s gonna happen? I am just stressed, at times I can feel my heartbeat being a bit painful , I am dizzy because of the blood rush . I can\u2019t eat, i am sweating most of the time. I am sure this is not healthy , but there is nothing I can do . \n\nI feel literal pain and I haven\u2019t yet even received a decision. \n\nI feel like if it goes on like this I\u2019ll be dead by the time I receive my admission decision.",

Know that you did everything you could possibly do but it just probably isn\u2019t gonna work out in your favor and be ready for that. A lot a lot a lot of kids with super shiny amazing applications won\u2019t have decisions go their way.\n\nHere\u2019s a post I wrote this weekend that talks more about emotional planning. https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/r8sjp7/happy_weekend_beautiful_seniors_if_you_applied/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nAnd here\u2019s a podcast from Inside College Admissions from Scoir where I chat about planning for your decisions. https://insidecollegeadmissions.buzzsprout.com/1384537/9651241\n\nThese early decisions can really hurt if things don\u2019t go your way for sure. And it\u2019s ok to give into the pain. But either way \u2014 you got this. You are way more than your college admissions. You will grow and learn and be stronger for it in the end.",

But it is what it is! Even if things go south in ED1, please be hopeful for other rounds. I'll do the same too. I'll be rooting for you OP. Wish you all the best and wish the universe will ignite you with calm and positive energies throughout this process \u2728",
