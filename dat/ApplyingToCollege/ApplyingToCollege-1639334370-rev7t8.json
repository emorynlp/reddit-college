              "text": "yeah i just need to immediately find friends who are struggling as much as me... a problem shared is a problem halved imo. if everyone's panicking then it helps me calm down, and when i have a good friend circle, it's going to be easier to get accustomed to living abroad. I have this habit of just... not studying for like 2-3 weeks and then doing it all at once but i doubt that's going to cut it in college. just hoping to channel my mentally healthy, put-together, responsible persona. good luck, for what it's worth :)",
