      "text": ">1. Is there anything I can do now?\n\nNo\n\n>2. How bad is it? \n\nNot ideal, but something like this definitely won't be the reason you don't get in. \n\n>3. Will they assume I have saved my money and am yet to decide what to do with it?\n\nDepends on the person. I would probably interpret \"TBD\" in this way, yes, but someone else may not.\n\n>Is that a bad thing?\n\nWhy would it be a bad thing for you to save the money you make?",
