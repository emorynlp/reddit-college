              "text": "Yeah, I should have included that the prerequisite structure puts de facto limits on how many freshmen and sophomores can take.  In theory a student could take CompSci A or Psychology as a freshman, since they have no listed prereqs, but the school's course offering lists \"10-12\" as the suggested grade levels.  I'm not sure whether that's rigidly enforced.\n\nFor a student who took two years (each) of high school math and foreign language in middle school, the maximally rigorous plan (ignoring electives) would be:\n\nEnglish I, English II, AP Lang, AP Lit\n\nAlg II, Trig/PreCalc, Calc AB, Calc BC\n\nBio, Chem, AP {Science}, AP {Science}\n\nWorld Geography, AP World Hist, AP US Hist, AP Gov+Econ\n\n{Language} III, AP {Language}, {Language} V, {open}\n\nThen students can add additional AP classes as electives starting in 10th grade.  So they're effectively capped to zero in 9th grade, around four in 10th grade (World History, Foreign Language, two electives), then no cap for 11th and 12th.  Following the most rigorous track in the four main areas would have a student taking four APs in both 11th and 12th, and I probably wouldn't recommend adding in excess of one more.",

There are only two electives in the freshman curriculum (one if you are taking a foreign language) and most students satisfy the required arts or CTE credit (which the AP CS would satisfy) \nSophs possibly 1-2 (there are official pathways for AP Spanish Lang, APES) If you satisfied the Arts/CTE, there are two open slots plus the one probably occupied by foreign language. Most ambitious STEM students take double block math  (third year plus precalc) which leaves one open. \n\nJuniors: many students take 3-4 (commonly APUSH, AP English Language, on a reasonably typical pathway, any science, advanced students could take foreign language or Calc) \nSeniors- 4-5 isn\u2019t that uncommon.",
