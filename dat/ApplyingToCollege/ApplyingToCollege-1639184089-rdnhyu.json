      "text": "this is from someone who got rejected from the school they wanted to go for years. \nMy friends literally called me after they found i got rejected and one of the things my friend told me was \"(the school i got rejected from) didnt realize your true potential and just judged you thru paper. You did your best and tried your hardest and they didn't realize that hence the reason why you are worth infinite times more than that stupid school. I know you (my name), you deserve way more than that and I know you will thrive and succeed anywhere you go to.\"\nHope this helped",

Also, I\u2019m not sure if this will work for your friend, but the school I got denied to (OSU) is a big public with a bad reputation, so my friends also said \u201cIt\u2019s probably best you don\u2019t go there, I\u2019ve heard really bad stories\u201d but I don\u2019t know if that will work for your friend.
