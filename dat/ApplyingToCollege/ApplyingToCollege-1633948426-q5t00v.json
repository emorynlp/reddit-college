  "text": " So i finished my common app and was gonna submit my first application. However, in UMD's \"College coursework\" it says number of college credits. Although, I didn't take any college classes, I have college credit because of AP exam that I took , but when I enter the number of credits I earned it asks me to choose a college I earned it from? I earned it from college board's exams so I'm confused",

So I\u2019m just going to put the max 15. I would just put the ones your currently doing and send them your college transcript.",
