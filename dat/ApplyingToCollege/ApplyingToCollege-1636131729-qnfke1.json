  "title:": "Question about reporting gpa and rank with SRAR",
  "text": "My school reports grades from middle school that were for high school credit classes on our trasncript, which means they factor into our GPAs. But for the SRARs from some of these schools, they only ask for grades from 9-11 and courses from 12. If I report only these courses, my GPA and rank would be very different because I have a grade from middle school that weighs my shit down. Do I just report my overall gpa and rank that factors in my middle school grades too or nah?",
