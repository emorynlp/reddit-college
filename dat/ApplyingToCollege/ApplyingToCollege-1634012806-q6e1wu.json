      "text": "These can vary wildly, based on ECs, course rigor, etc.\n\nI'd say that a student with the typical ECs of a high quality high school student should have at least a 3.8 and 1400 SAT to have a good chance at Purdue.\n\nStudents with lower metrics will be admitted, and students with higher will be rejected, but given their published data, this is my guess.",
