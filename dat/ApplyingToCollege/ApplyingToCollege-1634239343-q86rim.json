  "text": "Hey guys! I\u2019m applying to 3 schools early (2 EA, 1 ED). I\u2019m a little confused on how the mid year report works. From my current understanding it\u2019s not until the and of the semester and therefore cannot be submitted for ED/EA schools. But my counselor is trying to turn it in. Another problem is that one of my courses is dual enrollment so there is no grade on my high schools side but rather all on the college\u2019s side. I have no idea what to do. It\u2019s not the end of the semester so a mid year report can\u2019t be turned in right? I have read that some colleges will reach out to the counselor to ask about first quarter grades. I\u2019m super confused and this is stressing me out because I don\u2019t want to tell my counselor that they\u2019re wrong. Or maybe I am wrong. Please help! Thank you in advance!",

      "text": "The counselor sends the mid-year report when available, typically January or February. Obviously it can't be sent before then\n\nSo colleges require Q1 grades from all applicants,  some don't. Some colleges only require Q1 grades from some and will reach out to the GC as needed.\n\nHow your school handles DE grades on the transcript varies by school. You need to ask your GC.",

She then reached out to the college professors for which my daughter is dusk enrolled, received the current grades in those courses and wrote a letter to her ED school letting them know the current status of this grades.
