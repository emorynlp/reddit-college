      "text": "Look for some reason you want to attend that is unique to that school.  \"Strong program in {major}\" is better than nothing, but isn't really great.  You could talk about a specific honors program, a specific internship program, etc.  Is the school \"known for\" anything?  Like, if you're pre-med and are applying to a school known to be favored by pre-med students, then you could talk about the advantages that school provides \\*specifically\\* for pre-med students.  Affiliated with teaching hospital {X}, etc.\n\nAnother example: some schools have NASA research labs on-campus and send a lot of undergrads to NASA internships.  If that were a goal of yours, you could talk about how you're interested in the school because of that specific opportunity.",
