Different people have different opinions on where that threshold is. My opinion would be to not report a score if it's below the college's published 25th percentile. Others say 50th. Colleges publish admission data on their websites in the class profile or the Common Data Set, and at https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/.",
