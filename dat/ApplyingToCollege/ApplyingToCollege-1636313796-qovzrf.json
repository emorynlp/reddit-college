  "text": "I'm a US citizen living in Germany where we don't have official school counselors. I was wondering if a school counselor LOR is still a requirement in this situation. The problem I'm facing is that I wanted to ask my English teacher (who's already writing a LOR) to act as my counselor and I don't think it would work well if I had 2 LORs from the same person.\n\nThanks in advance!",
