  "text": "Hey!\n\nI was just reviewing my commonapp and wanted to make sure I select my SAT superscore correctly.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe testing section question asks:\n\nNumber of past SAT scores you wish to report\\* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf for one of my SAT's the math is higher, and the other- the English, should I report 1 or 2 SAT scores?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!",
