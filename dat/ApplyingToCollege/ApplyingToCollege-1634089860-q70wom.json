  "text": "I'm not sure how to differentiate my PIQ responses from others because it seems like a good response is more mathematical than I expected. What can I do to my essay to make it stand out? I've heard the PIQ's being compared to interview questions, so should I edit my written responses as I would to an interview response? Thanks!",

      "text": "Interview questions are a good way to look at them. Don't write your PIQ responses like you would write your Common App or other colleges' supplemental essays. Don't worry about how pretty or creative your writing is, don't use in-the-moment-detail or hooks. UC has repeatedly said they do not care how well you write. They are evaluating you on what you say, not how you say it. So be specific and focus on experiences where you learned how to be a better student, developed soft skills (like communication, persistence, time management, leadership), or developed your interest in your major. \n\nExplain your motivation or background for a particular activity, the concrete actions you took (we are talking specific examples here, with tangible results (a grade or feedback you received rather than you just telling the reader you improved), and the lessons you learned and/or how you applied them to other areas of your life (for example, if you learned to better communicate when you were volunteering and then used the skill to help your groups collaborate (and get better grades) in class projects). Then, wrap up by explaining why this experience has prepared you for UC, made you interested in contributing to UC in some way (through clubs, etc.), or made you want to apply to UC specifically.\n\nSource: Admissions Essay Coach, specializing in UC campuses.",

              "text": "You shouldn't just be listing activities and tasks in your PIQ responses, and you shouldn't be repeating your activities list (expanding on what you say there, yes; repeating, no). What's going to get their attention is not vibrant writing, it's you being able to provide specific examples to show them you learned the skills or have the qualities they are most interested in seeing students have. \n\nThink of it as the difference between stating *that* you did something and explaining *how* and *why* you did it. For example, \"I raised my grade in AP Calc to an A after working hard over a semester\" is explaining that you did something. So is \"At my internship this summer, I filed paperwork, sat in on calls, and asking the supervisor questions.\" However, \"Not happy with the C I got on my first exam, I went to my teacher for help after school each day, did practice problems without looking at an answer key, and found YouTube tutorials to help explain concepts I didn't understand. As a result, by the end of the semester, I had earned an A in AP Calc\" is explaining *how* you did it.",

I was looking at some example UC essays and a lot of them follow the same formula: a story that introduces a problem and then a solution that ties the story into the prompt.",

                      "text": "No problem! The UC PIQs are different than most of the writing you are probably used to doing and UC is looking for very specific things, so it's hard to get a grasp on what you need to do to be effective right away. Students I work with often go through 4-5 rounds of revision for each PIQ response before they get the content they need (though some do catch on right away).\n\nYes, you want an example that explains the problem and focuses on your actions related to it. I say example and not story because you don't want narrative story-telling elements in there. Think of this structure for the body: Statement about yourself --> examples that illustrate the statement --> result if example of success; lesson learned if example is failure/something that needed improvement. Any failure example should be followed by one that shows you applying the lesson you learned to result in a success.\n\nDon't try to write to the prompts. Unlike other colleges, UC isn't looking for direct answers to the prompts. Think of them more as keywords (leadership, creativity, challenge) to help you think of experiences or qualities you want to showcase. \n\nAlso, be careful of example essays you find online. If they are directly from UC, they will show good examples. If they aren't, they may or may not. Many of the examples of \"good\" UC essays online I see aren't actually that good because they are just short Common App essays, which is exactly what UC doesn't want.",
