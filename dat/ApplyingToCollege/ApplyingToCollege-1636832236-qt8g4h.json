  "text": "I'm from Germany and applying ED to a university. For that, my counselor (who doesn't have a Common App account) has to submit a counselor ED agreement. He's been able to submit all other forms (LOR, School report) and I was wondering if the agreement he has to sign comes in their email, or do they have to have a common app account for that? Will my application be immediately rejected if he isn't able to submit it?\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "Um this could go both ways. The first is he create a Common App account, fills out the ED agreement then submits it. The second route depends on the university you're EDing. You can email or call their admissions office, tell them about your counselor's situation and they might send you or him a PDF versions of the agreement which he can print sign then turn in. Hope this helps.",
