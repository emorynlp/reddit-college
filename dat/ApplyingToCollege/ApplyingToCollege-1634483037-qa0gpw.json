  "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm an international student who wants to major in bio/pre-med and potentially pursue medicine in the future. Are there any schools that are really good in this area? \n\nI'm not really looking to apply to the Ivy League schools or even T20 because I don't think they'd be a good fit for me. Some schools on my list already are the UC schools, UNC, Case Western, and (maybe) UVA.\n\nIdeally, I would like a school with a good balance of social life, academics/preparation for med school, location (convenience, transportation, weather, food, etc.), and overall a good college experience.\n\nAnything will help! Thank you :))",

      "text": "Keep in mind that med school entrance in the US for an international applicant is incredibly hard -- less than 1% of matriculants are international students, and the standards for admission to med school in other countries aren't necessarily the same.\n\nI'd say a lot of public universities with co-located med schools are very good. UNC is a good example, but so are less selective options like Pitt or Minnesota.   Rochester is another good private option to consider that's outside the T20.",
