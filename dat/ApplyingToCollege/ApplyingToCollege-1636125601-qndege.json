  "text": "So basically I don't have grades for 2 years of high school. This year because exams got delayed due to covid, and the next one because exams are in 2022. Is it better if I put predicted grades for this year and 'In Progress' for the next one or vice versa? Another option is that I could put predicted grades for both years.",
