  "text": "If you have a bajillion supplements to write and no motivation (like me lol), find something on your wishlist to buy (or a college acceptance letter \ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75), find a picture of it, make a widget out of it with Widgetsmith, and put it on your lock screen to motivate yourself, IE by telling yourself that you\u2019ll get it if you finish your supplementals by a certain day, or get accepted by a college on decision day. \n\n(For the fountain pen peers) I put a picture of a pro gear sailor from Jetpens, so if I match to Questbridge in December, my shopping cart is already ready to go lmao\n\nSorry if this posts did not make sense, but it works for me",
