  "text": "Nothing urgent, just curious since I submitted my UC app on Nov 13. and so far have only received a portal login from UC San Diego but none of the others. How long does it typically take for them to send? I assume other universities might send them in mass after Nov 30, but I don't know for sure.\n\nJust for context I applied to all UCs except Merced.",
