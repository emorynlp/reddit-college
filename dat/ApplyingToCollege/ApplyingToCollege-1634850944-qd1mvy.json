  "text": " Just a copy and paste, for those who are not aware of the following, general thoughts on paying for college:\n\nStudents who cannot afford to pay full price need to address this issue upfront, when making the list. Spring of senior year, after you get your admission results, is too late.\n\n***Public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more.***  Some exceptions may include UMich, UVA, UNC. OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. \n\nSome public universities offer large merit scholarships to out-of-state students.\n\nSome private universities offer generous need-based financial aid; privates do not differentiate between in-state and out-of-state.\n\nFAFSA EFC *does not* tell you what you can expect to pay for college!!!\n\nFirst see whether you are eligible for any *need-based* financial aid. Run the **Net Price Calculator** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate **before** you apply. *(Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.)* \n\nFederal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow. Larger loans require a parent signature and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow.\n\nIf the need-based estimate does not make the college affordable for your family, then look for merit scholarships. Often, ***the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves.*** Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college.\n\nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: [https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/;](https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/;) see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family. *Note automatic scholarship deadlines, as some might be earlier than the RD deadline.*",
