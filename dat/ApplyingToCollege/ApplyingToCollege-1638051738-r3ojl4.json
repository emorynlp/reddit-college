  "text": "Hi, I'm a first year bichem/pre-med student at UCR trying to transfer to USC. I know that it's uncommon for non-TTP students to transfer into USC their first year from a UC or 4-year, but since I took a fairly rigourous AP courseload in high school, I currently have more than 50% of my degree done at UCR in terms of requirements and units.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm working on my transfer to Dornsife as a potential chemistry/chem-bio major and by the end of my first quarter here, have worked for a 3.8-4.0 GPA pre-finals (general chemistry, calc II, philosophy \\[breadth\\]). I'm not involved in any clubs as I've been hyper-focused on school, but I did rush the pre-med fraternity - I didn't get past the interview, but I will try to rush again in the spring - and have begun an undergraduate research position at a fairly prestigious lab at UCR working on research directly related to my career path.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know USC looks at my senior year grades, so I kept on top of them, holding a 4.0/4.4 UW/W GPA for my 2nd semester and a 3.8/4.2 UW/W my 1st semester (1 B+ in AP Gov). On top of that, I have 2 years of high-level research experience, and have published several papers as a leading author in top high school journals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat more can I do to help with my application, and show that I'm truly committed to getting my degree from SC? I'm having a tough time deciding which of the three essay prompts to address and would appreciate any advice for a science-minded applicant to write a successful essay, as well as any general advice for transferring.",

      "text": "You have more than 50% of your degree finished and you\u2019re doing research in a fairly prestigious lab as a first-semester freshman. Have you thought about staying at UCR? Sounds like things are going well for you. Maybe think about USC for grad school? The path to success doesn\u2019t always follow the course that we expect. Sometimes it (pleasantly) surprises us.",

          "text": "It's been on my mind, but honestly, I'm not happy at UCR in terms of the campus environment. I'm more than happy to be at UC, especially one that's set to climb ranks in the near future, but I find that the environment isn't helping me grow and that I'm struggling to find experiences with people I genuinely connect with. Since UCR is only an hour away from USC, and many of my friends and my girlfriend go to USC, I go to a lot of their events and I've found myself more happy and fitting in more with the environment there than I am here at UCR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR, although academically I'm happy with my progress at UCR, I find that I'm lacking a lot of the experience in terms of finding activities and circles that I fit and belong in.",
