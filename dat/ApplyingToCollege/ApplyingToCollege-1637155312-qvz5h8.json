I also have a paper from AP research junior year, but that one is for an AP exam score only and I don\u2019t have specific feedback. However, I do feel like AP capstone papers feature my writing at its absolute best!",

I\u2019m kind of reluctant to use papers from AP Lang as I took the class during the pandemic and although the grades I got on those papers weren\u2019t bad, I don\u2019t think they reflect my writing at it\u2019s best",
