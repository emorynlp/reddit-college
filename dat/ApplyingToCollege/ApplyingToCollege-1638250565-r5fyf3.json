      "text": "I think if you can demonstrate leadership, communications skills, collaboration in those EC\u2019s, it won\u2019t hurt your app at all. They want someone well-rounded. However, CS and Engr is so competitive at the UCs that having STEM-related ECs (do you have a MESA or Science Olympiad or Mathlete program at your school?) would help put you at an advantage. Try to at least have course rigor in your schedule and take as many STEM classes as possible.",
