  "text": "Hello!  \ni'm not sure if my request for advice fits in here, but I'll try.\n\nI'm from germany and I have to write a motivation letter with many reasons why I am the right one to choose for an exchange year in the USA. I'm studying English and Philosophy for Education and my university has his own program where we have to apply. As I said they expect good reasons why they should choose me.\n\nWhat would you suggest could be the reason one should study in USA for a year and not in England or any other English speaking country? What are the benefits of the Universities in America for becoming teachers?\n\nThanks",
