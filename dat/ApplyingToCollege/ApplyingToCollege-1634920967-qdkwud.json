  "text": "3 of my schools EA deadline is the first, but I don\u2019t get my last SAT score back until the 3rd.\n\nCan I submit SAT scores after the deadline WITHOUT saying I have one planned in case the score is bad? Does it depend on the school?",

I just looked at three schools - one said all material must arrive by the November 1 deadline (delivery for electronic material, postmarked for paper material), one said supplemental material had to arrive by the 10th, and one said nothing.",
