  "text": "Hi so my ninth grade results are pretty weak. I\u2019m an international so my transcript for ninth only depends on my exams I take the end of the year and I had other stuff going on those 2 weeks:\n\nMy grandmother got hospitalised so I had many hospital visits makijg it hard for me to study \n\nI was in an accelerated math class in school so I wrote my board exam for math in ninth it self (igcse) and it was during my school exams and I ended up focusing on the board more (I did get a really good result in the board exam) \n\n\nI also had a piano exam that I had to prepare for.\n\nCould I write these 3 things in my additional info to address my low freshman year grades?",
