  "text": "So I just found out UT Austin requires official transcripts by Dec 1.. not the supporting materials deadline of Dec 8..\n\nI submitted my copy of my transcript, but its unsigned, so will they count this?\n\nMy counselor also submitted a copy of it through the original application, but again, unsigned.. (I dont know why she won't sign unless she's the one submitting them, they wont give me a signed copy..)\n\nOther colleges have accepted this transcript unsigned, but will UT Austin?\n\nI also requested my transcript through Naviance additionally, but I have no way to know when it was sent / if it has been..\n\nLastly, I sent my counselor a request to submit it directly to UT Austins document system, but she won't see it until tomorrow Dec 2.. will they still accept that document?\n\nKinda freaking out rn -- if the request is done by Dec 1, does it still count if she submits them dec 2?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Is it normal for my school to not give me a signed transcript copy? I've asked for one, but they said the best they could do is this unsigned copy unless they're the ones submitting it directly?",

          "text": "Transcript is under \"Required application materials\" that say they're due Dec 1\n\n[https://admissions.utexas.edu/apply/freshman-admission#fndtn-freshman-admission-hs-transcript-submission](https://admissions.utexas.edu/apply/freshman-admission#fndtn-freshman-admission-hs-transcript-submission)\n\nSo I don't think I'm misreading it, but you could be right and they just don't state it on there that there's a transcript grace period\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just got access to MyStatus at 7pm today, so I hope the AO's would understand the soonest I could have my counselor submit it is tomorrow.. (I emailed UT's admissions office saying this and asking for clarification)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: also confusing is they say any records saying \"unofficial\" will be rejected -- but never mention whether it needs to be signed or not to be \"official\" in their eyes..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: In an automated email response to my question to admissions, it states:\n\n\"To meet the deadline for Fall 2022 freshman admission, the online application must be submitted by December 1 at 11:59 p.m. Central and all remaining materials must be received by December 8 at 11:59 p.m. Central.\"\n\nWhich makes it sound like you're correct",

I would've been freaking out about this all night lol",
