  "text": "For household income, I put down 320k for the UC app. My mom just screamed at me my dad is retiring next month, which would basically halve our income. She told me I should've put 150k and my chances at any UC are fucked because colleges only want to help people who \"don't have it made in life\". Is this true?",
