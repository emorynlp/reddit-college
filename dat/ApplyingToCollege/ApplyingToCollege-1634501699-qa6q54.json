  "text": "Hey! Let's imagine a scenario wherein you get 80-90% aid from the college. And, let's say your parents cant contribute a penny (LET'S SAY). Then can that 80-80% be given by the student while on campus? Like, working on research or any other part-time and then earn money and then give it, without having parents to struggle for it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(I am not saying that I am getting such a scholarship or any of that, I was just curious if it works. I . know, it isn't easy to get that much aid, but still, just imagine such a case). :3",

Direct loan from the federal government would be up to $5500 for your first year. Private loans beyond that might need your parents to co-sign.",
