  "text": "Hello!! I'm a senior this year and am currently looking for teachers to look for letters of rec from. I am planning on majoring in something design/computer related, and have already asked my art teacher. \n\nThe AP computer science teacher I do not know well because when I took her class last year it was all remote. All of my other teachers besides calculus I have not had for more than a year, (I took calculus AB last year and am taking BC this year) And I also do not know him well due to remote learning. I want to wait a bit before asking so I can make a better impression, but I also do not want to ask too late. I also don't know what to ask him as my major does not really have to do with math. Any help is appreciated!",
