  "text": "So in the additional information section on common app, i talked about a COVID-19 community disruption. More people were living at my home home due to quarantine, and my sisters Bipolar and schizophrenia got worse. There were a lot of confrontations, and i mentioned occasional physical violence, and the police being called a few times. I didn\u2019t clarify that the situation is better now. How bad is it that I mentioned police/violence? Will it affect my admission? My application is otherwise positive. Should i email my AO to say that the situation is better (and I acted as a mediator)?",

Furthermore, you did not disclose depression, and admissions readers generally do not make assumptions based on things that were not stated in the application. There is nothing in particular for you to share, and sending a follow up email is only drawing further attention to the situation's impact on you (which it sounds like you are trying to minimize).",

In fact, it will strengthen ur app because a lot of applicants to top colleges are privileged and you will add to their diversity (it\u2019s hard to be academically successfully or mentally stable if you are facing challenges like this and it definitely demonstrates your resilience",
