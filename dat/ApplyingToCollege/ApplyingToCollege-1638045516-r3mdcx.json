  "text": "I applied RD to Cornell (Dyson School) and I received a request for an interview through zoom today. I\u2019m a little skeptical as I\u2019ve had 3 interviews: MIT(EA), UPenn(ED), and Georgetown(EA but switched to RD). For all 3 schools I had applied in the early round, and all of the emails seemed official: appropriate header, edu email, etc, but my interviewer from Cornell is making me skeptical. This is the email I got- removed names.\n\n[My name, but spelled wrong],\nHi there. I am an alum at Cornell University and was given your name to I have a meeting. Let me know if you're interested in having a zoom this week. If so, what is your schedule like. Have a great day. \n[Her first and last name]\n\nSent from [her first and last name]\n\nAlso the email is first letter of first name and full last name @comcast.net\n\nEdit: also realized that there was a typo in which she said \u201cname to I have a meeting\u201d. While that\u2019s perfectly fine, in all of my professional interviews I\u2019ve never really seen typo\u2019s",

That's probably why the alum was using a very casual tone since it isn't an interview in the true sense.",
