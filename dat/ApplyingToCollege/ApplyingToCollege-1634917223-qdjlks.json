  "title:": "Stats on Top 10 students (by public campus) in Suburban Public District",
  "text": "A suburban public school district near where I live (in Texas) publishes bios for the top 10 students in the graduating classes of each of its high school campuses.  One of these is an ultra-competitive de facto magnet; the rest are not.  None of them are particularly low-performing.  I compiled some stats on this set of 60 students that A2C may find interesting.  First off:\n\nAsian: 63%  (District is 19% Asian)  \nFemale: 72%\n\nThis should come as no great surprise.  Much ink has been spilled about how poorly male students are doing at the secondary level.  College destinations and majors:\n\nTop college destinations (all students, N=60, N(College)>1):  \n25 UT-Austin  \n5 UT-Dallas  \n3 Harvard  \n2 UNC  \n2 Texas A&M  \n2 St. Mary's  (BS/MD program)  \n2 Rice  \n2 MIT  \n2 Georgia Tech\n\nTop majors (all students, N=60, N(Major)>1):  \n16 Pre-Med  \n12 Computer Science  \n9 Business/Finance  \n3 Computer Engineering  \n2 Mechanical Engineering  \n2 Biomedical Engineering  \n2 Architecture\n\nTop majors (Asian students, N=38, N(Major)>1):  \n14 Pre-Med  \n9 Computer Science  \n4 Business/Finance  \n2 Computer Engineering\n\nTop majors (non-Asian students, N=22, N(Major)>1):  \n5 Business/Finance  \n3 Computer Science  \n2 Pre-Med  \n2 Biomedical Engineering  \n2 Architecture\n\nTop majors (male students, N=17, N(Major)>1):  \n6 Computer Science  \n3 Business/Finance\n\nTop majors (female students, N=43, N(Major)>1):  \n15 Pre-Med  \n6 Computer Science  \n6 Business/Finance  \n2 Computer Engineering  \n2 Biomedical Engineering  \n2 Architecture  \n\n\nAt the ultra-competitive magnet school, 100% of the top 10 were Asian, and only two were heading to public schools (UT-Austin, Georgia Tech).  The other 8 were all headed to T20.\n\nThe difference in preferred major between Asian/Non and Male/Female is interesting.  There is a clear preference among female students for Pre-Med and a preference among male students for CS, which is not a huge surprise.  Non-Asian much more likely to pursue Business/Finance vs. Pre-Med/CS/Engineering.",
