But on the teachers side it says it is, they submitted through scoir this new program we\u2019re using. \n\nMy counselor emailed MiT about it and apparently their having some issues with the website on their end but it should be fine but like. Aren\u2019t desciosn supposed to be coming out December 15th, if my things still aren\u2019t in what\u2019s the chance I\u2019m even gonna be accepted or even looked at. What if the problems continue and I just get like don\u2019t even get a response because things haven\u2019t loaded.\n\nHas this happened to anyone else?",

      "text": "Something very similar happened with my transcript. My school\u2019s system said it was sent well before the deadline but MIT emailed me on Nov 16 about a missing part. My counselor confirmed it was sent and emailed it just to be safe, and now the MIT portal says my transcript was received on Nov 1. \n\nIt sounds like these issues are completely on MIT\u2019s end; I doubt they\u2019ll have an impact on your chances and AOs will see that it\u2019s not your fault. Best of luck!",
