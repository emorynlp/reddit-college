  "text": "I heard that the ED pool, for a lot of schools, has a pie cut out for recruited athletes. Does this mean that these athletes also apply ED and then receive acceptances on the same day as other ED applicants, or do they have everything coordinated with the coaches/recruiters and basically know their acceptance earlier than the ED release date?",

      "text": "Some athletes receive admissions offers before the ED date but are still part of the ED pool. They usually get a pre-read during the recruitment process that lets the coach know if their GPA and testing are academically viable for the school. That\u2019s why the admit rate for athletes is higher. They still need to complete the application and recommendations but might do so earlier than general ED.",

      "text": "Pre-read with AOs, then a formal likely letter a few weeks after they submit their application. The actual acceptance is still via the portal (at least for the Ivies/T5), so they're waiting for release dates, just like everyone else.",
