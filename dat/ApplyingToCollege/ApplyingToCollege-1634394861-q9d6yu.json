  "text": "I\u2019m just so frustrated. I got my SAT score and it was thirty points lower than the other one I took, and each SAT I\u2019ve taken I get the same score on both parts, so I can\u2019t superscore. My extracurriculars take too much of my time (can\u2019t drop because I have leadership positions) and I barely have enough time to do my homework. My sleep schedule is terrible, and I don\u2019t even know where to apply. I don\u2019t know what I want to major in and I feel so lost. My mental health is declining and I don\u2019t know what to do. I am feeling so burnt out right now.",

      "text": "1. If you're applying RD anywhere, could just go ahead and take the SAT again.  Or take the ACT.  Even if you don't study at all, there's the potential to get lucky and/or benefit from super-scoring.\n2. You can always drop an EC, even if you're in leadership.  Just be aware you may burn bridges with the sponsor.\n3. Figuring out where to apply can be as straightforward as you want it to be.  If you're high stats, then state flagship + #2 school in state + 3 schools where your test score is roughly median and overall acceptance rate is in the 30+% range + 3 schools where your test score is roughly median and acceptance rate is sub-30%.  If money is a concern, then ratchet down the selectivity and add some options where you're likely to get a lot of merit $.\n4. Figuring out what you want to \"do with your life\" is maybe your most important task.  It's not necessarily urgent; for instance, you could apply undecided to schools that allow you to easily switch in to competitive majors.  Deciding before you apply does give you more options, since it allows you to apply to schools where switching into competitive majors is difficult or impossible.  Long-term, the most important thing is honing in on what sort of career you would find meaningful and rewarding.  If you can figure that out then you'll be ahead of most students.  Encourage you to focus more on \"what do I want to 'do' long-term\" instead of \"what major should I pick\".  If you answer the first question, then answering the 2nd question becomes much more straightforward.",
