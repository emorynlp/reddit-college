But they ask for it in a *separate question*.  \n\nThe general common app section asks for top scores in each section. (superscore) And, as I mentioned, schools that don\u2019t superscore will ask their own separate question about SAT scores in the school specific section.  An applicant should NOT change the highest section scores they reported in the general common app section.\n\nFor instance, in my application for UIUC, I reported on the general common app section my highest section scores.  But, since UIUC doesn\u2019t superscore, in the UIUC section, there is a separate question asking for the highest total score.",
