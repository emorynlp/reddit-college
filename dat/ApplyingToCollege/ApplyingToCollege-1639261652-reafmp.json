Maybe Stanford has 500 people who look like you on paper, but Yale only has 20 and you\u2019re the best of their 20.  It happens.",

Out of the 4 or 5 (don\u2019t remember exactly) kids who got into Stanford from my school last year, only 1 got in through REA. One of those kids had been on a full rejection streak from private colleges until getting into Stanford. The val got rejected from Stanford REA but got into Harvard RD. So you may as well try.",
