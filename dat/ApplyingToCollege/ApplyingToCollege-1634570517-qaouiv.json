  "title:": "Please chill out complaining about \"immigrant parents\" or \"ethnic parents\" as a whole",
  "text": "I'm not saying that people can't use a2c to vent or need to hide their family background\u2014there's definitely a correlation between being an immigrant and inheriting a stressful \"grind\" mindset. \n\nHOWEVER, that does not mean that every parent out there who's Asian/isn't white/immigrated during their lifetime is part of that group. That statement might sound obvious, but I've seen a lot of posts in a moment of frustration complain about stuff like \"you can't win with immigrant parents,\" when what they really mean is \"you can't win with MY parents; anyone feel the same way?\"\n\n\"Immigrant parent\" has become a shorthand on this sub for \"pushy, academically-obsessed, and abusive,\" and that's quite the shame in my opinion. Saying they're all one way is a pretty broad collector for those whose parents are perfectly chill and don't get talked about much on this sub, and leads to clueless posts like \"I feel so bad for those with Asian parents!\" \n\nThere's no need to demonize someone's background, which is literally out of their control. Demonizing unhealthy behaviors would be more productive.\n\nAnd once more to clarify, I still think people should feel free to vent about parents being abusive or controlling or just annoying on this sub, and should feel free to speak about their family background and how it influences their dynamics. I also think discussions about how certain cultural values influence attitudes toward college can be useful and enlightening (one of my best friends has helicopter parents like I do, but the things they said and implied about the future were very different, as we come from different cultural backgrounds. It was interesting and a bit of a relief to discuss this with her.) \n\nBut please try not to bucket all people from a category into specific behaviors, positive or negative.",

They certainly don't check grades or know the SAT from a hole in the ground. They will pull their kid put of school as needed to help with family stuff. Their own experience tells them the best path to success is to leave school at 18, work your ass off in a trade or other \"real\" job, and be 100% dedicated to family. \n\nThose sorts of parents are under representation here, because they rarely have super high-achieving students.

It's not difficult to frame it in the singular as the parent being toxic instead of the ethnic group.\n\nWhich is another issue entirely. For instance (and from personal experience) Vietnamese immigrant parents tend to be hard on their kids (not all but a large chunk) but in Vietnam most are pretty lax. So it's less about the ethnic culture background and more about the culture of being in the US (sorry being US centric here). \n\nIt's just hard for us first gen from immigrant parents. We end up inheriting our parents dreams and aspirations. Luckily mine were supportive and loving but that's the case for others. However I don't generalize experiences.",

They wanted me to be a good student but they're weren't pushy about being the top of the class.They always taught me that there was other things in life, being happy was important and education is education.

I said, \u201cI\u2026 think discussions about how certain cultural values influence attitudes toward college can be useful and enlightening.\n\n\"***You might not have parents who are like that, but a good number of people do. Hell, theres even a subreddit about Asian Parents.\"***\n\nI understand why the content of my post would lead you to extrapolate likely conclusions about my own background and of those around me, but believe me when I say that my background has not led me to be ignorant of common Asian parenting styles.\n\n***\"In addition, from what I\u2019ve heard, strict parenting and heavy emphasis on education are common values in most immigrant families, regardless of whether they have origins in Asia or another continent.\"***\n\nThey\u2019re not too uncommon in the United States, either! The U.S. actually has a pretty grindy culture endemic to it, with [the average U.S. employee working similar hours to one in Japan](https://ourworldindata.org/working-hours) and more than the average employee of other developed countries such as the U.K., Australia, Germany, etc. Working hours are more correlated with a country having fast growth (\u201cdeveloping\u201d) than with being in Asia (though [many Asian countries are considered \u201cdeveloping\u201d](https://isge2018.isgesociety.com/registration/list-of-developing-countries/), so there\u2019s a fair amount of overlap.)\n\n\"***I'm fortunate that my parents aren't overbearing and literally throw me into a pressure cooker when it comes to school, but my friends do.

Getting no support for activities and pressured to compete against people they know? Yeah that happens. A lot.\"***\n\nI agree, and it sucks! The struggles of students with highly controlling parents isn\u2019t seen as a big issue, and I wish there was more attention drawn to it. Many of the parents doing so are Asian (though I am familiar with parents of nearly every background who have done similar things,)\u2014however, just because it happens is not an excuse to make negative comments about all Asian parents. You can criticize behaviors, you can criticize cultural morays, you can criticize individuals. But I don\u2019t believe in criticizing race, nationality, or family background. (If people take one thing from this, I hope that would be it.)\n\n\"***Especially in competitive areas where there are a large number of magnet / private/ elite public schools. It's great that your in a environment where you know people who are pretty supportive of their kids.\"***\n\nWell, I\u2019m in college right now, and can\u2019t speak for the general parenting styles in my city since I\u2019ve only been here a month. But I actually did grow up in the environment you describe, and still hold the beliefs I do.Also, keep in mind that parental complaining, inherently, selects for those who have more to complain about. You say that over half your Asian friends have overbearing parents, and perhaps this is true, but I don\u2019t often hear people make even-keeled comments such as \u201cmy parents are annoying in x way but not particularly controlling\u201d or \u201cmy parents are overly invested this aspect of my life but great otherwise.\u201d That\u2019s not how complaining works. People share problems to vent, to seek advice, not to provide data for some sort of hypothetical parenting styles census.\n\n\"***But in my pretty competitive area, for 99% of Asian kids I know, even the most progressive parents still make their kids go into a non-humanities subject.\"***\n\nMmm, I\u2019m not from where you are, but that statistic seems high for me. For one thing, parents actually have relatively limited control over what their children major in once said kids are in college (unless you believe 99% of parents would withdraw financial support for non-STEM subjects, but I doubt that is the case.) \u201cHighly encouraging\u201d is not the same as \u201cmaking\u201d someone do something, and in highly competitive areas, I\u2019ve found the STEM thing to be true regardless of race. For another, at my school, I've met plenty of Asians in non-STEM departments, especially psychology, economics, language studies, music, and English.\n\n\"***The good news is that Asian parents are more lax now than before because they have seen more of a less grinding academic culture and I think in the future, this stereotype will probably die away with the next 20 years or so.\"***\n\nI do not believe that these associations with Asian parenting will be fade away so quickly\u2014they\u2019ve stuck around for several generations already. They do tend to be replaced with more values and parenting styles common to the U.S. as further generations are born in the United States, but recent immigrants are going to continue to be heavily influenced by their own cultural values for a long time (unless massive globalization becomes a thing.) That being said, cultural backgrounds may influence an individual, but do not define them. The U.S. has a reputation for the parents being relaxed and friendly, and I\u2019m sure you know parents who were born in the U.S. who are strict disciplinarians. Yet I hardly see anyone say, \u201cMy American parents are so lazy\u2014they won\u2019t even help me with college apps.\u201d (People do make complaints like this, but the focus isn\u2019t on the parents\u2019 backgrounds.)\n\n\"***I don't want to hurt anyones feelings and I agree that the broad mindset is harmful, but it happens far more than you realize, just saying.\"***\n\nYou didn\u2019t hurt my feelings!
