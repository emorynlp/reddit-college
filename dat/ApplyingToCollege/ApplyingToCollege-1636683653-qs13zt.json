  "text": "Common App Experiences?\n\nHi everyone,  I put on the common app for a  school (already submitted it) that didn't want to live on campus but now I am strongly considering it.  Will they ask me again my housing situation or is this all set in stone?\n\nI\u2019m just in need of financial aid too so am panicking right now about this.  If it helps it\u2019s a public university that is in state for me.  Any advice is really appreciated.  Thank You",

Check their website and see if you can find any additional information. Also, if you're worried, you'll probably be fine if you reach out to your AO and ask to change housing preferences (but again, may depend on college).\n\nI'd assume it's probably something you can change later on, as a number of people will likely have changed their minds about housing, but make sure to check!",
