  "title:": "8th grade predictions come true",
  "text": "So in 8th grade my English teacher made use write letters to our future senior selves, and I recently received mine! Part of the assignment was to list predictions for the future, including where you think you\u2019re going to college. I had completely forgotten what I had written 4 years ago, but I was so surprised to see how accurate it was. My friends and I got kick out of reading it. \n\nMy 8th grade self claimed, with a decent amount of certainty, that I would either be going to Cornell or Yale, two schools that were arbitrarily picked because they sounded cool. I am now extremely excited to say that I have been accepted to Yale! It\u2019s crazy to think that my extremely overconfident \u201cprediction,\u201d more like crapshot, actually came true. \n\nI thought that you guys would enjoy this wack story \n\n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m not a legacy nor have my parents donated a building",

I am forever thankful to my 8th grade teacher for bringing back the memories that I thought I would never forget. \n\nI was one of the more detailed writers in my grade with around 9 pages (front and back) of letters, but I still wish that I had written more. I wish that I had included more specific interactions with individual people instead of speaking on a more general level; think more of a diary entry of hand-picked events as opposed to a reflection. One of my friends even wrote down word-for-word her favorite text messages from her friends. That was probably my favorite part of her letters (they were absolutely hilarious). Some printed out pictures would\u2019ve been nice as well. I had included several inside jokes within my letters, but without any explanation, and that was a little frustrating to read. \n\nI really hope that this has helped!
