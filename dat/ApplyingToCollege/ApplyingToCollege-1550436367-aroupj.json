I'm 99% sure it'll be released on the 9th. Check [this post I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ax3io9/prediction_caltechs_decisions_will_come_out_on/) for more info.",

Also, I didn't receive a decision for UC Santa Cruz last night... Their website says decisions begin March 15, so, [as someone said in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/b12zn1/do_yall_think_ucsc_is_coming_out_tonight_at/), maybe the 12am to 6am rolling admissions begin tonight? I'm not sure though... Thanks for maintaining this list over the past few weeks!",
