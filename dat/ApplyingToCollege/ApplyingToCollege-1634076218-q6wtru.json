  "text": "i was told by my college counselor that i should not bother retaking the sat and apply test optional, but with the last few months i have been debating heavily if it will negatively impact my chances.\n\ni have a high gpa and a low sat, and i\u2019m really struggling on whether i should apply for the november sat with a fee. i\u2019m afraid that the score difference will make me look boosted.\n\ngpa weighted: 4.56\ngpa unweighted: 3.66\n\nsat: 1140, but i\u2019m debating on either retaking it or applying test optional for the fall 2022 applicants :/\n\nthanks in advance!!",

      "text": "Almost half of acceptances at top institutions were test optional. There is no real reason to include a score if it isn't well above the average at the college you're applying to. The rest of your application might make them think that you actually would have gotten a 1300 or something, so you never know. This would happen if you use that time on your essays instead of wasting it on a SAT, that too during senior year. SAT stuff should happen junior year and summer before senior year so that you can spend now for college apps. So spend it on college apps.",
