  "text": "Hi, I am a junior making my college list a bit earlier and I wanted to know what schools offer a program that allows me to get my engineering degree and an MBA in 5ish years. I know schools like  Syracuse, Johns Hopkins, UGA, Notre Dame, and Duke do but I was interested in knowing if any others do too\n\nThank you in advance",
