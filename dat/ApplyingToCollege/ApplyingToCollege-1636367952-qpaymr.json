  "title:": "HELP - Messed up recommender's mail ID",
  "text": "While submitting my common app, I invited my teacher but messed up her email address a little bit. So the invitation never reached her. I only applied to one college yet, thankfully. Today (a week after inviting), I deleted the recommender with wrong mail ID and just added a new one with the correct mail id. Am I screwed? can I call the admissions office and get it fixed? is this a big deal.\n\nSide note : the college I am talking about is Princeton University",
