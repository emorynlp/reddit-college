  "title:": "Just found out that my old school indeed did NOT send in my transcripts",
  "text": "So as the title showed, I asked my old school (because I switched schools from the 11th grade) to send in my transcripts to colleges I\u2019m applying to since August. I sent them the whole college list and everything and in September the transcripts was suppose to be sent. However, Umiami is telling me they don\u2019t have any record of nothing being sent. \n\nMiami is my ED school, I tried contacting my old school but I\u2019m not getting through to them. I shouldn\u2019t be so worried because Miami have a extra 2 week deadline after Nov 1 to get everything sent in but my old school takes a longggg time to send in anything about 3 weeks max and they\u2019re not answering and I\u2019m trying to not freak out \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",
