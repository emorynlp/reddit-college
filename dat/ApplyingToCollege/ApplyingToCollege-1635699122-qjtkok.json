      "text": "So here is my approach to the college search process (college freshman here)-\n\nEither A, you know what you want to do and you will choose a school for programs over vibes. Or B, you don't know what you want to do, you put the simple answer of undecided on your application, and you choose vibes over program. I was A, my sister is B.\n\nI now go to Purdue for energy engineering technology. I wanted to do environmental engineering with more a focus on energy, and this was the only program like it. Sure west lafayette isnt ideal, but im lovin it here so far.\n\nThe fun part though which I like to tell all my friends younger than me is that I did not seriously consider Purdue until like 2-3 weeks before the early application was due. I actually recieved a card in the mail advertising their new majors for next year and saw that energy thing and i was like awwww yeahhhhh. Fun part though was i was super close to being done with my Purdue application for first year engineering, so I straight up scraped the whole thing and redid it for this program.\n\nAnd hey it worked lol. The point is kid is dont feel discoraged bc you dont know what you wanna do, and its ok to put undecided as your major of choice for now. Just find a school that makes you happy, and you could fr see yourself there.",

          "text": "that makes sense, but i already did some AP and dual enrollment to get out of some of the general freshman classes and get straight to my major faster. I am thinking about doing comp sci and don\u2019t want to put undecided because what if it\u2019s hard to get into a super competitive major? Like i do think computers are cool and think it would be interesting to learn how they work it\u2019s just i probably won\u2019t be great at it and feel like i\u2019ll get sick of it since it\u2019s not like a big passion of mine. I don\u2019t want a job where i sit in front of a screen all day, but idk what else to do. I might do business if i end up not liking CS bc there\u2019s a lot you can do with it, but I honestly don\u2019t know too much about how college works yet i have to do all the applications so i\u2019m stressed\n\nalso i\u2019ve never really known what i want to do because i\u2019m interested in a lot of things but not enough in one specific thing to major in it. Also i want to have a practical degree that can get me a good job as well, like the stuff i\u2019m interested in you don\u2019t necessarily need a degree for and doesn\u2019t pay well :/",
