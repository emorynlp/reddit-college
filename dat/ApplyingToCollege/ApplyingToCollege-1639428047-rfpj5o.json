  "title:": "EC question: I do a lot of freelancing art work/commissions, nothing super impressive like you\u2019d have in an art portfolio, just stuff like customised nails, bags, digital portraits, social media graphics, logos, phone cases, animations etc",
  "text": "Art is very important to me and this is one of my main ECs, ive spent a lot of time on it ever since middle school. I have an instagram page too, but I dont post often and it doesnt showcase much of my work at all. Do you think its worth adding the name of the page, or should I add a drive link w pictures of my art or something?\nKinda unsure as once i read somewhere that art is only worth adding to your app if you have an entire portfolio with 10-20 large pieces, and not if you do it as a hobby",

      "text": "idk about linking your work but i do think you should mention it in your application. I similarly did graphic design and video editing for people and i mentioned it on my applications, but didn\u2019t include any of it for them to see. If you spend a lot of time on it then it should definitely go on there",
