  "title:": "Which would look better and rigorous: Adv. Precal VS AP Stats in Senior Year",
  "text": " I am planning to be a **business major**, majoring in **MIS or Analytics.** \n\nFrom what I heard, AP Stats is generally more versatile and practical but at the same time, Stats has a reputation being a \"easy\" math class that seniors and juniors take to avoid Calculus.\n\nI am solid at Math, but I generally like Stats more as I find it to be more practical to the real world, etc. \n\n I might even take Precal during the summer and take AP Calc AB instead of Precal if it gives me much more of a boost in terms of rigor and desirability to selective Business Schools like UT McCombs, Wharton, etc.",
