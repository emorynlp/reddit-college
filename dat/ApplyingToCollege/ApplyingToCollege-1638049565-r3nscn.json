  "text": "i started playing soccer in hs, two years junior varsity. i\u2019m not sure if this is significant at all, maybe the only thing is that i received an award for most improved. i didn\u2019t play after that because the season started when i was doing distance learning for covid reasons and my school was too far away to drive back & forth everyday, so it was just junior varsity for two years.",
