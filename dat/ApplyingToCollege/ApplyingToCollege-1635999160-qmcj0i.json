  "title:": "How to go about transferring LOR to university without seeing it?",
  "text": "This is probably a really dumb question, yet for some reason I haven\u2019t found out the answer yet. When I receive a LOR from a teacher, I need some way to transfer it to my college application without seeing it as I signed that one agreement that stated that I can\u2019t look at any of my LOR\u2019s. Now, the obvious answer is just \u201cdon\u2019t read it\u201d but I doubt that the process of submitting a LOR is the teacher giving you it by email so that you have free reign over it before you submit it to college board. There would be no point in the agreement then, right? What is this process? Or am I just completely misunderstanding something? Thanks!",

I would assume this is true for direct applications, but for some scholarships I applied for my teacher sent me the recommendation, and i was trusted not to see it.",

      "text": "As another commenter pointed out, you don't submit your recommendations, your teachers do\n\nAs an aside, the FERPA agreement doesn't mean that you cannot **view** your recommendations, rather that colleges/teachers are not **required to allow you to view it**  (if that wording makes no sense, sorry, I'm just tired)\n\nBut yeah, tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of applicants probably read their LORs every year, and more than you'd expect probably write 'em themselves",
