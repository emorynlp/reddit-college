  "title:": "I have discovered the secret to writing college essays",
  "text": "I just noticed a major pattern between all my best essays: they were all written after a nap. I'm not even kidding.\n\nOccasionally, when I get home from school, I'm so unbelievably tired that I just collapse on my bed and fall asleep. This happened on 4 separate occasions in October, and in all 4 cases I decided to write an essay after waking up. Those essays were the best ones, and I'm just now noticing the correlation because the same thing happened today and the essay turned out really well. \n\nThe other essays, not written immediately following a nap (control group for my AP Stats people), were not as good.\n\nA2C, I don't think you realize how perfect this is. My sleep schedule is presently *horrendous*, and I'm getting 3-4 hours a night. But now, on the days that I don't have ECs until later in the evening, I can just come home, nap for an hour or two, and write a great essay. \n\nBoth my essays and sleep schedule are gonna get so much better. I'm so glad I realized this.",
