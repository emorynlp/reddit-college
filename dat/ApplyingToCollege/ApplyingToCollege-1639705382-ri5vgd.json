  "title:": "I genuinely don't care that I got rejected at my ED",
  "text": "I just checked my UPenn portal and ofc, I got rejected. To be completely honest while I was making coffee and breakfast instead of looking at my results an hour ago I was already contemplating whether if I even want to go if I got in. Ivy league is so full of rich pricks(sorry if you got in) and all the top 10 lists I see UPenn in are like student depression rate. I applied for my ED2 Vanderbilt early so I've honestly fallen in love with Vanderbilt way more. So when I got rejected I just told those that asked \"I took an L LMAO\" because I don't feel any sorrow right now. I think I would've been happy if I got accepted, not because it is Penn, but because I got into my ED.\n\nIs this normal? Or do yall think that the shame and sorrow will kick in later?",
