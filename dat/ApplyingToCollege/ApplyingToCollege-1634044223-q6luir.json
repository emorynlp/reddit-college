  "text": "My school makes us use Parchment to send our high school transcripts to common app + different universities. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I sent my transcript to the right place on the Common App, but there\u2019s no Georgetown University for undergraduate admissions popping up when I type Georgetown in the search bar (they only have the school of continuing studies, law school, etc.) \n\nSo I decided to mail my transcript instead, but Georgetown only has a webpage about Parchment and sending transcripts that are for TRANSFER applicants, not regular applicants like me :( \n\nWhere should I send the transcript to? (As in the email)\nWould I be better off if I just reach out to them??",
