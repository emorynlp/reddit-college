Like some of the questions are \u201cwhat\u2019s a quality you admire in yourself\u201d and \u201cwhich character do you relate to\u201d. Am I supposed to say stuff that\u2019s supposed to wow colleges or can I just take these questions easy?",

      "text": "I struggled with the short answers for a while too. I kept getting in my head about what they did or didn't want to hear, and it drowned out the voice that was trying to tell me the honest answers. It turned out a lot of my real answers were actually quite interesting and unique once I finally chilled out enough to listen to myself.\n\nTry to let go of the audience a little bit, and spend some time getting in touch with your actual thoughts, memories, and opinions, like you would for a journaling exercise or a conversation with an old friend. This made these questions a lot more fun, and generated some answers that really represented me and that I was proud to submit.\n\nEven with this though, a few of my answers were bland. Not every question is going to trigger a strong memory or opinion, and sometimes the common, generic answer is the honest one. I imagine that's pretty normal, even among admits. But taking it easy on *all* the short answers is probably a bad move.",
