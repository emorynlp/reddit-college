  "text": "\nOk, so this is pretty bad. I submitted my Uc Apps earlier today. Then after I looked over my application again after submitting, I realized I made a grave mistake on the activities section. I served on the \u201cYouth\u201d Board of Directors at this non profit, but I simply stated Board of Directors. I forgot to put \u201cyouth\u201d which is probably the most important 5 letter word in this. I did mention this activity as being \u201cyouth\u201d later in the essay, but I am afraid they might accuse me of misrepresenting myself on the application. I contacted the application center, but all they told me was that you can\u2019t make corrections to the activities section of the UC app. UC Campuses don\u2019t even allow me to individually contact them to let them know about this mistake. I don\u2019t know what to do. I really put a lot of work into the UC app and now I am afraid they might even come after me for misrepresenting myself. What should I do? I am considering withdrawing my whole application. Any advice would be welcomed.",
