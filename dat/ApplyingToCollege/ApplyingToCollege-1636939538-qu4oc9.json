  "text": "I hold an executive position in a club but tomorrow is my first wrestling practice at 3:15.  I really wanna wrestle, but I also wanna keep my position so idk what to do, because my club is until 4:00 usually, and my coaches would kill me if I came an hour late or something like that. I\u2019ve been apart of the club for 3 years. How bad would it look if I was to leave it for wrestling varsity to colleges? Which path should I choose? At this point, I think I have to stick with one option, because I can\u2019t be in 2 places at once.\nThings to keep in mind\n\n1) I have potential but I\u2019m a shitty wrestler\n2) My shoulder got messed up during off-season practice, it\u2019s still pretty bad, makes it hurts to wipe my ass\n3) my club only meets once a week, so if I were to not join wrestling, I\u2019d be putting it off for something taht meets once a week which is weird\n4) I\u2019ve been training over the summer for wrestling, but it is very time consuming during school time, while the club isn\u2019t \n5) I think having a leadership position in a club is better than being on a varsity team (but I might be wrong)\n6) my club is generic and won\u2019t help me grow as much as wrestling + I have more fun during wrestling with my friends than in club with people I don\u2019t like\n7) ditching responsibility for wrestling might look bad on me in general and to colleges",
