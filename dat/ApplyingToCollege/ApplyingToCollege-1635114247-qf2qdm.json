      "text": "Every school that I\u2019ve seen talk about their admissions process has said that that\u2019s not the case. There are no quotas or limits on how many people colleges will accept from a given school or town (although public schools have certain limits on the amount of out of state students they can accept) What you will be compared to is your school profile \u2014 AOs will look at the resources you had available to you and how you used them. Lol I get where you\u2019re coming from though \u2014 I come from a super competitive feeder school, so I can\u2019t help but think about how lots of my classmates probably have better chances than I do rip",
