  "title:": "International who doesn't need Aid - Is this an edge (for EA/ED and regular)?",
  "text": "I go to a british boarding school and looking to apply EA/ED next year to Amherst, Williams or Dartmouth. I have straight As since the beginning of 'high school', 1520 SATs and halfdecent ECs (diploma level cello, nationally ranked squash player).\n\nWould the fact I don't need financial aid give me a leg up in early applications and in applications in general? Even though I'm in the UK, my passport is from a European country that doesn't send many kids to the US if that helps.",

      "text": "Yessir, at the end of the day unis are businesses so they want to maximize revenue and international students are a good way of doing that. A lot of unis see internationals as a positive thing in general as it diversifies their class, so if your a good student who can pay on top of that then your definitely in a good spot",

      "text": "it wont give u a leg up but it will definitely prevent u from getting a leg down. finaid is the last call for a lot of aid dependent International applicants so i think its more that incase AOs approve ur app then the uni/college wont reject u bcoz u asked for too much aid or u wont have to turn them down bcoz they offered too little. so in a way, u could consider a massive leg up if u have a strong app already",

      "text": "You should definitely look into colleges that still have squash programs, and reach out to those coaches individually.  If you're a junior now, it's fine to reach out.  Amherst has a great program, as do many other schools on the East Coast.  That might become a much yes-bigger factor for you than being a full-pay student.  Good luck!",
