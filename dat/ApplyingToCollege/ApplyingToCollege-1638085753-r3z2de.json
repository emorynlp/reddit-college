  "text": "If anyone knows, do UC's prefer narrative PIQ's where I guide the reader through an experience that demonstrates my personal qualities or growth vs one where I simply tell the reader here is what I did, what happened, and what I learned. Heard conflicting information about both. Seems like they want it to be direct, but when I asked my UCB counselor for my CC, I'm applying for transfer, and presented him with both options, he said he liked the narrative style better.",
