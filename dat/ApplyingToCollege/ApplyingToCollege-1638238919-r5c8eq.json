  "title:": "Harvard Interview: My Experience",
  "text": "I just had my Harvard interview and I wanted to go over some of the things I was asked and some things you should look for.  Every interviewer is going to be different, but from what I\u2019ve researched, they typically stick to similar questions.\n\nRESUME:\n\nI would highly recommend a resume going into your interview.  I procrastinated on mine because I did not know how to format it and it turned out very meh.  I did include pictures on a second page to give some visuals as to what I was discussing and my interviewer did seem to appreciate this as they referenced them multiple times throughout the interview.\n\nQUESTIONS:\n\n* COVID\n   * What was your COVID experience like?\n   * What have you done during COVID?\n   * What were your school\u2019s policies during COVID?\n   * Do you feel they worked well?\n\nFrom what I understand they want to get a feel for how you and your community reacted to COVID.  I have also read that they are especially looking for people who took advantage of the free time to work on projects and do things outside of school.  Despite the questions about COVID, I was never directly asked about my personal feelings on politics relating to the virus or whether or not I have received the vaccine.\n\n* School\n   * What is your favorite class?\n   * Why?\n   * What is your favorite book?\n   * Do you read a lot?\n   * What types of books do you read?\n\nMy interviewer asked a few questions vaguely related to school, but I was never asked about my test scores, GPA, or how many AP classes I am taking.  Your mileage may vary here because I\u2019ve heard of other interviewers harping on grades for most of the interview.\n\n* Extra-Curricular Activities\n   * What do you do outside of school?\n\nI can\u2019t elaborate much here because the subsequent questions were specifically related to my specific extracurricular activities.  We spent a good chunk of the interview on this section, so I would definitely be prepared to talk about what you like outside of school.\n\n* Closing Questions\n   * Why Harvard?\n   * What is one thing you want Harvard to know about you?\n   * Do you have any questions for me?\n\nThe closing questions were pretty generic, although I did fall a little flat here personally.  I would definitely figure out how you want to end the interview since that is the part the interviewer will remember most.  I personally asked my interviewer about their experience at Harvard and we had a short discussion about diversity on campus.  Obviously, this is specific to your interviewer.\n\nI hope this helps some!",

We also talked about how I deal with mental health and we had a discussion about the importance of valuing mental health. Something that is very consistent though is \"why harvard\", describe ecs, and overall show intellectual vitality and a willingness to change :)",

      "text": "Mine was very different! (So we\u2019re my experience, it\u2019s understandable.) he introduced himself and asked me to introduce myself too. So I said I\u2019d moved to the US from a few years ago. He asked what I noticed was different in America, what I learned, where I have been besides my state, etc. then we kinda went onto the activities I\u2019ve done, and I once I said I missed a teacher and was told he left the school during volunteering at camp, he asked if I\u2019d tried to reach out to the teacher. Then he asked for specific ways I reached out. And asked if I had any questions.\n\nI guess they adjust very well to their interviewees, at least mine did. He obviously improvised since he didn\u2019t know any of that beforehand (that\u2019s why I loved the interview, he was really engaged in my answers).\n\nEdit: instead of \u201cWhy Harvard?\u201d He asked if I valued the location at the East Coast and if location was actually important for me lol",
