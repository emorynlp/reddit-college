  "title:": "Is it bad that we just sent out Christmas cards consisting of a photo of the family posing at the school that just rejected my son's ED application?",
  "text": "We haven't had many family vacations this past year and we got a good family photo at the main entrance of the ED school when we were touring.  My son does not seem terribly upset at the rejection, as it was quite a reach for him.  It's also my alma mater, if that makes it any more justifiable.",
