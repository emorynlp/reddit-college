  "text": "I\u2019m pretty sure this is right but if someone can confirm I\u2019d appreciate it. Thanks in advance. \n\nI\u2019ve taken the ACT twice (first time, my composite score was 33, second time it was 34). My super score is 35 (Math: 35, Science:35, Reading:33, and English:35)\n\nIn the common app when reporting ACT scores, it asks to report the \u201cHighest composite score\u201d with a test date. \nI\u2019m entering 34 here vs. my super score (35) as it asks for the highest on a particular date (September in my case). Is this correct? \n\nIt also asks for the subsection scores and a date for each score which I\u2019ve also listed. Just confirming that one doesn\u2019t actually enter the super score anywhere and that it is determined by the schools that super score.",
