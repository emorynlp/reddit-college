  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m a rising junior and I\u2019m getting a little nervous about my gpa. I got a B in bio honors freshman yr because I had a tough time adjusting to virtual and I think I will end with a B in ap chem this year (which tbh I\u2019ll be happy if I do).\n\nHow does having a 3.8 UW affect my chances of getting in a selective school or T20s? Ppl in my school believe you need a 3.9 at least to have a chance\u2026 is this true? \n\n(I know it\u2019s not just about grades and I think I have strong ECs and took APs to challenge myself) I feel like many ppl have a closed mindset about gpa and top schools so if anyone was in a similar position as me I would appreciate your experience!",

      "text": "3.8 shouldn't be a huge disadvantage, you'll still be able to compete for t20 schools with good ECs and APs as you said, and as long as your essays are good and you seem like an interesting and promising student to your college, you definitely have a chance to get in. Like everyone, you'll need some safety colleges and t20's will be a reach for you, but it's definitely worth shooting your shoot",

      "text": "It's very hard to compare GPAs across schools.  More relevant is how is your GPA stacks up against your peers in your own school.  There are HS's where dozens of kids have 4.0/4.0UW and A's are handed out like candy with little rigor.  Then there are other places where 3.9 would rank you in top 5 out of hundreds because they avoid grade inflation.",
