Now my 1RM is a plate on each side of a 45lb bar.\n\nHowever, I'm not gaining much visible muscle mass. Yes eating more will likely help me gain muscle.

Then go to the class. Easy. forcing food down when I don't want it three times a day is hard, but manageable. Doing it three times a day for months isn't possible. When you feel sick after a meal, it's pretty hard to do the same thing again in 5 hours, day after day. Just because *you* can \"eat even when you don't have an appetite\", doesn't mean everyone and their mothers can. Just because you find something simple, and the majority of people find the same thing easy, doesn't mean it applies to everyone.\n\nYou are right, I'm not denying it, eating at a calorie surplus will make me gain weight. My issue is you think it's a piece of cake for anyone and everyone. I think after 4+ years of looking around and seeing everyone bigger, heavier, and stronger than me, I would have tried something.\n\nA handful of cashews may go down like nothing, but imma be completely full after that, and I'll prolly skip the meal I was gonna have.

Better education \n2. Traveling and experiencing something else than my home country. If I want to make my college years really fun why not do it in a place that offers so many opportunities and that is so different than what I\u2019m used to? As long as you aren\u2019t a citizen, you don\u2019t have to deal their shit. I can always transfer to a university in my country if things are tough.\n3. The future career I plan for myself requires an advanced English which I can only achieve by living among English speakers and speaking it everyday.\n\nIn general, America is not that bad. Way better than a lot of other countries. No offense but people who say it \u201csucks\u201d are privileged and don\u2019t know what a real terrible country is. Sorry I had to say it.",
