  "text": "I mean I am dedicating all my time to Bio/Calc/APUSH and my CP class grades are faltering (Bs in art and spanish 3). I have all A's in my APs. I just love it when the teacher gives me a week to study all of cellular respiration. Just love the challenge. But hate the small amount of work/test studying from my CP classes.\n\n \n\nI had all A's last year when the workload was easier. Because I focused equivocally on all classes.\n\n ",
