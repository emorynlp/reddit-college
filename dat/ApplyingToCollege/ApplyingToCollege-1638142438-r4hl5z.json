  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m a junior taking the IB Diploma in Europe and I will most likely get roughly 34 points as my predicted IB score. I\u2019m also going to take the SAT, however I don\u2019t have any assumptions about the results. Anyway, I would like to ask for some reccomendations for a Business major either in the US or the UK where I would safely get in with a 34. I glanced at a few schools like University of Illinois at Chicago and Hult International Business School but I\u2019m wondering what is your opinion.\n\nThanks",
