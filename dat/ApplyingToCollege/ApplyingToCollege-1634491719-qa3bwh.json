If you want to get really into the weeds, I would recommend using plans.ucsd.edu and the UCSD AP credit chart to see what credit you have and find out which college has the least and most flexible requirements for you. Every major is the same in each college though so it's definitely overkill for most people, since all that changes is your GE requirements and housing",

I would check out compare.ucsd.edu as well.\n\nKeep in mind it is effectively impossible to change the college you get into. They're really not a major deal though.

For most people the college you get shouldn't make or break things, but it'll be easier if you're in a college that has more overlap with your major. I'm an electrical engineer and I got into ERC, which is basically the worst combo you can get at UCSD, but it's been fine. I had some AP credit coming in which helped a lot so I actually could've graduated a quarter early this winter, but since I'm starting a master's at UCSD next year I'm just doing some grad classes early to finish the master's earlier.",

      "text": "Current UCSD student here.\n\nFirst of all you can major in basically anything in any colleges. It\u2019s not like other schools where you can only major in certain subjects in certain colleges. So the majors each college offers shouldn\u2019t be your concern if it was.\n\nI highly recommend you rank the colleges based on their GE requirements because the extra classes you need to take can disrupt your 4-year plan and may add to your stress. So conventionally you should rank the colleges with the easiest GEs highest while those with more difficult GEs lowest.\n\nApart from GEs you may also consider the surrounding environment of each college. Some have shitty dorms/dining halls. Some may be very isolated from the others.\n\nDisclaimer: the ranking I\u2019m offering is entirely my personal opinion and preference if I were to rank mine again. Others may differ in their choices.\n\nPersonally, I would recommend ranking sixth as your first. Because 1. Their GEs are not hard compared to some other colleges. 2. It\u2019s the newest college built. So it has beautiful and modern dorms. 3. I would say they have the best dining halls on campus. I always love to go there to grab food. One downside is because it\u2019s pretty centrally located, it can get busy during school days.\n\nThen I\u2019d recommend seventh (btw even if it\u2019s 7th, the buildings aren\u2019t the newest. They just renamed an old area of the school). 1. Not difficult GEs. 2. All their \u201cdorms\u201d are apartment style. So you\u2019ll get more private space and a larger and neater space for you to live in. I\u2019m currently living on seventh and I\u2019m loving it so far! It\u2019s quite far from the \u201cmain\u201d campus but not entirely remote. It\u2019s a nice and quiet area. Pretty chill even during weekdays when school is in progress.\n\nTwo colleges I\u2019d recommend you to put them last on your list are ERC and Revelle. They have the arguably hardest/most time-consuming GEs. Between these two, put Revelle below ERC because ERC has better dorms and is located in a pretty chill area (right under seventh actually). Also, Revelle has harder GEs compared to ERC (even though both are pretty hard already).\n\nAgain. This is solely my personal opinion.",

      "text": "UC San Diego has 7 colleges, or neighborhoods, and on the application, you'll be asked to rank colleges 1-7.  Each college has their own unique core values, academic advising office, residential community, dining, traditions, and special events. The core values, or philosophy, of the college influence the General Education (GE) classes you are required to take. I highly encourage you review the philosophies and general education requirements of each college before submitting the application. Still, even after reviewing, It\u2019s not always the easiest to wrap your head around, and sometimes students aren\u2019t sure how to rank colleges. I always tell students, as opposed to asking \u201cwhat\u2019s a good college for a science major, or a philosophy major\u201d to instead think about long term goals when ranking colleges. \n           As an example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re planning to study Biology and then go onto medical school. A long term goal might be to become a doctor and work with Doctors without Borders one day. Eleanor Roosevelt\u2019s philosophy of global citizenship/world leadership might be a great complement to that career goal. Or, maybe you\u2019re a Bio major, and want to become a doctor and work in a lower served area of the US, where there aren\u2019t as many health care professionals. Thurgood Marshall\u2019s social justice emphasis might be a great complement to that career goal. Or, maybe you just really like the philosophy of Sixth College-it really is up to you! Because college choice doesn\u2019t impact your admission to your major or to UC San Diego overall.",
