  "text": "Hi!  So other than the two main teacher recs (1 stem 1 humanities), I also requested a recommendation from my piano teacher.  However, today my boss from my internship offered to write me a letter of rec, and I know that it would be really good (plus he won an emmy...), so the offer is a bit hard to decline.  How would colleges view two additional letters of rec?  Also, if I were to only choose one, which would you suggest I choose?  My piano teacher knows me in a more well rounded way, and my boss can speak for my abilities major wise (and also my dedication to learning).   Thanks!",
