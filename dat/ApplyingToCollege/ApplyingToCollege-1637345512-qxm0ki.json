  "text": "This is something I keep seeing, and it\u2019s confusing and a little infuriating. So many of y\u2019all are like \u201cI must be miserable all throughout high school, and change myself into a person I\u2019m not, to convince my dream college that I\u2019m a great fit for their culture\u201d\u00a0\n\nLook, either you have what it takes to make it at a top school, or you don't. If you hate every aspect of the \"you\" that colleges want, why the hell do you think you'll like it there? Spoiler alert - you won\u2019t. If you don\u2019t like competitiveness, or thrive under academic pressure, it\u2019s not going to magically change in college.\n\nSO many of you have this really weird victim complex, that you insist on mixing in with humble-bragging. Some of you throw in a little, subtle racism into there, which is not a great look. There\u2019s also a LOT of classism/elitism, because you all seem to believe that only poor/lazy/stupid people\u2019t go to T20\u2019s. I\u2019m not sure what you all want, other than to be praised and told that you\u2019re a genius, but it\u2019s really getting insane. One of you is literally willing to \u201csettle\u201d for BERKLEY.\u00a0 Another one of y\u2019all thinks only T20 schools are worth attending because they\u2019re the only schools a degree matters from. Delusional.\u00a0\n\nY\u2019all need to get a fucking grip on yourselves, before you get to your \u201cdream\u201d college and realize you hate it, and that no one there wants to listen to your classist, elitist ass whine about how you hate it there too.\u00a0",

It\u2019s common to high schoolers when they\u2019re applying to college because they are alway putting themselves low and the fear of rejection plays a huge role on their mentality. Surrounding by outstanding peers can be stressful too when people in your HS class got into ives and stuff. That and all the other reasons can contribute to the rant.",

However, I assume many people are like me where they haven't changed much as a person their whole life, have had a stable life and their greatest challenges just makes them sound spoiled, and even if they perform above average in their interests it's still in a saturated subject like cs that doesn't stand out. \n\nIt feels like I have to overdramatize such things in my life and look more quirky, when really I think those things have nothing to do with how much I'll like the competitive academics and being around others that enjoy being challenged with advanced concepts.",

And college is so much more than just challenging academics. All colleges have challenging academics; it\u2019s in the community space that they greatly vary.

      "text": "It\u2019s important to note the term \u201cT20\u201d is subjective as fuck and pretty much only high schoolers in this subreddit seem to care about it. Unpopular opinion, but I think the term shouldn\u2019t even exist. One list may rank a school T10 but another list may rank them T50. It doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a right or wrong, it\u2019s just different criteria and different methodologies of trying to assess and measure the quality of hundreds of billion dollar institutions in different ways. If you tried telling someone in the Bay Area that Berkeley wasn\u2019t a T10, they\u2019d probably just stare at you and laugh. Same thing would happen if you said the same thing about Cornell to someone from NY. \n\nWhat arguably matters more is how good a school\u2019s individual department is and the fit of a school rather than the \u201cuniversal\u201d or \u201cindustry standard\u201d US News and World Report national ranking that employers or literally anyone outside of this sub don\u2019t even know exists or gives a single shit about.",

I remember last year I said I was making a documentary on my college process, and I\u2019m still going to make but it but I\u2019ve been pretty busy with ya know, COLLEGE and a few other personal things. But I know that I really wanted to share the message that not everyone is shooting for T20s, and that\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not. It\u2019s okay if you\u2019re goal is just to go to college. It\u2019s okay if you decided to go to your second or third choice. It\u2019s okay to be rejected.\n\nI was shooting for UT Austin. I didn\u2019t even get to apply because of my schools transcript system. I was bummed yeah but the more I looked at it, the more I realized that wasn\u2019t the school for me. I\u2019m at UNT now, I have an amazing roommate and have found so many opportunities here. It\u2019s not just about where your degree is from, it\u2019s about how you use it, who you network with, what your experience is. Don\u2019t try to fit yourself into a mold you don\u2019t fit in. Work hard but have fun in high school, it\u2019s the youngest you\u2019ll ever be.",
