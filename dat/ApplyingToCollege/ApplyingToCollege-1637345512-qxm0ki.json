  "text": "This is something I keep seeing, and it\u2019s confusing and a little infuriating. So many of y\u2019all are like \u201cI must be miserable all throughout high school, and change myself into a person I\u2019m not, to convince my dream college that I\u2019m a great fit for their culture\u201d\u00a0\n\nLook, either you have what it takes to make it at a top school, or you don't. If you hate every aspect of the \"you\" that colleges want, why the hell do you think you'll like it there? Spoiler alert - you won\u2019t. If you don\u2019t like competitiveness, or thrive under academic pressure, it\u2019s not going to magically change in college.\n\nSO many of you have this really weird victim complex, that you insist on mixing in with humble-bragging. Some of you throw in a little, subtle racism into there, which is not a great look. There\u2019s also a LOT of classism/elitism, because you all seem to believe that only poor/lazy/stupid people\u2019t go to T20\u2019s. I\u2019m not sure what you all want, other than to be praised and told that you\u2019re a genius, but it\u2019s really getting insane. One of you is literally willing to \u201csettle\u201d for BERKLEY.\u00a0 Another one of y\u2019all thinks only T20 schools are worth attending because they\u2019re the only schools a degree matters from. Delusional.\u00a0\n\nY\u2019all need to get a fucking grip on yourselves, before you get to your \u201cdream\u201d college and realize you hate it, and that no one there wants to listen to your classist, elitist ass whine about how you hate it there too.\u00a0",

I don't remember being delusional. I think that's the difference, for me",

      "text": "I think I mostly agree with about if you have to fake your personality completely you won't like it when you're there, especially if \"you don\u2019t like competitiveness, or thrive under academic pressure.\" However, I would argue there are other things a college application looks for that doesn't necessarily reflect with how much you'll be happy at a college.\n\nFor example, college essays seem to want you to exhibit some personal growth, overcoming challenges, and do something that stands out from other applicants. However, I assume many people are like me where they haven't changed much as a person their whole life, have had a stable life and their greatest challenges just makes them sound spoiled, and even if they perform above average in their interests it's still in a saturated subject like cs that doesn't stand out. \n\nIt feels like I have to overdramatize such things in my life and look more quirky, when really I think those things have nothing to do with how much I'll like the competitive academics and being around others that enjoy being challenged with advanced concepts.",

          "text": "I think you\u2019re pointing towards the most major misconception people have about college admissions. You don\u2019t need to have done anything super impressive in your life at all. You can talk about very small things in your essays. And you can put small hobbies that make you happy on your app even if they don\u2019t win awards. \n\nWhile you want to make your essays interesting to read, there doesn\u2019t need to be a giant revelation at the end or anything. And college is so much more than just challenging academics. All colleges have challenging academics; it\u2019s in the community space that they greatly vary. So presenting your personality is important of course. But you also don\u2019t need to force yourself to be quirky.",
