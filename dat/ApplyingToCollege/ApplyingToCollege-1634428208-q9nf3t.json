  "text": "I used to be obsessed with Harvard because of the \\~prestige\\~ but OMG I literally love Brown. You get to take whatever classes you want as long as you fulfill the major requirements??? The city is not too big but not too small??? The campus is beautiful??? The culture is unparalleled??? THEY HAVE A BS/MD PROGRAM???!?!?!!? I will probably get rejected because the program and the school itself is extremely competitive, but I genuinely think I just found my dream school. I won't get too hung up on it because obsessing over a dream school can lead to a toxic mindset, but here's to the hopes of not getting rejected (though it's pretty much a lottery at the end of the day </3)",

They also have no core curriculum, have a beautiful campus, are in a decent size city, and they have a BS/MD program. Also, their acceptance rate is a lot higher than Brown, so it could also be a good choice.",

              "text": "1. They are incredibly competitive, and the students who can manage to get into BS/MD programs would typically have no problem to get into med school traditionally. \n\n2. It limits ECs. I have no data to back this up, but I am confident that BS/MD students would pale in comparison to traditional students when it comes to extracurriculars. This is because traditional students are under constant pressure and strive to do extraordinary things that will make them stand out to med schools. BS/MD\u2019s don\u2019t have this problem because in order to stay in their program, they usually just need to keep above a certain GPA and score above a minimum threshold for the MCAT. This is usually bad because ECs provide you invaluable clinical experience and allow you to figure out what you like. \n\n3. It limits students. This ties in with number 1. Essentially, students who get into a BS/MD program are stuck. They won\u2019t be able to go to another med school. So if you are a extraordinary student who had high chances to get into Harvard medical school but you\u2019re in your state university\u2019s BS/MD program, then you\u2019re out of luck. \n\n4. And naturally, the biggest con of them all\u2026.. You, as a high schooler, are making a decision that you will spend the next decade training for. Even the most passionate high schooler in the world can\u2019t 100% guarantee they will still want to be a doctor 4 years from now. And traditional students can easily back out because they didn\u2019t sign a contract, but BS/MD students\u2026 not so much.\n\nOf course, BS/MD\u2019s have good qualities like less stress. But if you\u2019re confident in yourself, I would recommend you go the traditional route.",

I'm actually interested in a BS/MS (not MD) program but I won't have to apply until I'm in my junior year, and it's at a state school... and it's mostly for monetary reasons. But I'm questioning it because though it's a good state school, it's not a great state school and I'd like to transfer somewhere else if possible (I'm in community college rn at their satellite campus).",

                      "text": "> an md from harvard doesn\u2019t mean much more than an md from your state university. the medical school you attend hardly matters.\n\nDepends on what you want. If it's a 6 figure career and a great job, sure. But there are most certainly selective residencies and roles that look down on certain backgrounds. \n\nHere's my [source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristenmoon/2019/12/05/four-ways-your-choice-of-medical-school-might-limit-your-chances-at-ultra-competitive-residencies/#:~:text=Out%20of%20the%20programs%20surveyed,with%20a%20competitive%20residency%20program.) btw:\n\n\n> Out of the programs surveyed by the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP), 50% said that being a graduate of a highly-regarded U.S. medical school was a citing factor in decided to interview a candidate. \n\nSee:\n\n> When looking at the students that graduated from the School of Medicine at Wake Forest University, ranked 50th by U.S. News and World Report, the gap between the top medical schools and the lower-ranked medical schools grows larger. Out of the 117 students who graduated in 2019, 14 of those students matched with one of the seven most competitive specialties. Seven students matched with orthopedic surgery, but zero with integrated plastic surgery. In total, 12% of the students matched with one of the most competitive programs. \n\n>When looking at the list of students matching into neurosurgery, 27% were from the top 25 schools, showing that the ranking might have an impact on student\u2019s specialty. \n\nNow, being a medical doctor in general is lucrative and will give you a good life so people don't tend to care too much looking in from the outside, but the idea that there's no difference is also wrong. Hell, NYU's med school has historically not been \"as prestigious\" as other T10 med schools and that has been cited as a factor people have cautioned against taking the full tuition guarantee there vs. paying at a different T10 (which at that point I feel is a bit stupid, but still a commonly held opinion.)",
