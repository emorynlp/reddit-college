  "text": "Update: going to the university of Delaware :)) \n\nHey all. I got rejected from my dream school (Boston College) and I feel kind of lost. I applied ED and I know it's crazy selective (35,000 applicants, only 2,000 something got in). It just kinda messed with my confidence. I'm sure I'll go somewhere that will make me happier and whatnot but this is kinda worse than a heartbreak lol\n\nedit: wanted to clear some things up, in the midst of my sorrows I said some misinformation that has become an area of contention in the comments lmao..in my denial letter, it said that there were around 2,000 something available seats that would be filled by ED kids and 35K is the amount overall that apply to BC I believe. BC does not have a 6% acceptance rate haha, it's around 27% normally. I just misconstrued everything because I was just venting and letting out how I felt. apologies once again and hope this helps confused folks!",

It was a funny way to handle the mounting rejections because there were so many.  As they tell me, it was nothing to worry about because you can only take one job, and likewise, you can only go to one college.  Don't stress it, you'll get your perfect college, and you'll look back and wonder why you ever wanted to go somewhere else.  Good luck.",

That was back then though, the acceptance rate now is ~7%. I don\u2019t think they evaluate applicants in that way, like they specifically identify 7 others to rejects for each acceptance, but it\u2019s a good way to visualize how competitive the app pool, especially when you consider that likely ~5 of those 7 are also qualified.\n\nIt\u2019s a good reminder that there\u2019s a face behind the \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201ds and \u201cUnfortunately\u201ds  and even though it won\u2019t make us feel better, they really do wish us the best.\n\nTo be honest, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll feel if (when) I get rejected from MIT. Sometimes I\u2019m thinking like \u201cyeah MIT was a long shot, but I have these matches and safeties with cool programs and I\u2019ll be happy anywhere\u201d but then I start thinking about MIT and everything they have and I really want to go there.\n\nI heard about MIT when I was 7 and I knew I wanted to go there since I was like 11 (not raised by crazy overachieving parents or anything, l didn\u2019t start thinking about apps until Junior year like everyone else mostly), so it\u2019s really gonna suck if I don\u2019t get in. This is something I\u2019ve wanted for nearly half of my life and it\u2019ll be hard to have to let that go but I suppose rejections a part of life.\n\nIt\u2019s just important to not allow anything really to consume you and keep things in perspective, if we\u2019re even in the same stratosphere as people from MIT and BC then we are destined for great things and one denial doesn\u2019t change that.\n\nI know it\u2019s not probably not what you want to hear and probably won\u2019t make you feel better try not to take too much stock in one rejection, I\u2019m sure you have many more schools that want you and BC may have denied you for some random reason out of your control. \n\n\u201cThere are many paths through the forest. This is just one of them\u201d\n\nedit: just realized I didn\u2019t reply to OP but message still stands!",

I [posted this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/jxgs0y/some_more_thoughts_from_someone_who_was_rejected/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) a couple of weeks ago, but I truly hope it helps as you wait and prepare your RD applications.\n\nI know that it really feels personal since it's a rejection of something you spent so much time on, but what I know is that they're missing out on a unique person like yourself who will never come by again.  And I know that whichever school gets you will be so lucky to have you.\n\nGood luck with your other schools!  You got this.\n\nHave a nice day!",

I just want to say that you can feel sad about this, but try not to dwell on it too much. You don't know why BC rejected you, and please don't assume that it was because you weren't good enough. Chances are that you were good enough, and the college admissions process can be kinda wack sometimes, to be honest.\n\nSo after you let yourself be a little upset, pick yourself back up and move on to brighter horizons. Things happen for a reason and hopefully you will end up at a school where you will be happy. The school I currently attend was not my top choice, but I am so grateful to go here and I believe that things worked out for the best.\n\nGood luck!!",
