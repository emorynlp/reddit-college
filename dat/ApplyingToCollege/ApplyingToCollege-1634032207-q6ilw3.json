      "text": "I have never been in favor of someone taking a gap year just to deal with their exams or just to be free enough to apply to colleges... Everybody else does both the things in parallel, so you should be able to too - I would at least give it a shot, even if you're pretty late to the game at this point.",

      "text": "I had to answer this one even though very late. It is not a problem not to take one if you feel that you actually couldn\u2019t bring out the best of you. If you think that your circumstances weren\u2019t great and you have to do more then it\u2019s great! what if that single opportunity is what haunts you later and at the same time don\u2019t take a rash decision. If you think that you have the best representation you shouldn\u2019t take at all!",
