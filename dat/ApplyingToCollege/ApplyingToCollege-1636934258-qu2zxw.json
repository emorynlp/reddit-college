      "text": "Software engineering vs Computer science is mostly personal preference, and depends on the course offerings at the school.\n\nComputer engineering majors often go into software engineering just because of the demand, but unless you want to work on embedded systems it's not as focused on software development the CS degree.\n\nIT and business IT degrees are further away - they certainly involve some scripting and development, but they wouldn't be majors I would choose if you want to be a software engineer.",
