  "text": "I've recently \"fixed\" my sleep schedule so I've been sleeping for 8 hours on average consistently for the past month or two. But here's the thing, I'm losing out on two hours of worktime/ec time/freetime a NIGHT. It might not seem like much, but over time it adds up, especially if you're taking like 6-7 ap classes, doing a sport, and have hobbies you wanna do. For context, I used to sleep at 1 every night, came home at 5-6 and woke up at 7. \n\n*2-4 hours of homework per night. \n\nSo yeah, might just switch back and become a caffeine addict. :p",

Like try to do your homework quickly and efficiently so that you understand the material. Also you could do homework during lunch (I used to finish my math homework in lunch saving me a good hour when I get home)",

I searched it up and no I don't have dysautonomia, sorry for the confusion",

That does vary for people, later in life a lot of adults switch to maybe 6 hours a night, but when your a kid good sleep is very important for health development. Keep doing it even if it feels like it's not working. Losing two hours isn't a huge deal, your overall health is.",
