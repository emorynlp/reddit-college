So i have no extracurriculars and like a 3.4 unweighted but a 1500 sat and all 5s and 4s on AP tests so I'm just wondering what kind of schools are within my range.  Not a chance me i just have no clue what range i should be looking at.",

      "text": "For kinds of schools? Lots of schools in the 40-150 ish range are possibilities if you look at the US news rankings.  Top end of that might include some biggish reaches, once you get to 100 or so you would get options that are going to not only be safe for admissions but would offer you merit scholarships.  Also lots of schools not on that national university list to consider -- you might prefer a LAC, or a regional university might fit what you want better.  The rankings themselves shouldn't matter too much for you, but the factors that go into them certainly could.\n\nI think it makes sense to start not with what schools will accept you, but with what you want in a school.  \n\nDo you know what you want to major in?  Do you have financial constraints that limit your options to schools that are lower cost or meet financial need?  Big school or smaller one? Urban location or college town? Close to home or not? Greek life interesting to you, or something to avoid? Etc. \n\nOnce you know what you want, it's a lot easier to get advice on what schools fit that.",
