  "text": "2-4 decades later, when I win the Nobel Prize, while I hold my diploma in my hand, and a medal around my neck, I will call out the name of the top universities who rejected or would reject me, and say loudly, \"Your rejection didn't hurt me. You rejected me, but I am still here. You didn't need me then, and I don't need you now.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: (I am just ranting, lol. of course I won't give a shit about any of the college when I win one\ud83d\ude36)",
