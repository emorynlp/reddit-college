  "text": "I just got rejected from Wharton ED. Is a near perfect SAT score not good enough? Is a good GPA with nearly 10 AP credits not good enough? Is starting a charity and raising nearly 30 thousand dollars not good enough? Is starting multiple online businesses not good enough? Is being president of several clubs not good enough? Is winning various in and out of school awards not good enough? \n\nWhat do they want? Can someone explain? Why has is become so competitive?",

All colleges are pay to play for international kids unfortunately :(\n\nEdit: this is not to say your application is bad or anything or that you should\u2019ve been rejected I\u2019m not trying to say that. I\u2019m just saying that if you can pay or not is not taken into account if ur domestic. Obv your income affects your grads, ecs, and essays but Penn also accounts for that through holistic admissions. If you got into Penn, it\u2019s not because you could pay. But if you got rejected from Penn, it\u2019s not because you couldn\u2019t pay (again if you\u2019re domestic). And you shouldn\u2019t feel like you got rejected for a different reason because it is basically a lottery and a crap shot. You will go somewhere good!",

The toughest part for me was imagining my future at Penn and how badass I would be taking over the business world as a Wharton grad. I thought Wharton would turn me into this ideal version of myself. But I realized that no matter what college you go to, YOU will stay the same. You won\u2019t become a different person at Wharton as you will at the great school that will soon be in your Instagram bio followed by a \u201826. This is in no way indicative of your future college chances OR your success in life! I got into Ross and am now very happy at WashU. Plenty of kids go into MBB/IB from non-Ivies.

But if the school thinks ur not gonna fit on their campus or in other words, they don't vibe w ur vibe in ur essays and recs, ur not gonna get in. Ofc I'm putting it into simpler words, but that is utterly how each extremely competitive applicants are differentiated. Your stats will be in the top 10%, but its your fit that differentiates you from the rest of the 10% to gain admission.",

Applications that don\u2019t meet the gpa or sat standards are tossed with little further review. Luck plays a big role and you might have gotten unlucky. Starting successful businesses and raising real money is a good thing to have on your application. You might want to elaborate in your essay. It\u2019s possible that your essay was bad. I have no idea, but might want to go in a different direction on future essays since this one didn\u2019t work. I\u2019m not going to tell you that it\u2019s ok to be rejected, because that is dismissive of your pain. But if your application is strong, you will find success with other colleges.",

But she had a really great spike. She got 1570 on the SAT. She started her own non-profit which focuses on giving mental health access to poor children for them to strive in the future. For that, she volunteered over 500 students and also collected 150,000 dollars. (international student) \n\nShe got recognized at the state and national level by many politicians. I think that even if she did all this, she might've been rejected. It's all about luck, it's truly not your fault if you did all you could from the minute you dreamed about going there. \n\nIt's just external pressures that set us back. You know you truly worked hard and maybe you are going to be better off somewhere else right? Maybe they wanted a student who focused on something? Good for you that you are all-rounded! That's your thing, don't get discouraged, you'll find the perfect fit for sure.",

I don't think that's the right framing.  The reality is, they CAN'T admit every applicant like you.",

You gotta remember there are millions of highschool students if not tens of millions, so even if top ten accept a few hundred thousand, those few hundred thousand are all gonna have 50 clubs, super research etc, only a few(by nature of competition), will have national level competition, and those will get in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for being so mean, I am not belittling you(heck I got rejected by all those top 10 privates for this reason probably)...but If it wasn't rhetorical, that is what they want, and that is what is needed, is it insane yes, is it doable, probably not, but if you do it, will they maybe accept you, yeah you got a chance lol...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway have good luck, anywhere you end up is great, the derivative of 2x is 2 no matter where you go lol.",
