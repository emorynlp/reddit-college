  "text": "Okay so here is the situation: \n\nI am very interested in studying business. The problem is there is a fantastic business program (t10) that is near me, but my last name is on the school. Even though it was not my parents who donated it, it is still my family. I am not that \"type of kid\" where I want to use family connections and am afraid that if I apply here and go here that I will not be respected even though my stats and extracurriculars could get me in on my own. I feel like I should honestly go to a different school just because of this factor alone. I know this is a \"good problem to have\" but just thought I would write about it anonymously online because I can't really talk about this with anyone except my family which is awkward. My college counselor wants me to just go here so it makes her life easy and makes my school look good because its a top school.",

For any ED decision, you need to be 100% behind your decision.  Tell your counselor that.\n\nApply to this college RD and anywhere else you are interested in.  And let the chips fall, and if you get into this college with your namesake, evaluate it against all of your other options in April.  \n\nJust because ED2 exists, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to use it.  You are in the enviable position that you will probably get in to this college whether you apply ED2 or RD because of your family history.\n\nIt is weird that your counselor is putting pressure on you.  I can see parents doing that, but your counselor?  Tell her to back the f\u2019 up, honestly.",
