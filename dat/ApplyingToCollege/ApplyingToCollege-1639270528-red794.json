  "text": "Cornell Engineering has a question: \"What is the highest math class that you will have completed by high school graduation?\" I want to make sure I'm correctly reporting that Calc BC is the equivalent of having taken two calculus class. For context, I've completed Calc BC junior year and am taking AP Stats senior year.",

      "text": "Yes. BC is equivalent to 1 year of calculus. \n\nAP Calculus AB vs. BC\nAP Calculus is divided into two classes: AB and BC. The College Board says Calculus AB is the equivalent of a semester of college calculus and BC is the equivalent of a year of college calculus. In truth, AB calculus covers closer to three quarters of a year of college calculus. The main difference between the two is that BC Calculus tests some more theoretical aspects of calculus, and it covers a few additional topics.
