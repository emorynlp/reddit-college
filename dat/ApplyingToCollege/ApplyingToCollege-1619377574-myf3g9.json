I told another kid in passing at an onsite interview, \"I go to school in Boston\" (I went to MIT), since I didn't want to spend too much time talking about my school experience. I hoped we'd move on, but then he asked, \"Oh, Northeastern or BC?\" and then I looked like I was fishing for attention haha. \n\nBut yeah, I totally agree with you--don't want to draw too much attention to it...At worst, \"I go to MIT/Harvard\" gets you not-so-nice stereotyping or even repressed college applications salt. My friend went to a visit weekend where the department printed everyone's school on their name tags, and then she got to experience the full brunt of \"orgo bros who are still, for some reason, salty about not getting into MIT for ugrad.\"",

Maybe once every couple years our valedictorian gets into a T20 (last year's valedictorian went to Harvard, but that was it. Most just go to in-state university). I know that the salutatorian, and third-highest ranking classmate are going to in-state (T100).
