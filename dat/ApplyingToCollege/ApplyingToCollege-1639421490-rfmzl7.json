  "text": "Two-three years ago I posted on youtube and have amassed 50k subscribers and 22,612,900 overall video views. I don't use it anymore and the videos are of edits of cool superhero fight scenes with music in the background.  Would this make an impact of any kind on the admissions officers? Should I even mention it in the extracurriculars portions of my applications?",
