  "text": "Welp i\u2019m a complete fucking dumbass. I already submitted most of my applications through common app and just realized i didn\u2019t waive my FERPA (luckily i did waive my school giving info). It really sucks ass too cause all of my recommenders are my favorite teachers who I\u2019ve known for years and I know they love me and told ne how much fun they had writing my recommendations and now it\u2019s all meaningless. Let\u2019s hope my mediocre ECs make up for it :(",

They checked the wrong box and didn't know it until after a teacher already submitted a LOR, so now we can't change it.\nThey are emailing the counselor tomorrow, as another student told them that if your school links with Naviance, the counselor can  fix it from their side.",
