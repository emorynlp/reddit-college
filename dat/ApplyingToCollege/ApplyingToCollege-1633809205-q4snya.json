  "text": "Hello guys I applied for the Fall 2022 year on Cal State Apply. I'm a first gen student and I'm transferring from a community College so I'd never really done an application like this before. I was entering my college coursework and I submitted it, put all my current grades and left the current and future ones as \"in progress/planned\" I realized a few days later that I was supossed to wait to submit my coursework until I received my final fall 2021 grades. What do I do in this situation as there's no way to update your coursework after submitting??",
