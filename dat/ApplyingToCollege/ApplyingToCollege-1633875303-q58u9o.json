  "title:": "Do I need to explain why I abandoned an EC?",
  "text": "I used to make travel/educational Youtube videos and post it on my channel with around 20k subscribers. It was an activity that started since grade 6 and did it until grade 9. I was quite passionate at it.\nHowever, I stopped making videos when I started to burn out and found out that my grandpa got cancer. After that, I started to pick up a new hobby and never went back to doing it.\nI wanted to put it into my activity list and mention it in my essay, because it was an important part of me. What I wonder is will AO wonder why did I abandon that activity, and should I explain it under additional info?\n\nThanks :)",
