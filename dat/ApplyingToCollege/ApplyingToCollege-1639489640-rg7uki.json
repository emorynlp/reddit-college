  "title:": "Advice on if I should apply ED and miss out on my dream school",
  "text": "My dream school ever since I was in middle school was USC and my second choice as of late has become NYU (I don't know why I decided on two of the most expensive schools in the country but whatever). I'm a relatively below average applicant for USC and slightly above average for NYU so I was thinking about ED2ing to NYU to improve my shot. I feel pretty confident about getting into NYU ED so I was wondering if boosting my chances of getting in there was worth effectively throwing away my chances at USC. I want to go into quant research and NYU is more well respected in that field than USC and location-wise more jobs for that industry are in New York. Most of my reasons for wanting to go to USC are non-academic, mainly I liked that USC had a \"real campus\" and as a massive sports junkie don't know I would be that happy going somewhere like NYU with no D1 teams. In the grand scheme of things my reasoning for wanting to go to USC are kinda dumb, but for some reason I've been really hesitant about pulling the trigger and applying ED2 to NYU.",

      "text": "USC does this to ya with no ed. I\u2019m currently applying ED to NYU hoping for the best, but yeah I love USC as well, but I\u2019d just go with what you think will make you happiest. I have a bunch of friends who go to NYU who say you have to be outgoing or else you\u2019ll never make friends so keep that in mind. My list is essentially 3 schools BU (which I have guaranteed) NYU and USC. Good luck!",

Of course there's a chance I don't get into NYU and a slim chance I still get into USC regardless because I will still be applying but I don't know.",

From what I read federal loans can go up to 27k annually and the career I want to go into pays pretty well so hopefully it isn't extremely burdensome.",

              "text": "You are wrong about those federal loan borrowing limits. The higher amounts are for grad school. And if you want to plan for that you should keep your undergrad loans low. https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/student-loans/much-borrow-college\n\nCollege is one of the biggest financial decisions you\u2019ll ever make, and unlike purchasing a car or house or stocks, you can\u2019t sell it and get back most of your money. It\u2019s easy to feel like you are at the mercy of these schools, but you are the buyer here and those two schools are expensive designer brands most people can\u2019t afford or wouldn\u2019t pay full price for. Both also take a fair number of transfers so if you don\u2019t get in first round you can try again in a year. Sounds like your parents have saved for this so maybe it\u2019s worth it for you. And if you aren\u2019t happy, drop out and transfer. It\u2019s a lot of money to pay to be miserable. We know people who went to both schools on scholarships and were very happy - hopefully you will be too. NYC has so much to do and LA weather and events are great.\n\nAs a note of caution we made both my kids turn down NYU because it was more than double the cost of the UCs they got into. At the time they were upset. Now seeing how little college prestige matters in the job market they are questioning whether it was even worth paying for a UC over a basic CC + cheap state school. I myself thought that going to one of those top-tier colleges would mean a fantastic experience but turns out there are good and bad things about even prestigious schools. It feels like a huge thing right now, but you can be successful coming out of any college.",
