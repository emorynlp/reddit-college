  "text": "Hi!\n\nI am debating whether I should change my English tutoring (it is a community service, working with an NGO in Korea teaching English to defected North Koreans - it was really fun) to Church/\n\nI am more involved in Church (goes to service, volunteer in projects, and I really enjoy my faith) than the Community Service (I did 2 hours every week for 20 weeks, however, not as much compared to church).\n\nDoes it look better on my application to keep the community service (which I have a lot already - homeless shelters, underprivileged cram schools, orphanage clubs) or to add my activities in church (something that is different from the rest of my activities?)\n\nThanks!",

Thanks so much for you guys's comments.\n\nMy reach schools are Emory, American, and Ohio State. \n\nI have around 40 hours for community service, but for church I have a commitment of more than 100 hours (+ community service)... I am still kind of unsure of which one to put. But as the rest of my activities are filled with community service, does putting church down seem to stand out & be more impressive than another community service commitment of 40 hours?",
