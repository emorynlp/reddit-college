      "text": "id write about something you are really passionate about! i noticed a lot of students like to write about experiences they have had and how that impacted them, but i dont think that is the only avenue. its def a great choice but, like you, i couldnt think of any of those experiences. i opted for talking about my different passions and how they impacted me. be genuine, but also try and weave it in with what u want to study or something specefic to the school. \n\nalso i think u know yoursef better than you do! its easy to think that your interests or experiences arent \u201cgood enough\u201d for a college essay but if you can write about it in a meaningful way, it will work perfectly fine! let me know if you need more clarification on what  i mean :)",
