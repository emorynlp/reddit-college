  "text": " I'm an international junior who is kinda falling in love with Amherst, but still has my doubts about applying ED. My intended major is econ, I've got decent stats(1590 on the SAT, 95%+ my whole life) and good enough ECs I guess?([https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/nyro4a/chances\\_for\\_economics\\_international\\_student/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/nyro4a/chances_for_economics_international_student/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) \\-more details)  \nAmherst is one of my top choices because:\n\n1. It's need-blind\n2. Has great graduate placement\n3. I like the idea of a small school where you can form deeper relationships with everyone, and everyone seems to be sharing anecdotes of how close the students are with each other and the professors\n4. No grad students, so no TAs and better research+ internship opportunities\n\nBut I'd like to have a balanced viewpoint before I make the decision to apply ED(Plus there's always the \"what if by some crazy stroke of luck, I get into like, Harvard or something? Will I regret my decision then?\"). Applying ED would probably boost my odds significantly(I've been told they fill a third of their class with ED), but still. What do you think are the absolute worst things about amherst which I need to keep in mind before making a decision?",

      "text": "First, I love Amherst, but you wanted negatives. \n1. Winters are pretty cold. Snow melts, re-freezes and covers the walk ways (I fell a lot). Snow piles up and turns brown and dirty. I was a California kid showing up in Massachusetts, so the weather was a big shock.  \n2. Pretty small and can get clicky. \n3. Not a ton to do in Western Mass, so social stuff is really focused on campus.  So the social scene is off-campus house parties with bad beer. Doubt it has changed much, but ask around. \n4. Not a real sports culture, so you don\u2019t get as much school spirit around games.",

My whole grade has around 55 students, and I live in a small town where you can get to any place in town in around half an hour.\n3. I'm not planning on drinking and going to wild parties, so that shouldn't be a HUGE problem.\n4. I'm a pretty athletic person, but I don't follow sports like football(I ain't calling it soccer. Just...nope.) or american football which I assume are the major college sports in the US? I'm more of a martial arts, basketball, shotput person. So.....shouldn't be a big deal either. But thanks, I'll ask around.",

As a parent of two Mammoths...I can't give you negative things about applying ED, IF you truly think Amherst is the school for you.\n\n1. Yes there is such a thing called Winter. There is also Spring, Summer and Fall...and the campus is beautiful during each season. During Winter a favorite past-time for students (and quite a few people from the town) is to sled down hill. FYI, my favorite season is Fall...I was there just this weekend and the foliage was beautiful.\n2. Amherst the town is definitely not New York (or even Boston). But it isn't in the middle of corn fields either. With UMass nearby (and Smith, Holeyoke and Hampshire) there is a lot happening - concerts, trader joes, even a Tibetan restaurant.\n3. Some kids drink, others don't. Neither of my kids have felt pressured to drink, smoke or whatever. But I do hear that it is available for those who do.\n4. Mention Williams...and you will immediately get school spirit.\n\nAll kidding aside, both my kids absolutely love Amherst. I must warn you that the academics there is pretty intense. However, the culture is very collaborative. The faculty is very good and the alumni are amazing. The president of the school is LGBTQ and the community is pretty supportive.",

                  "text": "Thank you\ud83d\ude0a. I honestly feel pretty drawn to Amherst, and it just sounds perfect to me. But my concern with applying ED is that it's binding. So what if I don't receive sufficient aid?\n1. Based on the photos and videos I've seen, the campus looks amazing. The winter will probably be a bit of a problem for me, but I think I'll get used to it. \n2. I've grown up in a small city, so I think I'd actually like Amherst. It isn't a village, but it also isn't a metropolitan, and that's my type.  I'm not a big fan of skyscrapers, but I'd also rather not live in a corn field. \n3. That's great to know! \n4. I've heard about the rivalry. Something about a president from Williams who defected and started Amherst?\nIt's a top school, so I don't really expect the academics to be chill, but everyone keeps talking about how collaborative the environment is, and how close people are with each other and the professors. And I think that's one of the things that really appeals to me about Amherst.\nI went to the college's website and attended a virtual tour+ Q&A with an admission officer, and it all seemed very LGBTQ friendly. I'm probably going to have my family life wrecked when I come out, so it's good to know that if I'm at Amherst, I'll have some support when I need it. \nOnce again, thank you replying :)",

If you decide you cannot commit because the finaid is too low, I think that is a justifiable reason to withdraw. But don't trust me...someone on the internet...ask the school. They have an AO dedicated to international students.\n\n1. Winter is generally ok. Students have more complaints about the first week back after Summer back. Most dorms do not have air conditioning. If you stay on campus (for example to do research) during Summer, you will probably get to stay in an air conditioned dorm...Greenway is lovely.\n2. Amherst, the town, is quite lovely. If you want something more there are a few 'larger' towns you can visit nearby, including Springfield which is a mid-sized city. You can even go to Boston if you wanted.\n3. Kids drink, some more than others. But there is also a culture of looking out for each other. Girls generally pair up to make sure they make their way back to their dorms, and there are numerous stations where you can call for help...the campus police or the EMT will be there to help pretty quickly.\n4. Amherst the school and Amherst the town is pretty LGBTQ+ friendly. You will not be alone and the community is pretty strong.",
