  "text": "i just joined reddit so idk how this works but I think I'm going to get two b's my first semester of my senior year (which I'm in currently), a B+ in AP Calc and a B in AP Physics 2. I also got a B+ in AP Physics 1 2nd semester last year but still had a 90 yearly average for that class. Otherwise I've never gotten any B's, I have a 1500 SAT and 4.4 GPA, but I'm applying to a lot of super-competitive schools (6%-30% acceptance rate), is this gonna screw my chances? ahh thanks",
