  "title:": "My friend hasn't applied to any colleges yet",
  "text": "I have a friend who literally hasn't done any college research or any of her applications. The calstate app (she's not doing UC) is due on the 30th. I'm a little worried, and I'm not sure if she even wants to go to college because she has said she wants to work (and has also expressed a college interest), but hasn't been very specific. I suggested community college but still idk. She's just clueless about the process and it seems like her siblings and parents haven't helped or mentioned it at all (at least 1/2 of them have gone/are going to college). She doesn't have bad grades (almost, if not all As) but she doesn't take any challenging classes either. Just what is offered. She also barely has any extracurriculars. I think she'll be able to get into some colleges (if she wants to), but I don't know how best to support her.\n\nShould I even try to do anything? I don't know if she actually wants to apply or is just embarassed that she's not going to. I helped her start the app (like create a login) a few weeks ago but that's literally all she's done! Also I'm busy as well so I can't help her with everything. I'm going to send her our school's resources and advice on how to research but idk what else? I'm wondering what you guys think I should do. Thanks!",

      "text": "This is a common phase to get into around this time. This whole thing is nerve-wracking and people get freaked out and freeze up. Never mind the fact that many 18 year olds are absolutely not ready to move away from home. Offer her some help but then leave her alone. I had some friends like this and their reluctance was because they didn\u2019t feel ready. Most of them wound up taking a gap year or went to community college. She\u2019s also had a large portion of her high school experience impacted by COVID so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she just doesn\u2019t feel prepared.\n\nI do get the sense that she might be embarrassed about this, and she might just want to be left alone and go to community or take some time off. Offer to help, but leave her alone if she refuses. You sound like a good friend but this is a deeply personal process and I doubt she wants to be nagged. For all you know, she isn\u2019t planning to apply to CSU at all but just wants to hide the fact that she isn\u2019t applying.",
