  "text": "I've been so emotionally attached to MIT that I lose motivation for applying to any other school. When looking at all the \"why us\" essays, nothing comes up. I'm not sure why I love MIT so much. I haven't even visited MA. Even schools like Princeton and Stanford which I liked a lot have become boring to me. I either find them arrogant or missing some element that attracts me. This is probably the most unhealthy relation I've ever have in my life. Somebody please help me....",

      "text": "Applying to college is not choosing a college. At the moment, you don\u2019t have the choice to attend any colleges (unless you\u2019ve been admitted somewhere).\n\nRather than stressing about \u201cwanting\u201d to go somewhere else, focus on setting up the best possible choices for yourself down the road. You need to put in work to give yourself options. After going through a long and through application process and received admissions, you may have to choose between MIT and somewhere else. \n\nAt that point you can feel stressed about the emotional weight of the decision. Right now though, you have no choices to make or stress about.",

Each kick-ass app you submit is like getting one more raffle ticket. This process is not much different than applying for professional jobs, so consider it a life skill to get good at for its own sake.",
