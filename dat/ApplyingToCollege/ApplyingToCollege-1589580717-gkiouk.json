When the company earns money, they still share the company\u2019s profits with the owners. These owners include the investors. Owners don\u2019t necessarily need to do much other than provide the money.  \n  \nCEOs and other Executives are employees who have a job and duty for the company. The money that goes to those employees are expenses for the company. Those employees can have incentive bonuses. If the company earns more than it spends, that extra money is profit that can be used in the future to grow the company and to give back to owners. Those owners generally give their money with hopes that they will get something from it (otherwise why would they just throw out their extra money?).   \n  \nImagine that you start a nonprofit for bees because you really want to help bees. Your long term goal and vision is to help bees in some way. You start to build your not-for-profit and it gets bigger and bigger to the point that it gets bigger than you know how to handle. What do you do? You can hire executives to take lead for your nonprofit who can manage the company day to day while you and other board members can manage the long term visions and make sure that the people you guys pay are doing a good job.  \n  \nIn an ideal world this works great, but it doesn\u2019t always turn out that way.",
