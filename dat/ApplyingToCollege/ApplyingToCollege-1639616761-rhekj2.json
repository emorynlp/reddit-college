  "text": "Title. The shortest paper I have that would fit the requirements is seven pages (lol) and the others either don\u2019t have teacher comments/grades or were written under a time limit of 40 minutes and aren\u2019t representative of my best work. \n\nMy Model UN position paper kind of slayed last year though and my club advisor gave some nice comments on it- it\u2019s only about 2 pages too. It is technically an academic/social studies based work so couldn\u2019t I just submit it?",
