      "text": "Get a prep book if you can afford it (the black book is great), take practice tests and look over the answers you got wrong, and finally (and I\u2019d argue most importantly) sign up for an ACT test if you haven\u2019t taken both\u2014scores can differ a ton between the 2 and you won\u2019t really know which one you can do better on until you take both. That being said, 12 days is a decent amount of time to prepare if you use it wisely. Good luck!!:)",
