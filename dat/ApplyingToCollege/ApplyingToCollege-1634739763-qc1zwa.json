  "text": "Hey everyone! I\u2019m an international student from Argentina and my original plan was to apply for US universities for Fall 2022. Recently I decided that I\u2019m going to take a gap year, and apply for Spring/Fall 2023. (haven\u2019t decided yet)\nI don\u2019t know much about this topic, so I wanted to come on here and ask: does taking a gap year hurt my chances of getting in/ getting scholarships/ grants? \n\nAlso, what do you guys recommend doing, or what activities can I do, during the gap year to improve my application? \n\nThanks you for taking the time to read my post! \ud83d\udc98\n\nPd: I want to major in Graphic Design and minor in CS (if that\u2019s any help)",
