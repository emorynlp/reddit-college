      "text": "I attend Cornell and so much depends on your major, time management skills, how well your high school prepared you to study etc. If you come from a high school that required minimal studying to make an A and you are applying for engineering, computer science or any of the sciences for that matter\u2026 you may get your ass kicked by classes for the first time in your life. If you have good time management, learned how to study properly in high school and understand the importance of a balanced life then you will be fine.",

      "text": "I can't speak to top-top schools, but at my T40 alma mater I did not find the workload to be overly stressful.  Based on conversations with a high school buddy who attended Harvard, the most stressful thing about his time there seems to have been his senior thesis.  I'll ask him about it next time we get together.",

      "text": "Different schools have different cultures but that shouldn't be understood as some schools having harder/easier workloads. Degree programs are very standardized in the US, especially in STEM fields, so there's little difference in rigor between schools than you might imagine. Institutional culture can make things easier or harder based on whether you're comfortable with it and what resources it allows you to access.",

They want you to succeed (so that their graduation rate statistic is super high lol)\n\naw man who downvoted this? I literally go there. I know what I'm talking about.",
