  "text": "Hi. In my freshman year of Highschool I completed independent research on a humanities subject, presented it to my school board, had it approved, and was able to receive a higher credit in the course (I was the only kid of 3 to do so in a school of 800). Does this count as external research?? Should I add it to college apps? It was in my freshman year but it was substantial and quite an interesting subject. Perhaps it could go in the additional info section.",
