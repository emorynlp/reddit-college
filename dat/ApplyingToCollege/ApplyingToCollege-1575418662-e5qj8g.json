  "title:": "Hello Beautiful Seniors, if You Applied Early this fall, it's Time for Some Emotional Planning. Spoiler: You're gonna be OK.",
  "text": "Hold on to your hearts. This waiting can be godawful, super stressful, I know. But the cool thing is that if your ED/EA school doesn\u2019t work out, you\u2019re still gonna have lots of great options. I promise. (spoiler alert: even if you don\u2019t have a surefire safety that you love and every college rejects you, you\u2019ll still have lots of options. Crazy, right?)\n\nI\u2019m a big believer in doing everything you can to be who you want, get what you want, or position yourself in the best place for it. I\u2019m all for putting everything into it while being reasonably balanced. I want you to try your hardest, knowing that you couldn\u2019t have done any more, so you have no regrets, but then you just gotta let the universe take control. I\u2019m old so I\u2019ve seen it time and again, life works out the way it\u2019s supposed to more often than not.\n\nIt\u2019s real important that you do some EP right now. Emotional Planning. Your mental and emotional health are far more important than where you go to college. So, hope for the best, of course. You\u2019ve worked your asses off to get to a position to even be able to apply to the schools you applied to. You wrote killer essays and presented yourself as your best you on your very best day. It\u2019s only natural to be hopeful and you should be, but come on, you gotta be real too. The realities of admissions are that there are just too many of all these beautiful yous to be funneled into that tiny little teacup full of colleges you\u2019re applying to, and some of you (many of you -- I\u2019ll be honest) won\u2019t get in. So hope for the best, but please prepare yourself for the \u201cworst.\u201d I put \u201cworst\u201d in quotation marks because I know that often what seems like the \u201cworst thing that could possibly happen\u201d can turn out to be something really quite wondrous in the end. One way to prepare might be to check out this [blog](http://pwp.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2018/11/28/preparation-day/) from Georgia Tech with a \u201cNational Preparation Day\u201d pledge and all.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that we have to live our lives in the moment, and some of these moments suck and some of them blow us away with their amazingness, and some are just ho-hum. So buckle up, and prepare for some sucky moments to head your way in the next few days if you applied ED, but don\u2019t forget to take a look around you right now, this minute, and see your friends, the beautiful blue sky (it is here today in Houston), the snow on the ground, your pets, your teachers, your warm bed, and whatever it is in your moment right now that you can appreciate.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget we\u2019re here on A2C to cheer for you if it does work out for the best for you, and to console you when it doesn\u2019t.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the real deal, the honest to goodness truth: you are an incredible person (Hard to believe I know that without knowing you isn\u2019t it? But it\u2019s true), and you\u2019re gonna kickass wherever you go. You don\u2019t need any certain school to do that. You don\u2019t need a school to light your fire to help you on your way to be the person you want to be in the world. You don\u2019t need any one name-brand school to spark the match that lights your way. That fire? It is YOU.",

      "text": "Asian Senior Male btw\n\nAt this point, I just feel like I'll be at peace wherever I go to college, as long as I do get accepted. LOL\n\nBut like, these past 2 years have been absolute hell for me. My relationship that I have with my parents has become insanely unhealthy and I don\u2019t really have the motivation to bring us back together at all. It\u2019s always about college, and how other people they know are better in every way than me. I\u2019m barely allowed to do anything out of school apart from ECs like volunteering and when I do, I\u2019m literally begging the fuck out of them to let me do something I want to do for once. Same goes with my own personal belongings. First of all my phone. The amount of times something that went wrong is blamed towards me wasting time on my phone is crazy. Next, my computer. They\u2019ve threatened to take it away from me because it was distracting me from doing other things, even after I had done all the homework I needed to do and did a substantial amount of studying. \n\nFunny thing about this is that I have decent stats in terms of GPA and SAT, and have pretty good ECs, and I'm not even applying to any t20s(except maybe UCLA, if it's considered one). My parents make me sound and feel like I did nothing during high school, and that my scores are mediocre. (really mom, my 1480 is too low?)\n\nNext, my camera. So, I\u2019ve been working as a lifeguard during the summer for the past 2 years. I have enough money to buy the camera that I have wanted since freshman year, more so because I waited to buy it on Black Friday, where it was on sale from 1200$ to 700$. I\u2019d been telling my parents this for the longest time, but they never listened and were always like, \u201cThis camera is too good for you and is only used by professionals. You can always buy it when you get older.\u201d Here\u2019s my perspective. I\u2019ve been wanting this exact camera for a very long time. One of my friends has this camera, so I\u2019ve been able to use and try out how the camera is, which made me all the more want to buy it. And I\u2019m willing to buy this camera and never buy a new one after, since that\u2019ll be a waste of money in itself. I\u2019ll buy the better one, and then I\u2019ll upgrade it using accessories like diff lens and what not. But no, they insist that I buy the one that\u2019s 400$ that was 600$ before. Now I\u2019m stuck with that one until I can \u201cbuy it when I get older.\u201d I don\u2019t see their logic in this. \n\nGoing away from my talk about my belongings, I think I've cried the most during these past 2 years of high school. I never even thought depression or suicide would ever be something that I would be exposed to, but during these past years, I've gone into a spiral of loneliness and sadness and the only times I've been genuinely happy are when I'm talking to my friends. Like there are times when I feel that I ending it all would just be better, since no-one in my immediate family even cares to think about my mental health. However, I am also too much of a wimp to actually commit suicide, so I'm safe on that one. \n\nTo be perfectly honest, I want nothing more than to go to college and finally experience freedom to do what I want. The thing that worries me is that I'm kind of an introvert, so it's very hard for me to become friends with someone (it'll take me a pretty long time). Once I go to college, I'll be leaving many of my friends, and I'm scared to go into a new environment where I feel that I won't be able to make new friends that easily. \n\nOverall, I really do just want to go to college, and if it's a more prestigious one, all the better. I'm currently trying to make myself become more extroverted and more sociable and now that college apps are done, I'm kind of just riding with it. (until my parents start yelling about my grades again)\n\nBest of luck to the rest of you guys, and hopefully I'll be able to become a greater and improved person throughout the college experience. \n\nAlso, thank you so much u/admissionsmom. You're a godsend. <3",

          "text": "First of all, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. It\u2019s hard to understand this, but most of the time, your parents are coming from a position of love \u2014 and fear. They are terrified of putting you out into the wild, unprepared and defenseless. They are fearful of and for your future. They are also afraid of losing control over you. Sadly, some parents don\u2019t know exactly how to show their love, and instead, allow themselves to become wrapped up in their fears.\nConsequently, that means you have the opportunity to help them turn it around by understanding that their nagging and prodding and hurtful words are fear-driven. Now, understanding their fear does not mean giving into it. It\u2019s more about internalizing and accepting who you are and who they are instead of\nresisting or accepting their version. If you have the inner strength to understand yourself (and that takes time and is a struggle for anyone, much less a teenager), then when the family battles come up, you can hold onto yourself a little tighter. That doesn\u2019t mean you fight more or even disobey them. That means that you live your life in a way that is respectful to both your parents and yourself. Don\u2019t lose sight of who you are.\nThe fact is that many of you are just going have to find ways to communicate your needs with your parents and recognize their fears. In the end, all you can do is control your own behavior. One day I hope to have a revolution of super chill polar bear parents, but until then, you will simply need to work things out on their terms while keeping a tight hold of who you are.\nHere are some ways to go about doing that:\n\n1. Try talking to your parents and explaining to them the impact their words are having on you. Try writing out what you want them to hear from you. If you\u2019re feeling really down, tell your parents you need a counselor or therapist. Or, if things are bad, find a trusted adult to talk to, fast.\n\n2. I think it\u2019s imperative for your parents to know and under- stand that their point of view is being heard and considered. When they\u2019re talking, repeat their words back to them \u2014 this is a technique called Active Listening. Let them know you\u2019re listening. Be patient with them. This, your burgeoning independence, is scary for us parents, too. Make sure they know that you are still going to be their child, but that you are coming into your own.\n\n3. Also, compliment their parenting. Let them know that they\u2019ve done such a fantastic job of parenting you and teaching you that you are ready for the next step, and you are so grateful that they\u2019ve provided such a fantastic foun- dation for you. I mean, don\u2019t force yourself to lie \u2014 I know some parents are...well...the worst. But most parents at least did something good for you, and many did lots of good things.\n\n4. I also suggest \u2014 for all rising seniors and even juniors, too \u2014 that you make a No-College Talk Zone or time period in your house. In my house, it was our kitchen table. That way my kids knew that they weren\u2019t going to be interrogated by their somewhat college-admissions-obsessed mom (but in a totally good way) while having dinner or eating a snack. It helped keep some balance in our lives.\n\nLook, I know it\u2019s intimidating to sit your parents down like this, but it\u2019s worth a shot. You may be surprised at how much you can assuage their fears and anxieties by showing them the smart and competent person you are.",

              "text": "This is a super good post. As a Dad (of first generation Asian kind), I highly approve & appreciate this. For the longest period of time, my kid refused to talk about college to either us. It was driving me insane. I was worried too - fearing that he is probably burned out. Apart from all this - the sheer unadulterated hostility from the kid was also making us really worried about his mental health.  To settle this I had to step back (more than a few steps). First,  to manage my own anxiety I checked the background of leaders/champions of today and found that not everyone was from a top 10 school, and not everyone from the top-notch school was 'proportionally highly successful' by generic standards.  So a top-notch school gives the person a great start but that is just it. It is just a start. I hope that we have instilled in him the value of things like - hard work, tenacity, ambition, and humility and these will help him anywhere. I also started calling us (family) a team :) and named the team after my kid (I know it is cheesy). I think it is helping.  I also keep the kid involved when we talk about $$ stuff for education and other related costs. This a pretty brutal phase in the lives of kids and it is pretty similar or much worse in other countries. My advice to  @plsacceptmeibeg is to not give up on his/her parents - I think they are scared. If you can namedrop some of the CEOs (former/current) who are from smaller universities - just to illustrate that this life is a marathon and college is not even the first water station :). Sorry for this rambling post.",

          "text": "You don\u2019t have to be a good story teller to write a good essay. All you have to do is get in touch with who you are. \n\nHere\u2019s the deal about the personal essay. It has to be just that \u2014 super, incredibly, deeply personal. The essay needs to be about inner you \u2014 the you they can\u2019t get to know anywhere else in your application. So, you have to peel off your onion layers, find your inner Shrek, dig in super deep, and get to know yourself like you\u2019ve never done before. It\u2019s not easy. Ask yourself some really personal questions like: \n\nWhat do I believe? \n\nWhat do I think?\n\nWhat do I value?\n\nWhat keeps me up at night?\n\nWhat do I get excited about?\n\nWhat comforts me?\n\nWhat worries me?\n\nWhat\u2019s important to me?\n\nWho are my super heroes?\n\nWhat\u2019s my super power?\n\nWhat\u2019s my special sauce?\n\nWhat reminds me of home?\n\nJust play with these.  And learn a lot. Become the expert on you because you are really the only person who can be the expert on you. Then, you\u2019ll be ready to teach the lesson about who you are and what you believe and value to the application readers.  The vehicle you use to get your message across really isn\u2019t as important as what you\u2019re saying about yourself. This doesn\u2019t have to be (and, in my opinion) shouldn\u2019t be a complete narrative. I think the essays need to be more reflection and analysis than story. Those are the essays that stick with me after reading a few thousand of them.  \n\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t use a story. Use one if that\u2019s what feels right for you. Just remember the story is only the vehicle for getting the message of who you are across the page. \n\nAlso, this is fun: Practice answering the questions above and anything else you want with www.themostdangerouswritingapp.com. \n\nCheck out these web pages, www.collegeessayguy.com and www.thisibelieve.org for lots more info on the personal essay, and be sure to read what u/ScholarGrade has to say. \n\nHere\u2019s a link to the essay chapter of my new book, Hey AdmissionsMom: Real Talk from Reddit: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rGyOGOc_4GGeuNMGoedS2tKjHepmofe3/view?usp=drivesdk In it, you'll find lots of advice from me and others from Reddit from 2016-2018. I have a few more resources I'll be happy to share with you if you email me at dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com. \n\nGood luck and have fun with it!",

A sure fire safety school is one where:\n\nYou have already been accepted \n\nOR\n\nYou have guaranteed or direct or auto admit\n\nAND\n\nYou like it and can see yourself there \n\nAND\n\nIt works financially for your family \n\n\nAside from surefire safety and applying to schools that are still accepting applications, if everything doesn\u2019t go your way, you can:\n\nTake a gap year \n\nGo to community college \n\nGood luck! Go find that sure fire safety now if you don\u2019t already have one!",
