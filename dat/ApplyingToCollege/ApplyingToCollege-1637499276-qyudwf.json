  "title:": "Not enough APs cuz my school sucks",
  "text": "I go to a small competitive catholic hs. I\u2019m a senior rn. Freshman year they do not have any honors or APs to take. Sophomore year we have AP history. I applied and did not get in. Junior year we have AP Studio Art and AP Lang. At my school, you have to APPLY in order to get into APs which I have come to find out through friends that go to other schools do not need to do. They look at you PSAT(which I did awful on so that did not help) and your average (87) for me. At my school you need to have over a 93 to get into APs. Junior Year you have AP Lang,AP World,AP Art History. As you can probably tell. I DID NOT GET INTO A SINGLE ONE CUZ OF MY AVERAGE. Senior year is the worse. We had AP CompSci,AP Stats,AP CALC,AP PSYC,AP GOV.  I applied to ALL, was really hoping to at least get into 3. I only got into AP Comp Sci A, and now I only have 1 AP due to the fact my school won\u2019t accept students with under a 93 average to get into APs. How fucked am I if colleges see that I only have 1 AP even though i did try to take them all?\n\nI also find it annoying cuz when you google \u201chow to raise gpa\u201d people are like \u201ctake APs\u201d  but like thanks to my shitty school, I literally cant cuz my average is too low and they think I cant handle an AP. I also feel like colleges will see 1 AP and think I was just lazy even tho I really tried to take more but my school literally did not let me. I even tried to appeal to teachers saying why I should be in certain classes cuz some other students told me it worked for them. ugh\n\nI have gotten into 6 schools already BUT they aren\u2019t the most competitive schools on my list. I am scared some more reach schools for me i applied to (VT,JMU,Ohio State,UDel) will see it as a negative :(",

I\u2019m also assuming she knew that you applied to all of them, so she can mention it in her counselor recommendation/school report. Good luck, trust the process, and focus on what you really need to\u2728",
