I went to community college straight out of high school, taking 13 credits and working full time. Ended up failing one class, didn't go back for 5 years, then after taking two classes and getting an A+(over 100%) and a C, the college still pulled my financial aid out from under me because of my cumulative GPA.",

              "text": "I'd look into becoming A&P certified. My brother went to trade school for his airplane and powerplant certification and absolutely loves his career. He gets to work on planes all day! Pretty relax work environment for the two places he has worked. Great pay and there is always overtime available. He actually does four ten hour shifts so he can have 3 days off, but he frequently uses that extra day for overtime. He has healthcare benefits and is making around 34 bucks an hour with his 3 years of experience now. Starting out is over 20 dollars an hour most places and there are so many airports hiring people! School took him about 2 years to do because he was young and not super focused at the beginning. I'm very proud of him!\n\nI joined the army right out of high school and I dont regret it. It's a great way to get a free education. There are benefits to use while active duty or in the reserves. Healthcare and housing for the family. It's always worth talking to a recruiter about. I'm out now. I have my Bachelor's degree. I'm debt free and I work for the government. I love my job. I'm not married and I do not have kids.\n\nThe kicker to all of this, my brother makes more money than me. \ud83d\ude01 I wish you the best of luck!",
