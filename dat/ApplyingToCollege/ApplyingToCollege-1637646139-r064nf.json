  "title:": "Harvard Interview - questions they asked!",
  "text": "Hey guys! I had my interview a few days ago, and here are the main questions they asked. Hopefully they help you guys out too :))\n\nDisclaimer: this was inspired by u//stressed\\_spaghetti's post from last year\n\n1. tell me about yourself & why you're interested in Harvard\n2. What are your educational strengths and weaknesses?\n3. what did you do to pursue your academic interests? \n4. how did COVID affect your education/ learning?\n5. what are some of your favorite extracurricular interests?\n6. elaborate on one of your extracurricular activities\n\nintl-specific questions\n\n1. why are you interested in studying in the US?\n2. how do you think you'll adapt to US culture?\n\nThey told me that the interview is supposed to last 45 minutes, and turned it back on me to ask questions at 30 minutes. The interview was cut short because they had to go, but they were really nice and answered all my questions. Good luck to the rest of y'all out there!",
