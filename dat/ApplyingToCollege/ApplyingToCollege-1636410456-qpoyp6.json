  "title:": "Told someone I wanted to do graphic design, and they started laughing",
  "text": "I\u2019ve done art for over 13 years. I love it. When I was younger, everyone around me always asked me what I wanted to be. In our youth, society promotes us to dream and I was told I can be anything I wanted to be when I grow up. Now, as I approach all the college applications, I tell people I want to go into art or graphic design and they look at me with gawking faces and snide remarks. I remember once a few years ago, I told a family friend I wanted to major in graphic design and they wouldn\u2019t stop laughing at me. They told me I would never make any money or ever be successful. I reevaluated my career goals after that, and have done so even more during college apps. I\u2019ve already given up on my dream to be an artist. I\u2019ve settled on a different, more stable career path. I know it may be naive, but I wish people wouldn\u2019t look down on others who continue to dream. The same people who tell you to dream big, remind you how you\u2019ll never amount to anything when you tell them those same dreams as a teenager. Insight is helpful, but was it really anyone\u2019s place to tell me that?",

They\u2019re super passionate about their work and I\u2019m pretty sure they are fairly well-compensated. There are roles across many industries and the ones I highlighted are from big companies. You make of it what opportunities you are given. Ignore the doubters. They\u2019re not educated on what it is and the actual work.",
