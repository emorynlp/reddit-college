      "text": "If it a common college course that would likely transfer (see definition below) like Calculus 1 or Intro to Biology, then yes you can mark it as CL. If you are unsure try to find a similar UC course.  If in doubt after that, maybe don\u2019t mark it CL. \n\n\n\u201cFor students from other institutions\n\nAlthough UC does not have preapproved formal agreements on transferable coursework outside of the California community college system, general units or credits from a regionally accredited college or university are transferable if a course is comparable to one offered at a UC campus. If a course in not equivalent to a particular UC course, it must be appropriate for a UC degree in terms of its purpose, scope and depth.\n\nHowever, some courses are not transferable to UC. The following types of courses, for example, will not garner UC transfer credit:\n\nRemedial English (composition courses below the first-term college level)\n\nMathematics below college algebra (any course for which intermediate algebra is not a prerequisite)\n\nInstructional/technical how-to courses, such as how to use computer software (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint)\n\nTo get an idea of likely transferable courses from four-year institutions and out-of-state two-year colleges, refer to the General Catalog for any UC campus or to a transfer course agreement (TCA) that UC has with any California community college.\n\nFor TCAs, visit ASSIST.org and follow these steps:\n\nSelect any college name without UC or CSU in the title.\nClick on the UC Transferable Courses link then look for similar course names as those the student has completed elsewhere.\u201d",
