If you get admitted ED, the college will give you a massive aid package because they know you can break your ED agreement if they don't give you enough aid.  So the best way to get aid is to just apply ED.\n\n3.  No one will know or care if you lie in your application, so go all in.\n\n4.  Colleges don't read essays anyway, so just write whatever you want.\n\n5.  Every employer references the ranking lists and just hires whichever candidate went to the highest ranked undergrad school.  Even for mid-career jobs and executive roles.  Professional experience and skills don't matter, only who you paid tuition to when you were 19.\n\n6.  Colleges don't really care about letters of recommendation.  Since they're just a formality, we copy and paste our template for everyone.  It's more fair anyway.\n\n7.  There's no such thing as arrogance or braggadocio in college applications because the whole point is to put your best foot forward.  \n\n8.  Just enroll at the highest ranked college that admitted you.  Everything else will work out.  \n\n9.  If you really love your SO, you should go to the same college as them.\n\n10.  It will be so easy to move and claim in-state status.\n\n11.  If I get married I'll be an independent and colleges will have to give me a huge aid award.\n\n12.
