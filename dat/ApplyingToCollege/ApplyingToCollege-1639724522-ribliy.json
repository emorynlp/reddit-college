  "text": "I'm an Indian student, and most undergraduate college admissions are based only on marks, not ECs, essays or other criteria. There are no sports scholarships.\n\n  \nThere is a pretty famous college of engineering here called IIT, the acceptance rate in iit bombay is 0.118% (including the not so desired branches). The acceptance rate for the medical college AIIMS delhi is 0.0094%.   \n\n\nOf course, not everyone who gives the exam tries very hard, but since acceptance is based only on the marks you get on a 3 hour long test, competition is tough.   \n\n\nStudents from countries other than USA, how is the college admissions process there?",

Scoring above a 70 for all subjects, and being a member of a club, almost guarantees you can enter any Singaporean college and course selection you desire \n\nOf course, easier said than done; the low grade required to score an A (70+) corresponds to the difficulty of scoring it",
