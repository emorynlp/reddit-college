  "text": "If this was the difficult talk Princeton wanted, I hate to say it happened a bit late \ud83d\ude15\n\nBut seriously, do people besides my parents think like this?\n\nI told my dad I wanted to major in comp sci and work on tech startups and machine learning in college/masters program/ph.d\n\nInstantly shot me down\u2026\u201dI understand you want to do research, but 30-40 years from now they\u2019ll have better researchers to propel the future and your contributions are practically useless, is that what you wanna do with your entire life? Look at Robots? We don\u2019t want you to waste your potential, your smart. Listen as a black man [I personally hate using them using this phrase] it\u2019s virtually impossible for you to be successful or wealthy if you don\u2019t do medicine or make the nba. If you wanna code, you can code while your a doctor. Idk make new tech for clinics or even start up your own clinic. Look at your mate [xyz person I don\u2019t care about] she\u2019s doing medicine and she\u2019s just fine. Look at her brother he\u2019s also doing medicine too. Medicine is a very prestigious job (people would look at you [even if you work at walmart] and say oooh he does medicine, but if you do cs nobody will care) We don\u2019t have money to pay for college and wouldn\u2019t want to waste it on a skill that you can learn on YouTube. Even as right now, we\u2019re glad Questbridge exists or we don\u2019t even know how we\u2019d pay off these application fees.\n\nI feel like for years, I\u2019ve never got to have my say, piggy backing off of what u/yggswunfeEkyYYS said I literally feel like this trophy child that never gets praise.\n\nAll of my Ecs I\u2019ve done myself. Maintaining a 3.9 UW. Doing research upon research , making clubs doing internships, running a podcast but never a drop of praise of some sort. Everyone had money for elite tutors or cheated their way through the top 10% but I could never afford it. I had to get pdfs of all these sat books and cram for 10 months. I had to beg them to pay for the SAT/take me to the library. I can\u2019t even take an AP Test because it\u2019s \u201ctoo expensive\u201d I\u2019ve never seen my parents ever contribute to my Ecs whether it\u2019s driving me xyz or doing anything. They just do the bare minimum and scream at me to apply to HYS. It literally makes me mad. I busted my ass to submit that research paper for 5 months anyways and the first thing they say is \u201cWhat on earth do you do in this house, you just stay on your laptop and play computer games\u201d I haven\u2019t touched a gaming pc in years. I feel like the only time I\u2019d feel loved is if I get into HYS (not even Princeton or mit). And then retract it, the moment I tell them I don\u2019t wanna be this person they want me to be. \n\nThese guys are quintessential examples of prestige whores, their identity is warped with the idea that people care if you do this prestige job or go to Harvard. Maybe the latter matters if you wanna make connections but beside that it doesn\u2019t matter\n\nYou know, Sometimes I really wish I could have people that appreciate me. Maybe switch families for a week\n\nRANT/EMOTIONAL SUPPORT",

With 5 years experience, you would be lucky to be considered a staff engineer, most are still in junior positions at that point. \n\nI have friends who are software engineers for multiple of such companies (Netflix, Riot, Google, Epic, Epic Healthcare, Disney); I can assure you that this is the truth a lot better than a random site. \n\nI won\u2019t argue that it is a lot more likely than being a highly paid doctor, but at the same time, it takes a long time and a *lot* of effort to get up to that pay grade.

One thing to think about is this - the more black people there are in medicine, the better the black community is cared for. There is a lot of documentation about the medical mistreatment of black people based on outdated myths based on racism. Just look at [Serena Williams childbirth story](https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/11/16879984/serena-williams-childbirth-scare-black-women). You could help to change that. \n\nBut if you don't love medicine, becoming a doctor is probably a bad idea.",

      "text": "If they're not paying, their opinions are not your problem. They can't hold tuition over your head, so at the end of the day, what they want has no effect on your options.\n\nAlso, conditional love is not normal or healthy. I get the vibe you already know that, but I know a lot of second gen immigrants get trapped in this idea that they have to accept abusive parenting or they're abandoning their roots somehow. Just because a toxic environment is common among a certain group doesn't make it okay, and it doesn't exempt you from the negative impact of growing up in that environment.\n\nEven though I'm sure you're looking forward to it, leaving a toxic living situation can be a surprisingly difficult period. A lot of repressed anger and sadness can come up and overwhelm you. It's also pretty common that people from families like this aren't taught a full range of coping skills, because it's easier for your parents to manipulate you if you don't have them. \n\nLook into therapy options near your target schools. Many schools offer cheap or free therapy options, and there are sliding scale therapy clinics in most metros these days, even fairly small ones. It might seem silly, and you may get through college completely fine without counseling. But familiarising yourself with support services now can really help if you run into trouble down the road.",
