  "text": "Like I get it that STEM needs more girls. I get it that I could get a ton of scholarships and opportunities. I get it that I'm pretty smart and could do well in it. Lots of my family members are constantly pushing me to do some stem major like engineering when that's basically the furthest thing I want to do. The concept of going to school for four years for that then 50 years of working in the field afterwards makes me wanna shoot myself. Stem is currently SO PUSHED for girls and it feels like it comes at the expense of other subjects.\n\nEdit: if you're going to be misogynistic in the comments you can fuck right off",

There is a big push for girls during their middle school years to start looking into science and math because engineering is this burgeoning field and not only that, it is stuffed with white men. So engineering schools & companies have been forming these scholarships and opportunities for women in STEM to diversify the field... meaning that yeah, a lot of teachers in lower educations really encourage girls with a penchant for math and science to pursue STEM.\nEdit: clarity",

I am about to graduate with my masters in computer science and I was really lucky to always have a few women with me and a great female advisor. I kinda had the opposite experience where I was the person people came to for help and relied on in projects to get through things. I'm also lucky to have a pretty good job with male's in leadership who are super kind and encouraging. Def not the norm yet, but it can happen and I hope it will become the new standard to treat women like human beings.",

The challenge that math and science presents makes them genuinely engaging for me. In comparison, the routine work of writing essays is soul-draining even if I am more adept at it. \n\nWhen I told my family that I intended to major in engineering, they were all extremely skeptical and heavily advised me against it. But I\u2019ve reached a point where I\u2019d rather be alive and happy doing something I suck at than excelling in a field that drains my will to live. After sucking at math my entire life, I\u2019ve finally began to enjoy physics and calculus more that anything else now that I\u2019ve stopped equating my worth as a person with my grades. \n\nEven though academic performance isn\u2019t the point for me anymore, this shift has paid off for me in a huge way. On my first SAT, I scored 770 for ERW and 670 for Math. On my second, I scored 700 ERW and 780 for Math. \n\nI know a lot of this sounds like generic college essay filler, but I\u2019d really have appreciated receiving some of the encouragement (but not pressure) to focus more on math and science at an earlier age. Then again, that may have put me off of STEM for the same reasons I no longer enjoy English and history.",

You clearly know a lot about the subject, but I was simply pointing out that by saying \u201cthat\u2019s literally basic Jungian and Hegelian observation\u201d, you assume that your audience is familiar with those terms, which weakens your argument in this setting because most people will not put the time and effort into verifying your claims on your behalf. \n\nObviously, I am not the most well informed on this subject, but I took a look through the sources you provided, and the first one states that \u201cNo significant gender differences are typically found on Openness/Intellect at the domain level, likely due to the divergent content of the trait...\u201d (while I will concede to you about agreeableness and abstract thinking). The pubmed article you linked helps me to better appreciate your original point and I am grateful that you took the time to link it to me. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m not going to waste any more time today typing stuff about topics that I do not care or know much about when there is homework to do and applications to get in.

Jung and Hegel are white, European, educated, male writers who lived in a time when women couldn't even vote in both of their respective countries. If you're subscribing to the notions of gender roles adopted by these \"philosophers\" who died 60+ years ago rather than witnessing with your own eyes and ears the stories, experiences, and academic research on actual real life people today, then I think you should spend some time reading literature that challenges your views. I can tell you, as someone who got their degree in physics, works in tech, and is doing grad school part time that \"temperament\" is not the thing stops people, regardless of gender, from succeeding in STEM.",

I was always told that if I wanted to attend a liberal arts college and major in philosophy I would never find a job. I've also been told that I have \"a duty as a woman\" to be in STEM to break down the glass ceiling. Personally, I think it's just as much of a problem to pressure women and girls into STEM fields as it is to have no women in STEM. I think the most important thing we can do right now is to dismantle the idea that you are either a STEM person or a liberal arts person and there's no middle ground. The two aren't mutually exclusive and treating them like they are just damages the perceptions of young people (especially women) in academia.",

I think the push for girls in stem generally comes from the patriarchal thought that male-dominated fields are somehow more \"intellectually challenging\" or \"worth of study\" than the humanities and arts and its literal bullshit!

Depending on how involved you are/how much of a chance of getting into a college with stem/the colleges policies for switching between majors/schools I see a few options. First, tell  you parents the only way to get into a school is to apply to a different major (the major you actually want to get) and then 'tell' them you'll switch after. Of course, this  is if your parents are cool with that not all are. You could apply to the major your parents want and then switch. You could apply to the major you want and do a minor your parents want. You could double major in what your parents want and what you want. Of  course literally everything I say can be thrown out if  your parents aren't cool with that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd from what  I heard having a STEM majors/minors can be a big benefit for girls once we get into the job market (regardless if you get another major/minor). Ex. comp sci is def the future of all this jazz and you can make bank with that degree on top of everything else. And making bank= retiring early.",

      "text": "I'm an almost 50 year old white guy, with 25+ years of experience in the technology industry.  \n\nI am also a father to three daughters.  \n\nThe technology industry has *(finally?)* taken notice that many of their product teams are packed full of staff members with nearly identical life experiences, backgrounds, preferences and opinions.  \n\nMale. 20-30 years old. Middle Class family background. SciFi & Fantasy enthusiast. Introvert. Math-inclined from early age.  \n\nThese teams of similar-background developers all solve problems the same way and all think the same concepts are \"cool\" because they all have such similar backgrounds.  \n\nThis is apparently not a big deal for you, and that's totally cool.  \n\nBut a fair number of influential women have taken the technology industry to task for their total failure to develop products that are inclusive and/or attractive to women and any other gender or personality that isn't the same as the product teams.  \n\nThis presentation is a great example of how the tech industry at large failed women: [TEDx: Debbie Sterling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEeTLopLkEo)  \n\n\nThe technology industry has achieved a state of *\"kinda woke\"*, admitted that they fucked up, and are now trying to beat each other to market with products developed with diverse product teams.  \n\nAs we well know, the technology industry has money. Fuckloads of money. Nauseatingly large piles of money.  \n\nThey are shoveling buckets of money into education to try to overcome **decades** of cultural stereotypes, feelings of normalcy, trends, beliefs and failures of early-education to support girls into accessing the foundations of technology and engineering.  \n\nRealities like the fact that there are no Legos or Erector Sets in \"The Pink Aisle\" at Walmart are just an easy example of things that need to be overcome to help make women comfortable embracing the toys and concepts.  \n\nIf engineering / math / technology isn't for you, then you don't have to leverage these resources. You don't have to take these scholarships. You don't have to attend the free technology conventions. You don't have to pursue a career creating of things using technologies. Nobody is going to force you into this career path.  \n\nBut please be careful of bashing these efforts that a lot of your peers fought really damned hard to get started.  \n\nThe medical segment of STEM has already done great work in getting women to achieve great successes. Here is a fantastic recent example:  \n\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/05/06/kizzmekia-corbett-vaccine-coronavirus/  \n\nA 34-year old African American woman named Kizzmekia Corbett is one of the project leaders for The US National Institute of Health responsible for the research that led to the vaccine creation. I wouldn't quite say she invented it, because these are large teams of researchers. But her team was apparently (according to Dr Anthony Fauci) instrumental in the research necessary for the creation of the vaccines.  \n\n\nIt's totally cool that you are not interested in inventing the next great SmartPhone, or Killer Social Media App, or techno-gadget. But let's not obstruct these opportunities for other women to potentially take advantage of. Please?",

I wouldn't presume to relate to every mom & dad, everywhere.  \n\nBut what I want for my daughters is career stability, with a clear retirement benefit at the end of the rainbow.  \n\nRight now, today there are technology companies and tech-focused recruiters ready to quite literally do battle for the privilege of hiring high-performing female technology & engineering graduates.  \n\nThey are armed with hiring incentives, flexible work schedules and remote-work arrangements, not to mention premiere-quality apprenticeship and mentoring programs purpose-built to help them achieve not just career success, but strong leadership success within the career.  \n\nGetting your wagon hitched to a train that will make you a junior executive in 10-15 years post-graduation is a glorious solution to the objective of achieving career success.  \n\nThere are opportunities available right now that weren't even a conceptual idea when your parents (and I) were entering the workforce.  \n\nThe nostalgia of women in medicine has pretty well worn off. The programs built to urge women into those fields and roles have to some extent dried up.  \n\nThere are no programs (or damned few programs) that exist to help women get into or accelerate their careers in Marketing or Psych or Social Work or any of the usual Liberal-Art & Humanities focused roles.  \n\nSo, if you choose to go down that path, you'll have to chisel your own success out of the stone. Which is fine. But walking past all those opportunities for acceleration that I know I would kill for, and I suspect your parents would so love to see you take advantage of hurts a little.  \n\nIt should also be pointed out:  \n\nMore and more tech companies want to hire Liberal Arts majors into technical roles.  \n\nYeah, I know that sounds counter-intuitive. But they are **desperate** to unfuck their design pipelines that are overly wrapped-up with *\"Brogrammers\"* that all think the same.  \n\nSo, a computer science minor or even a couple of introductory programming classes might open doors you haven't thought of even trying to approach before...  \n\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/26/tech-jobs-now-a-fit-for-a-liberal-arts-degree-or-no-degree-at-all.html  \n\nhttps://www.edsurge.com/news/2019-02-25-dear-liberal-arts-major-stem-companies-need-your-skills-to-grow  \n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/georgeanders/2015/07/29/liberal-arts-degree-tech/?sh=29c74db1745d  \n\nhttps://www.fastcompany.com/90430000/i-have-two-liberal-arts-degrees-heres-how-i-got-a-job-in-tech  \n\n-----  \n\nI don't want you to pursue any career you aren't interested in or excited by.  \n\nIf tech isn't for you, then it isn't for you.

Because for centuries their contributions to the field have been diminished and the roots of oppression against women run deep. We HAVE to invest this much energy and time and resources into getting women into STEM-- there are centuries of deep rooted sexism to unearth within ourselves and the industry. If you're not interested in it, then ignore it. Personally, I'm grateful for the push of women into STEM and my parents being eager about it. If not for that push and for my parents I wouldn't have taken math and science so seriously and then come to find that I really enjoy those fields. The nearly all-male, misogynistic af STEM clubs and classes at my school would have put me off.\n\nThat being said, OP, do NOT feel pressured to go into STEM! Frankly, women are underrepresented everywhere and have spent so long being forced to follow what their family and society want that I really just want you to feel free and happy and pursue what you want :) I am a HUGE believer in the humanities as being absolutely crucial to society as well. I love my English and History classes too.",

On one hand, subtler societal conditioning leads women to be predisposed towards humanities fields (and I\u2019m not passing judgement at all, for the record.)

But those don\u2019t address the source of the issue, so while they have accomplished some in evening out the gap, it ends up alienating a lot of women in the process. A lot of girls, myself included, are more aligned with humanities fields, but whether it\u2019s for money or acceptance, end up pursuing stem. There\u2019s no easy solution, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a really pressing issue, but it\u2019s interesting to think about.",

But I wouldn\u2019t expect any random stranger online to have \u201ctextbook knowledge\u201d on psychology, especially outside of a forum dedicated to said subject. Also, you seem like quite the Jung devotee, so I\u2019m sure that you\u2019re familiar with the criticism of his work. I personally try to avoid putting too much stock into anything that doesn\u2019t have a healthy amount of empirical evidence to support it. All I\u2019m trying to say is that it is better to evaluate a complex issue from several different angles rather than assuming you have all the answers. \n\nEdit: I have so many regrets - my argument here is really stupid that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say",

It\u2019s something I was pressured into for a while, but it also was a dream of mine. Now i can\u2019t even remember if ai like it or my parents do. I genuinely want to do it because there\u2019s aspects of it i am super passionate about. However, the thought of going to 4 years of med school makes me wanna die. \n\nI was also discouraged from a lot of passions of mine. I loved history and wanted to major in that, but basically everyone i knew convinced me not to. They basically said i could never find a job in it and questioned why i wanted to do history when i could be successful at science.\n\nRight now i am planning on double majoring in science and humanities and seeing what I actually want. I do agree, forcing girls into STEM is harmful. They would make the decision themselves. I think it also can discourage a lot of girls from actually doing it when you bring up the facts it\u2019s a male dominated field and they only want you for your gender. We should make the decision ourselves. If i actually go into STEM i want to. be there because I earned it not because ai am a female.",

It took me three and a half years of my undergrad degree for me to realize that (resulting in me graduating a semester late). I let my dad dictate too much of what I wanted in life and ended up depressed and suicidal before taking a leap of faith and switching degrees from Geology to Russian Studies.\n\nNow I live in Moscow and am doing my second Bachelor's degree \\*in Russian\\* at MGIMO for International Law. Note that no one in my family is Russian. I started learning the language five years ago and have lived here since February (thanks COVID!). The sky is the limit and STEM isn't the only path to success. \n\nI may have loved math and science (and I still do), I just couldn't see myself making a career of it. Law and languages are much more up my alley and I found a way to make use of both. Sometimes you just have to be a bit bold and creative and willing to take a risk.",

Maybe for some electives you take some elective courses in poli-sci, the history of Brazil/Portugal, Public Policy, Portuguese, international relations etc. and then you go on to work for the government, for an NGO, for a non-profit and so on. Once your idea takes form, you can turn to professors, professionals and advisors for help, experience and wisdom. Heck, you might do all of the above and decide it isn't for you and take a different path. All of that is okay! There isn't a right answer and life is constantly changing. You are constantly changing. Whatever happens, don't stress too much, work hard and enjoy your college years!\n\nedit: also study abroad. It is life changing and eye-opening.

      "text": "Yup. Weirdly, it's a culture here in South East Asia too. It's more of a 'peer pressure' kind of force than parents or teachers from my school. During Grade 10, we get to decide whether we want to major in the arts or sciences. Since all of my friends were in science, I chose Science. My seniors said I should do Physics and Chemistry cause it's easy, so what can possibly go wrong?  \n\n\nI ended up flunking on my Chem during Grade 10 and pretty much survived Physics. It wasn't until Grade 11 when I had a better teacher for Chem only then my grades went up. Luckily for my package, I had Accounting as a replacement for Bio (though I regret not switching Physics to Bio cause I would probably excel in it compared to Physics). Suprise to say I ended up going for Social Science during my A-levels and I loved it!  \n\n\nMy advice: Just go for your passions! It's ok to not go into STEM if you don't enjoy and see yourself working in the field in your career. And to all who are pursuing STEM and non-STEM fields, I'm proud of you, supporting you, and cheering you all the way! Do it for passion, not for the money!   \n\n\nBtw if anyone asks what I want to pursue, I'll be focusing more on film and comms and a second major in PoliSci or Psychology (though it would be CompSci if I do get a scholarship from my government).",

There is a reason people who work at government are the least productive. If you actually believe pushing for equality of outcome and productivity are not related, then I dont know what to tell you. I never said anywhere they should be left out. I literally said they shouldnt be discriminated against. I said I am against pressuring them to do stem to have a diverse representation.\n\nEdit: the reason former USSR countries had good stem programs is because they spent all of their money on stem research and education so that they could compete with the US in arms/space race, not because they had more women representation. As a result, the countries collapsed.",

                                  "text": "Now, how exactly do you know that for sure? You don\u2019t... \n\nAlso, to directly answer a Q from before with an anecdotal story: I\u2019m actually an immigrant (very little when I moved though) from Eastern Europe. My entire family from that side, both boys and girls, have STEM positions. America honestly doesn\u2019t even rank well in mathematics, so no, I don\u2019t doubt women in Russia, for example, aren\u2019t \u201cqualified.\u201d However, it\u2019s interesting that I grew up having very low confidence in my math abilities (though I\u2019ve always been \u201cabove average\u201d in it) because I\u2019ve always had to \u201ctry\u201d, and all my female relatives from Europe never understood that and actually did encourage me in math classes and such. I think that\u2019s a great example of how cultural and societal norms about girls in STEM with US vs former USSR states differ and the long-term effects of such. Not to mention, again, there\u2019s so many studies that have been done about this... One of them I read a while back was about how girls are more likely to drop their economics major after just *one class* if they receive anything less than an A compared to boys. Multiple potential interpretations could be taken from that: girls need to be more confident in their abilities (hence, the importance of encouragement and role models in STEM fields), girls aren\u2019t less \u201cqualified\u201d than boys in math-related fields, boys are overly confident in their abilities, etc.\n\nEdit: Girls literally enter college with better STEM qualifications, too. This is just a blog post, but it\u2019s from a reputable organization with reputable citations: https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/national-stem-crisis-then-why-are-high-school-girls-out-performing-boys-in-science-and-math-classes/\n\nAnother study that\u2019s a bit older even found girls have slightly higher engineering GPAs than boys. https://clear.dol.gov/study/women-men-and-academic-performance-science-and-engineering-gender-difference-undergraduate At which colleges was the disparity even more pronounced? The ones in which girls felt actually supported in their STEM programs. No surprise there, which brings me back to my original main point. \ud83d\ude43",

This is similar to why affirmative action is legal, based on the idea that, for example, people aren\u2019t inherently less intelligent than white people - they just likely went to poorer schools, etc., and those disparities only widen as one progresses in school. \n\nAlso, since you brought in SAT scores, again, girls have higher GPAs both in high school and college than boys in STEM related fields, so... I\u2019m pretty sure an employee is going to care about one\u2019s GPA more than a standardized SAT section they took in high school.\n\nEdit: I just realized I missed your point about conscription just for men.

Anyone who broadly paints a brush on such a complicated matter, such as the USSR, as XYZ is just... I don\u2019t even know what to say - lacks critical thinking skills? \nOne can condemn something and not want it to repeat in the same exact form overall while acknowledging that yes, there were some positives of that system. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive. I can\u2019t believe I even have to tell someone in college that. Public opinion polls of people who lived under the USSR weren\u2019t as black and white as you make it appear ( https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/29/in-russia-nostalgia-for-soviet-union-and-positive-feelings-about-stalin/%3famp=1 ), so basically saying that those former citizens of the USSR who all didn\u2019t completely hate the system they were living in and who have directly been the ones who have lived in two completely different systems are all idiots is... weird. \n\nFurthermore, your earlier responses don\u2019t seem to indicate that there\u2019s a difference between socialism and communism (hint: there is!) and that all socialist states weren\u2019t exactly the same, so I\u2019m not sure what you learned in your supposed classes about this if you don\u2019t know that basic information one would gain in any history class about the former USSR states. I highly doubt your professors are \u201cpro-communism\u201d - pro-socialism, sure but communism was pretty awful. Calling people \u201cidiots\u201d and placing huge labels such as \u201cpro-communism professors\u201d isn\u2019t an effective form of argumentation, and honestly, anyone who throws stuff like that out there isn\u2019t worth talking to whatsoever, hence why I saw there was zero point replying to you earlier. \n\nComments on your sources:\n\n1. This study looked at Dutch schools, which is pretty irrelevant when talking about the *US and the USSR*.  That said, I don\u2019t know much about how the gender equality and education system is in the Dutch states, so can\u2019t comment directly on that without researching more into it. \n2. Lol, good luck on using whatever the hell \u201cLife Site News\u201d is as a reputable source in a research paper. This article gives zero direct citations for the studies it talks about, so I can\u2019t check out the original studies...\n3. Lol, did you read this past the headline? \u2018\u201cMany countries have seen a gender gap in favour of boys in maths narrow or disappear since 2003. But the report warns that this is the result of a \u201cworrying trend\u201d \u2013 that low performing boys are failing to improve... A Department for Education spokesman said the government was supporting the\u00a0Your Life campaign, which promotes STEM subjects, to \"show young people - and especially girls - the exciting opportunities these subjects can bring.\u201d This approach has helped ensure 10,000 more girls are now studying STEM A-levels than in 2010 \u00a0and last year as many girls as boys achieved grade C and above in science GCSEs,\" he added,\u201d\u2019 literally helps my point, not yours. Girls are qualified and capable of STEM fields, and they are more likely to engage in them if they feel supported doing so.\n4. \u201cThe study of primary schools in the county suggests that under-performance among boys in most national exams could be linked to lower expectations,\u201d so... If we tell students that they\u2019re capable and encourage them to aim high and achieve high, they\u2019re more likely to do so. Thanks again for giving me another source that helps exemplify the notion the importance of girls being supported in STEM fields and the long-term effects of that.\n5. This is actually a really interesting study, but it\u2019s not about whether men or women are actually \u201cbetter\u201d at STEM - it\u2019s about who is more likely to be told white lies about their performance. If anything, I think this study only helps my point lmao as it certainly doesn\u2019t help yours. Their first possible explanation for their results is literally about gender stereotyping, which is problematic and one of the root causes to the lack of women in STEM. They even say in *neither of the studies done were women judged as less competent* and that women are generally perceived as less confident, so people may show paternalistic attitudes towards them as a result. Hence, once again, women aren\u2019t necessarily \u201cunqualified\u201d and having girls gain more confidence in their abilities from an early age can lead to greater long-term effects *for all genders*. I truly love that you gave me this study as a source supposedly for your side. \n6. \u201cContrary to prevailing assumptions, men and women faculty members from all four fields preferred female applicants 2:1 over identically qualified males with matching lifestyles (single, married, divorced), with the exception of male economists, who showed no gender preference.\u201d *Your literal own source said that these women favored over men are just as qualified*. If your problem is that though *equally qualified*, women are being favored, 1) diversity is important for all the reasons previously mentioned (role models, decision making by a group of people that\u2019s actually representative of society) and 2) lol men are still over represented in male-dominated fields - you\u2019re fine. \u201cOur research suggests that the mechanism resulting in women\u2019s underrepresentation today may lie more on the supply side, in women\u2019s decisions not to apply, than on the demand side, in antifemale bias in hiring. The perception that STEM fields continue to be inhospitable male bastions can become self-reinforcing by discouraging female applicants, thus contributing to continued underrepresentation, which in turn may obscure underlying attitudinal changes.\u201d So, once again, it\u2019s not that women aren\u2019t qualified; they\u2019re just not encouraged enough in their own profession (certainly doesn\u2019t help when it\u2019s male-dominated!) and consequently, not confident to proceed to professorship positions within the field. \n7. \u201cSecond, girls receive higher grades on average than boys in reading, consistent with reading test scores, but receive higher grades in science and comparable grades in math, despite having lower average test scores in those subjects.\u201d This study doesn\u2019t say anything about *why* girls receive lower average test scores. That\u2019s what\u2019s important here. Some potential factors, as previously stated several times: gender sterotypes, lower confidence, less encouragement by family/teachers, etc.  \u201cBoys in all racial categories (white, black and Hispanic) across all subject areas (reading, math and science) are not represented in grade distributions where their test scores would predict. We then trace the misalignment of grades and test scores to differences between boys and girls in their non-cognitive development. Boys who perform equally as well as girls on subject-area tests are graded less favorably by their teachers, but this less favorable treatment essentially vanishes when non-cognitive skills are taken into account. For some specifications there is evidence of a grade \u2015bonus for boys with test scores and behavior like their girl counterparts.\u201d The last sentence basically says that that being perceived as a good student = you\u2019ll get higher grades. That\u2019s not really a surprise here as just because you score well on a test doesn\u2019t mean you actually do work in the classroom. Additionally, even excluding that point, this seems to more so say that boys aren\u2019t as graded as high as they should be, but that still doesn\u2019t speak to your presumed notion that girls are less capable of excelling in STEM fields or lesser than boys. \n8. This article literally has nothing to do whether women being/not being qualified to perform in STEM fields at the same level as men or gender-based discrimination towards girls in STEM. It\u2019s about potential bias in the sources use lol, but people can pick and choose whatever *reputable* sources they want to use. It also used a sample size of ten essays, which is pretty small considering how many studies have been done regarding gender bias. \n\nWell, that was fun. Maybe you take a closer look into your own sources that largely contrary to what you preach or are completely irrelevant to the USSR vs US with women in STEM.\n\nLast note, this has gotten annoying. As I mentioned earlier, I find arguing with people who throw subjective words like \u201cidiot\u201d out there and make incredible broad black-and-white assumptions completely futile (though reading many of your sources that just help my side was fascinating), so I\u2019m blocking you .

You should admit that you are simply ignoring the parts that challenge your views. People like you explain why politicians like sanders, warren, AOC are getting popular nowadays. And Politicians like you are kind of the reason why this country is falling apart. Government bureaucrats who make policies on the subject without actually being a part of it. Just like I said, you couldn't accept anything from these sources that opposed your views which is why I didnt bother using it. I expected you to call it not reputable or saying it is wrong by cherry picking the info. Just like Yuri Bezmenov said, it is impossible to change the mind of someone who has been already corrupted. No matter what I show you, your opinion won't change until you face it, just like how your parents left the country but you cannot acknowledge that their system failed. \"There is a difference between communism and socialism\" - I expected no more from you. We already have socialism in the US. Guess what pushing it further and further will do.\n\nFun fact:   in 1974, a law was passed that banned woman from hundreds of jobs because it was deemed \"harmful to women's reproductive systems\". Before that, they were working in coal mines because there weren't enough men for it to be a male exclusive job in USSR. They literally just didnt have enough men in USSR. \n\nTalking to a typical white pc socialist feminist warrior has been fun. You people dont want \"equality\", as I have seen not a single feminist pushing women to get conscripted to the military. I am looking forward for people like you to make policies that will fuck up the country like USSR  got fucked. It will happen, and you guys will always say in theory communism should have worked or socialism is different from communism after moving to another prosperous country. Whether you like it or not, this country and European nations will get fucked by all the shit show they have been playing for the past decade. But when they realize it will be too late.",

A liberal arts degree can offer an avenue into law school and other routes for individuals who simply don\u2019t have the aptitude or drive to perform well in a STEM field. It\u2019s simply a matter of making the most of the resources and connections one has. Putting all of that aside, OP\u2019s life decisions are her own, not her family\u2019s, and if after much deliberation she chooses not to major in STEM, well, there\u2019s no shame in that.",
