Since we visited in June, I didn't get to see many students milling around, so can't speak to it's vibe. \n\nI've been on at least 17-20 college campuses by now, Case was different than most, but not bad.

There\u2019s just something so awful about the concrete ocean between every building that makes even the aesthetically-pleasing ones look lackluster. Luckily, we got Scripps and Pomona to make up for it, but even those are overrated sometimes honestly.",

Totally agree.\n\nAnd I agree with you on the hills: I run cross country & track; I don't want to have to walk up a bunch of hills every day lol... I'd rather do hills on my own time during a workout lmfao.\n\nWhat I did like was the vibe the students gave me.
