  "text": "Thinking of rushing an application for U southern California before the deadline, since it got extended. I'm wondering if I should though since it seems they meet full financial need anyways, and my EFC is 0 / financial stuff is well within the limits for full aid. \n\nWould I gain anything by applying for merit scholarships by dec 2? Or would there be no benefit since I'll get need-based aid anyway?",
