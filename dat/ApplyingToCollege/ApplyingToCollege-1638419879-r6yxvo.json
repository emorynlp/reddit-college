  "text": "I\u2019m a US highschool senior looking to apply to McGill. The website is just straight up confusing. As an international student I know I have to fill out extra forms. It took me forever to find the application form once and now I can\u2019t seem to find it again. Could anybody who went through the process give me some insight on how many steps there are to the application.",
