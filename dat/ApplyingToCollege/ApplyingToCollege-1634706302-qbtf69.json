  "text": "Hello all,\n\nI am not sure if this is the right sub to ask this question, but I will ask anyways.\n\nIn regards to the Computer Science department, would going to a college with a ranking of around 40-50 still be fine in order to get into nice paying job? Or should I try to aim higher?\n\nThanks for your time",

      "text": "When it comes to CS, what you do in your program matters a lot more than where you go to school, because all the top companies hire from all kinds of colleges - it is your skillset that gets you the job and not your college's ranking, whether it's a T50 or a T100 or even beyond that.",
