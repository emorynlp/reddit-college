  "title:": "My sister is in critical condition",
  "text": "It happened this morning. My dad and sister were struck by a drunk driver at around 7 AM. I was awoken to that news. \n\nFrom what the doctors said, my dad will make it out, but my sister was in critical condition, and is currently in the ICU. \n\nFuck. I don't know what I'm going to do. She was my favorite person in the whole world. I can't imagine what'll happen if she's gone. \n\nI remember during my tour of UW, she asked the tour guide where the nearest Chipotle was because she knew I couldn't live without it. It was embarassing. But that was how much she cared about me. \n\nI'm numb. I can't believe it. \n\nI had a final project due at midnight. I emailed my teacher, and I even gave him the 60% of the project that was done. He just emailed me back that incomplete work gets a 0, and there's no late submissions allowed. \n\nI can't finish. I just can't. I don't have time, I have more important things, and I'm not in the mental state to do so. \n\nThe class is 600 points, and the final was 200. If I get a 0, my grade goes to a D-, which will almost certainly disqualify me from UW admission, and get me rescinded from UT. But, I don't care about that now. \n\nI said that all I wanted for Christmas was for UW to let me in. I was wrong. All I ever want is for my sister to come back. \n\nI have another final due for the same teacher on Monday. I can't do it. I just can't get myself to. \n\nAny advice? sorry for the gloomy post.",

I know sorry won't cut it and I can't imagine the pain and the worry going through your mind right now, but I want to tell you that your mental state and taking care of yourself comes over schoolwork. Honestly, I'm so frustrated and angry that your teacher didn't even understand your situation. I highly suggest talking about your situation with your counselor/school administration so they talk some sense into your teacher because they SHOULD understand and give you an extension. If I were your teacher I would just give you a 100 because sht like this comes over some stupid school work smh. Your family will be in my prayers OP, and please take care of yourself in the process as well. Sending you warmth, hugs, and healing vibes <3",

There's nothing I can do to help your sister, but you shouldn't have to worry about how this will impact your college admissions.\n\nI've counseled clients through avoiding rescinded admission before and I would be happy to give you some advice and review whatever emails or communications you send the college.  If they want to try to rescind you for this, we can go to the mattresses.  Inside HigherEd, US News, and other news outlets would eat this story up and the mere threat of a PR disaster would likely be enough to prevent any college from rescinding you.  I have contacts who are reporters at US News, Yahoo, Gannett and more, and if needed we can reach out to them.  \n\nFor now just let me know how this plays out and I'll try to help however I can.",

Those folks do some amazing things with even the most critical of patients and your sister will receive absolutely the best possible care.  I agree with the other posters that your biggest concern is your family and yourself.  Obviously getting into any hospital ICU is near impossible right now, so basically your only option is to be with your Mom and take things one step at a time at home.\n\nNobody at your school will be reachable until Monday at the earliest, so don\u2019t worry about your final grade until then.  When Monday comes, then you can reach out to your school\u2019s principal to make your case.  Repeat after me: *your grade is not ruined*.  \n\nI will send all the positive energy I have in your direction; I sincerely hope that your sister will be okay.  It\u2019s going to work out.",

I'm saying that as someone who has ptsd and has experienced very extreme trauma (so much that I'm considered a victim of abuse federally). and remember that no matter what happens, you will be okay. if things go sideways, it will sting but things will get better. please please please if you need someone I'm here for you (I will literally give you my phone number if you need it) and this might sound bizarre but if you ever get urges of hurting yourself, DON'T and seek help immediately. don't lose hope and you're all over my thoughts :)",

Sometimes teachers are jerks because they hear a lot of fake excuses and so them may not be sure if the circumstances are real or just an excuse. A police report will solve that. My story is not nearly as serious or important as yours, but might shed some light on how they think...I tried to once ask a teacher if I could take a final exam early (which you would think they would tolerate more than me asking to take it late.) But they had a really strict no exceptions policy regarding when it had to be done. I tried to explain that my brother was getting married on that date and I had to travel across the country to attend the wedding. They said that they didn\u2019t believe me (or I should have planned my calendar better). The teacher insisted that nobody has a wedding with only 2 weeks\u2019 notice. I tried to explain that they do when they knock up a girl and her father is the local judge. Anyway, my heart goes out to your family. Sending love and light to your sister and I hope she heals quickly.

      "text": "I\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t imagine the stress and pain that you and your family are feeling at the moment. Please know that you, your family, and your mental health come first. The rest can be worked out later. \n\nIf you can\u2019t get the teacher to see sense and petitioning admin at your school doesn\u2019t work (I think it will) so you keep the D-, you can communicate your extenuating circumstances to UW.\n\nBut right now, put that aside unless you are choosing to cope by distracting yourself with schoolwork, and focus on doing what you can to take care of yourself. I used to volunteer in an ICU and spent a lot of time talking to families, so my best advice is that you do what you can to cope in a healthy manner. \n\nIf you\u2019re mad, punch something that can\u2019t break, go out into the words and scream, or throw eggs at a tree. If you\u2019re sad, spend some time talking with your family, write down your feelings so they don\u2019t get bottled up, listen to music, or read a comfort book or watch a comfort movie. Distraction can prove to be an effective tool in moderation. Take care of yourself physically too. Try to remember to eat and drink fairly regularly, change clothes, shower, etc. \n\nSide note: I imagine that visiting is tricky right now, but If you have a social worker on your family\u2019s case, and you would be interested in pursuing it, ask if they can arrange a phone call so you can talk or if you can give a note to be read to your sister. ICU patients, even if sedated, often have positive reactions to hearing a loved one\u2019s voice or words. \n\nIf you can finagle it, I would try and get a few days off school so you can have time to process this news. Ask your school counselor for extensions too. \n\nRemember that the medical staff is going to be doing all they can and the ICU is the best place for your sister to be right now. The ICU can give the highest level of care to ensure your sister has the best chance of recovery. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of people leave the ICU and go home to their families. There are no promises in the medical world, but don\u2019t lose hope yet. I\u2019m sending good thoughts your way. \n\nIf you want to PM me with questions regarding ICU things, I\u2019m happy to answer. \n\nTake care.",

You health and well being should be you number one priority! I\u2019d say your principal should be able to do something about it, assuming he\u2019s not as big of a prick as your teacher. I know what teachers like that can be like, there\u2019s one at my school who\u2019s notorious for screwing his students over. Just because he\u2019s strict and a hard teacher doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a good one. I hope you get through this soon and that your sister is alright. Losing a sibling is something that will effect you for the rest of your life and I pray you won\u2019t know that pain. We\u2019re all here to support you. And if you ever need to talk to someone or just have someone listen, even if it\u2019s about something unrelated I\u2019ll be here no matter what. Just DM me. Even if all you need is a distraction from all of this. Again I a truly sorry about your situation.",

I strongly suggest you take days off from school. During the no-no disease, its gonna be quite hard to visit the hospital, but you should do anything in your power to support your family. \n\nFor UW and such -  just send them a email. There are people on the other end (I think...) and you do get a chance to explain yourself. In the end, they WILL understand. I know you have already emailed the principal, but if it doesn't work out, you should email your higher-ups and all your other teachers. Also, I can't still believe your teacher dared to give you a zero, YET EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. SMH.\n\nBut that's not the main issue. Here's what my final words are - take care of yourself, take care of your family and most importantly, STAY STRONG - everything will turn out okay. I wish your sister a speedy recovery to perfect health. Sending you lots of love and warmth <3. Wish you the very best chief. I'll be rooting for ya <3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf there is any way I can help you, please feel free to PM me.",
