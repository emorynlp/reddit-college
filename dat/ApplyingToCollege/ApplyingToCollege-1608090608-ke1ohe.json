  "text": "For context, my mom would make the best celebratory pork ribs whenever I had a big concert, won a game, etc. It broke my heart when I opened the fridge and saw marinated ribs, ready to go. I think she was going to surprise me but decided not to when I told her the results. If you're coming from a family of first gen immigrants, be sure to give them a hug regardless of an acceptance, deferral, or rejection, okay?",

I applied to my top choice ED and was deferred, then I applied to 9 schools regular decision, got into my safety, waitlisted at 4 schools including my top choice and rejected from the rest.  That was crushing, I really didn't want to go to my safety school and it felt like I didn't have any options. \n\nI wrote letters to the head of admissions at each of those schools that waitlisted me, a few teachers sent additional recommendations and even my girlfriend sent a recommendation to my top choice (without my knowledge). I ended up getting in off all 4 wait lists, including my top choice. I didn't get accepted to my top choice until 4th of July weekend! \n\nLooking back on that whole process now that I'm a few years out from graduating, I'm so glad I didn't accept my deferrals and waitlists as defeat, and I think that showing my continued interest by writing letters is what got me to where I am today. \n\nBest of luck with the rest of the admissions process, I'm rooting for you! Feel free to dm me if I can help in any way!",
