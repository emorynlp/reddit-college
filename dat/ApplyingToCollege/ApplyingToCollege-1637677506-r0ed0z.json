  "text": "So I passed the DET a couple of days ago and immediately sent the scores to most of the colleges on my list since I'm running late for my application. I would usually get a half dozen or so emails from them daily, but now I'm not getting anything anymore, did I eff up everything?",

I've even been getting mail sent to my house by colleges every week. it's just them promoting themselves",
