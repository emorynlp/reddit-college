      "text": "That's happening to me too for my Northeastern portal, and I submitted them like a month ago.\n\nIt says \"If you intend to apply for financial aid, a list of received financial aid documents will show here once received. Instructions on how to apply for aid can be found HERE.\"\n\nBut nothing is there.\n\nI think they got them, but they're just not showing it on the portal for some reason. Oh well",
