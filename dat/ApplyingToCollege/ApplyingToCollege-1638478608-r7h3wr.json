  "text": "Hi I\u2019m an international student. I wrote the SATs in October and got a 1280 without studying. It\u2019s not bad but it\u2019s not great for what I want so I\u2019m not including it in my applications. However I do have good results in my local exams and they\u2019re accepted by US universities. My essays and personal statements are quite good but I\u2019m applying for aid. Should I have retaken it? I want a scholarship and I\u2019m also filling out my CSS profile (which is honestly a headache. also do they require copies of your bank statements and stuff) for need based scholarships. While I be okay to get funding? Will I even be accepted?\nI\u2019m applying to Columbia, UM, Cal Poly SLO, GIT. The one I really want to get into is Columbia. What do you think? Should I write my SATs in March? Schools are test optional and I already have these other exam results but should I do it to increase my chances of a merit scholarship? Will March be too late?",

      "text": "No. You pretty much have to be 1500+ to not be below average for T10s like Columbia, given that your previous score is 1280, moving into a 1500 will be tough, and March SAT will be too late for both ed and rd rounds. Can't say about the odds, but keep in mind internationals needing aid does drastically reduce your chances.",
