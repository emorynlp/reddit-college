  "text": "Hi I\u2019m an international student. I wrote the SATs in October and got a 1280 without studying. It\u2019s not bad but it\u2019s not great for what I want so I\u2019m not including it in my applications. However I do have good results in my local exams and they\u2019re accepted by US universities. My essays and personal statements are quite good but I\u2019m applying for aid. Should I have retaken it? I want a scholarship and I\u2019m also filling out my CSS profile (which is honestly a headache. also do they require copies of your bank statements and stuff) for need based scholarships. While I be okay to get funding? Will I even be accepted?\nI\u2019m applying to Columbia, UM, Cal Poly SLO, GIT. The one I really want to get into is Columbia. What do you think? Should I write my SATs in March? Schools are test optional and I already have these other exam results but should I do it to increase my chances of a merit scholarship? Will March be too late?",
