  "text": "I\u2019m applying to the University of Cincinnati as an Engineering major and I have to write a 500 word Personal Statement. The prompt is: \u201cWhy did you apply to each of the academic programs listed on your application? This personal statement should provide additional information not already referenced on your application\u201d.\nI have a small bit written but I\u2019m not sure what else to add to expand my essay.",
