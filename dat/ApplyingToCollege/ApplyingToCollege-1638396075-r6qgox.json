  "title:": "504 Plan Question",
  "text": "Hey! My psychiatrist and therapist are recommending a 504 plan for me at school (my diagnosis is unspecified psychosis and I tend to have some of my worst symptoms at school). Before I go through the process, I was wondering if being on a 504 plan negatively impacts your chances to get into a top college. I'm currently a senior so I don't have to worry about LORs being negatively affected, but is there any other way this could hurt my chances? Will my teachers see/treat me differently? Any help is appreciated. Thanks!",

If the proper supports are put in place, and your teachers obey them, you should see your grades improve a bit.\n\nColleges don't have to know you're on a 504. But they will have academic support programs for you as well that you might want to look into when you get there.",
