  "text": "So someone from Umich sent me an email asking to explain my gap since I graduated in 2021 spring and I\u2019m applying for fall 2022 and that I didn\u2019t address it in the app, but like there wasn\u2019t any place to explain it on the application?\n\nanyway, is this gap rare? is it a disadvantage? would it be a bad thing if my reasons are not sufficient enough for them? \n\nI\u2019m just scared they won\u2019t consider my application if i don\u2019t explain it well",

They\u2019ll want to know what you are using your time productively.",
