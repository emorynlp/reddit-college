  "title:": "Activity Weeks Question",
  "text": "So I recently got hired for a job, and I plan on including it in my RD apps. My question is, what should I indicate for the weeks per year? If I anticipate doing the job until at least next summer, would I simply calculate the number of weeks between now and then? Or should I only include how many weeks I've actually completed? This job will be a significant time commitment so I definitely want to include it, but I don't want to accidentally report the wrong thing and have that reflect badly on me.",
