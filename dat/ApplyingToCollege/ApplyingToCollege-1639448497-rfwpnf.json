  "text": "Not sure if this is the right place for this but I\u2019ve kind of been having a breakdown over the past week or so. I\u2019m a senior and I\u2019ve applied to a bunch of in-state schools (UCs and cal states) and I was planning to spend December working on essays for my reach privates and I had a whole list of ivys and top LACs that I wanted to apply to but I\u2019ve realize that I know next to nothing about these school and just picked them mostly based on ranking. I\u2019ve spent my entirely life doing basically nothing but school and busting my a** for a 4.0 to \u201cget into a good college\u201d all to realize in a span of days that my idea of a good college would require my parents to pay 80k+ for the next four years and probably resent me. It just sucks to know that I screwed up so badly in not researching schools well and now there are basically only two schools that I\u2019ve applied to that I actually want to go to and I\u2019m so burnt out from this whole process and senior year that I don\u2019t know if I have it in me to even care anymore.",
