  "text": "Got accepted to Drexel for BS in CS, with a dean's scholarship (20,400/year) yesterday, and I really want to go there. But the problem is I am an international student and in need of tons of aid. The deadline to submit the CSS was Nov 15, but I missed it and didn't submit. So, I got no aid or grants. My EFC is 10k/year. still need around 43k/year aid to attend. What do I do now? mailed them today describing my situation. Is there any chance they will reconsider it? I really like Drexel and their co-op program is great, don't want to go anywhere else at this moment.",

              "text": "They also have a full-tuition merit-based scholarship (Global Scholars) for international students with a deadline of February 1, so maybe apply for it as well\n\nEdit: I just realized you need $40k+. In this case, you should apply for the scholarship anyway. Even if your financial aid application went through, in no way Drexel would give additional 43k in aid - probably around $15-20k",
