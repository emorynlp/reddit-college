      "text": "Indeed, it seems that Dartmouth's ED Acceptance Rate has been higher at about 22-23% in the last 4 years. However, keep in mind that Dartmouth is the smallest Ivy and it admits on average 540 to 565 students during ED.\n\nOn the other hand, Upenn's AR is about 19% -I excluded 2025 stats for both schools- and it admits on the average 1280 to 1320 students.\n\nWhy this is important? Because both schools admit almost all their athletes during ED.\n\nRegardless of size, the number of athletes is about the same in both schools. This number is about 150 students during ED. Therefore, if we subtract this number from both schools from the equation, then the non-athlete Acceptance rate becomes:Dartmouth : 550-150/2500-150= 17%.   UPENN : 1279-170/7110-170=17%  !!!! \n\nTherefore, it seems that there is no real advantage either way. Both are great schools and I would suggest that you focus on which school is a better fit.\n\n\\*\\*\\* I excluded 2025 stats because it was really an unusual year for many reasons .",
