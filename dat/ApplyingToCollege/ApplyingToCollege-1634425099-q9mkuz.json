  "text": "I'm looking at the Coalition application, and one of the additional information areas asks you to provide additional information about your siblings, including their highest degree earned, age, college or university attended, etc. Should I fill this out? None of my siblings went to the college I'm applying for, but they all have at least a BS, and one has a MS.",
