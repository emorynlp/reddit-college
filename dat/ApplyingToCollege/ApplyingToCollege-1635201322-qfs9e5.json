I talked to my counselor about my application and rec letter for a long time and requested one a month ago. But then since last week she hasn\u2019t been showing up, now because of a family emergency she is not going to be at school till Nov 4th but I\u2019m applying on Nov 1st. \n\nI literally want to cry, I emailed her since last week but got reply and I want to end this all what am I supposed to do",

      "text": "Luckily, most colleges won't hold it against you if other people have dropped the ball, which means if your counselor is late with the LOR, as long as you got all of your pieces submitted by the due date, you should be fine, at least for a week or two.\n\nI might report this issue to the associate principal or move it up the chain at your high school, though. You can't be the only senior affected by this. \n\nI'm so sorry for this stress.",
