  "text": "I\u2019m talking about Cornell specifically since they emphasize fit a lot, but I\u2019d also like to know for reference in the future. \n\nIs \u2018fit\u2019 only measured in your college supplements, or through your teacher recs, ECs, and academic courses? And how much weight does each category hold in terms of measuring fit? Are colleges mainly looking for someone whose academic interests align with their school in terms of fit or is it their personality,or both?",

      "text": "I'm guessing that since each Cornell school has its own listed descriptions/missions, they're looking for you to show how you will contribute to that identity throughout every part of your application. \n\nFor example, Cornell Engineering has this: \"We are a surprising, eclectic and visionary group with a broad range of experiences and interests that compel us to tackle pressing problems from many angles. Cornell Engineering students think their way over, under, around and through problems, with a tenacious and entrepreneurial spirit, to make the world a better place.\"\n\nSo, those are all the points you want to demonstrate. Usually the best place to do this is through the supplemental essays.",
