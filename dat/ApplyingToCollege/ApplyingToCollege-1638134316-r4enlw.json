If not, only apply if your family can afford the OOS tuition (which I presume isn\u2019t the case with fee waivers in hand).\n\nIf you are in-state, a 3.1 is tough for most UCs without ECs or something else to make up for it. If you have few waivers and you want to attend a UC, you could look at ones with higher acceptance rates, like UCSC, UCR, and UCM. Definitely apply to some less selective CSUs (you can still get a solid education at less selective institutions) in case it doesn\u2019t work out for a UC.",
