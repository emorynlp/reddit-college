  "title:": "how can i reframe reading (gay chinese) novels as a good EC?",
  "text": "title. and in junior year.\n\nmainly my concern is that i don't read works with a ton of \"literary merit\", because although i enjoy occasional historical fiction or memoirs, mostly i'm super into fiction...like YA fiction (which is pretty standard) and non-traditionally published novels.\n\ni'm gay and chinese and reading gay chinese (danmei) novels is a major secret addiction and escapism method for me but i'd rather die than explain the content of the novels to my grandma so i'm not sure if it can go on college apps. i can't cut it out of my life (see above, addiction) so how should i go about trying to improve this EC?\n\n*edit: cut out very lengthy details and rambles and put them in the comments*",

      "text": "perhaps maybe *making* something based on it can help? for example: since you seem to be part of a community of fans, you can host a sort of book club kind of thing but with the novels/fics that you read. perhaps even creating a video essay that goes in-depth in analyzing certain themes, or even recounting how the stories mean so much to you",

          "text": "the fan community is rabid even if there are some nice pockets. think of it as a rip-off of kpop stanning. book club is essentially the group chats and discord channels. for video essays, would you mean posting them on youtube? would it have the same effect as writing up reviews and analysis on blogs?\n\nagain, the biggest concern is the content of the novels which, can i just omit the specifics? like not mention the borderline erotica parts and instead describe it as if it's only the more well-written ones?",

      "text": "If I were you, I label it as a cultural reading study, and in the description be like x books read x weeks/year, reading queer Chinese books to explore cultural connections/ reflect on my own experience as a young lgbt poc person. Frame it as like a personal study/introspection of your culture and intersectionality\u2019s of identity rather than explicitly stating the genre. If you have any other ECs related to being LGBT or Chinese this could totally work as you being proactive in learning/educating others in intersectional interactions. \nConsider starting some kind of blog where you talk about your identity/customs if you want to connect it to something more \u201clegitimate\u201d.",

      "text": "HEAR ME OUT, i don't mean wattpad (because duh ao3 ftw and i do read an embarrassing amount of fanfic and i would never write that in apps so let's just ignore it) but more like a specific niche genre of fiction that has um questionable connotations? i already searched this sub for mentions of it and there are literally zero results. the point is, i have read a shit ton of translated chinese webnovels. to clarify, i read the english versions, that are translated by fans, not the chinese originals. i think the average wordcount is around 400,000 with a few over 1 mil and over the last year i've probably read over 60. i kind of feel that this is a quirky hobby but i think it may be straying too far.\n\n  \nif anyone has heard of danmei...that's what i'm talking about. it's probably one of the most time consuming ECs i have but i'm worried it looks bad to colleges especially because there's a lot of explicit themes and most of them aren't very polished. however, it's really important to me because of all the friends i've met in online communities, how it connected me with my chinese heritage, and how it's helped me come to terms with my own sexuality. despite the fantasy elements and general lack of historical inaccuracy in some period-set novels, to me it was also representation in media that is often so lacking in western published works which is why i think i became so attached.\n\n  \nmy other concern is a little personal so i'll put it under a spoiler warning because i don't want it to be blaring to anyone just scrolling by.\n\n>!\n2nd concern is that neither of my parents know of this EC. yes, i moonlight as a sordid danmei reader. i have a fucking addiction. i slept 4 hours a night during online learning bc i would just stay up reading and nap in the afternoon. when my mom found out why i was so sleep deprived few months ago, she essentially banned me from reading (it was a smart decision ngl but it was unsuccessful.) the ban was for homophobic reasons (i am not out but she suspects for sure...) but also that she thought i was going to flunk if i continued. it's not so bad anymore, bc now i'm sleep deprived from procrastination not reading!! so i would have to secretly add this to apps after they view the initial version. i was fairly active in the fan community prior to The Ban (memes...and like short 2 fics...but no translations or anything) but i've since dipped and i've only been involved in private groups (LMAO like discord and twt/ig gcs)!<\n\n  \nany insight would be helpful or if you have any ideas on how i can \"elevate\" this hobby. maybe i could start grinding euro classics and only mention \"good\" books? idk. thank you!",
