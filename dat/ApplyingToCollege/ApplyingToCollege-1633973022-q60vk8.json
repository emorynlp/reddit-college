  "text": "Hi Fam,\n\nI hope y'all are doing okay. So I have written the first draft of my personal statement and it is about how I usually doubted myself, and how I was afraid of taking risks and not believing in myself and how  coffee with my grandma slowly helped me overcome it. Sorry if this is a stupid question but I wanted to ask if this was a good topic to write about? I am a bit stressed. Thank you so much. Good luck on our apps!",
