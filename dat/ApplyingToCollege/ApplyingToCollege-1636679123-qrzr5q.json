  "text": "My high school has a choice where instead of taking 3 electives you only take 1. The other two are used to go to a academy where you specialize in a certain field. The field I want to specialize in is electrical engineering. Will colleges me going to the academy and getting a degree or would it be better to continue with my electives?",
