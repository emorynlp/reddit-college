For the applications I already submitted, I do see my scores when I preview the thing. Is anyone else having this issue?  \n\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/UOEn6dQ](https://imgur.com/a/UOEn6dQ)",

I\u2019m just super worried now because a huge part of me is how I improved through high school and increased my course rigor, which is also why I choose to self study 2 additional AP\u2019s which didn\u2019t fit well into my schedule (long story). I had only taken 1 AP class before senior year (got a 5 but like, other people took 8) Does everyone report future AP tests?",
