CB showed them \u201csent\u201d on the following Tuesday. UMD portal shows them as having been received on Monday\u2026 the day BEFORE CB says they sent them.\n\nNote: this was in September when there weren\u2019t a zillion other kids ordering SAT score sends. No idea whether \u201cvolume\u201d is a problem for CB or UMD.\n\nHave you checked the schools\u2019s portal?",
