  "text": "In one of my activities in my common app, an internship, I was only allowed to put something very generic as a result of my mentor, initially not being too comfortable with the fact that their name would be on my application, as they happen to be an important figure in a fortune 500 company.\n\nHowever, they have seemingly turned a new leaf and are now alright with their name being in my applications. So to all the schools, I applied to early, how exactly do I send it to them, as none of their update application sections allow for additional information.",
