      "text": "No such thing as a safety school in the US for intls needing significant aid. If you can apply to more colleges without sacrificing essay quality, I\u2019d apply to more top LACs and universities that meet 100% of demonstrated need for intls. The best you can do is cast a wide net. Keep local safeties in your own country. Hopefully this advice ends up obsolete when you get in ED today :)",

Safety goes out the window when you need a full ride. There's no university just sitting on a mountain of gold that's waiting for you to settle for them.",

That will give you some idea, but the schools will decide what they will contribute and most often it is predicated upon family contributions first. There are \"exceptions\", of course\", students who receive full rides...you just cannot depend upon that expectation and be very disappointed latter, Good Luck",
