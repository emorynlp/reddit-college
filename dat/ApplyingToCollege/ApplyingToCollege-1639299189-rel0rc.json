  "title:": "Thinking of transferring to Babson",
  "text": "I am a business major at a top 75 uni and I am thinking of transferring to some other school with better opportunities. It is hard to find internships as it's not a target school. Moreover, I haven't been able to find many people at my current uni who are really focussed academically and careerwise. \n\nAnyway, I have a 3.9 GPA and decent stats and experience. Considering that money is not a concern, will it be a good decision to transfer to Babson (if I get in at all)? Will it be an upgrade or should I worry about this while applying for grad school? Also, any other college recommendations (realistic pls)?",
