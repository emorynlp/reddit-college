  "text": "I've been looking at tips for writing the why major essay, and everywhere it says that you should connect that back to why you want to attend that college. \n\nThe problem is that another prompt the school has is a why college essay, so I don't want to repeat. \n\nShould I leave out the part about that college in my why major or should I include it in a small part.",
