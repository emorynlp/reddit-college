  "text": "I am currently looking for colleges or universities to apply to. I live in Russia but really want to study abroad, specifically Canada. I want to go for computer science or other programming related courses. Knowing that, I still find it extremely difficult to find a good and affordable match, since I know very little about higher education and how it works.\nPlease give me your best advice, thanks in advance.\nP.S. it's my first time posting in this subreddit, if I made a mistake please notify me.",

      "text": "I would start by getting a broad list and then slowly start to wittle it down. First google a list of all schools in Canada that offer computer science as a major. Then take your grade/gpa and divide the list into three sections: safety, likely, and reach. After that start looking more into specifics depending on your prefferences like small or big, rural or suburban, and other things along those lines. For example I have wittle down my list by requiring each college I apply to, to be near or by a city. After that start looking for scholarship opportunites at each college on your list. If that doesn't work try taking one of those find you perfect college quizes online! I hope this helps!",
