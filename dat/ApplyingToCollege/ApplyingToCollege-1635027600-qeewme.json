  "text": "Hello my fellow stressed children!\n\nI love Photography and Film and wanted to put it on my resume as something that I enjoy. Are there any good summer/winter programs or things I can do outside of school to show my passion for it? Internships with film studios would be cool as well but I just wanted to know what options there are for programs, competitions, or ideas!",
