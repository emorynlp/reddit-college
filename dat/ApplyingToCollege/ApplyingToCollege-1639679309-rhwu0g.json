  "text": "IB Student here. I had a 38/42 term 1 score (Junior year). 667  HL and SL respectively \n\nWorked harder and got a 39/42 term 2 score (junior year).  776 HL and 667 SL .\n\nThis semester (first sem of senior year), I've gotten a 667 HL and a 765 SL. The 5 is in my second language. \n\nWill this be considered a significant drop in points? I'm worried I'll get defered from my EAs and then have to submit these scores. Also worried about my RDs.\n\nWill unis consider junior year aswell? Or will they only look at the most recent transcript",
