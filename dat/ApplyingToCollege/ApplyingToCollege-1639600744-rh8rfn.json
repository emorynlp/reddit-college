You don't seem to have any schools that fall under that category on your list, which is good.",

She\u2019s already in Pitt, Rutgers, Penn State, Delaware and The University of Arizona.  She\u2019s still waiting on her reaches.  I\u2019m not a fan of ED since I think the merit and financial aid packages are important when the student is likely to attend grad school.  We also wanted to have more time to visit the schools that admitted her and check out the particular aspects of her likely major at those schools.",
