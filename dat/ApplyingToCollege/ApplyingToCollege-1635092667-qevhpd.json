  "text": "So, I was doing some research, and some of the colleges I want to go to accept December scores past the deadline. Thing is, I have no clue on how to complete the process to submit them after the deadline. I\u2019m guessing some schools do it differently? If anyone has an idea, would appreciate some help, thanks!",

      "text": "Check each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll \u2013 colleges that accept self-reported scores often have a way in the portal to update scores. Other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission - for these, you'd need to order an official report.",

I\u2019m still concerned as I want the college to know I will be sending later test dates, so that they don\u2019t check my earlier scores thinking they are final, if that makes sense.",

So, I can update my scores, but can I updated them after the deadline? Because to be clear, the reason I am worrying is because my December scores won\u2019t be here in time for deadlines, and for the colleges that accept December score dates, I want to make sure these are the scores they see",

After you submit your application, you will receive login credentials for the portal, where you can check on the status of various components of your file, like test scores. There may be a form (link to click on) in the portal to enter more scores.\n\nFor colleges that require an official score report prior to admission, order the report the day scores are released.\n\nMost colleges have RD deadlines in January. While some colleges have RD deadlines in Dec, if they say they accept Dec scores, then they do. Don't worry.\n\nWhat college is it? there are not a lot with Dec RD deadlines.",

I\u2019m just making sure that when I get my December scores, I can submit them to the college after the deadline. I just don\u2019t know if I have to go through some special process to do this",
