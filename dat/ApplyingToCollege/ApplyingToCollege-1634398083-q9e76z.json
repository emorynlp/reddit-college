  "text": "I\u2019m applying to uiuc for cs, and have a 1470 right now for EA. Should I apply EA or retake SAT and apply RD? Also, how much easier is it for me to improve in 1 month from a 1470 to a 1500+? Is it even worth it?",

I\u2019ve seen on their website that you cannot change your test optional status after you submit, so im not sure if they would allow you changing your scores in the portal.
