  "text": "Like, not on the main common app essay but on the covid info one. It says 250 words but i read somewhere that going about 30-35% over the limit is fine. My essay is 302 words, AFTER editing it mercilessly. Will that be a huge problem for me?\n\nEdit: okay guys got it don't go over the word limit AT ALL. Thanks for the super prompt replies lol",
