  "text": "i don\u2019t understand why this happens to me when my dad has always and still tries to brag about me in school. i\u2019ve always been pretty high achieving, except for when covid made me do distance learning i took a hit due to my internet but even then i made up the classes i got low grades in with A\u2019s. every time i get excited to mention to a college to him that isn\u2019t in arizona or has a high acceptance rate in a nearby state (that isn\u2019t california) he just writes me off. earlier my mom asked where i\u2019d wanna go and i said \u201cmaybe somewhere in new york\u201d and my dad walked by and said \u201ctsk\u201d and rolled his eyes. this has happened to me in mostly every scenario where i bring up a school like texas, california, east coast, etc schools. \n\ni remember when i wanted to go to a couple UC schools like Berkeley, LA, or santa cruz he was like \u201cyeah yeah those fucking liberal places\u201d which really annoyed me because he\u2019s bringing his own ideals onto what i want to do (for reference my family lives in a very conservative small town in arizona, and sorry if this offends anyone on this subreddit). he\u2019s always been like this even for better job opportunities because he is really afraid of the world outside of this little town, as in he disregarded countless offers for his job title just because they\u2019re not rural or because the weather isn\u2019t good (even though it gets the hottest in the country here) or other factors. i feel like he is projecting those kinds of thoughts onto me which is holding me back because most colleges are obviously not conservative these days, and he knows my mom and i do not share his political views either.\n\nalso he\u2019s concerned about money which i understand, but he keeps putting off fafsa even though i keep bugging him about it. i don\u2019t think he accepts that some schools give their own grants to kids even though i already mentioned this to him. i also got some pretty sweet scholarships from a couple of schools already, so i think i can get possibly some more merit scholarships at other places or just general scholarships. but even with the scholarships i got from two places so far, he clowned me for the places they are! ($20k for nebraska and $116k for jacksonville). i also plan on doing work-study.\n\nfinally, he always clowns me for what i want to study. i remember when i was a freshman in high school i wanted to be a pharmacist and he didn\u2019t think it was good for me and i probably won\u2019t be skilled. then i wanted to be a psychologist and he said have fun on the streets. then finally, i\u2019ve decided on CS as my first major choice and he literally said, \u201ccomputers is what john\u2019s friend\u2019s son tried and he ended up a failure good luck with that\u201d in a really mean tone. i\u2019m not sure what he even wants me to do, because i also thought abt being a doctor a while ago and he said i\u2019ll never do it bc it costs too much. it\u2019s just really hurtful that everytime i get excited for something he shoots me down. my dad hasn\u2019t even ever been to college so idk what he\u2019s basing this off of! im a prospective first gen college student for both of my parents. i told my mom about this and she totally supports me wherever i go and not to listen to my dad cus hes always like that, but i don\u2019t understand what i\u2019m even doing wrong. university of arizona isnt a bad school don\u2019t get me wrong and i got a scholarship, but it\u2019s just really not where i want to be at. i live in the middle of nowhere with barely any opportunities for EC\u2019s and i\u2019ve tried to make the most out of it but now i feel like shit and i\u2019ve been crying because i can\u2019t make him happy with mostly everything. i\u2019ve always been his academic pride and joy but when it comes to this he acts like i\u2019m garbage\n\nTLDR: my dad is really conservative in a low-income small town  and is trying to influence where i go to college based on that so pretty much no big towns, liberal arts colleges, or anything really that isn\u2019t in my state. also nothing really outside of a border state, and he clowns me for all of my areas of study. he\u2019s trashing me every time for anything else even though i\u2019m probably capable of getting into a better school with aid and it made me cry idk what to do.\n\nsorry this was super long i just had to let it out ugh \ud83d\ude13",

      "text": "At some point, what your father thinks and says will have less of an impact on how you feel about what you want to do and where you want to go. I had a similar issue.  I wanted to do something that didn\u2019t have enough status for my father and he said a lot of discouraging things about it for many years. So I literally changed my career trajectory, went into graduate school in a totally different area only to land myself in my low status dream job when all was said and done. And he was supportive, after all of those wasted years and angst on my part. It\u2019s your life, your dreams, your future. Love and respect your folks, but it\u2019s all you, kid. You\u2019ve got this. Do you. Follow your dreams- no one else\u2019s. And be a better parent if you decide to have kids. You aren\u2019t alone in this experience- at all.",

      "text": "My thoughts:\n\n1. That really sucks. Not a whole lot else to say.\n2. Out of state isn't all that it's cracked up to be. UC admission rates are quite low, tuition rates are absurd for OOS students, and aid is nonexistent. East coast privates are generally even more expensive. UT is impossible to get into as an OOS. The list goes on. Arizona does have some decent universities, ASU perhaps being the best (top 50 in most things). It also gives pretty generous aid (I'm a CA student that applied to ASU as a safety, and they gave me enough aid to make the cost the same as a UC in-state). It's not a bad option at all, to be honest.\n3. You can fill out FAFSA yourself and just ask your dad to give you the numbers (income, etc). He might be more willing to do that than filling out the whole thing for you.\n4. Pretty much every college is liberal. It's just a fact of life. Maybe, if you tell him that, he will care less where you go? (idk about this though)\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": " As a parent of 3 college students, one recently graduating an one applying like you, I have always had a hard time balancing what I want (which is almost irrelevant) with what my student child wants and in the end: you are the one that has to choose your path in life and I hope that your dad will understand that eventually.  Maybe you need to sit down and talk to him.  And it is OK for your dad to \"brag\" or be proud.   If you stay grounded and modest, its fine.  Maybe your topics could be;  1. Talk about your values (which sounds important to him)  say, here are my values, they are not going to change whether I go to the east or west coast for school but I respect your values and agree with some of them (whatever the case). 2.  If you /we can't afford a private school without aid, at least let's see how much aid we might get.  Sometimes schools, especially ones with $$ will meet your financial needs... so dad; fill out the FAFSA and CSS etc.  3. If you like a liberal arts college show him the graduation rate and employment statistics for that school and explain to him why they are sometimes the better choice for students like yourself.  If you want to pursue a major he doesn't like, explain to him that you could change your mind but if you don't you are ok getting a position in a field that may not pay as much... 4. Have a meeting with your dad and your guidance counselor and try to come up with a college list that works and explain to your dad, that other than ED, you don't have to decide until May 1.  Good luck.",

If your stats are in the right place you can still be admitted.\n\nAnd I want to commend you for staying respectful and understanding your parent's worries.
