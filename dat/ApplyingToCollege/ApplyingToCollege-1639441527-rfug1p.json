Not sure there is much else you can do beyond submitting the best mid-year grade report that you can (if you haven\u2019t already) and letting the admissions committee know of any other major updates to your application. Best of luck!",

          "text": "The academics are definitely challenging. There are definitely ways to mitigate this, like not overloading on credits. A lot of it depends on the professor. Personally, I don\u2019t always have enough time to finish all my work, so half the battle is choosing which part of your studying you want to forego. Ngl, it\u2019s extremely stressful at times, but possible once you figure out how to manage your time. There are quite a few requirements that I\u2019m not a fan of (I\u2019m in Arts & Science), and the grading is at times really arbitrary and unfair. On the plus side, most professors genuinely want to see you succeed and are more than willing to help you out\u2014but you have to seek it out.\n\nSocially, it\u2019s what you make of it. There are quite a few clubs that you can join, both selective and non-selective. I\u2019ve found that it can sometimes be challenging to establish relationships here since a lot of people are very concerned with themselves. Not necessarily a bad thing, although it can be. A lot of wealth and entitlement on campus that can be a shock. There are parties to go to as well if that\u2019s your thing. The surrounding area has a lot of nice scenery and you can find stuff to do but it\u2019s obviously not as action-packed as, say, New York City. Met some amazing people here as well, and everybody you meet has a cool story to tell.",
