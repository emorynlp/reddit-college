  "text": "Hey guys. I am 22 and am going to graduate with a degree in cyber security in about a months time. Before this I bounced around from major to major trying to find my passion and I think I finally found it. I am wanting to get a second degree in computer science and this time from a well respected school. I am above average in academic ability, scored a 33 ACT(not that this matters now), and have had little trouble with challenging courses in biology, math, chemistry, or in cyber security. I haven\u2019t thought about applying to college again until recently, and I am wondering how to go about this since I will already have a degree and will most likely apply as a transfer student. Is it possible for me to get accepted into a good college for cs at my age and academic standing? Any advice for how I should go about this?",

      "text": "IMO, getting a second undergrad isn't worth it.  Either build your own CS skill set outside the realm of higher education or go get a masters degree.  So much of the value of a CS undergrad would already be captured by an undergrad in cyber security anyway.",
