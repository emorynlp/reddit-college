  "title:": "I'm going to take a little different approach from the \"zoom out\" a little posts.",
  "text": "I've been thinking about this for a while. A lot of the other posts say that what University you go to doesn't matter. I wholeheartedly believe that is true, with a caveat. It's all about what person you are. No matter what point in the road you are, how much you've \"fucked up\" academically, been lazy with EC's, not done much, done a lot, have straight A's, are recruited for sports, it all doesn't matter. Sure, you may miss out on one second of pride when you walk into your school on decision day with an Ivy League hoodie, but what matters is that starting from today, or whenever the fuck you come to your senses, you not only work towards your academic dreams, but also your overall vision of success. This goes to everyone, to lazy people whose parents donated a building to Brown, or hard-working people that are in unfortunate circumstances. Every day is an opportunity to work on yourself. Happiness down the road, when we graduate, isn't going to come from having gone to a top 20, or even a top 50, or a top 100, 200, so on. \n\nI'm not saying to let go and relax, or to stop being so up-tight about studying, because that's what is important for a lot of people. Everyone has major faults. Work on those now, so by the time you're 4 years in the future, you can see that as your biggest point of growth. Become your ideal self. Start working out, start taking care of your body, sit up straight, ask that girl out, make amends, drink more water, put your pride aside, stop pushing people away, cut toxic people out of your life, eat healthier, stop being so mean to others, be nice, stop worrying about what other people think of you, be smart with money, help others, put other people before yourselves sometimes, take that one risk even if it comes with a moment of embarrassment. Work harder, WORK ON STOPPING PROCRASTINATING! Find something you love, do a new hobby. It goes on and on, and these are skills that you will find invaluable later in life.\n\nI don't feel like I have the right to say this so much, because I'm also the same age as y'all, but I've resolved to start working on myself because I'm a lazy motherfucker who hates who I am right now and want to work towards my ideal self. \n\nJust an insight, being Nice and giving compliments is a superpower that will get you very far in life. Learn how to do things like that. Take up personal projects, like taking a new risk every day.\n\nRegret is a crazy thing. I have so many regrets in life, and I'm so young. Put your pride aside, learn from people older than you. Think about what regrets you have in your life, and how to fix them. I've hated myself for not fixing my bad habits and mentality for so long, but the blessing is, realizing right now is so much better than realizing it when you're 25 years old and struggling/in a bad mental state, whether you went to an ivy league or an another school. Live life so that in 10 years, you'll have no regrets. AND THAT INCLUDES ACADEMICS! \n\nI hope this serves as motivation to other people. It's not Friday, but this is what I'm most proud of this week. Realizing this. This is my 3rd day of working on myself. I'm taking better care of my health. I'm starting to try to work out. I asked a girl I've liked for a while out, and regardless of how it goes, I'm happy I did it. I'm trying to participate more in class, be less toxic, be more intellectual, become closer to my friends, be a harder worker, plan things, get out more. \n\nJust wanted to share, sorry it's so long. <3",
