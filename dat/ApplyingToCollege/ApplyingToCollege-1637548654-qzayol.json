  "text": "I am torn. I have read on multiple websites that religion is a topic to avoid in a common app essay. I was planning a bit of a different approach though. Rather than talking about the importance of my religion, I was going to talk about how leaving my religion has shaped me. Up until my junior year, I was a devout Christian and even planned to become a pastor. My life took a bit of a 180 and I now am a lesbian atheist. Should I choose a new topic?",

      "text": "Ik I'm gonna get downvoted for this but plz understand my intention:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm gonna be honest, there are *so* many people writing abt these subjects that admission officers are probably gonna be exhausted reading them. Even if they are progressive a ton of people write about their diverse religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, etc that it doesn't feel like it's diverse anymore. idk I'm progressive but when all you hear abt is this stuff it gets tiring even tho I support it. \n\nColleges expect the essay to be about things like this, and I sincerely doubt you're the first to write abt this exact problem, so if you're going to write about diversity write about something different. Instead of writing about religion, write about how your friend with contrasting views has shaped your opinion of the world. That's a part of your identity that's diverse bc not many people can say they're friends with that person. I wrote about how my sister has autism, and how my life has been affected by it, how I was so proud when I taught her to play the recorder, how her lack of a filter has led to some funny and mortifying moments, but how in the end I wouldn't change her at all. That's diverse to me because a small percentage of people have autism, but I'm *not* someone who has it. I'm a sibling of someone who has a special need that most media portrays to be a burden but I'm talking about its positives. \n\nAnd I think that last bit truly matters. Make it positive and passionate. Make it about something or someone that has given you joy or made you see things in a different light, something that most people see as bad but is good. I didn't write a word on that essay that I made up, exaggerated, or sugarcoated. I love my sister and am more proud of her than anyone will know. I could spend days talking about how much of an impact she's had on my life. \n\nGoing back to an example, if you have a friend who challenges your opinions, be it political or otherwise, if you enjoy those debates then write about it. Most people would think \"I don't want someone to disagree with me politically in my friend group bc that could cause drama\" so bring that up and say how it's caused both of us to find common ground, learn to respect the other side, and keep our arguments strong. Most importantly, it taught us how to have a civil debate where both sides can walk away knowing the other side respected them and they learned something new. \n\nEssentially, be a positive contrarian. Challenge the status quo by writing abt something the AOs have never heard of. My mom's friend got into Harvard bc of her essay. The prompt was \"What's something you can't live without?\" She wrote an essay on post-it sticky notes. How many other kids do you think wrote about that? \n\nMake it happy, make it passionate, make it unique",
