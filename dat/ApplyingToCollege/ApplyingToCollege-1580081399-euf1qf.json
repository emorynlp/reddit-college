Little did i know it was the last time id spend with my grandpa. I regret not seeing him. Regret staying at school to make application to another school. See the irony in that. I favored school over my own grandpa. I could have been there at his death bed. When i heard he died, i didnt even cry. I didnt even ride the next airplane to go there. I didnt take the extra mile i just sat and finished my college apps. Now that im done i realized i made a huge mistake. So when i went to my grandpa's house, it was silent seeing his favorite chair where he would sit at the balcony. His smiling face imprinted on a huge tarpaulin that says RIP, at that moment i wept so hard. I wept because I lost time with him. He promised he would go up the stage with me to get my high school diploma. I agree it is super important to enjoy life. It is fragile and precious. The admissions was a huge turning point in my life. It taught me to cherish moments. Life should be enjoyed. \nPS. He didnt want to call me because he knows i was busy. The day before he died. He roamed around the village saying goodbye to most of his friends.",
