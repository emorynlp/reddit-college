  "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm a senior who has now submitted several college applications and will be submitting more, but I had a question about how colleges look at GPA. \n\nI attended two different high schools and the one I currently attend is an American public school that uses a 4.0 GPA scale. But my previous school (international school) didn't use this scale and instead used the IB scale of 0-7, but on the school report, the school states that they don't use GPA.\n\nFor anyone who might have an answer to this, how do colleges look at my grades from this high school that doesn't use GPA? Thanks and good luck to everyone applying to college!",
