  "text": "If any of you guys don't know, a case study is where AO's look at fake students' applications and walk us through the process of how they review them. We could barely get through one student. Everyone was flooding the AO with unrelated questions about all the research they have published, awards they have received, and all their crazy extracurriculars. It felt like they were trying to impress him, thinking wasting everyone else's time would somehow benefit them in the end. It felt extremely selfish of them to shamelessly brag about themselves in a space dedicated to learning more about the admissions process.\n\nIt made me rethink the type of schools I thought I wanted to attend - I am interested in prestigious schools but cannot stand these people who are so obsessed with impressing other people.",

          "text": "I think I know of a few people that had this happen to them. Last year, there was one kid at my school who took 17 AP's and had a 4.5-4.6 GPA, a 35 on the ACT, 3 800's on SAT Subject Tests, and very good extracurriculars. Yet, he got rejected, waitlisted, and deferred from like 29 schools. The only school he ended up getting into was UCSD. I knew that he was an extremely arrogant person, so I figured the only way he got rejected everywhere with those stats is if he came across that way in his essays.",
