  "text": "In the summer after the ninth grade, I took a geometry course at the school I attended so I could get ahead, but I was already planning to transfer school. So, at my new school in 10th grade I took the next math class available. Fast-forward to now, I found out recently that this geometry grade did not transfer over. My counselor and I have been trying to contact my previous school and talking with administrators now on how it can get on my transcript. If not, I am planning to take an online geometry course in the next semester. Should I say this in the additional comments section of academic history on the UC application since I don't have a geometry course or should I just included it in the activities  section where it mentions other courses?",
