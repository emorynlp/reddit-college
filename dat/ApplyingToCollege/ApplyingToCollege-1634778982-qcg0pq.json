  "text": "I don\u2019t know what I want to do, I know where I want to apply (University of Alberta) and I have good enough grades but I don\u2019t know (90s). I have Asian parents and they expect something that will make a lot of money along with stability. Early admission has already started and my mom started nagging about it today and it\u2019s stressing me the hell out\n\nI was thinking about dentistry but it\u2019s so competitive and I don\u2019t know if I could maintain my mental health or grades to achieve it\n\nI know I don\u2019t want anything to do with English because I hate writing English papers, I also dislike the idea of having a 9-5 desk job. I\u2019m also kinda worried about climate change and it\u2019s affects in the future",
