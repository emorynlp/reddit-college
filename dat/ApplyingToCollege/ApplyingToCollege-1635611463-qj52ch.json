  "title:": "is this possible, or even a good idea? cbse pcm student considering to shift to an o-level school",
  "text": "hi everyone. i'm an indian student based in dubai currently studying pcm+cs at an indian school (grade 11)\n\ni'm going to have my term 1 (half-yearly) exams soon, and i'm very very unprepared, like i probably won't get more than 35/50 lol. i decided today that i want to shift to an o-level school, and my parents (surprisingly) agreed, since they know i'm not doing well in school.\n\nmy question is, it is possible to shift right now? i think school begins in september for the UK curriculum, so i've only missed 3 months, and i can probably cover up for that. my grade 9 and 10 grades were good - 91% and 97%, so i don't think academics will be a problem.\n\nalso is this like a really bad idea? will colleges take this as a negative sign? most of my ECs are outside school so that shouldn't be a problem\n\ni don't want to mess up my chances for college, but cbse pcm is really fucking hard lol ;-;",
