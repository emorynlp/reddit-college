  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm in that income bracket where I don't qualify for need-based aid anywhere, but my family also cannot reasonably afford any top schools. All of my friends got into Ivy Leagues, and I am of the same (if not higher) caliber as they are. I didn't even waste my time and money applying to any Ivy Leagues. I am extremely envious right now and am finding it very hard to convince myself that I am making a good decision for my future, even though, fiscally, I am.\n\nHelp?",

      "text": "I am in the same boat. Really look into and find colleges that you like, there are affordable colleges of all sizes. Just because a school is big does not mean it has less opportunities for research or internships, you will probably find yourself with the same future job opportunities as these people that go to Ivys. Remember that wherever you end up, as long as there are options which often exist more at bigger schools, it will work out, you will find your group of friends etc\nGood luck on the search :)",

I worked my ass off in high school but didn\u2019t apply to any ivies and very few top schools, both for financial and mental health reasons. sometimes i feel like i missed an opportunity but I tell myself I\u2019d rather go to a midtier school and make it out with my sanity and bank account intact lol. the more i look at the financial aid and opportunities that would be available to me at a lower ranked school, the more convinced i am. besides, there\u2019s always grad school :D",

      "text": "You are definitely making the best decision. I hate to be *that* person, but it typically doesn't matter whether you go to a T10, T20, T50, or even T100 school - you will all graduate with the same degree (I know, I know, there are some exceptions). The point is, it doesn't really matter where you get your undergrad degree because if you are a truly academically-minded person and hope to pursue further education, grad school is the place to shine.  Until then, you've got 4 years to save up money for the future, enjoy your time in a healthy(ish) college environment, and most of all, gain unique experiences. At this moment, feeling envious of your peers is almost a natural reaction, but I promise that in 10 years it won't matter where everyone got their bachelor's degree (and hey, maybe you'll even be the richer of your high school friends).",

      "text": "For a different perspective than the die hard T10 people.  There is something to be said for being in the top of your class in college at a mid tier school.  Better internship opportunities for top-ranking students,  better class choices (honors usually get 1st choice of classes).  There are kids that thrive when they can try new things and not have the pressure of a T10 school and there are others that need the pressure to succeed.  Which are you?  Be confident in who you are and why you are making the choices you make.  If saving money for MBA or med school is important to you, be proud of your decision.  Can you imagine the stress of having to pay back all that undergraduate loan $ if you had to do that alone?  Financial stress is unbelievably difficult esp while trying to balance a full college load and lab work etc.  GL",

If you are Ivy League material, you will probably stand a chance at substantial merit scholarships at schools like BC, Ohio State, USC, Vandy (tough but possible), and more. These are all incredible schools. Having these massive scholarships and doing well at these schools will put you way ahead of someone doing alright at an Ivy.",
