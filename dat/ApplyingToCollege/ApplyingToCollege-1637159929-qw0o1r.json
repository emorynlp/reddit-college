      "text": "NYU is one of the most expensive schools in the US. Also financial aid isn\u2019t 100% needs based. They also offer very little merit scholarships to International students, and International scholarship at NYU are limited. \n\nTufts is more expensive than NYU, and Lehigh is not to far behind them both. At end of the day they are private colleges so it probably won\u2019t be a big margin regarding how much they give you. financial aid for internationals at privates in general are circumcised.\n\nHowever, you are going for mechanical engineering which is a high paying industry, so if you think you\u2019ll be able to deal with the cost after graduation then just apply to the school that you like the most for ED2. \n\nSimply put, none of those schools are very flexible. In general, but especially for international students.",
