  "text": "Hi all. I\u2019m an Indian student with CBSE board, and I\u2019m not clear with the meaning of terms like A levels, Dual enrolment, extra courses etc. \n\nI believe my 11th and 12th courses are already extremely rigorous. \nI have taken physics, chemistry, maths, english and economics.\n\nNeed I take the above mentioned extra courses etc and if yes, how? I\u2019m going to be applying next year. \n\nAnd do the APs have something to do with this? I\u2019m confused as to whether I should take them.\n\nI\u2019m aiming t10s - so please let me know accordingly! I\u2019ve always heard they want you to have tremendous course rigour, but honestly Indian curriculum is already so hard \ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "A levels are for Cambridge Board, don't worry, you don't need them. As far as dual enrollment is concerned, it's more of a U.S thing where you can enroll at a college in your locality to take simultaneous classes at both school & college. Often times, this helps in transferring credits to the uni you go for your undergrad and you get to graduate faster. APs are Advanced Placements that let you skip a certain part of your coursework in uni and helps you graduate faster as well (I'm not sure if every uni gives credits for APs). Schools in the U.S and a few intl' schools have AP classes whereas as a CBSE student, we don't. But we can take AP exams (for example, AP calc is essentially NCERT calculus; there's AP Physics for both electro & mechanics, etc etc.). AP exams cost a lot in India and hence think before you appear for them. They're graded on a scale of 5 and you can find study material online. Hope this answers your questions! (Don't worry about course rigour, regional admissions officers are well versed with the CBSE curriculum).",
