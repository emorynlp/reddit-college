  "title:": "Question on Early Decision",
  "text": "So I really like UC Hicago and have been putting a lot into my application. I want to apply ED because I haven\u2019t felt sure about a school until UChicago. I\u2019ve done thorough research in programs, opportunities, environment, alumni, outcomes, environment, people, and all of that jazz, so I\u2019m sure. My parents are against ED because they believe anything binding is messed up, and that getting in on a non-binding agreement leaves room for financial-aid negotiation (they don\u2019t understand that negotiations don\u2019t really exist). In general, they do not know, or care, a lot about college admissions, so they\u2019re just going off of their assumptions. How much will applying ED vs RD affect my chances? Is it worth trying to convince them on EDing? \n\nAlso, I have a 3.6uw, but my grades from this semester will be great, so if I do ED, is it just better to to ED2? Is there a difference in the advantages of ED1 v. ED2?",

      "text": "Assuming that you are a domestic student, run UChicago\u2019s NPC. If the number it gives you doesn\u2019t work for your family, then don\u2019t ED. While you can break the ED contract if aid is insufficient, that is based on the college\u2019s NPC calculations, not you or your parents\u2019 comfort level. \n\nAssuming aid isn\u2019t an issue, if UChicago is your absolute top choice, I\u2019d go with ED1 unless there will be something game-changing to show in December.",
