  "text": "So I\u2019ve filled in my activities section truthfully (just to clarify), but as my dad was reviewing it he told me that it might seem a little exaggerated because the numbers seem overstated\u2026 but neither of us know what the \u201cidea\u201d number is\u2026\n\nIdk should I reduce the total number of hours to lesser than I actually did? I don\u2019t want to raise any suspicions regarding the time I spent on my activities \n\nOn average, how long you should you be spending per week?",
