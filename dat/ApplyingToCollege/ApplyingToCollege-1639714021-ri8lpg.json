  "title:": "Does anyone else experience HUGE swings in their confidence in admission??",
  "text": "Coming from a school with a graduating class of under 40 people in an extremely rural area in a super unpopulated state, I feel like my inability to compare myself to other students can lead to cycles of massive ego/confidence inflation and deflation. My academic stats are on par with the standards of T20s, but that\u2019s pretty much where the comparison between me and most of the other students in this sub ends. I\u2019ve got super bizarre ECs that are cool and unique (at least in my eyes), but they don\u2019t demonstrate \u201cexcellence\u201d in a way that a national award or founding a successful charity do. I\u2019ve basically got two ways of looking at this:\n\n1. My ECs are unimpressive on an objective basis in comparison to applicants who are, for example, presidents of multiple clubs or who generally have much more understandable, tangible activities.\n\n2. My ECs are so unexpected and unique that they will help me stand out in the eyes of the admissions officer, outshining an activity like volunteer hours at a generic charity.\n\nThere is no in-between in my mind, and it\u2019s stressing me out. Does anyone else feel this ambiguity in their applications that causes these confidence swings? Any advice?",

      "text": "Yes this is me right now lmao. I will think about the positive stuff and that makes me happy because then I realize that I may have a chance to get accepted into the majority of my colleges but then after a little while, I'll think about the negative parts of my application and start to think that I may not get into any of my colleges including my safeties lmao. I applied to IUB on October 31st and I still haven;t heard from them yet while tons of other students have already heard back. Its freaking me out because I love the school and I will apply to schools that are overal better but I would be happy to go there cause their busienss program is soo good in my opinion. Their acceptance rate is like 80% and I'm scared I won't get in because first of all I haven't heard back yet and I'm scared I may have made a mistake in my application. I have like till January 15th to heard back from them but I can't help but freak out lmao. Honestly, I can't even focus on school or anything else, I'm always watching something on youtube or some anime to distract myself. I am also feeling these confidence swings. Youre not the only one lmao. Also, are your days just going by. Like one week is finishing after the other week and its weird. I'm pretty sure it is because I want to hear back from the colleges that I applied to and since I can't think of anything else, time just flies by. Are you feeling the same thing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Sorry for the rant lol, I just applied to two college and I was still thinking about IUB so I hope I'm not being annoying by ranting a little",

I\u2019m def feeling the time warp too, I just submitted my final assignment for the semester today but it feels like I was just doing midterms. I\u2019m just cherishing the fact that this time next year I will have finished my first semester at college and it will have been awesome. Stay strong and good luck with your apps!!!",
