  "text": "I don\u2019t know who needs to hear this but know that it\u2019s going to be okay and these days will pass. Your future is not determined by a college acceptance or rejection. \nThe reason why I\u2019m writing this is I was talking to a friend and realized that how misleading achievements can be. My class is extraordinarily successful with really high SAT and AP scores. Most people have incredible extracurricular activities such as ranking the first in the World Economic Cups or making a documentary about women rights which was sent to the European Union and got paid by the EU for the documentary. Some people won multiple writing competitions, and created amazing portfolios. But there is also another side to the coin. \nMajority of my classmates are on antidepressants, visiting a psychiatrist and not sleeping at all because of college applications. Last week my friend -who is also a classmate- committed suicide. Those things I listed above might seem great on a cv but they don\u2019t make who you are as a person. They don\u2019t determine your life. These college application processes might be really hard and stressful but those days will pass. You don\u2019t need to attend multiple MUNs or win a competition if that\u2019s going to make you anxious. You don\u2019t need to compare yourself with anyone. This is your youth and know that your joy and will to carry on is the most important thing. \nRegardless of anything, I love you and cherish you. These stressful days will pass and I believe in you.",

      "text": "I am so sorry for your loss This is all so true. Then many of these people get into their \u201ctop dream school\u201d and find themselves more anxious and depressed once they arrive bc the workload is even heavier. Quickly their newest worries become about getting the best internships and jobs. Internships begin to consume their every thought. Next they are on the college Reddit page complaining about how unhappy they are even though they are at their #1 school. They worked incredibly hard for 12 straight years to find themselves at college overwhelmed and not the best anymore bc they are surrounded by the best of the best. Life can turn into a perpetual hamster wheel if you let it. It makes me sad when I read about the universities being unprepared and unhelpful in dealing w the mass amounts of mentally unwell college students. Many blame the top universities for their insane expectations, but I\u2019m convinced many of these students came to the university Un well. It\u2019s good for people like you to remind others that perfect grades and winning endless awards comes with a price for many people. Balance is the key to happiness. Work hard and then get with friends and go for hikes or runs or whatever brings you joy. Go to the party. Skip a lecture and sleep in. Take care of yourself bc life only gets harder.",
