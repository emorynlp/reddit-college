  "text": "My parents aren't millionaires, and we first wanted to apply with financial aid, but because we won't have it ready before the deadline, I'll apply without asking for aid. My parents told me it's going to be really difficult but if the university is worth the price, they\u2019re ready to pay full tuition even if it\u2019s extremely expensive. I\u2019m International major CS btw. So the question is : Is Cornell worth it?",

              "text": "Within CS, I'd say UIUC > Cornell > Purdue reputation wise, but they are all excellent schools for CS and for engineering more broadly.  The feel of the schools is certainly different though - Cornell is a top private university, UIUC and Purdue are both public universities that are especially strong in those particular fields.  \n\nBasically, the general prestige of a school doesn't matter as much in CS as it might in a field like investment banking.  Top public schools in the field (which also would include UW Seattle, Georgia Tech, UC Berkeley, and others) have similar outcomes to excellent private schools.",

This means tuition, fees, room, board, books, travel, etc.\n\nDoes your family have $350,000+ on hand currently?\n\nAlso, if you do not apply for aid at application, you will not be permitted to apply for aid in the future.",

Cornell is good but not top tier or amazing enough to offset financial difficulty.\n\nI'm an international trying to apply (ED) for Cornell as well but the only reason why I'm doing it is cause my father is pretty rich (he makes about 1 million USD per year) and he is willing to pay (cause he likes the idea of an Ivy League school).\n\nHave you considered the needs-blind schools (for Internationals) like Harvard, Amherst, MIT, Yale and Princeton? They're definitely worth it and they also do not discriminate against internationals applying for financial aid (unlike Cornell and most others).",
