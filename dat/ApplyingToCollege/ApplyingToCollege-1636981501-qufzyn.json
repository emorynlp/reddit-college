  "text": "My interviewer reached out to me over whatsapp and asked me for preferable time slots for an interview. He sent me an email containing all the details. Any replies I write to him over mail (both gmail and stanford alum ids) do NOT get delivered to him for some reason. Neither is he replying to my whatsapp messages.\n\nShould I be worried?",
