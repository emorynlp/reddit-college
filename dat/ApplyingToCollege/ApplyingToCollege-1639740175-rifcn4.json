  "text": "I got deferred from Columbia ED, and need to make a definitive RD list. \n\nI have a 35 ACT and 3.95 GPA (unweighted). I take the IB, so all my subjects are IB, and I have a 44/45 predicted. My EC are decent but I don't have any insane spike. I think that I can write good essays as feedback I've received has always been very good.\n\nI am not sure about my major, but am interested in literature and philosophy, although I am considering premed, prelaw and going into consulting/business so as you can see I have really broad range of interests o would probably apply undecided (or literature if the college also offers wide range of courses)\n\nFor the most part, I want to apply to schools most in the north east, although I am open to anywhere, and would like a school with a well rounded program in sciences and especially humanities that is a strong feeder for grad school and competitive jobs. \n\nI know this may be very general but I can answer any other questions you have, and would like your advice on what schools you think I should apply to. \n\nSo far I'm considering:\n\nPrinceton, Yale, UPenn, Cornell, Northwestern, Tufts, Amherst, Boston College and U Michigan.  \n\n(I don't have any safeties because I would only consider attending a T20 school or T50 school with significant aid, as I have alternatives in Europe.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long post, and I would really really appreciate any advice and/or colleges you think I should apply to!!",

      "text": "Unless you're a Michigan resident or think you can win a Stamps scholarship, I'd scratch Michigan.  You won't get my financial aid (if any).  There are merit scholarships below Stamps, but super hard to get.\n\nYou could probably add several more top LACs in the NE if you wanted.  Williams, Swarthmore, Bowdoin, Middlebury, etc.",
