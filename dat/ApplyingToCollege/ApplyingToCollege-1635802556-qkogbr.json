Is not meeting the math requirement an auto reject, or is it a flexible requirement?",

      "text": "I was looking up the exact same thing for a bunch of schools I\u2019m thinking about today lol (also trying to figure out if it\u2019s possible for me to take 2 classes next semester to get that 4th credit or by taking an online class or something) so I can help a bit -\n\nMissouri and all CU campuses state that they want 4 years but they will still consider you if you have only 3. If they accept you (I know this for sure for Colorado and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the same at Mizzou) you can choose your classes like normal but you have to take that makeup math class by the time you graduate - they suggest just getting it out of the way your first semester but you could put it off if you really wanted just as long as you get it completed by the time you graduate",

      "text": "Check each college's admission website for a section typically titled \"high school preparation.\"\n\nSomewhat selective, but not super-selective universities probably do not auto reject. But, realize that you may put yourself at a disadvantage.\n\nIf you have algebra 1, geometry, algebra 2, and precalc, you may be fine, as far as having 4 years of high school math, even if you took one or more during middle school. (Of course, that's not the same thing as being a competitive applicant.)",
