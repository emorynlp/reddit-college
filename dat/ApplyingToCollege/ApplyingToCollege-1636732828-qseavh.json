  "text": "On my Cornell portal it says that audits are conducted to verify applications:\n\n\"Important Note for All Applicants\n\nCornell University requires official documentation as part of the application process. For students who are admitted and enroll, the Undergraduate Admissions Office verifies the authenticity of information submitted as part of the application process for a random sampling of entering students.\"\n\nElsewhere on the website though, they only mention an audit for transcripts:\n\n\"The Undergraduate Admissions Office at Cornell University conducts audits to verify the authenticity of final transcripts for a random sampling of entering first-year students.\"\n\nhttps://admissions.cornell.edu/apply/first-year-applicants\n\nSo, are the audits just for transcripts or for other information as well? Does this mean we should be collecting documentation for proof of our extracurriculars in case we get audited?",
