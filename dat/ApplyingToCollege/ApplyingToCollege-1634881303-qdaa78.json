  "title:": "Is the 1 Year Performing Arts Requirement Even That Enforced?",
  "text": "A significant portion of the people at my school who graduate and go onto UC\u2019s do not do any course in visual performing arts in their four years.\n\nI would estimate that at least 50% of people are not in either band, choir, orchestra, or music theory classes, drama, art, ceramics, film, or media arts at any time in high school so they will not meet the F letter requirement.\n\nAnd they all definitely did not take an AP exam to meet the requirement.\n\nSo I\u2019m curious, how do they get in? Does that mean that this letter requirement isn\u2019t that enforced?",

      "text": "My kid did not take ANY of those classes you listed (band, choir, etc). What he did take was a course in engineering design that met the art requirement per the UC a-g list. Those students in your school may have gotten in via similar, qualified classes. They may have taken a qualifying class at a community college. The \u201cF\u201d in the a-g criteria is absolutely enforced.",
