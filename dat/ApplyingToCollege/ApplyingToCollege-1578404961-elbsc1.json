I got into Stanford EA, and even though I do want to keep my options open to other places, It's really not fair of me to keep the application in if it hurt his chances like that.

No, they're going to proceed as they already had planned.\n\nIt's generous and thoughtful to consider how you can help your friends, but your decision (and your timing) is not going to change their odds.",

But, after doing so my older sister actually informed me that it won't really benefit her much.So it really is a nice gesture but if UMich is giving you more money than Stanford or in anyway you think you'd want it, don't reject the spot so early in the year. If you know you won't chose UMich over Stanford, you can reject it. But, regardless if you end up not choosing it I'm sure in the end it'll pay off to get someone off of the waitlist. That may or may not end up being your friend, the admissions process is very complex.",

Regardless of the deferral pool, having an accurate estimate of how many students we'll have in September is critical for a lot of reasons, including housing and food service availability, the number of English Comp classes we need to offer, etc.  I wish everyone who knew they weren't coming would tell us as soon as they know.\n\nNow, for the deferral thing, it *might* help.  If we were talking about waitlists then yes, for sure it would help.  Depending on why someone was deferred, it may or may not help them specifically.  Let's say they were deferred because the Admissions office wants to see their first semester grades before making a decision.  Assuming the grades are good, there still needs to be space in that major or class for them to go.  If the school still thinks they're at capacity, particularly if it's a very competitive program, they're going to be less likely to offer that person who is currently deferred.  You declining your offer now will help them know what their actual count is going to be in a few months, if only by a little bit.\n\nSorry there's no clear answer on this as it relates to your friend, but the short version is that it absolutely helps everybody if you cancel your apps at the schools you know you won't be attending.",

She always does a good job of explaining exactly what UVA does and does not do as part of the admission process.  Even if you aren't interested in UVA, they're pretty representative of what you can expect at top schools and she provides tons of great information.",

      "text": "A topic like this comes up every year, but usually from someone on a waitlist asking everyone who already got in to decline their spot if they plan on going somewhere else.\n\nThe consensus every year from the AOs is that this will not help anybody. Just hold onto your acceptances, wait until all the info is in, and make your choice by the deadline. After that the schools will start letting people in off of the waitlist. There's no benefit to declining now vs. later.\n\nAnd just to preempt this coming up from people trying to get in from waitlists: please do not ask anyone to decline their acceptance or withdraw their applications before they need to! The only exception to this is if someone got into their top choice under binding early decision. In that case, they should withdraw any pending applications and decline their other acceptances, but even then only if the financial aid package works for them.",
