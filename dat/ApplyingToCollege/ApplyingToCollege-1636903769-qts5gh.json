  "text": "Last friday I sadly lost the student government elections while running as president. I'm very devastated since I was hoping this would be my leadership position. I'm a junior and if I run next year I won't be able to report it next year since I will be applying to ED for some colleges. Which leadership role is well looked upon by colleges that I  could replace student government with?",
