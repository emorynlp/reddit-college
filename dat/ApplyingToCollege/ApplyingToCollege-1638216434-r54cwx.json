At competitive, rigorous high schools that AOs know about, it probably won\u2019t be an issue as long as there are a good number of As on the transcript as well (all As and A- gets you on the high honor roll at my school). \n\nThere are people who will say an A- is a 3.7 GPA. GPA means nothing without context. There\u2019s a reason AOs look at transcripts; GPAs don\u2019t tell the whole story.\n\nI\u2019d say having a mix of As and A-s is better than having mostly As and some Bs but, of course, it depends on the school.\n\nMany schools (including feeders) are also dropping the - and + on grades. So you might want to consider that.",
