      "text": "Best to have a parent help with the NPCs to make sure you are using the correct numbers.\n\nDon't just look at estimated cost. Look closely at the types of aid that make up the package. Federal student loans are typically included and those amounts may be reasonable amounts to borrow. Parent loans not reasonable. Ideally, you want grant/scholarship aid (money you don't have to pay back).\n\nSometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.",
