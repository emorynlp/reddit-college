  "text": "So I'm stupid and JUST noticed that non-California honors level classes don't count as HL on the UC Application. I have about 5 classes that I marked as HL but they don't count as such under UC criteria (and one AP class from 9th grade that wouldn't count either). \n\nSo is there anything I should do or can change? Or would any admissions person realize that they're not actually California-designated honors classes (obviously I put that I'm not from CA on my application) and calculate everything appropriately? I'm so stressed out about this please help will I get rejected because of this?!?$#!",
