  "text": "For people applying to UPenn and requesting financial aid, did you submit your 2020 federal tax returns through the document portal listed on the website? I am doing that but I did not receive a confirmation email, so I did the fax but it said the fax did not go through. The deadline for financial aid shit is TODAY 11:59 and I am not sure if my docs went through.",
