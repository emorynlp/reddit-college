      "text": "I\u2019m in a similar boat. My school only offers math up to BC which I took last year. Taking EM and Mechanics this year to compensate as well. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really a big deal considering the only other math courses available would have been relatively trivial. As long as you had a solid grade in your math course and maybe some good math scores on standardized tests you should actually look more impressive for completing your schools math curriculum a year earlier.",
