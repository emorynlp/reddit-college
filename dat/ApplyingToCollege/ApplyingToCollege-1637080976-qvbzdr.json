  "text": "So I am technically homeschooled but I take/have taken most of my highschool classes at basically an unofficial school campus with like a counselor and real teachers. My counselor filled out the report and submitted a transcript that included all the classes I\u2019ve taken and the grades I\u2019ve gotten, even just the ones I\u2019ve done at home. \n\nHowever, after I submitted my application on Sunday, almost every school I applied to is saying I need to submit additional transcripts, some even while acknowledging the one I have submitted. One school that was doing this corrected itself but the others have not. \n\nIt\u2019s basically saying\n\u201cYes we have received [unofficial school name] transcript but we need your homeschool transcript\u201d even though they\u2019re the same thing. (I listed myself as homeschooled on the common app like I was told to)\nSome schools are even like \u201cwe need a [My Name] transcript.\u201d\n\nThis is a really unique situation I\u2019m guessing so I don\u2019t expect y\u2019all to have the answers but I\u2019m very stressed about it and my counselor says she\u2019s never seen this happen before",

              "text": "I understand. The transcript needs to be official. My guess is that the colleges are expecting the official homeschool transcript to come from your homeschool, not an unaccredited (subcontracted) third party. (This could be as simple as some sort of signed and sealed paper attaching the other transcript.)\n\nI would strongly encourage you to ask in the forum I linked, as those folks will help you sort out what you need to do, exactly, to satisfy the colleges.",
