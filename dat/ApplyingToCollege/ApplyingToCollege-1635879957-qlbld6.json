  "text": "I'm on Pacific Standard Time and submitted my application at 10 pm, which is 1 am Eastern Standard Time (what UMich uses). Now when I look at my common app dashboard, under UMich it says \"application - submitted\" but a friend of mine who submitted earlier has his dashboard saying \"application - downloaded by college.\" Did I miss the EA deadline and if so, is there anything I can do to fix it?",

      "text": "If you submitted by 9:59 pacific (that was your deadline, yes?), you should be fine. For most colleges, the deadline is 11:59 your local time zone. For others, it's in the college's time zone. I don't know about U Mich's deadline specifically.\n\n(Common App time stamps are always eastern time. Colleges download overnight the batch of everything that was submitted before midnight eastern; the download date will be after midnight eastern. And if you submit on time for your time zone, but after midnight eastern, the download might not occur until the following overnight, >24 hrs later - still fine!)",

You are not held to a deadline for the school to download it.\n\nIirc, Michigan did lag in downloading and providing a portal link for my daughter. It took 5 days to receive the link, second longest of the 9 to which she aplied.",
