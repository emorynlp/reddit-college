  "text": "How do colleges not accept by major? E.g. Brown doesn\u2019t admit by major but it\u2019s very popular for computer science. If I get into the school and all of the required classes for a computer science degree are full, am I just outta luck and have to give up my intended major, or do I not understand the system?  What if a school accepts three thousand computer science majors and four English majors by luck fo the draw?",

      "text": "Schools have plenty of experience in this regard, and know how many classes/sections to offer to accommodate the actual demand for majors/courses. (Brown has been around for 250 years; next fall won\u2019t be their first rodeo.)\n\nPS - do note that just because a school does not accept by major does not mean there won\u2019t be prerequisite courses/grades/gpa needed in order to actually declare a certain major.",
