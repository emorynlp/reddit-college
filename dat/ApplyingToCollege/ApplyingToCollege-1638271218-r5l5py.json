  "text": "Hi guys\n\nIn one of my PIQ's, I said \"these lectures learned about band theory .....\" instead of \"I learned about...\" in a sentence, making  it kind of meaningless . My other essays and academics are pretty good((1550+ SAT + 3A\\*1A(UK A-Levels)). \n\nIs there any way I can fix this, if not how big of a deal will it be?",
