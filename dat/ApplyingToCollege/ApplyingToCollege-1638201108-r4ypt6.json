The interviewer will most likely say something like, \u201ctell me more about yourself.\u201d When you do that try to omit some of the useless information, and cut to the chase with your journey with creative writing. Try to sound enthusiastic about creative writing as well, and talk about the points that really motivated you during your journey.",
