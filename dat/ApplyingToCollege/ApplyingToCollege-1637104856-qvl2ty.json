  "text": "Is there a major difference in how people view ivies of different calibers such as Harvard vs Columbia or Dartmouth vs Princeton in regards to investment banking is it just a matter of working harder in lower ivy leagues to secure top jobs. Same question for entrepreneurial engagement and also tech with regards to tiers of institutions",

      "text": "I've taught both kids of a top-3 investment bank CEO, and I asked him exactly this out of curiosity.\n\nHis answer was \"absolutely not\". His interviews for any meaningful position consisted of either playing chess or taking a Math Lv. 2 SAT-II while taking the verbal interview, but he also said that there were steps of the hiring process that occurred before he saw any resumes.\n\nAll of these banks operate VERY differently in terms of hiring practices, though.",

He said that gardening indicates a methodical, careful approach alongside careful planning, and those were the traits that numbers and pedigree can't articulate on their own.\n\nOh, and by \"absolutely not,\" I mean that he genuinely didn't care where his bankers went to college. He had people without college degrees, people with Ivy diplomas, and everything in between.",

I can't speak for the other Ivy schools but there are a ton of kids gunning for IB at Cornell and ton of them get jobs and internships every year. \n\nIn terms of tech/entrepreneurship degrees don't matter as much, so program strength matters more. However all of the Ivys should be good for this, although there are varying levels of entrepreneurship communities/ tech communities at each school.",

      "text": "Economics, tech, and entrepreneurship are very different fields. \n\nElitism exists within finance \u2014 HYP have the best alumni networks, on-campus recruitment, and \u201cwow factor\u201d that major financial firms tend to care about. Nevertheless, Cornell places into every single well-known investment bank, every single year. It is a full target, and (barring some crazy backdoor connection) it is unlikely that a student would place from HYP but not Cornell. Networking is important regardless of the school you attend, and will be fruitful (if you do it correctly) from every elite school in the northeast. I\u2019d argue there\u2019s a slight drop-off beyond Ivies/NYU/Duke/MIT/Stanford, but students continue to place from every renowned institution. \n\nIn tech, you\u2019ll be better off looking at Berkeley/Caltech/Harvey Mudd/CMU/MIT than any of the aforementioned schools, but there\u2019s no difference between Cornell/Columbia and HYP. Truthfully, tech isn\u2019t that elitist.\n\nNot sure why school would matter for entrepreneurship.",
