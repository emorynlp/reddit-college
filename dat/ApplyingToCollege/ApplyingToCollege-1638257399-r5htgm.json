  "title:": "Confused about reporting AP scores on the UC apps",
  "text": "Hello!  Hope everyone is doing well!\n\nDo you need to report all scores?  I got a 2, and I initially didn\u2019t want to report it because it reflects really badly on the rest of my app, but my counselor said to be honest and report it.\n\nIdk I think I\u2019m kinda worried if I do get accepted and have to send in the rest of my scores, the college might rescind my offer.  I\u2019m kind teetering on a C in one of my classes rn and that\u2019s a big difference from previous years, so I\u2019m freaking out now.\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "You can self-report the scores you want to report. It's not dishonest to not report a score if you're allowed to select which scores you report. Also, if you're accepted, they're not going to rescind your acceptance for failing one AP exam. \n\nThey most likely won't rescind for one C either, but try to get it up to a B if you want to be completely safe. You definitely won't be rescinded for a B.",

However, know that most schools consider senior mid-year grades when evaluating applicants in regular decision, and a significant decrease in the quality of your grades from previous years could adversely affect your application. 1 or 2 Bs most likely won't be a problem, but try your best to keep your grades up.",
