  "text": "I have taken the SAT three times so far, and my most recent score (as of today) is a 1490 (780 RW/710 math). However, I really want to get into a school like Harvard, Brown, Hopkins, etc., which need at least a 1500-1520. I'm not sure if I should keep trying to improve my math score (I have always struggled with the math section) or just switch to ACT. I am a junior but it makes me sad that some of my friends got 1540s and super high scores like that on barely their second try, while I can't even reach that threshold after studying so hard and for such a long time (since sophomore year). I've exhausted all of the resources that I have access to. I used Khan, QAS, UWorld, YouTube channels, all of the College Board practice tests, etc. I even made a log with all of the mistakes I made and how I can improve. I just feel so tired and frustrated. I don't understand why I just can't do better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsorry for the rant :( please help i don't know what to do",

      "text": "It's not a hard cutoff, and a difference of that many points isn't really that big of an issue. 1490 is an excellent score, and you should feel proud about it! I've not really met anybody from college who got in because they had 100 more points on the SAT over someone else; sure, high scores help, but past 1490 it's really no big deal.",

      "text": "a 1490 is really good, especially for a junior! At this point in my junior year, I hadn\u2019t even sat for the SAT, and I had a very mediocre PSAT score, even after studying all summer. I literally had a 1360 SAT in the spring, and I only broke the 1500 barrier on the august test. You\u2019ve 100% got this, especially if you keep taking a lot of time to focus on what you\u2019re doing wrong (write down why you got a problem wrong and how you can prevent that mistake in the future!). With a 1490, a 1500+ is literally within the margin of error for you. \n\n Also, it doesn\u2019t help to compare yourself to other people, especially when it comes to something as arbitrary as standardized testing. Literally one of my closest friends scored a 1600 (literally 0 questions wrong \ud83e\udd20) on her first sitting without studying, and I worked my butt off for a 1520 (which I personally am really proud of): it would be unproductive to compare myself to her.",

      "text": "I get test fatigue, but you're really only a junior! Chill for a bit seriously. I was kinda in your situation (except the Math and r/W were reversed), what helped me was going to a tutoring center, not necessarily for the tutoring per se but for their resources. The place I went to in my area had a great book of 500-600 problems broken down by topic. What's usually helpful is to break down what you miss. Do you struggle with algebra, or is it trig, etc. Maybe go back to your practice tests and tally up what sections you missed the most from. \n\nSAT math is about practice and repetition. AFAIK, there aren't usually \"really difficult\" questions;  getting a good math score is usually about doing good clean math without making any mistakes along the way. Fill gaps in your understanding, then hit the books. The more you practice you WILL get better. Maybe set aside an hour 3-5 times a week for this (that is if you want to take the December SAT administration). \n\nAs for my situation, I was the opposite (kinda) so I applied this idea to grammar and EBRW. Basically went through two books of the \"hardest problem set\" in a month or two. Voila, 770. you can def do it dw!",
