  "text": "I'm an international student pursuing the U.S. high school diploma in an international school outside the U.S. I'm applying to many selective U.S. universities and was just wondering: does having no APs disadvantage me? My school doesn't offer AP courses or tests. Only few schools actually do so where I live. There are also no honours classes or college-level classes offered either. I have achieved a high SAT score and SAT Subject Test scores, but I am just kind of worried about having no APs.",

      "text": "\"prestigious\" schools typically have essays as a requirement of application.\n\nFrankly, these schools have no idea if your school offers AP classes or not, and not having advanced and college prep classes on your transcript, especially in English where many universities expect that you've read a great many English novels before you enter their campuses, is going to be a barrier to you being accepted.\n\nThe Essay section is where you explain these things.  Hopefully you have as much extra curricular activity as possible, and you've advanced to the highest math and science classes (calculus and physics, I'm guessing) that your school offers.\n\nIt will be an uphill battle without these classes, but ab excellent essay can be the equalizer.\n\nGood luck.",
