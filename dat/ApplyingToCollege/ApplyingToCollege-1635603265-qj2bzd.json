  "title:": "How to write my activities",
  "text": "Hello there! \n\nCouple of questions regarding my activities section: \n\n1. For the position / leadership description of an internship, do I just write \u2018intern\u2019.\n2. For my internship I would like to emphasize that I was the only intern as I believe it would sound more impressive, how do I formulate this? \n3. How could I explain having taking mandarin lessons outside of school? - e.g independent mandarin studies? \n4. I\u2019ve won an award which could be beneficial to answer in the honors section, however I do not have a certification. What\u2019s the move? \n\nThanks in advance!",
