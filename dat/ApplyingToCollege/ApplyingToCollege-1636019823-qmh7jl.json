We gonna pretend CMU/Berkeley don't exist?\n\nStatistically, at least for most of the FAANG companies, number 1 hire is Stanford, number 2 is CMU, number 3 (I think) is MIT, but there are tons of university that they hire from.\n\nI have yet to meet a Stanford graduate myself and only a handful of MIT graduates. Most people I met are from CMU, Berkeley, Penn, Cornell, Yale, UT Austin, Georgia Tech, University of Rochester, etc. Hardly consider \"domination\". This is unlike finance, which exclusively hires from top universities.",
