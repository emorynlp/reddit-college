  "title:": "How do I work on college-apps after losing my dad?",
  "text": "Hi guys. I hope this doesn\u2019t come off as really dramatic, and I am NOT trying to get attention. My dad died suddenly yesterday, and I am mentally, emotionally and physically destroyed right now. I can\u2019t even think about what I am supposed to do in the next five minutes, and I am terrified to go into my house right now and not see him there. I have been working on college apps non stop for the past few months, most of them with my dad\u2019s guidance. I still have to work on a good amount before I can send them in. I have an online interview for one of my top schools tomorrow morning. I also am taking a heavy course load in my classes, but thinking about doing the work right now is too much. How the heck should I wake up and move on with my own life when I can\u2019t even get out of bed???? Does anyone have any advice??? Literally anything will help, because I have no idea what to do. Thank you \ud83d\udc9b\n\nEdit: I called and cancelled the interview, and I have been resting, spending time with my family for these past couple of days. I can not thank you all enough for your kind words and the surplus of advice you\u2019ve sent my way. I am beyond grateful, and I know I will get through this. Truly, thank you guys.",

You're not being dramatic at all, you're just starting to go through the normal grieving process.\n\nLike others here are saying, please make sure you priorities you and your family's mental and emotional health right now. Sure college and school is important, but not by any means more important then these kinds of happenings. Your health comes first.\n\nIf you need to take a few days (or even longer) away from school stuff, then do that. I would also echo what others are saying and contact your school counselor. Hopefully they can help in contacting teachers and/or college counselors about your situation, so they know you're not going to be coming to school for a while. Also, just let the college know about your situation, and ask to reschedule. If they have any heart, they'll be more than accommodating to your situation.\n\nAgain, I'm very sorry you're going through this. I hope that you're going to be able to find peace, and I know you'll go on to make your Dad proud!",

      "text": "Hey ... really really really sorry to hear that you have to go through this. Please take a break if you need to .. please leave apps if you need too; your mental health comes first! Please tell colleges if you need more time too.  \n\nAlso, make sure to find someone to vent too -- whether that be a therapist or a trusted adult. This is understandably a very very hard time for you, so make sure to get emotional support -- please don't feel the need to carry the weight all by yourself!\n\nI know it seems like everything is crumbling down right now but you will be okay. Breathe, do something you enjoy, and try your best to push through. It will get hard, yes, and you are juggling a lot, yes, but time will heal. Remember, please recheck your mental state every so often and don't feel pressured to do everything. \n\nGive yourself time and lots of love. You are amazing for being able to push through all of this. I hope everything gets better and I hope I was able to help! My pms are always open if you want to talk! Cheers!",

When you\u2019re ready to take that first step, you\u2019ll know. It will be extremely hard at first, but once you start it will get easier each time. You\u2019re in my thought. Goodluck!",

      "text": "Hello, I want to simply say that I am so so sorry. I cannot begin to imagine the heartbreak you are suffering from. It is crucial that you take time to grieve properly now, rather than accumulate pain that will hurt you much worse in the long run. I beg you to ask your interviewer for a different date, given your circumstances- and I have faith that they will be beyond understanding. Please take time for yourself. Understand that your time spent with your father is time that you will always cherish and has provided you will year of memories you may be very grateful for; conversely, understand that it is completely normal for you to feel devastated and that it only goes to show how much he impacted you. Your college applications and admissions have nothing to do with your relationship with him- then or now. He is so beyond proud of you for being his child, and nothing will ever diminish that pride. Again, I\u2019m so sorry for everything you are going through right now. He loves you. I love you, feel free to pm me if you need to talk.",
