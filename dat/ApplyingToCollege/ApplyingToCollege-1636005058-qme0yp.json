  "text": "Is there any place where I can look for scholarships as the LAC (Latin American-Caribbean)? Also, does anyone know if there is any scholarship for Latin American students apart from the one mentioned before? I'm interested in applying to UCs, but as there is no financial aid for international, I was wondering if there is any scholarship.\n\nThanks in advance!",
