  "text": "My honours are mostly of my junior high. The last nation level award I got was in my 8th grade, because in 9th-10th grades I really only focused on my studies for my board exams. Same goes for my 11th-12th. So most of my activities were just school level, like all the school based activities. So how should I mention my honours from before my high school, or should I just not mention them all together?",
