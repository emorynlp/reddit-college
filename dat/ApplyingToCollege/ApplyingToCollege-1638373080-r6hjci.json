  "text": "I\u2019m having a crisis and feel like I\u2019m not applying to the right schools lol. Please suggest some!\n\nLocation: Suburban/Urban. I wouldn't mind being in a more rural area, but I want to have a city to go to and lots of things to do nearby. The big thing is I really want a distinct campus, something like Harvard.\n\nRegion: I've been looking at primarily northeastern schools, some mid-Atlantic or West coast. I'm from Texas and want to go far away. Don't mind any weather in particular, but I am tired of the heat. \n\nMajor: Political science. I want to double major in history, public policy, or something along those lines.\n\nCurriculum: ?\n\nSize: Small-Medium. I come from a class of 46 so I think a larger school would kill me. I don't mind a slightly larger school if it feels close-knit.\n\nCosts: EFC is under 1000. I need as close to a full ride as I can get, but I could probably pay 5-10,000 per year if necessary. 100% need met colleges would be best.\n\nOther: I want professors to be focused on teaching. Small class sizes and minimal teaching by TAs. I want a relationship with my professors so I can be held accountable.\n\nSchool spirit is really important to me -- I want the people around me to actually like the college we go to. Not a huge sports fan but I do want to go to games. I'm not great but I do want to try out for cheerleading.\n\nStats: 4.0 UW\n1340 SAT\n18 Dual Credit Hours\nClass President, NHS VP, Choir, Cheer\n\nthank you!!! :-)",

What schools are on your list so far??",
