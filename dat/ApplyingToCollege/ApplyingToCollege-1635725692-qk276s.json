  "text": "what's goin on y'all, hope everyone's having a good evening.  i'm almost done with my common app, but before i submit it, i wanted to know what y'alls take is on including future/upcoming activities in the activities section.  i'm starting a hospital internship in january, and i was wondering if it would be okay to include that as an activity, as long as i make it very clear that i haven't started it yet, but will have started far before the school year is over.  thanks for reading, i appreciate it a lot",
