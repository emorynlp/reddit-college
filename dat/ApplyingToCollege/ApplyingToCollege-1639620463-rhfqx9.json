  "text": "As a national merit semifinalist I have gotten emails from a bunch of school highlighting how much money they would give me. But recently a big state school that had offered me a 200k+ scholarship for my status emailed me about getting a VIP tour. The thing is that this school is not exactly close by and I do not really want to pay for plane tickets to go see a school I am not completely sure I am applying to. So my question is that would it be reasonable to ask the admission office to see if they would cover the cost of transportation and a hotel if I were to go visit their school in the near future? Its not like I am trying to get a free vacation, because for all I know I could really enjoy the campus and the vibe there. I mean what is a 200 dollar plane ticket and a couple nights in a hotel in comparison to the money they are already offering me.",

But I have had other schools send emails about reimbursing half the cost of travel for a tour if you apply, then the other half if you attend. Maybe they would agree to cover it on the condition that I do decide to apply afterwards.",
