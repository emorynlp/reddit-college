  "text": "Or as u/pinkblush99 put it, this can also be used as the \u201cOutrage Thread\u201d.\n\nThe UCs and Cal States are experiencing some outages with their application systems. Here\u2019s your place to ask questions, discuss, or vent about it.\n\nAccording to a [tweet](https://twitter.com/calstate/status/1465531594840576003?s=20) from the CSU system, you should contact applicant support if you\u2019re having trouble submitting your application.\n\n~~At the time of this posting, the UCs have not made a statement about their application system\u2019s downtime.~~\n\nThe UCs have [tweeted](https://twitter.com/UC_Apply/status/1465549532989558785?s=20). Do not resubmit your payment. Wait 2-3 days before trying again. Submitting a late payment will not affect your application. \n\n**Edit:** The UCs have [extended their deadline](https://twitter.com/uc_apply/status/1465740500980228098?s=21) to December 1st 11:59 PM PT. However, today (November 30th) is the **last** day to start your application. They will not be accepting applications that are started on December 1st.\n\n**Edit 2:** The Cal States have also [extended their deadline](https://twitter.com/calstate/status/1465825847600816133?s=21) to December 1st 11:59 PM PT for some (but not all) schools. This includes Fullerton, Long Beach, and San Luis Obispo. Fresno, LA, San Diego, Pomona, and San Jose have all extended until December 15th 11:59 PM PT",

Ugh.\n\nFirst, be aware that the last time something like this happened, they extended the deadline by a week.\n\nSecond, I STRONGLY recommend to everyone that you click save and continue after EVERY entry, and keep local/gdoc backups of literally every single entry that's not just a word or two.\n\nFinally, if you experience problems and receive an error screen, make sure to take a screenshot that includes a date/time somewhere and keep it locally for documentation purposes. \n\nOne thing I've noticed is that a lot of screens are simply taking a long time to load. Try not to click the reload/stop button in your browser and let it figure out the internet, even if it takes a while.\n\nIf you do all of that, this should just end up being a minor annoyance at worst. Good luck, everyone!",

Try to let things settle for at least 15-30 seconds between each click, and only reload if the stop button in your browser has automatically changed to reload.\n\nDon't panic! If you keep screenshots of any errors as I suggested above, you'll have a paper (well, binary) trail to fall back on if needed. And remember that the UC people are pretty accommodating in general when stuff like this happens.\n\nThat said, it'll likely be smoother in the morning :).",

The answer I got was \"we are working on it but do not know when it will be back up\" and that \"We do not have a relationship with the campuses so we can't ask them to extend deadlines because of our issues. It's up to them.\" \n\nMy student and I were able to finish her applications with much patience and many repeated actions, but the final submit page isn't loading at all. I had her take a photo of the completed tiles (which take about 6-8 minutes to populate on the otherwise blank page) and a video of how the submit tab just loads a blank page, but there's not much else to do today but hope they extend.",

Literally everything I tried before calling. She said she would email me back once it's fixed but I could only wait so long before I used the live chat 'help'. Guy just said, we will email you.\n\nI tried looking up what that code means but I can't exactly hack my application to put in my stupid classes ;-;\n\nI know the deadline finally got extended for CSU's but I am afraid my problem wont be fixed by tmrw. The most frustrating part is that it's the very last thing on my app and it loads just fine (after pressing refresh 30 times).\n\nI want to burn my laptop but all I can do is whisper half-crazed bribes to my camera for the nice mr. NSA man while I rock back and forth checking my email.\n\nI've only seen one other person say anything about this weird message but I just wanna apply to big kid school :/",
