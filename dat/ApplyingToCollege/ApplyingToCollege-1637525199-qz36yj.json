  "text": "I am planning on submitting my application for Vanderbilt in the coming days and I\u2019m conflicted on which of my essays to put where. I have a really strong one about a unique experience which would fit great with both the application supplemental and one of the scholarships. Problem is I\u2019m not sure if I should put it in the scholarship or the application. Maybe I could even put it in both?",

              "text": "No. I think what happens is that you first have to be admitted  solely based on your normal application.  After that, before you receive your decision, the Admissions office will check from the admit pile to see who they can award scholarships. That's where your scholarship application comes in. But then again, the process is probably different for each school so this might not be the case for Vanderbilt. One thing I'm certain of is that a scholarship application does not increase your admission chances.",

When I visited and talked to students there, I heard that they tend to pick kids who have a clear vision of what they want to do in the future. This matched well with my application \u2014 my CV essay was mostly about my academic and professional goals. Best of luck to you!",
