  "text": "So there are some universities in my Common App which require mid-year transcript while others don't.\n\nMy question is will the universities that don't *require* the mid-year transcripts not receive my mid-year transcript, or will they still receive it. Is it like one of those things where they say it's not *required* but if you do submit it, then they'll still take that into consideration?",
