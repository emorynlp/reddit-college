  "title:": "English Waiver Request Letter",
  "text": "I am an international student who lives in a native English-speaking country. However, the university does not consider my country as one and asked me to submit a formal statement to waive the English Proficiency Exam Requirement. I'm not too sure who can write this.  My school counsellor told me to ask my English teacher for one but when I searched in Google it seems that it is the student who writes one.  \n\n\nI also applied early action to this university and they won't review my application until all requirements are set. It have been one week since I contacted the school about the requirement. Will I still be considered as an early action applicant and get an early response?\n\nIf anyone can help with my situation, I appreciate it.",

      "text": "i would suggest calling the school directly, which is what i did for uw-madison -- you'll get a faster response that way.\n\n>I'm not too sure who can write this. My school counsellor told me to ask my English teacher for one but when I searched in Google it seems that it is the student who writes one.\n\nnot too sure about this but my counselor wrote one for me, like a formal letter with the school's letterhead proclaiming that we were a school which taught in english and therefore waiving the requirement etc, etc.\n\n>It have been one week since I contacted the school about the requirement. Will I still be considered as an early action applicant and get an early response?\n\nagain, this is something that only the specific school would know, so CALL THEM. the admissions office is v helpful and you won't have to wait 3 days for a response to an email! although i wouldn't hold out too much hope being still considered for EA since it's already been \\~1 month since the EA deadline.\n\nhope this helps and good luck!",
