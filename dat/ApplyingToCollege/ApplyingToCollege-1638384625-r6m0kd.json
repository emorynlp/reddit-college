  "text": "i know it\u2019s shitpost wednesday, so just in case, i want to clarify that i\u2019m being completely serious.\n\nbasically, i learned that toby fox went to northeastern, so that got me to research the school and eventually i decided to apply because i liked the school. in the contacts section of their application they ask how i learned about their school, and i\u2019m not sure if i should be honest and let them know that undertale and deltarune accidentally served as free advertisement for them. i\u2019m afraid that they\u2019d think i\u2019m only applying because tony went or something, especially \u2018cause there\u2019s no supplements for me to show what i actually like about northeastern. it\u2019s an optional section, so i\u2019ll likely just leave it blank, but i thought i\u2019d ask here anyways. thanks for any help :)",
