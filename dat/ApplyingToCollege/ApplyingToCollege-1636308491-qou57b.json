  "text": "I'd applied for CSS Profile waiver at a college and they promptly offered me a voucher code for the same. There's been a slight change in my plans and I'm now planning on applying at another university through ED. Is it possible to use the voucher for waiving CSS Profile application fee for a college that didn't offer the voucher? Would the former college know that I kinda cheated on them with the voucher? Would there be any repercussions with regard to my application if I do so?",
