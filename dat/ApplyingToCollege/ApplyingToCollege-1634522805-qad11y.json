  "text": "Ok so I\u2019m currently a senior and I live in Texas, I want to major in graphic design but there are only 2 good schools for it which sucks. I\u2019ve found a lot of options out of state, but Covid messed up our process to get our papers/citizenship. We already have an interview set up and with everything still on hiatus, it will definitely take sometime. I need to start applying, lowkey starting to get stressed bc I know that the only school I might be able to get into is 1 out of the 2 schools. Anyways, my question is what should I do? I know I need to wait but do you still it\u2019s smarter to wait for regular admissions to start applying? \ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "So not a citizen or permanent resident yet, but think you might be by the RD date?  I would wait for any school that isn't an absolute safety.  \n\nIf you have schools that you are considering that you would be in for sure (like an ASU with automatic admissions standards), I might go ahead and apply now.  Talk to their financial aid office, but they should be able to update any aid/scholarships once your status changes and you can submit a FAFSA.\n\nHopefully things come through for you in a timely manner.  If they don't, this is the kind of situation where a gap year isn't the worst thing in the world.",
