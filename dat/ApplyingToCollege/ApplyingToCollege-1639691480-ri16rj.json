      "text": "Keep your thoughts on your career path and goal. There are always multiple paths to achieving what you want to achieve. Where you want to attend college isn\u2019t a goal so much as it\u2019s one of many vehicles that can help you reach your goal. If you want to become a doctor, you don\u2019t have to go to Johns Hopkins to become one. \n\nBy focusing on your goal, you quickly learn to adapt and overcome the various obstacles and that in itself illuminates the path to achievement. \n\nIt\u2019s not lip service to say that where you go is less important than what you do when you get there. It\u2019s a fundamental truth.",
