  "text": "Alright so I wrote this super good research paper for my Cambridge global perspective course and it's probably some of my best writing and research. It is however 2095 words and 9 pages at 12 point double space. Is it better to settle for a slightly worse option that's shorter or is it okay to submit a longer paper? I also have an interesting multi-genre research paper from my Cambridge english lang class which is around 5 pages, not sure if that's any better.",

      "text": "Gonna go off from the other opinions here\u2014 if it\u2019s your best work\u2014 I\u2019d definitely submit. Single space that shit to get it down to 6 something pages. If it\u2019s over two pages I\u2019m guessing they\u2019d just read the first two like they\u2019re doing for everyone else, and ignore the rest (which is good or bad, depending on what you wrote)",
