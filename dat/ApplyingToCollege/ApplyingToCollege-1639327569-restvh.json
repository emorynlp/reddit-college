  "text": "I\u2019m currently a senior living in New York and my GPA is a 89 weighted on a 4 scale idk but probably something like 3.5, 1210 SAT, one EC(volunteering). Which colleges should I put as a reach? I feel like I can write a really solid college essay so I wanna try for some reaches because you never really know. Im also planning to go as a Psych Major.",

      "text": "These are not low stats. As far as your SAT, be strategic about whether you submit them or not, depending on how your scores compare to the published average score for admitted students at each college where you\u2019re applying - assuming the colleges are test optional, which most are. And it\u2019s not all or nothing. You might decide to submit your SAT to some colleges but not to others.",
