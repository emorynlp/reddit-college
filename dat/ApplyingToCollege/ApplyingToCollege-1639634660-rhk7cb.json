  "text": "I\u2019m kinda tempted to apply rolling admissions to a safety rn just so I can have a win because getting deferred sucks and I don\u2019t want to have to wait until the end of March to get acceptances. \n\nI\u2019m starting to feel like nothing I do actually gets me anywhere. Everything that I\u2019ve applied to recently\u2014a math camp in the summer, youngarts, Yale\u2014didn\u2019t work out and it\u2019s making me feel like nothing will. \nI know that I\u2019m a great student and I have a great portfolio, and I\u2019ve put a ton of work into both of those things, but it feels like nothing is coming out of it. \n\nI get that youngarts is a very selective program and Yale is a very selective school, but idk it just feels like shit for some reason. Like I was hoping that at least one of them would work out and now that neither of them did I just feel like a huge failure and like I\u2019ll never be good enough for anything that I want to get into. \n\nAnyway I wish I could just forget about colleges until the end of March but I can\u2019t and it just sucks.",
