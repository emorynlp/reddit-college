  "title:": "Applying to Canadian universities advice? Will I get in University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, and Simon Fraser",
  "text": "I'm an international student, and I was wondering if it's safe to only apply to those universities above or should I get a safety, and if I get a safety, what safety do you recommend? I'm very worried of getting into college and I always feel like I won't get in and all that ahhahha. My grade 11 and 10 GPAs are 4.0 if that helps, but I barely have any extracurriculars, maybe 3-4 only but they aren't heavy, if that makes sense? I just need advice and all that, thank you.",
