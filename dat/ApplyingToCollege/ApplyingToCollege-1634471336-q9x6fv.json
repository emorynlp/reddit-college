  "title:": "Question about the additional info section",
  "text": "So in the additional info section on the common app, I was planning to include my resume just like most do, but I read some advice online that including a resume which is very similar to the activities section might be redundant, and in my case, most of the info in my resume has already been covered in others parts of the common app, only with few more lines of description and 2-3 other ECs which are not covered in 10 available spots (with obviously proper resume formatting as well)\n\n**Question:** should I include the whole resume, or only write about the extra 2-3 ECs with bullet descriptions to fill the additional info section?\n\nWould love some advice regarding this \n\nthank you!",
