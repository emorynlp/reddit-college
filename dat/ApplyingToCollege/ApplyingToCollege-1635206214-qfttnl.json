  "text": "It is the BRUNT of application season right now and I know DAMN WELL that our teachers know that. Regardless, they insist on giving me ungodly amount of work. Do they realize that if each gives me an hour-hour and a half a night, that it tends to build up. I know we\u2019re block scheduled and that I only have 4 classes a day, but that\u2019s still around 6 hours of homework on top of my EC\u2019s. I just want to do my scholarship applications and finish my apps. I am aware that I take rigorous classes and that I am expected to accomplish at a college level, but shouldn\u2019t they just let us focus on the important matters?",

You are completely justified in feeling overworked and frustrated during this time when you're trying, at the same time, to put together college applications and complete all your homework every day.\n\nYour teachers might have to hew to a set of learning objectives and homework requirements that were determined beforehand by the department, the administration, the faculty members who collectively teach that class, or the school board. (I'm sure I'm getting the details of the high school chain of command a little bit wrong, but the general part about requirements is what I want you to focus on.) If you're taking AP classes, the requirements were *definitely* not set by the teachers.\n\nI'm sure you've already thought of this, but maybe you can talk to the teachers, explain how swamped you feel, and ask for an extension on some of the homework. If you write to them, talk about how you feel and don't present yourself as writing on behalf of the entire class, because that's a trope that teachers are already familiar with and often respond to poorly.\n\nThis is a really tough time in your life, but this, too, will pass. You've got this.",

Today's prompt spiraled into everyone adding their two cents to the work they give on top of our college applications. There was a theme of people unable to get enjoyment out of life because school took all their time, regardless of their course rigor. None of the work can be done *well* with all that I'm getting, personally. I work until it's passable for an 80 and just go with it. That's not fair to the standard I hold myself to, and it's not fair that everyone else has to walk through life in a daze. He said he would bring the matter to the school board, but the first thing my friend said when we walked out was \"Watch that conversation die there.\" It's extremely frustrating.",
