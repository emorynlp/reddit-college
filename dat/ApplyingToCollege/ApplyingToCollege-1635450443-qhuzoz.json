  "text": "I go to a pretty small school and my mom is the secondary principal but we don't have school counselors. She does everything for college apps. Some college apps require counselor lors and I think it would be very unprofessional for her to write it, even if she wrote it objectively. should I ask the head of school to write it? She's very busy but I don't know what else to do\n\nps I'm a junior so it's not urgent I'm just curious",
