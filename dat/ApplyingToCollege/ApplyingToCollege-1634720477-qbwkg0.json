  "text": "so i have a huge dilemma here. here are the options i have so pls help me choose\n\n1. list them in chronological order\n2. list them in order of prestige/importance to me\n3. list them in order of most to least time commitment \n4. list them according to interest (ex. if i have 3 cs ecs and 3 business ecs then i list the cs ones first, then the business ones, instead of having my list mixed or like, 1 cs then 2 business then 2 cs then 1 business or sth)\n\nim hella conflicted on how i should do it especially that all my activities fit into two interest categories like the example in #4. but then again, that doesn't seem like the common way to do it. so im lost. pls offer any tipsnor advice. what should i do?",
