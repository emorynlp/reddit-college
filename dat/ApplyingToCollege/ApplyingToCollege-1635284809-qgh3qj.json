  "text": "International student here. Only a couple of the colleges I'm applying to require courses and grades, but I'm not quite sure what to put here (from grade 9 up). I haven't had formal graded exams each year, and those I have had are not marked for external use. \n\nMy transcript is going to be submitted by my counselor anyway. Do I actually need to fill anything in here, or should I say I don't have access to my transcript?\n\nThanks!",

The only results I got from those were the end of grade 10 (and are noted on the transcript). Then no grades in grade 11 and provisional in grade 12 (as on transcript). Is that still required to be filled in?",

You have a couple of options to pursue. (1) Use the chat feature in common app and ask them for what they would recommend. (2) Email the admission office of the school you are applying to and explain the situation to them and see what they recommend. \n\nIf you don\u2019t hear from them, I would still input the class for each year and where applicable, put the grade. There is an option to submit additional information. That could be where your school can provide an explanation about the course set up and the grading system.",
