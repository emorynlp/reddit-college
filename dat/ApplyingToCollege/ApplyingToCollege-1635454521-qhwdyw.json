  "text": "Does anyone know the application process for Rosemont College? I recently had an interview with the director of admissions on Monday and she told me that I\u2019ll find out if I\u2019m accepted or not in two business days. I\u2019ve been checking my email nonstop but I haven\u2019t heard anything. I know that they will send a letter but do they also send an email? I will be out of town for a couple weeks so I\u2019m not really sure if they send additional confirmation.",
