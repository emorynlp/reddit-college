  "text": "TL;DR at bottom. \n\n\n[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a46gxi/that_stanford_interview/?st=JPESTVPD&sh=96d699ce) \n\nYesterday, I had my stanford interview. \n\nI arrived ahead of time and was just taking notes in my notebook, seems a small detail but it\u2019ll be used later on. \n\nWhen he came, I shook hands and he insisted we sat outside. It was freezing cold, but I obliged nonetheless. He asked quite naturally to just introduce myself and I did... but he just interrupted me and went \u201csorry, I didn\u2019t catch you. I just saw a beautiful girl. Could you repeat?\u201d. I kinda got an odd feeling from the off with this. \n\nHe asked me about what I do in IB, and I did so and explained my extended essay to him. He then proceeded to critically question it with various complex issues with the experiment I did for it (it was in physics, and he has a PhD in electrical engineering). He asked for the equation I derived, and obviously I can\u2019t remember so I told him it was a long formula but I can\u2019t quite remember. He responded by essentially telling me my experiment is quite simplistic, and it can\u2019t be that long and complex. Then flexed his thesis that derived an 11th order formula. \nFor reference, my extended essay was predicted an A. \n\nHe asked about my econ coursework for the IB as well, and we had a short debate about monetary policy of the Fed. However, when explaining my opinions to him using simple economic concepts, he simply told me I don\u2019t make sense. \n\nThis was about 10mins in. \n\nHe then proceeded to tell me \u201cyou spend your whole life studying. You won\u2019t succeed at Stanford, you will struggle massively.\u201d\n\nHe hadn\u2019t asked once about what I do outside of school or ANYTHING. Nor had he seen my resume or common app beforehand. Zilch. I am convinced in hindsight he made such a comment simply because I was so into our academic discussions as an Asian. I\u2019m convinced it was racial stereotyping. \n\nI refuted that claim, naturally. \nI explained all the things I do and he decimated each and every one. \n\nI run a funny podcast with friends for enjoyment. He ripped into it as \u201cit does not have a purpose\u201d despite me explaining we do it for the enjoyment and entertainment of content creation. \n\nI explained the two international honours I\u2019ve received. One of them was a 3rd place. He asked me why I didn\u2019t win, and when I gave my answer, he asked what the first place team\u2019s project was. He told me \u201cthat\u2019s actually innovative, all you\u2019ve done is manipulate a few numbers. \u201c. \nI explained my next one, and he said \u201cI\u2019m not interested in things you\u2019ve done for competitions\u201d.  \n\nHe asked me why stanford. I give a whole host of reasons ranging from the culture and how I clicked with students when I visited, all the way to specific societies and research groups that sound interesting to me. He told me \u201cthat\u2019s not quite good enough. You can find that entrepreneurial culture in any university.\u201d  He asked where I\u2019m applying other than Stanford, then told me \u201cyou don\u2019t make sense. these universities don\u2019t have any entrepreneurial culture at all\u201d. \n\nThe colleges I named? Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, USC, NYU (am applying to more but didn\u2019t want to rattle off a list of 10). He also insulted USC and NYU saying they\u2019re simply \u201cparty schools with average academics\u201d. \n\nThen he asked me what my \u201cthing\u201d is. I asked him to clarify what he meant, and he said \u201ceveryone has something they\u2019re amazing or world class at such as sport, drama or music. What about you?\u201d  \n\nNow I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not an Olympic athlete, a talented actor or a world class musician. I can\u2019t help that. I do what I do and have excelled at what I enjoy- and I enjoy a few areas. He called me \u201cuninteresting\u201d and told me \u201cyou will blend in with the 50,000 applicants, you\u2019re not differentiated. \u201c\n\nHe asked me about what I want to do when I\u2019m older. I told him I want to start a company.  He responded \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence you can do this. You have no evidence. You\u2019re 17,18, why haven\u2019t you built a successful company already?\u201d \n\nI have family responsibilities and don\u2019t even know which area I love most to start a company in. What does he expect from me?\nHe then told me \u201creal passion and evidence\u201d is like this example of a girl who did debating since she was 9. \n\nHe then asked about what drives me. I open up about what drives me... and he completely shut me down and told me it\u2019s \u201cnot really a motivation\u201d.\n\nHe questioned me on if I drink alcohol. Obviously I say no even though I do.... then he criticises me and says it\u2019s \u201cridiculous that You follow your parents wishes even when they\u2019re  not around\u201d. Eventually I break my guard and say I have the odd beer with friends. \n\nThen, he wrapped up the interview by telling me \u201cI know what I\u2019m saying is probably making your mind race at 100mph behind that superficial smile of yours but you have to drop that. \u201c in a serious tone. \nHe told me I \u201cdon\u2019t have a story, narrative or drive in life\u201d and to go and \u201cfind them and email it\u201d to him. \n\nHe said he would email me what he\u2019s going to report to stanford and \u201cnot to be disheartened by it\u201d. \n\nThen, as he\u2019s leaving he tells me \u201ctake your little notebook, reflect and sit there and take some notes on what I\u2019ve said. \u201c\n\nAs I said, in hindsight his comment about me spending my life studying was imo racially driven. In hindsight, I should\u2019ve respectfully terminated the interview there and then. \nHe had no right to make such a comment. \n\nI should\u2019ve been self aware of the situation, instead I was taken aback by his comment and too involved.\n\nAdvice: if an interview is going badly, be self aware. Don\u2019t take shit, even if you think your future is in their hands - because it really isn\u2019t. \n\nHonestly I\u2019d rather have taken the L there and then from Stanford (most likely happening anyway) than sit through and defend myself against a constant unfair, unwarranted bombardment of criticism. The tone he took with me was condescending at best. I was nothing but polite and sincere. Luckily, I\u2019m not too upset by this. Just pissed off. If it were someone sensitive, with the way he spoke, they could well have been in tears. \n\nTL;DR: Interviewer was a huge asshole and constantly criticised me. I believe he stereotyped the fact I\u2019m Asian  when he told me I \u201cspend my life studying\u201d and thus will \u201cstruggle at Stanford\u201d without knowing anything about me. Advice: don\u2019t take shit from interviewers. I should\u2019ve walked out there and then. \n\nEDIT: This lasted 2 hours. \n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone. I appreciate the support and amazing advice - even those that have been downvoted.\n\nEDIT: I am Male. \n\nEDIT: There will be an update post after decisions are released by December 15. \n\n[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a46gxi/that_stanford_interview/?st=JPESTVPD&sh=96d699ce) ",

This is not what Stanford or the Stanford community stand for in any way, shape, or form. If you're willing, I am willing to do everything in my limited power to help make this right.\n",

Inappropriate behavior in breach of that agreement would get you flagged as ineligible for interviews in the system (every interviewer has info/notes on their account for folks like me who match and manage interviewees/ers) and may result in removal from the program.\n\nIn terms of frequency, I've been with the program since it started a little under 10 years ago and I've never seen anything like this. We've received feedback here and there about alumni not asking good questions or long awkward pauses (which is just a matter of training/re-training) but most of the stuff I've seen or heard in my experience is fairly rare and benign. All alumni who participate in the program self-select, volunteer their time for free, and go through training to be in the program so the population is generally one that really wants to be part of the program and contribute in a positive way.",

An idea springs to mind about seeding the program with 'test candidates' who are selected and trained to look for positive and negative cues.\n\nIs there an easy, encouraged way for applicants to give feedback on the interview process and their interviewers other than complaints? This can give more wide-ranging and valuable information than complaints alone.\n\nDefinitely bring this to the notice of other alumni leaders in the program -- imagine denying the next einstein! \n\nI highly suggest looking at the applicants that were handled by this guy, at the very least, those handled for this application term. This sounds like repeat behavior and other highly motivated, educated candidates with otherwise good chances to succeed might have been denied unfairly.\n\nStatistics on applications:\n\nThere were 44k applications to Stanford in the 2017-2018 admissions cycle[1]. Conducted in 53 locations in the US and its territories, and 58 countries across the world[2]. Interviewers typically conduct 4-6 interviews per admissions cycle, though some alumni enjoy the program so much, they offer to do 10 or more[3].\n\nThat's an estimated 6300 alumni participating yearly. In such a large organization, understanding details at the lowest level through oversight, transparency and methods of communication are vital to improving the effectiveness of programs.\n\nHopefully some of this helps spur further discussions at Stanford and engages other readers. \n\nCitations:\n\n[1] https://ucomm.stanford.edu/cds/\n\n[2] https://admission.stanford.edu/alumni/oval/interviews.html \n\n[3] https://admission.stanford.edu/alumni/oval/faqs.html#interviews (Answer number 18.)\n",

What you experienced is absolutely inappropriate and I would recommend writing a lengthy letter to Stanford admissions describing your experience. They will definitely want to know that one of their interviewers is acting this way. Be sure to mention the \"beautiful girl\" line, specifically. That is wildly unprofessional.\n\nIf you want to take a strong, principled stand, state firmly in your letter that you are rescinding your application from Stanford and would appreciate a refund of the application fee due to this experience. \n\nIf you do not decide to rescind your application, writing this letter well is likely to increase your admission chances, honestly. I'm sorry to hear that you had such a horrible experience :(.\n\nedit: read some replies. I agree that the guy is just an asshole and probably not a racist. He's clearly the type that enjoys acting smarter than everyone in the room. For future interviews, though, do make sure that you can explain your research in great detail without notes. That is pretty important, for what it's worth. And although I personally disagree with the tactic, it's entirely possible that other interviews at your chosen schools will *feel* hostile and challenging. Part of what this is intended to tease out is the both the strength and grace of your intellectual spine. That said, this guy is about five steps beyond anything resembling a line.",

If at some point in an interview someone decides they are not going to recommend you for an admission or a job, it is great and ideal that they essentially tell you the reasons why they think you are not qualified. This is good. It gives you a chance to respond to the reasons they have decided against you - because maybe they still might change their mind if you had some great counter-points they were not considering. This person failed in the delivery of those points because they were demeaning and dismissive. I just wanted to say that it is good to hear constructive feedback, but not if it is delivered in a negative manner.   ",

You're right, OPs feelings are not the interviewer's responsibility just as it is not OP's responsibility to determine the interviewer's intentions because there is no way for OP to know for sure. Hence that is why I suggested that OP give his side of the story without trying to guess the interviewer's intentions outside of how the interview made him feel. Stanford can then take both sides of the story and come to a conclusion as neither OP or we are getting both sides of the story. ",

When I interview people who claim some kind of knowledge or experience in research, I question them at length on it precisely because a fair number of students will skate by on others' work and overstate their contribution. Questioning is how I figure out if the student has actually put the effort in or if they're pretending.

For any student who is quite nervous or shy, it's important they know that so they can be mentally prepared for it. They definitely won't be grilled to the extent that OP was, but if they make a statement then they should expect to have to back it up. It's generally not a great idea to use words like \"always\" or \"never\" because you can be trapped if you have, in fact, *not* \"always\" or \"never\" believed in something. If they claim to have a certain character trait, it's reasonable to be pressed to give an example of where you displayed that trait. Or if you say one thing and later contradict yourself.\n\nAgain, it will not be rude and racist, but it can push you into uncomfortable territory if you're asked for a second example, or questioned on your specific role in research, especially if you're not prepared for that. \n\nThe best advice is to think seriously about what they want to do in life, why they want to go to that university, what's special about that university, and their overarching \"story\" in general. You can twist that to answer any question and to shift gears on the spot far better than if you memorise your response to 100 stock-standard questions. Learn the big, common ones, but be prepared to be thrown off track at times. \n\nMy only position on this is:\n\n1. OP's interviewer is a dick and needs to be reported\n\n2. Some interviews can be uncomfortable and the interviewers can grill you on things sometimes\n\n3. It's important to really know the basic stuff you know you want to talk about so that you *can* answer the tough questions tactfully, and possibly dig yourself out of a hole in a respectable way\n\nThat's it. That's my position. If you're going to be really rude to someone and start flashing around your qualifications from the \"number one program in the world\", at least pick someone who actually disagrees with you. We both agree that this interview style is totally inappropriate for a HS student. I'm sure there are plenty of people on this thread who think otherwise, so go argue with them. You can't change my mind if we already agree. ",

We will suck some of the brightest into the PhD career track!) but the discovery that some area of study is just so  truly fascinating that it will be a thing they stay curious about their whole lives.  I used to help administer a big survey of undergrads, and when we asked them about their most meaningful experiences on campus, the answers make it clear that this does happen for some students.  \n\nOn the bright side:  since I\u2019ve outed myself as a person without the chops to have a real job, this may cut down on applicant requests to read their essays.

My post was not meant to be a pearl-clutching \u201chow dare you;\u201d if I were going to go down that road I probably talk about world-changing work being carried out by academics.  But I pushed back because I think it\u2019s flawed and relies on generalizations that (in my view) don\u2019t hold up.  And I remain surprised that this view is embraced by so many people who are working so hard to insert themselves into that world\u2014and in many cases pay to do it.   Perhaps a substantial number of applicants here think that all professors are worthless, and they are therefore dreading the fact that they have to sit at their feet for four years to get the piece of paper that they believe they must have to succeed in life.  Setting aside other arguments about why that attitude might be a little narrow, maybe they should consider revisiting it because it sounds like a really *miserable* way to spend eight semesters.  Rather than HOW DARE YOU, I am saying, applicants, think about this some more, given what you\u2019re signing up for.  Consider believing that along the way, you might meet some amazing academics who are good at what they do, whose work matters, and who might change your life.  Next time you are in an interview or on a college tour, consider asking your informant to tell you about a professor they especially admired.\n\n\n\n",

Because reading your other comments, that's what you think he was trying to do. \n\nHere's a hint: Cutting off someone to tell them they're wrong about what they think is stupid and doesn't exactly engender discourse. On top of that, it's a 17 year old who's being insulted about their life, after and during possibly the most stressful time in their life. *On top of that*, this guy is obviously insecure or has a bone to pick with other schools since he's insulting them too. What about any of that suggests he's trying to get OP to think about their life?\n\nMost people who apply to Stanford and get in are pretty damn intelligent. I'm nowhere near that level, and even I've thought about what drives me and such. Shutting me down by saying my reasons are stupid (most of OP's reasons aren't even stupid at all; also, how does me not drinking illegally seem like a bad idea) is a really shitty way of explaining it. \n\nThis guy is a moron, whoever he is. Let's look at precisely what he says, in order:\n\n* Ignored a student he was supposed to be interviewing because he was checking out a hot girl\n* \"What you did is simple. Here's what I did my PhD on...\"\n* \"You don't make sense\"\n* \"Stop studying so hard. You won't succeed at Stanford\"\n   * I don't think this is racial, I think he just meant that he thought you weren't having enough fun and were focusing too much on schoolwork u/breadwinner\n* \"These specific things about Stanford are generic\"\n* \"These other schools like USC and NYU are shitty and generic\"\n* \"What honors have you won? Oh those? You didn't really do anything there, you just manipulated some numbers. This team did much better.\"\n\nHow exactly is that supposed to reveal anything about a student? Sounds like abuse to me. ",

He didn't \"bond\" with me and I did my best to finish the course without any feedback from him.\n\nThe other thing is job interviews. Some interviewers have their minds made up in the first few minutes whether they want you to fail or not. Usually, I try not to burn bridges and finish the interview but it sucks because you know whatever happens after that just don't matter - you are not getting the job. One day I really just want to walk out if I get a shitty interviewer.\n\nOP, when one day you have made it and you are successful, remember to not turn into an asshole and abuse your success.",

If it helps you, use the experience as fuel to show those types up. Use it as an example of what never to become regardless of how successful you are (or think you are). I doubt Stanford actually wants to associate with this guy, so I'd recommend reporting his behavior (especially the opening remarks) so they can rectify their ties with him.",

Please don't ignore the advice on this thread to report the interviewer if you're comfortable doing so; you could harm a lot of students in future generations. Admissions boards take this kind of thing extremely seriously.\n\nThe sad truth is that interviewer training for many colleges is very poor, and certainly behind the times. In most locales, interviewers are largely not a very diverse group of people, and their views of what a good candidate is are based on what they experienced in college.\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable reporting the interviewer to the admissions committee, you could also reach out to any alum you know or have met.",

The world is full of people that should not be in public positions because they do not have the emotional intelligence regardless  of them being subject matter experts.  This has nothing to do with competition, but in a way it is a pompous misuse of power.  It is unfortunate it happens, but it does.\n\nThere are many successful and brilliant professionals that will talk about their  humbling beginnings  in an admissions office, of their choice,  and how it was a blow to their ego.  But in introspection they are glad it happened because it led them to other better opportunities to sucess.    If I were OP I would not waste my time on this matter, but focus on targeting other universities and continue to grow.   In time their maturity will mentor other on how not to behave.\n",

I thought my interviewer was trying to get me to look deeper, and he wanted to approve me, but he really wanted to know why I was exceptional. He didn't badger me or belittle me or harass me. When I gave an example of my work that wasn't good enough, he just asked for another example that had more of whatever he was looking for. He definitely had concerns and definitely wasn't sure if I was good enough, even with my extensive academic background. But he was honest and polite the entire time.\n\nSo for all the people who are saying the interviewer was trying to achieve something with the way he talked to you, I can say from personal experience that I've been in THAT interview, and it doesn't sound anything like what you went through.\n\nI'm sorry you went through this.",

And before people jump on me for being racist against Asians I am an Asian American myself and I pride myself for having provided a fair and even assessment on every student that has interviewed with me Asian or not.\n\nWhat you just experienced was exceedingly unprofessional and exceptionally uncharacteristic of the interview process for any university that provides interviews.\n\nPlease report this immediately.  If there are enough reports that go through showing that this person is exceptionally unqualified to be interviewing students it is very possible the school will ignore a number of the interviews the interviewer has performed (if not all) and offer another interview with a college admissions officer or another interviewer (depending on when this person's behavior has been recognized and whether or not there are interviewers available in your local area that are not booked).\n\nUnfortunately I can't really help you directly because I do not carry connections to Stanford's admissions office but again I must emphasize. Report this individual immediately. The closer to the date of this interview the better.  Make sure the report is as clear as possible.  Try to quote the individual verbatim as much as possible. Try not to infuse your own emotions into the report it will only compromise the seriousness of the message.",

Our job is to make them feel comfortable, explain what to expect, ask questions about their life, passions, dreams, etc. And then I write a report with my observations, generally about how driven they are, whether they're a good cultural fit for the university, if they maintained eye contact, etc. What this guy put you through is totally inappropriate. If he's behaving that way towards applicants, I'm guessing he's awful to work with in any capacity, so the university should know about it.",

I would say that if the interview went as you described, it is very abnormal and not representative at all of what Stanford has to offer. Now that I'm on the other side, I can recommend you some steps. Here's what I would do if I were you:\n\nStanford most likely uses their alumni network to do applicant interviews and there's a chair for the region where you interviewed. I would recommend you find someone who is a Stanford alum in your area, explain your situation and try to get the email address of the Alumni Interview Chair of your region. You should email the Chair, explain your situation as politely as possible, and ask if it's possible to arrange another interview with another alumni. \n\nUnfortunately, I think your chances of getting into Stanford will most likely be significantly diminished by this (if the interviewer gives you a low mark and you don't get another interview, your odds of getting in will drop dramatically), but it's certainly worth a shot and you may hit it off with another interviewer if given a chance. \n\nCheers, and best of luck.\n\nPS if you have any questions, you can pm me.",

I love the university I go to now and find it perfect for my personality and efforts)\n\nbut the way my interviewer talked about his life after graduation really instilled a sense of respect in him from me. He shared a story of how he struggled and \u201cfell off the horse\u201d so to speak. The only reason he got back into the job market was because some recruiter saw Stanford on his resume and figured he was pretty smart. He was incredibly humble and made a point to describe the motivation and effort of the most successful people he attended undergrad with. He was incredibly relatable and human- completely opposite of how your interviewer seems. I\u2019m sure my interviewer noticed some shortfalls in my explanations of why I wanted to go to Stanford, but he had the insight to understand why I thought it was worth a shot anyway and why I might not know exactly what I want to do with my life as a 17 year old. Much less how I\u2019m going to \u201cchange the world.\u201d \n\nYou seem like an incredibly strong person for withstanding this seemingly strong intellectual- who is the definition of a weak man. Your interviewer is weak because he fails to leave positive marks where he treads. Only the strongest people leave places better than when they came. I am certain you will grow from this experience and thrive in whichever path you choose to take next year. The fact that you even had research to defend means that you are making good progress in your scientific career. It was his loss that he did not realize you can grow from any of the shortfalls he perceived you had made. \n\nGo forth with motivation from this experience- that you can become both a well educated and successful person who maintains humility and graciousness towards all you meet. I wish this for both you and I. I\u2019m very excited for the progress I\u2019m sure you will make in whatever project you pursue. \n\nEdit: I just remembered: The last thing my interviewer told me was \u201cI\u2019m sure you will be successful wherever you go.\u201d\nI took it positively, and continue to work toward my life projects.",

      "text": "First off, I feel I should note I am on mobile so I apologize for any issues with organizing my thoughts...\n\nI started off by thinking this whole thing was a test (e.g. is the student one that would stand for someone making inappropriate commets?). But I would guess they professors demor would have changed quite quickly if that were the case.\n\nYou did a fine job and sound like you are a good candidate. That professor probably has some self esteem issues and you were an outlet. The university should hear about this as there were and will be other victims. If the interviewer is in your department, I'd withdraw the application. If they are not, I would consider requesting someone else. You sound driven. What you learn is a vector quantity. You define how far you go and the university defines your direction. You dont want to choose a professor/department that will make you miserable because you will likely push your issues on to others. Just as with interviewing for a job, this interview was to see if you are a good fit for them AND if they are a good fit for you. Edit:(It sounds like Stanford replied to you and is interested in addressing this issue. I suggest following through with that because Stanford is the top university in my mind for academics. Keep in mind though that you can achieve 90% of any education at any top university and your mental state after is also very important).\n\nI also agree with others that this may not be a race thing but we were not there. My opinion is that there is almost no racism at any high level university because there is a massive mix of professors of all nationalities and everyone earned their their position. I think that anyone working as a professor in these areas can't help but lose racist views they may have had prior. \n\nOther people here stated that you should have your research memorized. I did a masters in statistics and there is no way I could memorize all of the formulas I used. What I did in interviews is bring supportive documents. This does a few things; it allows you to show them, in a more consumable manner, how you approached different things and it allows you to save face when you do not have things memorized (you can  say \"on page 7 you can see how I used x to do y which resulted in z\" and then slide them the document with important parts highlighted).\n\nJust for future reference, one thing I do at the end of interviews is I note what I struggled with and ask the interviewer if they mind if I get back to them on a few things. I'd spend the night researching every question and email them with 2 sections: answers and explanation (separated in case they want a quick read or want to be shown the depth of what I learned). This will show that you have the passion to find answers to problems enxountered.",

On the first one he was great and pleasant and engaging. But on the second one he randomly changed to heavily critizing us on everything and even saying something along the lines of \"I just looked at about a hundred applications all light-years more impressive then yours. Why should I even continue this interview?\". He told us afterwards that some interviewers will act like that if they want to see how you react to negativity and if you can keep a cool head and still present yourself well. \nIts obviously possible this wasn't what your interviewer was doing. And even if it was I have no idea what to recommend as far as the correct steps on how to handle it. Maybe they want you to end the interview to show you won't let yourself be bullied. Maybe they want you to stick it out because the real world has crappy people you have to deal with. Maybe they want you to report him to the school to show you are a good citizen and can recognize it was not proper conduct. Maybe there is no best response and you just need to do what's right for you. \nOr again, maybe he was just really being a rude buttmunch. \nHopefully he was just seeing how you'd react to negativity and you handled yourself well. \nHas he sent you that email yet?

      "text": "I've been a volunteer college interviewer for Yale for many years. I imagine that Stanford conducts interviews generally the same way. I strongly agree with other comments here encouraging you to contact Stanford/the admissions office directly with what happened, but will add that, for what it may be worth, the value of this interviewer's opinion to Stanford is probably quite low, if not entirely irrelevant. I would expect that this interviewer probably deals with all applicants in a similar way, and probably writes long, rambling, incoherent reports on applicants that the Stanford admissions office likely ignores (because of how useless they are). I think it's quite rare for interviews to actually \"hurt\" applicants, and I can imagine admissions officers at Stanford rolling their eyes whenever they see a report from this guy on students. College admissions officers know interviewers (not necessarily personally), and, at least in my opinion and experience, find certain interviewers more or less useful based on prior experiences/reports on applicants... this guy is almost undoubtedly in the \"useless\" category. At the same time, there's probably little or no incentive (at least prior to your interaction with home hopefully being reported to the admissions officers!) to remove him as an interviewer, since there are usually more applicants than people willing to interview them.\n\nI've had students who I've written glowing recommendations for that were extremely academically qualified that did not get into Yale, and had students that I was not particularly impressed with get accepted (and matriculate). So, even presuming that I am a \"good\" or \"valuable\" interviewer, my opinion doesn't really count all that much.\n\n(I am also fairly shocked this interview went on for 2 hours: if I, for some reason, didn't like an applicant, I would simply cut the interview short, and I can't ever recall an interview going beyond an hour and a half, even for students that I really, really liked.)\n\nStanford is a great school with great alumni, so, for what it's worth, please don't be discouraged by one asshole. It's not reflective on the school.",

Is a bit of a stretch mate.\nThe boy lied for one.\nAgree with previous commenter, that showed a very bad trait. \nAnd thirdly, this has everything to do with academia because your character, is an extension of that.\n(See what you did there) ;) \nBut dont be so quick.\nHis asking about his motivations, the bloke who did this post, played up to that stereotype then backed away from it in hindsight, because he realised it was a disadvantage. And recognising that then used it to try and make it an advantage. Which shows he has a knack for dishonesty, to smear the poor guy of such a ridiculous thing is quite frankly cheap.\nThe doors aren't shut to this guy, yet! And if he uses this and gets in it will be because he played the race card.  \nVery classy \nOn the other hand if he bucks up his ideas. Maybe he has a chance mate. \nThese u universities love clever people, and if were gonna play this identity politics game then let me hear how being considered a smart person as result of culture or whatever people's faulty heuristics are, is a bad thing.

It's not a stretch that colleges are giving poor personality assessments for asians for similar reasons, to protect places for legacy students and donators, which would explain why the percentages for asian students at the top colleges have delined/stagnated despite all other universities showing an increase for the last decade.\n\nImo, this interviewer was deliberately trying to pigeon hole this kid into the asian stereotype so he can discard his candidatecy. Unoriginal, copys ideas, isn't assertive, un-entreprenuerial. Now these are stereotypes i could give any hard working student, however the whole moma's boy comment about drink and his parents really showed that this guy was really shoe horning the good subserviant asian narrative.\n\nThe interviewer gave a no good answer question, if he doesn't drink, he's a moma's boy, if he does, he isn't a serious academic. The interviewer was deliberately being a douchebag regardless if race was a motive.\n\nThe only candidate he would probably accept is elon musk 2.0, who ironically wouldn't bother with university if he had his own company by 17.",

Something which you can only discern in an interview. In university you\u2019ll be criticized, even unfairly sometimes. Or maybe you\u2019ll think it\u2019s unfair when it\u2019s actually fair. Immediatly jumping to race based conclusion like you did there is ridiculous. And some of the criticism he gave you was completly fair, almost anybody who gets in your position dreams to succesfully start a company. A very small percentage of these actually manage to. Asking what makes you special in this case is completly fair. But as I mentioned, there are things there that are completly unproffesional such as the line about the girl at the begining.

He was an electrical engineer and you debated him on the financial policies of the fed. You told him you don\u2019t drink and then that you do.\n\nYou\u2019re communication needs work. Of course, this guy was also just a total asshole. ",

Who\u2019s to say really, but know and understand how it made you feel and realize that you never need that. If you weren\u2019t a fit so be it, If somehow he meant to push you to be greater then the kind of blunt criticism you described was a shit tactic to push an aspiring youth. It sounded like this guy was smart but he wasn\u2019t smart enough to be kind. You might be the prospective student with much to learn but that guy, that guy hasn\u2019t learned basic decency, so fuck what he knows. I learned a long time ago that in these types of settings it\u2019s best to not give a shit about people clearly not giving a shit about me because doing so will make me the lesser in an environment that was meant to be evaluative instead of combative. You\u2019re there to see if you can make the cut not to get crapped on.",

The first flag was the immediate \u201cdidn\u2019t catch that\u201d comment. Even the biggest assholes don\u2019t usually start off with something like that. That\u2019s just not normal behavior for any type of interview regardless of whether the person is a dick or not. Unless, however, there was a reason for it.\n\nYou might have done excellent in the interview. But the point that he clearly undermined everything you said and made harsh accusations seems like a flag. Some interviewers in the real world (I say that because you\u2019re 18, no offense) like to see how the candidate will handle difficult situations and difficult people. Instead of just answering simple predetermined questions in a monotonous way, you can much easily gauge someone\u2019s personality by how they react to a situation. In this case, that situation would clearly be a shitbag as an interviewer. That might be his way of interviewing to see how students react. Stanford Im sure is a very tough school (which I know nothing about) with a very stress-heavy academic calendar. Students who break over someone who is just an asshole to them might not make the cut. They might be looking for people with a thicker skin. \n\nI think it was great that you held your own and didn\u2019t break character and unleash on this guy. Even if I\u2019m entirely wrong and he is just a shitbag, you still took the high road and didn\u2019t drop to his level. If I\u2019m right, you looked fantastic in the interview.\n\nAnyways, just my two cents on that. \n\n",

I do and without missing a beat he goes give me 5 traits that describe you. He was miserable and helped me realize it was not the school for me. Towards the end I was kind of over it. I asked him why he chose Tufts from out of state. He blew the question off. He asked me if Tufts was my too choice and I said I had visited but I dont think it was for me. He then asked what other schools I liked better so I was honest and told him. He scoffed and said Tufts was a better school. I said yes but not for the program I was interested in and there is more to college than just rankings. Surprisingly I \"passed\" the interview. ",

Later into the conversation, he casually mentioned that there were Eastern European people who he was classmates with and called them \u201ceuro trash\u201d -being of color myself, I was very taken aback and didn\u2019t know what to say, and I just awkwardly nodded along and silently wondered what he must think of me if he was willing to say these things in front of a senior in high school that he had just met. Needless to say, it left a bad taste in my mouth and I was perfectly fine with it when I didn\u2019t get in. I didn\u2019t report him but I wish I had, he was grossly unprofessional. \n\nMy Yale interviewer was fantastic and I\u2019m actually still in contact with his daughter (who ended up going to the same school district as me). The experience definitely varies so don\u2019t let this one person get you down! That was a great conversation and I still remember it with fondness. The interviewer has to respect you too, and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad if you don\u2019t receive that because that\u2019s more reflective of them than it is of you. ",

Then, considering the point at which he\u2019d said that to me, 10mins in, he\u2019d only heard from me about my deep interest academically and seen what I\u2019m like. Knew nothing about what I do outside of class (which essentially tells you if you\u2019re just an academic)- and I do do a lot outside of class. \n\nI fully hate making assumptions and victimising/playing the race card. I\u2019m not saying he definitively was stereotyping- to be clear I simply felt  that it could  most certainly be a possibility. \n\nI hope that\u2019s cleared up! ",

Sorry you had to go through that.\n\nSecond, I advise you to hold off on reporting him in full until AFTER you\u2019ve gotten your acceptance decision. For now, I would simply send a short request for a second interview, and outline the most egregious behavior of his in bullet points. I would leave your feelings out of it as much as possible. You don\u2019t want to come off as disgruntled or overly sensitive, which, rightly or wrongly, may be a factor in the admission committee\u2019s decision.\n\nAfter your decision, I would send a more detailed description, including the more racist parts of what he said (unlike others, I *do* think his comments were racially motivated). Then send it to Stanford to ensure he never interviews anyone again (you can mention your previous letter).\n\nGood luck! ",

I am a Stanford grad and can confirm that (as with any blue chip university), there are going to be some hyper-competitive a-holes and hyper-inflated egos affiliated with the school.  There is some actual merit to some of the more general comments made by this jerk\u2014not the ones personally attacking you, but the ones about the culture of the school, the comparative academic reps of some of your other choices, etc\u2014but my experience was that there was definitely plenty of room for many wildly different types of people at Stanford, not just this d-bag\u2019s version of what a Stanford person looks/sounds like.  Seems like he was possibly testing (inappropriately, in my view) how \u201ctough\u201d you are\u2014how you will be able to withstand criticism, being challenged, etc.  I would not pull my application per the advice of some on here\u2014you could still get in\u2014and as I said, this guy does not represent all of us.  \n\nI would consider filing a complaint, however (without speculating on racial motivations\u2014unless he said something specific, that would come across as pretty recklessly speculative.  You may indeed be right, but nothing you described of your conversation is solid evidence of that).  There is enough about the way you were treated to be upsetting to me as an alum without getting into specifics of motivation.  Others in admissions will likely feel the same way\u2014it reflects poorly on the school and it is important to prevent this kind of toxic b.s. from becoming an accepted part of the admissions process.  \n\nGood luck in the rest of your journey.  Hope you get in to one of the schools of your choice.  Stanford is great (and at least 20 years ago) was full of some genuinely warm, kind, funny, and brilliant people, but ultimately your success and happiness will depend 100% on what you do with wherever it is that you land.

If you're doing something Physics or Engineering based, there are 20 other better schools in the USA; but you wouldn't think University of Michigan had an amazing Physics program or that Georgia Tech has some of the top engineering and computer science programs in the world. In that respect, his asshole-ism is *somewhat justified because it sounds like you haven't really done your research. \n\nWhen he asks you about what your \"thing\" is; it sounds like you're leaving out a lot of the story. What did you tell him? \n\nYou said you want to start a company when you're older... what kind of company? You're leaving out any details about some pretty major things; which makes me think you are coloring the story in your mind and giving us half of the truth. Are you going to start a cupcake bakery? A cryptocurrency mining farm? A biotech company? It makes a big difference. If you don't really know, just \"a company\"; well, no shit he responded the way he did, that's a vapid answer. I've been in school for 7 years with a B.S. in Physics and finishing my masters in CSE (stop abbreviating everything too, see how annoying it is?) and I've seen a lot of people like you; it's a lot easier to lie to yourself and paint this picture of him being an asshole when the simple truth is that you didn't live up to their expectations because you were too wooden. It's a hard school to get in to; like, old school hard to get in. They have some of the best programs and students in the entire world. You haven't mentioned anything that would get you in. If your interview with him was as lacking in details as your post about it (which I assume you had no time limit to prepare), I sort of understand. But don't let it keep you down, use it as a learning experience for other interviews or try to transfer after taking some classes somewhere else.",

Academic and non academic. I explained them to him.\n\nBut the point I'm trying to make is that we're only hearing your side of the story and you didn't explain it to us in good detail; which it sounds like Mr. Asshole called you out on. It makes me question your version when those big details are left out. Maybe you did say something that made him justifiable in his criticism, maybe you didn't; you withholding that info is sketchy and I'm not one to blindly support anyone or anything; which is why I'm a good research engineer.\n\nI've dealt with many people like him and it never stopped me from achieving what I needed to achieve with them. Any student or professional can say the same; I'm not unique or special in any way. \n\n>Regarding the rest of your comment, I\u2019d like to let you know that I think you\u2019re missing the point. I answered each and every one of those questions with precision, passion and sincerity. \n\nThe thing is, if your answers show extreme ignorance then that doesn't matter. Again, I've talked to many many students who have passion and sincerity (you didn't answer with precision as you mentioned about not knowing much information about your research and couldn't give him the fundamental equation, so you're sort of proving my point here that you've colored the facts with your own bias) and even though they were passionate and sincere, they had no idea what they were talking about; literally spoke gibberish and were edgy for the sake of being edgy. One kid I knew even talked about how he wanted to \"build a perpetual motion engine\"... he couldn't be told that the physics denying that possibility were *pretty* fuckin' solid after 500 years of attempts. **edit: It's important to note that what you may perceive as \"precision\", possibly short and concise answers that seemed like a speech from a movie or something, is exactly what most people in his position would consider \"wooden\" or rehearsed behavior. It's good to struggle with questions because it makes it seem like you're really mulling it over. Otherwise answering too quickly, without thinking, without asking questions back in order to get some clarification for exactly what he's asking; makes it seem like BS answers that you think they want to hear.** \n\n>The point is that he is overstepping his mark, walking in as someone who doesn\u2019t have a clue of my achievements, grades or anything, by behaving unprofessionally, inappropriately and condescendingly. \n\nI've had plenty of asshole bosses and professors that I've done research for or worked for who treated me just like the guy who interviewed you. I overcame their bad behavior and exceeded their expectations. I am not unique. Everyone has had a similar experience and I hate to sound harsh, but what separates those of us who rise above and those of us who don't is the ability to deal with people like that and work them. You didn't mention any specific achievements that mark you as someone who has done amazing things and immediately deserves respect. And I don't think you understand just how far personality and the ability to work a crowd or single person will get you in the world. It's going to be a harsh reality when you realize this truth in what sounds like many years down the road. \n\nOne last thing to lift you up even though I'm sure you probably won't even read this far and have disregarded everything else I've said as \"this guy is just another asshole because he doesn't tell me what I want to hear\"; the university you go to means very little in regards to your success, and if you already know that, then you're basically crying over someone being rude to you and none of this matters other than he hurt your ego. If that's the case (I phrase it that way because I may be wrong and am without ego enough to be able to admit it), then that is a personality trait that you want to get rid of as soon as possible because it will hold you back throughout your entire life and make you a terrible pain in the ass to work with in group/team work. If you're getting into STEM fields, then either you learn how to work with people or you learn how to work people.",

Sad truth is OP was given a chance to show he was a truly remarkable human being, but could only muster polite sincerity and assertiveness, skills that can be learned in a few months as a retail associate.\n\nOP, you sound like a smart guy, but learn from this and next time bring your fight",

The kid came in one day and started bossing people around without any experience and soon was elected leader and was never taken down. So my friend's boyfriend got demoted after all his hard work. And when him and the snob both applied to Stanford, the latter got in and he didn't. Just goes to show that Stanford has a habit of admitting the most uptight and/or horrible people. And adding the rapist kid on top of that.. That's just my opinion though. I'm sure you're a pretty cool and determined person and will strive at Stanford or wherever you go. :)",

I would mention details of the interview that will be considered objective, things he will have to outright lie to deny, like verbatim quotes. Then at the end of the complaint, include how that made you feel - demeaned, stereotyped, etc. I think that structure will help, because it's like you present the case, then you draw your inference and let the people who review your complaint draw theirs. This guy is a fucking piece of work and needs to be accountable for his actions. Frankly, I wish I knew who this was so I could go rip into him. ",

Please don't let that person strip away your self confidence.    \n\nReading your post brought back memories of a similar experience I once had in my early 20's and I was seeking an entry level internship at a gym in the field of health and fitness training- I was trying to break into the field because I was recent college graduate from '09 and I couldn't find a job and was depressed for about two years after graduating.  I had no prior experience save for studying and passing an exam for the CSCS- its a certification in the field of strength and condition.  The person interviewing me skewered me. He had it out for me from the start.  It was traumatic because it wasn't even in a room closed off from the public and he raised his voice for all to hear.  Regular gym goers got a free public display and it was excruciating.  \n\nI was already struggling with self confidence going into that interview and that experience didn't help in the least.  I felt so little.  \n\nPlease don't doubt yourself!",

Of course he was looking for that student who would stand out & not \u201cblend in\u201d w the rest of the school bc he knows those are the ones that get far. This interviewer knew what he was doing, but you\u2019re young & not used to having adult conversations. Yes he was in the wrong bc shouldn\u2019t talk to teens like that, but he was hoping you\u2019d bark about how special you are. When he said you would \u201cstruggle\u201d at their school, that was your chance to prove him wrong; should\u2019ve told him WHY you wouldn\u2019t struggle, why YOU were different. He was looking to see if you were witty or talked passionately about your life & future (that would\u2019ve really impressed him). You shouldn\u2019t have stayed quiet, he WANTED you to prove him wrong. \n\nAll in all, don\u2019t take it personal. You\u2019ll be a great fit for soooo many other places, but use this as a learning experience. Learn how to be strong/firm when communicating w tough, smart men like him bc you\u2019ll definitely come across more of those in the future, especially the successful ones.

Sometimes people undermine us and attack our personalities and efforts because they feel insecure themselves; that interview was a chance for you to step forward into a position you wanted. So maybe just maybe, he was testing you to see if you were serious enough to make sure no one or their opinions got in your way\u2026.if I\u2019m wrong, maybe that could still be a lesson.",
