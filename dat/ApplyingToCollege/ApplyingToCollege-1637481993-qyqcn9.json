  "text": "In the the Academic History section of the UC application it asks if you have taken summer courses. While I did take a class over the summer of 2019, it appears on my transcript as if I took it my sophomore year (it is listed with the grades from 19-20 year). Should I still report it as a summer class? or just put it as a sophomore class?",

      "text": "I don\u2019t know the official answer to this question, but I am assuming the main point of the question is to be sure they have a record of all the schools you attended and courses you took. Is there an \u201cany additional info\u201d question on the UC app? I can\u2019t remember. If so, I might answer \u201cno\u201d and then explain in the additional info section that technically you took X course in summer 2019, but did not list it as a summer course because it is reflected on your sophomore year transcript (as a spring term course, if that is the case).",
