          "text": "Mid twenties guy here, I'm glad that you were successful but doing in person applications is not inherently the best move. I've worked in restaurants for 5ish years and saw a lot of people who tried this get rejected. \n\nI can really only speak with any authority on restaurant hiring, but if you want a restaurant job there are a couple routes: easiest and probably best is to make an application on a website like Poached. This site basically works like the common app but for restaurant jobs, you can upload a resume and send it out to a dozen places. Agreed on wearing a nice shit and looking professional to the interview, but at the end of the day, restaurants need bodies. If you're not a total dipshit and you can work the hours they need, they'll hire anyone. This works best if you want a front of house job, and trust me, unless you really want to be a chef, front of house is better. Paid better, and easier work.\n\nThe other way is closer to what you were describing: just call them and ask if they need a dishwasher. Dishwashing is a shit job. It's gross, it can be mildly dangerous (hot pans), and it can be physically draining (taking out the trash when the trash can is full of wet food products is super heavy). The only people who work it are usually immigrants, high school/young college students, and people with criminal records. It's not all bad though: usually dishwashers who are consistent can easily get prep jobs, then work the line. The turnover is super high and I've never worked in a restaurant where the chef wouldn't be happy to at least get your info, so the next time a dish washer shows up drunk they can get you.\n\nOne thing you never ever do though, is show up asking about a job between 11:30-1:00 or after 4. That's when a restaurant is expecting to be busy, if you show up and bug a manager or a chef during that time they'll immediately ignore your application.",
