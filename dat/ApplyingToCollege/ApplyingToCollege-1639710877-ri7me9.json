  "text": "So many people I know who should have gotten in or at least deferred got flat out rejected from their early schools, while people whose ECs weren't nearly as good (like research or those really well known academic competitions like USACO and Regeneron vs starting clubs and Instagram nonprofits) and stats were lower got in. And it's definitely not just because of connections because I know so many people who had legacy, parents as staff, or rec letters from doing research with professors at the college, along great stats and ecs who everyone thought was going to get in who got rejected.\n\nAnd I know so many people not getting into their safeties when in previous years, almost everyone with similar or lower stats who applied got in (at least according to Naviance). These people are above 50 and 75% for these safeties, like what is going on ?????",
