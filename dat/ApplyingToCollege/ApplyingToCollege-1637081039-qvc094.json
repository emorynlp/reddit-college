  "text": "I haven\u2019t finished most my apps yet, what dual credit classes would help getting into T50s? I\u2019m gonna major in psychology and (hopefully) go to law school after. I took an archaeology course for my first semester in dual credit, but I have no idea what to do for my second one. It\u2019s a big college so they offer loads of classes, I just can\u2019t pick which ones would be helpful. Also I\u2019m worried about credits not being able to transfer from my local college to whichever college I end up going to. Any advice? Or warnings of classes to not take?",
