      "text": "Colleges like some diversity in their applicant pool. They don't want their CS program to be 90% white and asian males. Asian CS applicants are very very common (particularly male). Thus you may not be as preferable to someone who comes from a more minority background. \n\nThe amount that this disadvantages you by is pretty debated. I wouldn't worry about something you can't fix though. Plenty of Asian CS students still get in. It's not a game changer and something you should worry about",

          "text": "This. Colleges love diversity in multiple dimensions, and even if colleges don't \"admit by major\" they still care about your academic interests. Additionally, they have to maintain their various departments and it'd be a bit awkward if they just start firing their staff because no one is interested in a niche major/field that they offer.\n\nBut that does not mean that you should use this as a back door though. If you want to major in CS and have a strong CS Background, you're better off indicating your first choice as CS instead of a less popular subject you don't care about e.g. theater.",

Some folks who fit this profile may misunderstand what these schools actually want to see in their applicants, and what sorts of things may tank their chances.\n\nI've known people like this guy.  The stereotype is:\n\n* Treats life like it's a video game and he's trying to get the \"high score\".\n* A terrible writer, to the point of not even using proper English grammar.\n* Arrogant and not capable of masking it.\n* Extremely one-sided, with no academic interests outside coding and competitions.\n\nProbably only a minority of such students match this stereotype, but among the set of USACO top finishers I suspect the % is non-trivial.  And it's a *complete turnoff* to universities.",
