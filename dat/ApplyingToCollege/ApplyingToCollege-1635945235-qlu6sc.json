  "text": "I know that I am straight up STRUGGLING. All my applications have been turned in for a few weeks so the deadlines weren\u2019t really a problem and I was already accepted into one safety, but just the WAIT FOR ED is killing me. It\u2019s just a month and a half of sitting here. Waiting. The worst part about it for me is that my school isn\u2019t some kind of reach or last ditch effort to improve my application chances. The stats are actually under/on par with mine. So I can\u2019t even predict the outcome because I could totally not get in or I totally could. Can someone just speed time up a little bit?",
