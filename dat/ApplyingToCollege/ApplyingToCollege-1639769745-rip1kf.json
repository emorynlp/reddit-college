      "text": "Your decision where to apply shouldn't depend on your perceived chances of admission or where you think schools might rank and instead be based on your academic preparation, cost, and career goals. \n\nYour GPA is fine for many excellent public universities that will give you a world class education. Community college is also an excellent way to adjust to college or to save money if you are unsure what you might want to do once you get to a university. Community college students tend to have better outcomes after transferring to universities than freshman admits for that reason.",
