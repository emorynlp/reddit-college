  "text": "so i\u2019m a junior and right now my gpa is a 2.43(sadly) and this year crushed me especially taking AP classes for the first time. None of my APs are below a C but it\u2019s still terrible for this quarter. i\u2019m aiming for a 3.6 hopefully for next quarter to finalize my semester grades.\nI was wondering if colleges would care if my first semester final grades are lower than the other? I may consider dropping an AP to aim for a easier class for a higher GPA.",
