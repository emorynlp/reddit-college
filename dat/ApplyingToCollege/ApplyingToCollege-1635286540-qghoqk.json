  "text": "Let me start by saying I hate this class and would love nothing more than to drop it. I am currently in AP Stats and have a 55% in the class. I attempted to drop to a lower level but all the classes are full. I think if I really tried I could get my grade up before before the end of second quarter and end with a decent grade. My only options  are to stay in the class or to drop it. My fear is I've been told by many this would look bad and greatly hurt my chances at getting accepted to a college. I would apricate any advice anyone could give me.",
