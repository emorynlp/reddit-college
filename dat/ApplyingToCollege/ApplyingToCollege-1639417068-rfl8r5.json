  "text": "Hi r/ApplyingToCollege,\n\nI have a habit of making specific rituals for good luck, which aren\u2019t super fun (like right now not allowing myself to listen to any other song than my \u201clucky\u201d song.), yet I feel are important because any deviation will mean bad luck.\n\nThe deal is I\u2019m waiting for my Stanford REA decisions in two days, but I kind of hate having to keep these rituals going for these two days, yet every time I feel like deviating from them I feel like if I get rejected I will look back at my defiance as the reason why.\n\nThis prompts my question, how long before the day they release the decisions will all of the applicants have been evaluated and all decisions are \u201cset\u201d? If I knew that all decisions have already been made, I can feel safe in freeing myself from my rituals, as nothing more can be affected.\n\nI know this is super weird! But thank you in advance!:)",
