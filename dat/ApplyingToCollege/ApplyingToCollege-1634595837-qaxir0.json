  "text": "It\u2019s not even November yet and I feel so burned out with assignments after assignments. And just sitting through school is so soul crushing waiting for it to end while my sleep deprived a$$ is eating 4 chocolates to stay awake. And when I get home I have a mountain of work to do. Idk how everyone seems so upbeat and enthusiastic, how do you guys make it through?",

      "text": "God yes. I am EXHAUSTED. I have something every single day of the week and then homework on top of that. I work 3 days-4 days a week, babysit, volunteer, sit on a youth art council, etc and then I have to come home and do what I can only describe as hours of mindless work. I\u2019m drinking so much caffeine which is only making my anxiety worse about everything. This year is an absolute shit show.",
