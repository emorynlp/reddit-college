  "text": "I think I\u2019d like to go to a SUNY school, because I don\u2019t want to end up with crippling debt, and I wish to major in geography (unsure whether I want a BA or BS yet). I could likely get into all of them given my grades, and I\u2019d just like to know which school has the best geography program. Thank you!",
