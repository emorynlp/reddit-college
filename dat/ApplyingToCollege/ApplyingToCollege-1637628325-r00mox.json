      "text": "On their website, for The School of Medicine Guaranteed Admissions process, it\u2019s says that **only those selected to move forward in the process will be notified by December 15**\n\nAs for the honors college (if you applied), **students meeting the December 1 deadline will be notified of their Pitt Honors admissions decision on or before March 1**\n\nHope this helps! :)",
