  "text": "I added EVERY single school i liked to my collegeboard SAT score send list. this was before I took the SAT so I didn\u2019t know how i was gonna do. (big mistake)\ni ended up getting a 1310 and i\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s any way to retract this score or remove it from my application profile?",

      "text": "You can check the \u201capply test optional\u201d box on the application and they will ignore your scores.\n\nIf you sent a previous higher score, they will ignore your recent score.\n\nThis is reason students are usually advised not to use the free send option. Test-optional, due to the pandemic, makes this slightly less dangerous that usual, but still a bad idea, IMO.",
