If you talk about the city, make sure to mention how the school is involved in the city (don\u2019t just imply that you want to go there to enjoy the nightlife). Do they have classes where students visit the museums, or do they have cool community service organizations that work in underserved neighborhoods? Be specific and talk about what opportunities you want to take advantage of that are going to help you achieve your goals.",
