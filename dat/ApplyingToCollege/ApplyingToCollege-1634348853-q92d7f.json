  "text": "Just found out today that a girl at my school went to Germany to perform her cello piece! I searched up her name and apparently she's one of the nation's best player, and has gone to other countries to perform. \n\nJust...insane, and she's not even the only one. One of the kids in my grade swim junior olympics, another girl raised 11k dollars, and there's a lot more of them lurking in the crowd. How am I even suppose to compete with my slightly above average resume???\n\nHow the hell are these kids so talented? Is there even enough spots to go around?? \n\nI used to be so confident in my activities but that confident has dwindled. I hate admitting it, but I'm average. It sucks that I worked so hard just to ... come out average in the end.",
