  "text": "damn it, it's all over--13 years went by like a flash. Yesterday, was my last day as a high school senior, and I walked around my empty high school campus because I forgot we had early release on the last day. I managed to get inside a building (thank u my ap bio teacher for letting me in), and I was the only one in the building, and I just sat on the ground and started ugly crying all alone. It was my first time back on campus since that 2020 \"2 week spring break\" had started and that's when it  hit me that I was finished with high school, and that I will never be able to see some people + friends ever again and that I would never experience that same aura when my friends, teachers, and other people were around. I feel so void.\n\nI didn't get an elementary school reunion and I was really looking forward to it. I keep listening to 2014-2016 music and now I miss middle school and elementary school because it will never happen again. I get excited for graduation and college yes, but being in public school has really changed my life like I met so many amazing people and teachers and made the most incredible memories that bring me to tears now reminiscing upon them. :(( I feel so sad that I didn't get to say goodbye to anybody at all.\n\nnot college related ahh but, ima just a sad high school senior right now  :((\n\nupdate: holy I really didn't think this would get viewed at all. I love you all so much, your comments are so sweet and relatable. Thank ya'll so much <333\n\nWe're all in this together <33\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

I\u2019m a transfer student so I\u2019m still living at home, but in spring I run out of classes at my junior college and need to move on to a university. I\u2019m struggling through everything you\u2019re feeling. All my friends from high school have already moved away for various reasons. So I see them maybe once every couple months. With college out here in the real world making friends is a lot harder bc we all are here for a reason. I haven\u2019t made a new friend since I started college. \n\nI\u2019m feeling nostalgic about the simple life of middle school and early high school. I never cared about school or anything at all, basically almost failed out. But now I\u2019m stressing over an A+ versus an A-, getting letters and emails from schools across the country. It\u2019s terrifying to imagine not getting into the university close to home, I\u2019ve been stuck inside my home for almost a year and a half. I\u2019ve never left home. Over the pandemic I\u2019ve basically become agoraphobic. \n\nEverything is changing all around me. I still feel like a kid. I\u2019m nearing 20 now, but I defiantly am still stuck at 17 graduating from high school. I feel everything you kids graduating this year are feeling. Because I never felt it when I actually did. I never thought I\u2019d make it this far. \n\nBut everything will be okay. We grow up, we learn, we\u2019ll expand our horizons and move on to bigger and brighter things. We need to be open to new people, new places and new experiences. Everything will be okay. I believe in this class and the 2020 class. And everyone around my age being able to push through this really messed up situation. \n\nSo much love and hugs to you sweetheart. I really hope you start feeling better soon.",
