For a regular student, anything beyond 20 hrs is very difficult (unless it involves stuff like self-study or spent whole summer on one activity, etc). I don\u2019t think any AO would count but system would calculate. The system would probably say you did xyz activity for 10 hrs/week for 3 years, abc activity for 4 hrs/week for one year - in some descending order - this way AO would know which are long term activities and how deep you are in that activity.",
