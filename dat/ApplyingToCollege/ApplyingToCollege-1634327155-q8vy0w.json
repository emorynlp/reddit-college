  "text": "I just found out I got a 1060 in my first ever SAT attempt. i tried to give it last year but got COVID a few days before my test. I do plan on taking it again in December to improve my score but wanna apply to Santa Clara University as a Marketing or Management major for Early Decision. I applied last year aswell but got waitlisted and rejected :(   Would it be smart to apply with this SAT score or without? \nAny advice would be appreciated!!",
