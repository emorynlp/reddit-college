  "text": "Got accepted into my dream school... spring semester??? Do you think I should still go? There's options to study abroad which i've always wanted to do but I wanted to wait until my junior year. Do you think i'll regret missing out on first semester freshman activities like move in day and all of those things? Idrk what to think abt this situation. On one hand i'm really grateful I got accepted into a school I had a very low chance at with my gpa, but on the other hand i'm a little sad that I wouldn't be able to attend first semester. Any thoughts and advice are appreciated :)",
