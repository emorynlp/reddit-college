  "text": "Hello, so I have been contemplating on being a Biology Major during this college application process. My dream is to either be a veterinarian or some sort of physician. I am also considering being a dentist. My counselor told me that I should be a Biology major so that I could decide what career path I want to take while in College. However, I feel like having a Bachelor of science degree in Biology is pretty useless when it comes to having a backup plan in case it doesn\u2019t work out since there\u2019s not a lot of great jobs available in that field. Ideally, I want to have a job that ensures my financially security, and also one that I would enjoy doing (Veterinarian or physician). Would being a Biology major be good or should I pick a different major in college that not only allows me to get ready for Vet or Med school, but also grants me a better field of jobs than Biology?\n\nAlso, is the College of Arts and Science at Vanderbilt good for someone who is pursuing these types of careers?",

      "text": "I would go for a biology major if you\u2019re 100% certain you love biology and want to make it a lifelong career, either in medicine or maybe another research area. Even if you don\u2019t get into med school first time, you can keep applying and I assume you will because if you really love the field you\u2019ll commit to it.",

          "text": "Thank you! You kind of reinforced my thinking on Bio. I do enjoy it, but last year I took AP Bio digitally so I didn\u2019t get to do all the labs and interactive stuff unfortunately. What minors would you recommend for someone going into a healthcare or veterinarian field? I want to learn a language if I become a physician and I want to eventually run my own animal clinic if I do become a veterinarian.",

              "text": "No problem! I would recommend either psychology, public health policy, or any other field you\u2019re interested in that you think might benefit you in the health care field. Business might also be helpful if you want to open a clinic but many people learn how to open/start businesses without a formal degree but rather just experience and mentorship.",
