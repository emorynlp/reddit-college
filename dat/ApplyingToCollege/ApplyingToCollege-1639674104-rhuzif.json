  "text": "Two years ago, I applied to Phillips Academy Andover. I didn\u2019t get in. An hour or so after finding out, I took a chemistry test and got a B even though I understood the material well and it wasn\u2019t a hard test. Less than a week later, schools across the US shut down due to COVID-19.\n\nThey say that Phillips Academy Andover students go to Yale.\n\nYesterday, I found out that I didn\u2019t get into Yale. I have a chemistry exam today. Some schools are considering shutting down due to high COVID cases.\n\nThere are just too many parallels. So if your school shuts down, you can blame Yale admissions.",
