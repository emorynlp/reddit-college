  "text": "Not to be outshined by the UCs and Cal States (which if you\u2019re still having problems with you can check out on megathread on them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/r5fla6/uccal_state_outage_megathread)), the Common App has decided to step up and have some problems. If you\u2019d like to ask questions, discuss, or vent about these problems, this is your place to do so.\n\nThe Common App has [tweeted](https://twitter.com/commonapp/status/1466249023409606657?s=21) that they\u2019re aware of the issue and are looking into it.\n\nA possible workaround to this issue has surfaced. According to a [tweet](https://twitter.com/kyukibug/status/1466249682737315840?s=20), you may do the following:\n\n* Hover over the loading sign and right click. An option labeled \u201cInspect\u201d should appear. Click that.\n\n* Hover your cursor over different elements on the web page with the inspect element panel open until you see the loading sign get highlighted. The code line should start with something like, <div _ngcontent-emx\n\n* Remove that element by right clicking the code and clicking \u201cdelete element\u201d\n\n**If anyone is able to make a picture demonstration of this, please post it here.**",
