      "text": ">Is it easier to be admitted to Mathematics & Computer Science \u2026 than the Computer Science major in The Grainger College of Engineering?  \n>  \n>All of the undergraduate programs with \u201cComputer Science\u201d in the title are very competitive.  The difference in the high school GPA and standardized test profiles of students admitted to these programs versus those in The Grainger College of Engineering is insignificant.  Students should not apply to Math & CS, Stats & CS, or a CS + X major unless they have a strong and genuine interest in both halves of the major.\n\nThis is certainly much more restrictive than straight Math in the CLA&S. CS has a 15% acceptance rate overall, around 3% for out of state. The school overall was 72% on the latest CDS.  And that\u2019s including CS.\n\nBe aware that Math+CS is very different than Math.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What career fields are common for the different blended CS majors?  \n>  \n>Math & CS: specialized fields of scientific computation, financial engineering, software engineering, and theoretical computer science.",
