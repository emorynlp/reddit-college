  "text": "I got awards from CEMC mathematics competition which is hosted by the University of Waterloo (I don't think anyone would know about this contest), but am I allowed submit awards from this competition when applying to US university? Also, if you know about this competition, will it be a good boost for my chances? I got awards from Euclid, CSMC, Fermat, and Hypatia.",

Otherwise just prioritize which one you got the best award for. Euclid would probably be the most well known out of those contests though.",
