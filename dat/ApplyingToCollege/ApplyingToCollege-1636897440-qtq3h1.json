  "title:": "Question about signed tax returns",
  "text": "Hi! It's my first time creating a post here, and I would like to ask about the signed tax returns.   \nI'm an international student and in my country's tax returns there's no place for handwritten signature. Will it be enough if taxpayers' info is printed there (including local equivalent of social security number) or should I ask my parents to sign them by hand in the corner or whereever?   \nThanks in advance and have a nice day :))",
