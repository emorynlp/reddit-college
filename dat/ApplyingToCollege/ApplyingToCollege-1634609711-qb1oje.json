If you are struggling ask, if your grade\u2019s not what you want ask if you could redo a test or if there are any extra-credit opportunities. \n\nRemember that a 4.0 is not a 100% it is a 93-100% so you don\u2019t have to be completely perfect.",

So it would be a 3.67 or something. Or is 93 the lower limit for a A/A+?\n\nEdit: Nvm, just realized that this guy is likely a high school freshman, not a college one \ud83d\ude02",

      "text": "I'm going to do tips on Freshman year in general + tips for a 4.0\n\n1. Do 2 AP's in classes you're actually interested in and that appeal to your strengths. You'll enjoy the classes and get 2 AP exams out of the way so you can relax more during your junior year.\n\n2. Use Onenote or the sticky notes app (if your school uses laptops) for writing down hw whenever the teacher mentions it in class. Then use that when you get home to know what hw you need to do.\n\n3. Study for tests (start studying at least 2 days in advance) and figure out study methods that work for you. For history, I just read over my notes and did practice FRQ's, for science I did practice problems/read the info again from class etc.\n\n4. Do 3 - 5 extracurriculars that seem interesting to YOU and not just because you think they'll look good on college apps. Plus, extracurriculars will be a nice breather in between all your work.\n\nHope this helps!",
