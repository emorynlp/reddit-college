      "text": "Nope. \n\nEssentially, it depends on how far you've reached in your application. Some of my friends were very late in starting their application process, so they had to get a counsellor to personally go through their application. \n\nI started early and researched a LOT about colleges via PrepScholar, Niche, Reddit, College Websites, and what not. If you're early, and you can put in the work, you won't be behind those who use a counsellor. \n\nThat being said, these two points are for HS Seniors. As you're a sophomore, you should see how far you've reached in your college admission journey i.e How many stand-out EC's have you done? Have you taken the SAT? And so on and so forth. \n\nIf you're slightly clueless regarding 80% of the application, I'd prefer getting a counsellor. \n\nAlso, do remember. There are a lot of unhelpful counsellors out there, ones that don't teach you anything valuable or don't give you personalized ideas and guidance. Make sure you choose the right counsellor! All the best!",

If by reaches you mean that these schools reject 85%+ of applicants, then you have to start thinking about additional colleges which admit closer to 50%+ of applicants. \n\nThere are many colleges where each individual student could be happy and successful. \n\nWhy are you concerned about your ECs? You\u2019re only a HS sophomore right now? \n\nHere\u2019s a good resource for first-gen students:\n\nhttps://striveforcollege.org",
