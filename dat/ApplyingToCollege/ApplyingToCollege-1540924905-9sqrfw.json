I rewrote my whole supplements overnight and I like them 568397456 times more now (let's see how everything goes though). But yes, never be afraid of altering your app, even if it felt perfect to you a month ago. (MANY THINGS change in 2 months...)",

      "text": "I see this sub on the popular section from time to time and lemme just say almost all of this advice is bs. The \"grind\" is barely any work. You have to write an essay which is the only difficult part. The rest of it is basic filling out forms which will take you a week tops if you do like an hour a night. I applied early action/decision to all of my schools (I forget which one but it's the option where you just get your acceptance sooner) and I did all of my work across two weekends while in fairly rigorous classes so if you apply regular decision you have until I think January until you have to get all of your shit done which is no Herculean task.\n\nRandom other terrible advice I see here is:\n1. The name of your school doesn't matter.- that's just plain wrong. The whole argument is usually \"you learn the same stuff anyway.\" That in itself is false as more prestigious schools have better professors most of which have worked in the field so they tune their teaching to reflect that. And even if every professor was a carbon copy of themselves different schools provide different connections and opportunities. Your state school most likely won't have as many opportunities or connections to big companies as if you went to say Wharton school of business.\n2. Go to whichever school gives you the most money.- As above, prestige matters. Obviously don't go to Harvard if it means you have to pay the whole tuition through loans but if you have the option between a state school and a private school, most times the price balances itself out (excluding room and board) if you're a good student and qualify for schools' highest merit scholarships which are usually like a 3.3 GPA or something around that. Taking out 5-10k in loans each year won't mean you're poor for the rest of your life as long as you're going into a well paid field, but take that into account when you're choosing a school rather than your current income. If you really want to save money then only look at schools where you'd commute. As someone who has both commuted and lived on campus, commuting blows and makes it harder to be involved, especially for group work and such, but it's definitely worth saving 15k a year.\n3. (Don't) Choose your dream school or you'll be super disappointed.- I've seen both versions where someone either doesn't get into their dream school so they romanticize their current school so they don't feel bad about what could have been if they weren't rejected so they go on a mission to tell people that their dream school will only let you down and you'll be sad forever. On the other token, such as in life, you don't HAVE to love your dream school. You can go there and decide you hate it but that you're going to stick it out, or you could even transfer (no shame in that). I got into my dream school but I decided to go somewhere else so I could live in New York and have the college experience and all that dumb teenage stuff. I loved the social stuff but the school wasn't nearly as rigorous as it should've been and was insanely expensive so I transferred to my dream school where I commute so I know all sides to going to college.\n\nMoral of the story is this sub is a waste of time making highschool kids worry about something that's ultimately not a big deal while they should be having a great time enjoying their last years of high school.\n",
