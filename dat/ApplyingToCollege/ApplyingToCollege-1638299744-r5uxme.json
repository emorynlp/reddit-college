      "text": "It\u2019s not super common but not particularly rare in the US, I think. I know some schools like Williams make a big deal about tutorials, but other schools sometimes use the term as well. They usually refer to discussion classes with only one or two or maybe three students. Discussion classes with more students are usually called seminars instead.\n\n(And of course many of the US schools that use the term are emulating the Oxford tutorial system, which is probably the best-known example globally of a school that uses tutorials extensively.)",
