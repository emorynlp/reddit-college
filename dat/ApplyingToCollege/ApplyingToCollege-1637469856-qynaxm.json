  "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore in high school and also dual enrolling in my local community college. I was looking over my class options for next year and trying to plan out ahead. But just out of curiosity, would dual-enrollment classes fulfill A-G requirements for UC system. For example if I took a Spanish 1 class at my local CC, could that count towards my foreign language requirement?",

      "text": "PSA in case it's relevant: public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.",
