      "text": "Yeahhhh, North Carolina kinda wins the best overall state school system. We've got the T-30 in UNC chapel hill, the top tier stem school in NC State, regional universities with solid programs in ECU and and App State, plus mid-tier schools like UNC Charlotte and UNC Wilmington, all for like 20k or less even without aid. If your living at home, tuition is just 9k at UNC and 10k at NC State. \n\nThen there are plenty of lesser schools that can give you a decent degree for like 5k or less. \n\nNot to mention private options like Duke, Wake Forest, and Davidson. Sorry for the rest of ya.",
