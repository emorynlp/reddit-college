  "text": "I had a very bad first year of college at a private university near where I live. I'm not currently in school but I'd like to go to one of our state schools next year. My current GPA is extremely low. I'm starting again at a community college in the spring and I would really like to only have to do one semester there, so I can start at the state school in the fall. The application deadline for that school is May 2nd, but the community college semester doesn't end until May 5th. I'm certain that I wouldn't get accepted with my current GPA, and if it doesn't go up until the semester is over, then I'm going to have to wait another semester before I can get into the state school, which I would rather not do if I don't have to.",
