  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nCurrently filling out my UC App and I had a couple of questions regarding certain things. For one, should I include high school achievements and honors if I\u2019m a college transfer student? And for the scholarships and programs section, should I mark the involvement in athletics box if I was on a high school team but not on a college team? I still do casual sports, just not at an academic level. \n\nThanks.",
