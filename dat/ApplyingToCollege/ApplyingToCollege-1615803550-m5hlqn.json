  "text": "I got into my dream school with absolutely no aid. When I calculated the total cost of attendance, it happened to be two times the budget my family gave me. I dreamt about this university day and night. \nI decided to decline their offer. My father spent his lifetime earning the assets he possesses today. I cannot let him spend it all for my undergrad education. \nI decided to attend a college that isn\u2019t as highly ranked as my dream uni, but gave me lots of aid, and a warm welcome. The college is good too but ofc not as reputed as my dream uni. \nEven when my father offered to pay for my dream school, I simply couldn\u2019t accept it. I will get into a better grad school and with lots of aid. I will work for it this time. \nSometimes, making these decisions can be tough, but you will eventually have to make them. You have to adjust no matter where you go. If I wanted to be in my comfort zone, I would\u2019ve simply studied in my country. I decided to study abroad so I can grow as a person, and I can see the epic highs and lows of high school football. Oh sorry, I meant life lol. Anyway, wherever you go, do your best and make sure you grow as a person. Rankings aren\u2019t everything. Have a good day\u2764\ufe0f",

My mother didn\u2019t want to send my brother and my father wanted the opposite \n\nOver the next 4 years, there have been infinite crises and fights and screams over this decision and regarding the family finances. It severely affected me and my growth as a teenager. To this day, I am facing the ripples of that decision. (I think there\u2019s still a bit of regret from my mother\u2019s end about sending my brother.)\n\nMy brother is an absolute hero of mine, and I\u2018ll love him forever, but that decision exposed all the cracks within the greater family and the snakes emerging from those cracks often haunt me, to the point I decided to stay back in my country for my undergrad",

And he's right, what difference does it make? When they get old and they need help and support it's gonna be me and my sis taking care of them one way or another, what does it matter in 'whose account' it's in? It's all **ours**.\n\nNote: I ended up also going for the local 'cheap' (well it's actually free, cuz Europe) uni where my parents teach mostly because all of my friends were here and because I honestly wasn't that driven, going to a highly competitive environment wouldn't have been right for me. My sister however was wicked smart, but most importantly extremely hardworking methodical and just straight up insistent. She would have done fine anywhere but I know it must've felt somewhat good to 'stretch her legs' academically, as it were.",
