  "title:": "Some CommonApp queries for an Indian Student",
  "text": "Here are all my queries :\n\n* What is should I fill in cumulative GPA  as our education gives a score out of 100 in a subject and total score by adding up scores in all subjects\n* What should I fill in the courseworks ? More specifically for math, because we are taught almost all the individual maths courses (calculus , trigonometry ,etc.) under a single subject of math . I had taken up PCM( physics , chemistry and math ) as my mains subjects in 11th grade with English being the mandatory language and computer science being the fifth subject .\n* If I have got a merit certificate for board exams by scoring a perfect score in a certain subject and being in the top certain percent of students at the national to do so . Can I fill something like this in honors section ? (Board exams are  annual examinations held for 10th and 12th grade at national level )\n* I have done voluntary work under an NGO . Do I need my superior from the NGO to write a letter about it or can I just give my certificate of participation to verify this activity ?\n* Where I live , we don't really have guidance counselor . So all my transcripts will be submitted by the Principal of my school . But I changed schools after 10rth grade . So can the Principle of my current school submit the transcripts of my previous school with a transfer certificate to prove that I changed my school ?\n* Also what is everything included in the transcripts ? I had always assumed it was just another term for what we call Marksheets . I suppose it is also supposed to include my attendance data of the grade or the school as whole",

      "text": "Just choose math other. \nYes you can add it in the honors section\nThere is no need for a letter. You can just mention it in the activites section.\nI think it will be fine if your principal uploads all of your transcripts.\nTranscripts are generally one page sheet with final marks of each subject for the year. It's similar to marksheet. And it should have the school letterhead.",
