  "title:": "If a Dual Enrollment course isn't transferrable to a college, is it still given a +1.0 grade boost & treated as a college-level class the same as an AP for admissions? I'm taking courses like HVAC repair, diesel replacement, etc. that are offered through CCs but wouldn't transfer to Harvard per se.",
