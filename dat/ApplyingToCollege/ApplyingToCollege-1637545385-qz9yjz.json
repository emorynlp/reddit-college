  "title:": "I am so indecisive is 20 colleges too many to apply to",
  "text": "So ive categorized my colleges based off of benefits because I don\u2019t have a dream school and can\u2019t really envision myself anywhere in particular. These are the categories:\n\n- colleges that would give me scholarships as a national merit finalist\n- BS/MD Programs (direct pathways to med school) \n- colleges I think are nice idk \n\nSo this piles up, and I have like 4 I\u2019m applying to for scholarships as national merit finalist. Then I have like 9 for bsmd programs, and maybe like 1 or 2 because they\u2019re cool ivies and why not. Problem is I have no idea where I wanna go, but all the schools I\u2019m applying to are pretty difficult. (My safeties are the schools bsmd programs that I\u2019m applying to; if I don\u2019t get into the program, I\u2019ll get into their undergrad school which Ik is a safety for me). Is this too much?? For a lot I can reuse my essays but my teacher who is writing me a letter of rec made a remark about how many Im applying to and I\u2019ve only applied to 7 so far. Idk am I crazy idk what to do but I feel like why not try right??? And I have few waivers for like 6 of them",

      "text": "Not at all - undergrad/MD programs are all high-reaches, so it's good that you'd go to the undergrad only, as safeties. I would guess that most kids who apply to those selective programs could easily exceed 20 schools, if they didn't want to go there for undergrad only.",
