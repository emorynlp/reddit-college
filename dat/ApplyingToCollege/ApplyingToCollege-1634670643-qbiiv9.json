  "text": "So I was recently filling out the CSS profile and came across a problem. My dad has been disabled since I was born and since he can\u2019t work, he receives workers compensation, which is basically his entire net income. The CSS profile also asks for any untaxed income (I.e. workers compensation, benefits, etc.) and so I included that same amount there as well. My concern now is that financial aid reviewers will take it as 2 separate sources of income since they\u2019re in separate sections and therefore add them together, which will affect how much aid I receive. Any thoughts?",
