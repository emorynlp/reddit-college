  "text": "I\u2019m wondering about how to fill the \u201cFamily\u201d portion of Common App. One of my parents has abandoned me for a very long time and so we haven\u2019t had any contact in years. I do know who he is, however, as well as certain information about him (he\u2019s something of a public personality). Can I choose the \u201cI do not have another parent to list\u201d option for this particular parent? Or would I be better off choosing \u201cI have limited information about this parent\u201d (if I choose this option, I\u2019ll have to indicate some things that I don\u2019t know about, such as his university graduation year)? Could anyone please help me?",
