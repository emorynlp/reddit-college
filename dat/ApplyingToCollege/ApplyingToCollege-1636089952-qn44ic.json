  "text": "I\u2019m an Indian student with 97.5% in 9th grade, 99% in 10th grade and 96.2% in 11th grade.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t written clearly in my transcript, and today when I looked through them, they do look a little confusing. I was in ICSE for 9th, so my transcript is filled with internal exam marks, some marked out of 20, some marked out of 100 (it doesn\u2019t even say the full marks at the top), and weird break ups of marks here and there. One really has to search through the whole thing if they want to look at the final mark out of 100. \n\n10th is fine, but in 11th CBSE too, our school has a weird pattern of internal exams (some out of 20 and some out of 30). Plus, the way the transcript is written makes it very confusing. \n\nWill AOs be able to figure out the final percentages? Or am I just being paranoid?",

          "text": "This is actually quite common because all school counselors aren't familiar with how the transcripts should look. If they haven't uploaded the transcripts yet, ask them to create a simple table for each year that only shows the total marks for each subject. If they've already uploaded the files, that's still not a big deal since the Regional AO's are familiar with the formats.",
