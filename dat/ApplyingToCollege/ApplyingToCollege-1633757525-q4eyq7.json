  "text": "I want to go into business at UVA and I have to apply through their college of arts and science school. But their supplemental essay about a media has me stumped because I'm not sure if I am supposed to talk about art or something. And I'm not sure how to tie business into the essay. I feel like talking about the office or some anime because honestly thats the only bit of media I can think of that can work with this essay and something that I love. What are your thoughts on what I should do.",

My topic barely relates to the prompt, and I think that's okay. Write about a business book/ or a business show, or like anything really which allows you to show your interest in business, while kinda being in the prompt.",

      "text": "The uva CAS school's supplement prompt is \"What work of art, music, science, mathematics, or literature has surprised, unsettled, or challenged you, and in what way?\"\n\nIt's a very vague and open-ended question that could relate to almost anything. \"Work\" could refer to a song, an article, a documentary, a movie, a tv show, a novel, etc etc. If there's any business-related book or article that sparked your interest in the subject, write about that! The important thing to understand about the prompt is just how many different things you're able to write about; you're not just confined to a tv show or art!",
