  "text": "Sorry if this is a stupid question but I\u2019m not all that in the know with college stuff. I just got an email saying I got a 40k scholarship (10k/yr) from UO which I\u2019d consider to be a pretty decent amount especially being oos. To what extent (if any) is receiving something like that a good sign that my application will be competitive at more selective schools?",
