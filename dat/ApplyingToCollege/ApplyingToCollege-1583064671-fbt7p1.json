  "title:": "Rejected With a Full Ride",
  "text": "Having applied ED2 to a top LAC, I kept my expectations low. Decisions came in early February and I was rejected. Can't say that I wasn't disappointed but I moved on fairly quickly. Come 29 February and I receive an email saying there is an \"application update\", which has to be the most confusing moment for me in this whole process. I go open my portal and see a \"financial aid award letter\". Clicked on that and... it's a full ride! If I hadn't received the rejection letter, I would have been ecstatic but I felt nothing but confusion. I go back and forth between my rejection letter and financial aid award letter to make sure I wasn't hallucinating, and everything was in order (except being rejected with financial aid). I finally decide to email the school to get some clarification. They replied, apologized for the mistake and said they had mixed up my ID number with someone else's. They pulled the financial aid letter from my portal and kept the rejection letter. I don't know how to feel about this. I would be lying if I said I didn't have a brief moment of hope. Nothing I can do, I guess. Congratulations to whoever earned this full ride!",

From OP said, it also may have been based on the need/merit profile of another student entirely.\n\n\"Discover\" could be replaced with \"Error was brought to their attention\" and I'd still think they'd done the right thing.\n\nMistakes happen.   Errors that involve sending the wrong information should be corrected by sending the right information.\n\nArguing otherwise is arguing for more arbitrariness in college admissions.  \n\nImagine an error where hundreds of rejected students get an aid letter they weren't supposed to get. That scope of error has happened before, it's not far-fetched.  The college is supposed to resolve the situation by admitting all of them and giving them that aid?  \n\nWhat if some of them haven't had enough math or language to succeed on campus?  What if it means hundreds of other students who were just about to get their admit letter (admit decisions made after a careful assessment of their application) could now NOT get them?  What if some number of the students who got the wrong letters weren't eligible for the aid offered?  To make good on the offer, the college must allocate institutional funds fund to fill in for the grants or loans the students weren't eligible for.  What if the school had to reduce aid for everyone else to balance the aid budget?",

Deleting the offer without further conversation was callous. Perhaps he could have been given some insight as to why he was not accepted at this time (to better inform him for future applications). I have it on good authority that this student is in the top percent of his class, so the offer letter was out of the ordinary, but feasible.  It\u2019s quite possible that OP is an international student and is not familiar with the application and acceptance process in the US.  I think everyone who commented here, empathizing with OP, felt badly for him and wanted to offer words of support-myself included.  I trust that he will be successful and happy at whichever school he lands.",

OP indicated that they apologized.\n\n>I do not think that OP should have been offered a full ride if he doesn\u2019t deserve one, nor should he be offered a spot at the university due to a clerical error.\n\nI'm sorry, I misunderstood what you meant when you said \"step up and do the right thing.\"  Since my understanding was that the school apologized, I assumed you were saying that an apology was insufficient, and were advocating that honor what appeared to be a mistaken offer.\n\nSorry I mistook your meaning.\n\nMy hypotheticals may be farfetched for your own particular suggestion (since you only wanted an(other) apology) but they absolutely not farfetched in general.  Hang out on A2C and you will find people advocating that students who get mistaken letters should have such letters honored.  This is not the first time that a student has posted here with this kind of experience, or a student has posted about a news story where this has happened to other students.  Sometimes the story involves *hundreds* of students.  And there have most definitely been students who, in response, argue that students should get to treat the letters as a valid offer of admission.  As policy that has some potential problems, which I laid out.",
