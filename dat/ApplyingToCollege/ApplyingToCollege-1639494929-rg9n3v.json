  "text": "This is such a trivial question, but I've been a tad curious since Yale reported a [slight decrease](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2021/11/19/yale-college-sees-second-largest-early-applicant-pool-in-history/) in early applicants. \n\nWill Columbia have a roughly similar pool of around 6.4-6.5k to last year? \n\nThis is just my decision anxiety exacerbating since it comes out in a few hours lol.",
