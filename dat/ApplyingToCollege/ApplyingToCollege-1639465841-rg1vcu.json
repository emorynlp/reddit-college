  "title:": "First Generation Student Verification",
  "text": "My friend just told me that he said he was a first generation student on his college applications but his mom went to college but his dad did not, I don't know if this is right or wrong but nonetheless I told him that I think it's a bad idea. I'd rather try to talk him out of it than snitch on him and ruin our friendship and jeopardize his college acceptances as a whole. I'm pretty sure I did talk him out of it but it did get me thinking, if he did go through with his plan and said he was a first gen would colleges know if he was lying? Can they verify if someone is telling the truth or not? Or is it based off of the honor system? It seems like it would be an easy thing to lie about to give yourself an advantage.",

      "text": "Before enrolling, most colleges verify each and every material provided to them for a random sample.\n\nAnd if someone mentions he/she is first generation, they will easily get caught because college requires parent/guardians info before enrolling. And if anywhere in the school records it is mentioned that either of their parents are college graduate then their acceptance will be revoked. But if in school records it isn\u2019t mentioned then it is easy to get away with it unless someone tips the college off.",
