  "text": "Hi! So I\u2019m applying to MIT early action and I wanted to attach music to my music portfolio. \n\nThe thing is, for the past 3 years, I have been in a rock band that writes their own music and we\u2019re currently in the process of releasing our first album. \n\nI\u2019ve written 3 of the songs on the album (I play bass, piano, and sing lead/backup vocals). I have the official produced versions of them that I wanted to send in.\n\nI\u2019m super excited to show it to MIT but their music portfolio guidelines are to submit 2 10 minute unedited solo recordings (of 1 instrument) with contrasting genres or styles, along with a resume and a recommendation.\n\nI wanted to send in the music from my album so I was thinking to submit, along with my music resume, a letter explaining my situation, and then submitting 2 of my songs, but I\u2019m worried that that will completely disqualify my entire application.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do and I really want MIT to see what I\u2019ve been doing during a portion of my free time during high school.\n\nIf you guys can recommend me what to do, I\u2019d really appreciate it!!!!",

      "text": "It's not going to disqualify your application, but it's also not a good fit for the portfolio. The music portfolio is *principally* for the kind of music and vocal performance that might fit into our orchestra, a capella groups, that kind of thing. We don't have many rock musicians on our music faculty who consider themselves qualified to review what you're submitting.\n\nWhat you should do is submit a spotify link or youtube playlist in the additional info section and someone will click through to it. \n\nOh, and congrats on the album!",

      "text": "Honestly, this is a specific question that I'm not sure anyone who doesn't work at MIT admissions could answer. In general, the rule is follow their directions as closely as you can. But, it also seems like this band is important to you and you clearly want to submit it.\n\nI would email them. If they say no, you can't submit it the way you're saying, then maybe try to record 2 solo performances in the time you have left.",
