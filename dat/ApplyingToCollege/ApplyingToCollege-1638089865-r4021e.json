  "text": "I'm applying for Vandy, and Im not sure how the selection process for their merit scholarships are handled.\n\n\"The Cornelius Vanderbilt Scholarship application is required; you must apply to be considered. Applicants apply via\u00a0MyAppVU\u00a0after submitting admission application. Cornelius Vanderbilt Scholars are selected on the basis of academic achievement, intellectual promise, and leadership and contribution outside the classroom. In evaluating candidates, the selection committees review the entire application for freshman admissions along with the Cornelius Vanderbilt Scholarship application.\"\n\nSo when deliberating for scholarships, I get that the entire application is reviewed. But what about the initial admission into the uni? Is it the merit app will never be seen at first at the initial adcom review, and if they reject it then, the merit app won't be seen at all?",
