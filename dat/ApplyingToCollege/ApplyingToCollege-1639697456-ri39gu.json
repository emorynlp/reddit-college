  "title:": "Should I submit 1520 (780 M, 740 R) for MIT?",
  "text": "Not sure if I should submit my 1520 (780 M, 740 R) for MIT, since it's at the 25th percentile, and my math score is also borderline.\n\nI took it once in March of my junior year and initially wanted to retake it, but ended up not - mostly because test centers around my area were closed due to COVID until around the end of summer, and I felt that restudying for the SAT during the school year would take up too much time.\n\nI am self reporting my AP scores\n\n5: APUSH, Statistics, Calc BC, Calc AB, Psychology, Computer Science A, Computer Science Principles, European History\n\n4: Bio \n\n so I'm not sure if that would be sufficient enough to make up for no SAT/ACT?\n\nMy application isn't stellar - no research, super prestigious science/math competitions, or deep concentration in a certain STEM field - but I do have 2 National Science Olympiad medals (5th and 6th). It seems that those in the 25th percentile are usually extremely strong in other parts of their application (EC's, LORs), and I'm afraid I'm not in that bucket.",

Anything 1500+ is amazing and should 100% be sent in. Plus, doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a specialist, you seem like you have a passion, and that\u2019s what top colleges want to see! If you\u2019re that good at Scioly (fellow scioly member here, what events?), then flaunt it! Tailor your essays to it if you\u2019re passionate about it, it speaks volumes\n\nAlso I\u2019m sorry 10 APs?! Good gosh, how\u2019d you survive? And with mostly 5\u2019s?!",
