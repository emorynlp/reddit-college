  "text": "Hi all!! My college application letter is due in a week and I\u2019m so lost :(. The question is what experience in life shaped you as person. I\u2019m thinking of writing about having a twin. I\u2019ll talk about how it was difficult to stand out as an individual bc im a twin then discuss how I was able to distinguish myself from her and really find myself when we went into separate classes. Is that good enough? I think the ending is basic considering the topic itself is not one everyone can write about. If anyone has any ideas on how to make it unique in terms of the structure or content itself, that would be very much appreciated!!!",
