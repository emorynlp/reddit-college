  "text": "Hi guys, when I received my portal, I could not find a place to submit my resume. Hence, I emailed the school my resume in case they want to look through it. However, the school replied me that I had to send it through the portal, and at this time did I realize it had a place to submit my resume. Does this count against me in any ways? (like I am not careful or sth)\n\nThank you in advance!",
