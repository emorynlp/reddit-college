  "text": "Senior in HS here, so I've been thinking about taking a gap year because I feel that I am not ready for college. Because I have not studied for the SATs and I have not even taken a look at/decided any colleges yet. I realized that I don't want to have a month to write an essay and decide where I want to spend my future at. So I want to take a gap year to build up all of the academic skills that I missed (I am bad at math) and study for the SAT/ACTs so that when I apply next fall I will feel ready to go to where I will decide my future. But everything I have looked up about gap years says things about travelling and working.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I ask you people of Reddit, do my conditions warrant a gap year? Is this an acceptable way to use a gap year? And how can I go about making sure that I am actually ready for college and that I don't procrastinate like I already did? I want to plan out how I go about actually studying and building my skills.",

      "text": "There is no wrong way to take a gap year, with the exception of doing nothing with it. I'm in a self-directed gap year that focuses mostly on my mental health as well as projects that I never had time for during school. Building up your skills through projects and studying subjects is a perfectly acceptable use of your year!",

      "text": "The only bad gap years are ones that end up being about getting a part time retail job and spending all the money you make on weed and playing video games 60 hours a week. Don't do that.\n\nBest way to avoid that is to have concrete plans for each month and find a way to be accountable, to yourself or someone else.  And avoid drugs. Not because drugs are always awful, but because they really can be dangerous when you have too much time on your hands and nothing expected from you that you can't do high. It's easy to get to where \"mildly stoned\" is your new normal, and hard to come back from that.",
