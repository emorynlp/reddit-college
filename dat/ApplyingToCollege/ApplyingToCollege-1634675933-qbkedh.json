  "text": "I'm applying to 20 unis on the common app and will be getting a few waiver for all of them. Mine you I am an international student looking for aid. But the issue is the cost of the css profile. It's an extra$16 for each uni. I know a few unis that have their own financial aid reports but most of them use this and I surely can't afford that she neither have they written anything on fr waiver eligibility for international students on their website. What should I do?",

I got an answer from all of them, either directing me to use an alternative or giving me a fee waiver code. The only exceptions to this were Stanford, who chose to simply not reply, \ud83d\udc80 and Drexel, who said they can't give me a waiver. I think Dartmouth doesn't give one too.",
