  "title:": "Glorification of CS",
  "text": "I\u2019m a current junior at a well-known university, studying a non-CS STEM field. I\u2019ve noticed at my institution (and on A2C) that there\u2019s a glorification of CS that goes something like this:\n\n\u2022 CS provides the best career opportunities because of its exits into FAANG and quantitative finance, or even its ability to make students look \u201cmore intelligent\u201d than other job applicants regardless of their intended field\n\n\u2022 CS is the most challenging major, barring a few niche exceptions centered around math and physics \n\n\u2022 Hence, everyone is who majors in CS is exceptionally brilliant and ambitious, and the only valid reason to *not* major in CS is an inability to succeed in such a demanding field \n\nI\u2019ve also noticed a bizarre stereotype of CS majors being the \u201cgenius nerd\u201d type, though IRL it\u2019s probably among the most fratty non-business majors. It is a very self-congratulatory culture as well.\n\nThe (intuitive) truth is that students in finance, consulting, and law experience just as much economic success as engineers at FAANG, there are plenty of brilliant students who pour into academia, medicine, engineering, and the public sector, and elite students have a greater diversity of interests than these forums would suggest. \n\nSure, for those who enjoy coding and find the theory of computer science genuinely engaging, CS is an excellent choice that will open many doors. But if it is not your true passion, there are *many* other ways to earn just as much in (IMO) more multifaceted roles. \n\nIf you\u2019re one of the many pre-CS applicants here, think about why CS is your goal. If you love it, you\u2019re in it for the right reasons. If you see it primarily as a lucrative IQ flex, do some research on law, finance, engineering, consulting, or medicine before being misled by this glorification.",

But typically you have to work for years. \n\nA dude at my old college heard I was *interested* in Data Science and offered me an 80K internship. I don\u2019t know anything about Data Science and told him as much, so he said when I graduate, I\u2019m welcome to come name drop him for a 140K entry salary (or more if I have desirable skills). \n\nFew jobs give you the chance* to make that kind of money so soon during school or after graduating. \n\nA lot make anywhere from 70K-120K entry salary. \n\n*this is if you\u2019re a competitive applicant in your desired field. For example, look up Data Science skills. That\u2019s Python, R, SAS, SQL, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, data manipulation, data cleaning, etc.\n\nETA: a lot of people like money. A lot of people need money. I chose CS because I like it and I find it fun. But I also chose it because my family is in debt (20K) and my parents have no retirement fund. If I live with them, I\u2019ll be able to help them financially. I\u2019ll be able to get them a retirement fund, kill their debt, and get them out of this house that\u2019s falling apart.",

It doesn't make you smart and most people end up doing a basic office job.\n\nOn the other hand, none of the careers you mentioned come close to the # of opportunities available and financial reward as the software industry... at least for now.\n\n* Law: Direct and indirect costs of grad school & bar prep. Bimodal pay structure upon graduation. Inconsistent demand. Opportunities often locked by the school you graduated from.\n\n* Finance & Consulting: At the entry to mid level, high finance requires very long hours so you're really making minimum wage. May require extensive travel. Companies are built like a pyramid with *less* demand for people at higher levels. It works out because a lot of entry to mid levels burn out and switch to other fields or companies. Opportunities often locked by the school you graduated from. Lower level finance like financial analysis does not have the demand or compensation available in software.\n\n* Engineering: varies by field, but most engineering fields do not come close to software. The companies they work for are low margin and often grant or project based. Software is high margin so software can afford to spend more on salaries.\n\nEdit: also you're not a junior in college.",

Atlanta, Memphis or Baltimore for example are considered LCOL but has a lot of demand for tech and pays a lot. \n\nFor really rural areas, still hard to say since a lot of office jobs including software engineering can be done full remote. But there's way more demand for physicians in rural areas. However, most people consider these areas inherently bad QOL since they're far away from everything including good schools for your kids, which is why they have to pay a lot to get professionals to move there and work there.",

However, if they tried for remote companies, they could be making that if they have some internship experience and are good programmers.\n\nAnd then you have 1 friend who works as a Project Manager, which is a lower paying career.

Talking about them is like pursuing football assuming you're becoming an NFL quarterback. They exist, but the number of opportunities is so small that it's negligible. \n\nThere's a lot of overlap between quant research and quant trading. At some institutions there's only one role. At most, traders are more focused on real-time application but also do a significant amount of research. The role can even vary team to team depending on asset and how systemically-driven it is.\n\nBut both trading and research, even when separate, is dominated by graduate students. Most undergrads get hired to those kinds of firms as developers, not traders or researchers. Quant still pays every hire well, but 400k out of undergrad is an extreme extreme outlier.",

Even if you major \\*gasp\\* gender studies. \n\nThese are not incredibly rare extenuating circumstances. Nearly all students fulfill one of these requirements. It is not stupid to do a subject with worse entry level job prospects. It is stupid to assume someone lacks critical thinking skills because of their chosen major.",

Whereas most flagships send a bunch of kids to FAANG. Law is graduate school so not relevant in this case. \n\nCS is honestly the most accessible, high paying career path for people who don't go to a prestige school and who don't want to go past a bachelors. FAANG probably hires more software engineers than there are new Investment Banking analysts each year in general lol",
