Anything you wish you would have done when you were my age? For context im in 3 APs and my gpa is 3.8 unweighted but it will definitely be going down soon. I have nothing to compare this to. I want to apply to some Ivys. Anything helps!!",

      "text": "Personally, I take the IB diploma which is seen by most colleges as an extremely rigorous course and is considered harder than AP. I think if you take more IB or AP courses it'll help boost your chances.  \nAlso, if you want to apply to the Ivy League, good grades aren't going to be enough because everyone else that's applying is most likely going to have those top grades too. If you feel like your GPA might be decreasing, I recommend focusing more on your extracurriculars and really making them stand out.",
