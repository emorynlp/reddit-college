      "text": "Worth noting that median early-career pay for CivE majors doesn't vary a ton from school to school, and the numbers don't exactly line up with the \"rankings\".  Part of that is almost certainly geography related, but not all.  Consider UT-Austin and Texas A&M.  From College Scorecard (caveats apply) here are the median earnings 2 years after college for Civil Engineering graduates from the 12 civil engineering programs ranked by US News:\n\nBerkeley:  $71,351\n\nGeorgia Tech: $65,238\n\nIllinois: $65,148\n\nMIT: (no data)\n\nUT-Austin: $62,848\n\nPurdue: $62,707\n\nMichigan: $66,045\n\nTexas A&M: $66,094\n\nStanford: (no data)\n\nCornell: $73,321\n\nVirginia Tech: $65,208\n\nCarnegie Mellon: $60,094\n\nHowever, here are the same numbers for some CivE programs that aren't ranked by US News and that aren't hyper-selective:\n\nWisconsin: $67,450\n\nFlorida: $64,642\n\nTexas Tech: $63,997\n\nKansas: $63,666\n\nColorado School of Mines: $63,666\n\nIowa State: $62,632\n\nIowa: $61,651\n\nMinnesota: $61,603\n\nOklahoma: $61,516\n\nOhio State:  $60,110",
