  "text": "I'm applying to Penn. I'm revising one of my essays and I spelled out \"School of Engineering and Applied Sciences\" the first and only time I mention it. That makes the sentence very wordy and somewhat hard to follow. Changing it to SEAS makes it way more readable. \n\nDo you think it'll be OK if I just leave it as SEAS? I can't imagine a Penn reader would have any doubt as to what I'm talking about, considering it's a school at the university they read for, and they get thousands of people applying to that school.",
