  "title:": "Stop opening decisions with friends",
  "text": "especially if they\u2019re also opening the same decision. like i want to bash you all for doing something so dumb but EVEN I DID IT. and i was so dumb for doing it lmao. like odds are someone is definitely not getting in. \n\nMy experience wasn\u2019t applying to the same school but we were both opening questbridge match decisions. The other person opening was actually a stranger but some friends that were with me knew her so they asked her to join and I felt so bad once we opened it cause i screamed and celebrated and then i look over and she\u2019s just disappointed. \n\nas for opening with friends/family there to just support, i never did that besides the match but I hear people always say how bad they feel with people around if they get deferred or rejected cause they feel awkward and the people want to comfort you and all you really want is to be left alone. \n\nIt\u2019s up to y\u2019all in the end but just some food for thought. Good luck!!!",

      "text": "Counterpoint: I was rejected to my ED with my best friend, and it was probably the best scenario for me. \n\nNot only was it really comforting being with my friend, but I actually had someone I could genuinely talk my mind to about it and just be myself around, even during so much immense disappointment. I honestly feel like if I didn\u2019t have him it would\u2019ve taken me much longer to come to terms and be satisfied with the outcome.",
