  "text": "(This will sound like a lowkey flex but it really isn't I just can't figure out how to word this activity for the life me)\n\nI basically did independent research at my school about bullying. I interviewed teachers/students and also created a survey which I sent to a majority of the people at my school. I presented the results to my school's administration board and principle and plan on presenting to the county school board early next year. Along with this, I'm also working with admin to implement an anti-bullying program.\n\nHow should I word this in the activities section? Thanks in advance!",

Surveys are not considered strong research methods, because there are many variables that could drastically impact your results (i.e. nonresponse bias). In addition, for this to be a very strong EC, you need this work to be published and have some statistics that contribute to society\u2019s understanding of bullying. Without numbers or impact, this does not mean much. Anyone can create a survey and send it out. What you do with the research and the METRICS/IMPACT that come from it are the important thing. If you do not have this information, I\u2019m not sure I would fill one of your activities with this, unless you have nothing else to include.",

I\u2019m not sure where you live, but most big cities have a research university. You could present this information to maybe the psych or education department and see if they pick it up? Another alternative is that you could provide this information and see if a professor would take you on for research. It is difficult to get involved in university research in high school, so it would take the research to a higher level.",
