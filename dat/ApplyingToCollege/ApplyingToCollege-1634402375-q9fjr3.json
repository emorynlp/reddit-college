  "text": "I\u2019m looking for a school to apply in ED but I don\u2019t\nknow if they give a lot of aid to international students (they all meet 100% of student need but they may not actually pay tuition for a lot of students). Here\u2019s the list : NYU, John Hopkins, Northwestern, Uchicago (I\u2019ll be applying for CS)",

      "text": "Johns Hopkins and U Chicago don't make that data public, so it's hard to say.  My guess is they are comparable to Northwestern, but it's just a guess.\n\nNorthwestern provides aid to 50-60 new international students each year, so it's very competitive.  Their average aid award is over $50k/year though, so for those international students getting aid they do really well - having a large need doesn't translate into automatic rejection.\n\nNYU gives aid to more international students (almost 250/year) but their average aid award is much smaller - around $13k.  If you had a small amount of need they do ok, but if you have significant need they probably won't meet it.",

      "text": "You have very slim chances of getting into any of those while asking for fin aid, simply due to how competitive CS is and the sheer number of international students applying with the same major to those unis asking for extensive aid. Def take NYU off your list tho, and you should consider trying privates that are a bit less selective if you want a good chance of getting in w aid.",
