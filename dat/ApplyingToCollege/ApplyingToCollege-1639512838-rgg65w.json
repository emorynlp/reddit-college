  "text": "I got accepted into my ED school and I'm so thankful. But I have a few questions now. I am aware that I need to withdraw all my other applications but.... is it possible to wait until December 22 to do so? I want to wait and see how much scholarship money CWRU gives me before withdrawing my application just out of curiosity, which is sent out December 21. Cornell doesn't have official deadlines for these withdrawals as far as I can see.\n\nSecond question, does anyone know how many days after the acceptances are released that financial aid packages are released for Cornell. It says they're released in Mid-December, just wondering if its usually like a week after the admissions notification or what..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo can I do that",

If you are just waiting for CWRU you should withdraw all the other apps(don\u2019t waste AO\u2019s time) and you should be aware that CWRU has a high chance of delaying their decisions since they have already delayed ED this year.",
