  "text": "I got accepted into my ED school and I'm so thankful. But I have a few questions now. I am aware that I need to withdraw all my other applications but.... is it possible to wait until December 22 to do so? I want to wait and see how much scholarship money CWRU gives me before withdrawing my application just out of curiosity, which is sent out December 21. Cornell doesn't have official deadlines for these withdrawals as far as I can see.\n\nSecond question, does anyone know how many days after the acceptances are released that financial aid packages are released for Cornell. It says they're released in Mid-December, just wondering if its usually like a week after the admissions notification or what..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo can I do that",

Perhaps think about all of the thousands of other applicants who are crossing fingers that they have a chance at the other schools you won\u2019t go to. It would be empathetic to withdraw your other applications to give others a chance out of the goodness of your heart except for CWRU . Thinking from someone else\u2019s perspective..other kids are waiting to hear and can\u2019t sleep over the fact that they may not get into their dream school and your spot that you\u2019re not going to take may impinge upon another\u2019s future acceptance. They hope to be like you and gain acceptance to a dream school too .",

I'm going to withdraw because I'll have an aid package before then,  but it's not like I'd be taking someone's spot because it's the early round. At the end of the day, me declining my offer means they'll give my spot to someone else.\n\nIf they hypothetically had 100 open spots, and 200 people applying. 100 people will be accepted including me, 50 deferred, and 50 rejected. If I decline my spot, it's not like there are now 99 full spots. There are now 99 full spots and 1 open one, which CWRU will eventually fill with someone else. So am I really taking someone else's potential place? Me waiting to reject a CWRU offer doesn't mean one extra person isn't going to get in, because wouldn't the next best person fill my empty spot in the regular round anyway?\n\nI think you're saying that every rejected spot (like what I would leave) is left empty and will not eventually filled with someone else. Because that's the only case in which I would get someone rejected. But that's not the case right? Schools account for people rejecting offers, and those newly empty spots are always filled.",
