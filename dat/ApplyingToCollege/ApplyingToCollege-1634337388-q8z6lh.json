  "text": "I\u2019m working on the supplements for the bs/md programs, and I feel like I\u2019m spending way too much time on the penn state one where I could use that time on other parts of the app - like the activities section which I didn\u2019t start. The penn state bs/md is due nov 1 so should I focus my time on other important things like the activities and my Ed supplement and if I have time do the penn state one in the end?",
