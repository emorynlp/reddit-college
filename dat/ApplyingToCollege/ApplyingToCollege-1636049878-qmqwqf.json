  "text": "So I live in western Nebraska and there aren\u2019t any colleges in my area that seem like a great fit for me. I\u2019m trans so I want to live somewhere where I\u2019ll be accepted/that\u2019s more urban, but most schools here don\u2019t really fit that bill and are also really far from hormone clinics. I\u2019ve looked at going out of state to some schools on the West Coast but I don\u2019t really want to go into a ton of debt yk. I have a 3.6 GPA and got a 33 on the ACT so I\u2019ll get some academic scholarships but it\u2019s not enough to go out of state. Also my family is upper middle class so I won\u2019t qualify for much financial aid at all and I just have no idea what college would be a good fit for me that\u2019s somewhat close\n\nI plan on majoring in computer science btw\n\nSorry if this is too broad of a question but I don\u2019t know where else I can go to find info on this, I\u2019ve done some Googling and haven\u2019t found any good options that aren\u2019t overly expensive - I don\u2019t want to stay in Nebraska really and don\u2019t like the University of Nebraska campuses",

There are plenty of other liberal LACs, but many of them wouldn't have the same kind of access to hormone clinics I would guess.",

As others have mentioned, check out Ohio State and Wisconsin. For Ohio State, if you apply for the Morill Scholarship and talk about your experiences as a trans individuals, you have a pretty good shot at getting the scholarship. \n\nAlso take a look at the Campus Pride Index to see what trans-affirming options different universities offer.\n\nI know you said you\u2019re not interested in UNL, but I would recommend applying (you can get a fee waiver) and submitting an application for the Raikes School. I\u2019d be happy to give you more info if you want.",
