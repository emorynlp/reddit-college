      "text": "UNC student here, as far as I've seen racism is pretty compartmentalized. By and large UNC is a fairly liberal school, not quite to the level of UC Berkeley but probably more so than your average large public school, and DEFINITELY more so than your average university in the South. Racism, sexism, homophobia, etc typically pool more so in the greek life (this is true of most universities) and some small sub-communities but by and large this is NOT indicative of the campus culture. If I were to walk through the Pit and scream obscenities about Trump I would generally not only feel safe to do so but would probably be met by agreement from a passerby or two (by contrast, pro-Trump people would probably also feel safe to do the opposite, although I can't imagine much vocal support). While not always perfect in its efforts, the administration seems aware of the university's sordid history and makes a visible effort to counter this going forward. I'm not saying bad things don't happen, but a lot of people really really care when they do/are brought to light. \n\nIf you like the school, apply. You can always visit and say no.",
