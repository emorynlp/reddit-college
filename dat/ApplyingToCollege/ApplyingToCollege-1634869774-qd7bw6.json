  "text": "so i have two options for this question and need some advice on which one is better:\n1. my favorite musical composition but it doesn\u2019t have any special title and there is no words. it is masterpiece but very few people know it\n2. quite popular song (no, it\u2019s not high hopes) with strong title but lyrics are a little off topic\n\ni don\u2019t think they listen songs from this question so in this case first option will be completely useless(\u00bf?)",
