  "text": "Okay so yeah even though I'm already in sixth form and probably would better go to university soon after or something else, I still kinda want to get some qualifications for other subjects by applying them in college after sixth form. Like I was hoping to take maths for sixth form but I couldn't since grades weren't greatest so I've retaken it and passed successfully. \n\nI was wondering if there are some available college courses when it comes to math to study for a year? I don't want to study it two years since I don't want spend over extended time but at the same time won't be minding that one year.",
