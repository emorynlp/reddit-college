      "text": "Interviews are not a big part of your application, but a good impression from the alumni would add value to tour application. They're usually very chill and casual, I gave one for Stanford a few days back it starts off as ....Tell me why you like cs (I applied cs).... Info about your EC (how it impacted you and all)... What do you think about XYZ... What do you like about Stanford. My interviewer was a data analyst (mid/late 20s) he was Indian had a similar background as me. My interview started rough because I'm a introvert but after the first 10min I got comfortable when we started talking about topics I was well versed with like elon musk becoming the richest man on earth, impact of cyptocurrency on the economy, cricket, math, Indian political system . He shared his number with me, It was 2 hrs long but I have heard some go for 30min and some extend to 3hrs. I hope this was helpful",
