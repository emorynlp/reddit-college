      "text": "Look at departmental webpages (usually in the Classics dept) and look for programs with a couple archaeologists. For undergrad that will be enough and many liberal arts colleges will have some people who lead digs.\n\nIf you're looking for powerhouses, it's not my specialty but it used to be the biggies were:\n\nClassical: Berkeley and Michigan, then maybe Cincinnati, Brown, Columbia, Texas and Penn. Bryn Mawr is small but well-respected for its size.\n\nMesoamerican: Tulane, Yale, Texas.\n\nEgypt and Near East: Chicago then JHU. Yale's Egyptology program imploded awhile back, not sure if it has rebounded but it was never as strong as the others.\n\nNative American: Arizona maybe...\n\nUnderwater archaeology: Texas A&M\n\nGeneral: UCLA (They have an archaeology program that is not within a specific dept. which is unusual in the US)\n\nCanada: I believe UBC\n\nThis information is a couple decades out of date, but traditionally strong departments tend to stay that way.",

I am guessing Chicago will replace the position, and not just hire an adjunct, but you never know.\n\nThis list seems valuable: https://brynmawrcollegeegyptologyassociation.digital.brynmawr.edu/egyptology-graduate-program-list/\n\nIn general, for undergrad Bryn Mawr seems top-notch for anything with the ancient Mediterranean. But because of genetic issues, that school wasn't an undergrad option for me.",
