  "title:": "Midyear transcript for selective colleges",
  "text": "Deadlines for midyear transcript are like Jan 1 or 3 of 2022 for these selective colleges (RD). First-semester finals will be on the  3rd week of December 2021 and school is on Christmas break for 2 weeks and comes back around January 5, 2022. Obviously, the guidance counselor will be out during the break. DO selective schools follow this strict guideline? or do selective schools give extra weeks for this midyear transcript to arrive? Thanks",
