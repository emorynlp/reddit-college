A summary of this in a good quote is \u201cyou need a nickname that AOs can tag to your application. A nickname on your application is better than a number\u201d. \n\nI might have trailed off from the main question, but hope this helps. \n\nFor credibility, my school is a T20 residential STEM high school. Our school sends 10-20 kids each year to ivies and T20s, 1-2 people a year go to Harvard or Stanford each year with my counselor guiding the top students.\n\nHope this helps!",

Even if my pack my transcript with rigor, would a \u201cUW low gpa (3.96)\u201d be a reason for rejection?",

After that, it would be up to your ecs, essays, hooks, etc. If you get rejected from a school, i\u2019d highly doubt it is because your gpa wasn\u2019t good enough.
