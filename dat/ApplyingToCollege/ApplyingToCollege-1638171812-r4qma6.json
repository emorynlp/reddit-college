  "text": "Technically the letter was to my dad, a Stanford alum.  It had well wishes on his daughter applying to Stanford and described how the process flows with legacies. It also listed what the acceptance rates were in the past and what they are now and talked about how many well qualified applicants they get. Blah, blah, blah.  \n\nSeeing an actual real paper envelope from Stanford admissions in the mail seriously made me stop breathing.  It was a nice personal touch, but just made it harder to wait.",
