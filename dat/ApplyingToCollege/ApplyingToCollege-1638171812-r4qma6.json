  "text": "Technically the letter was to my dad, a Stanford alum.  It had well wishes on his daughter applying to Stanford and described how the process flows with legacies. It also listed what the acceptance rates were in the past and what they are now and talked about how many well qualified applicants they get. Blah, blah, blah.  \n\nSeeing an actual real paper envelope from Stanford admissions in the mail seriously made me stop breathing.  It was a nice personal touch, but just made it harder to wait.",

I am interested in how the college admissions work and how they disadvantage those within poor communities- I was even apart of a specific club at my HS to help other students apply to higher ranked colleges since we come from a disadvantaged background. Right now I am reading a book called \u201c The Privileged Poor\u201d by Anthony Jack which talks about disadvantages in college admissions. I highly recommend it. \nCalling out this type of post is beneficial to me since it serves as a revelation moment where I realize this is a reality when it comes to college admissions and not an exaggerated issue that I thought it was when I was in high school since I had no exposure to the process of university level education at all. I think it is also helpful for those who are applying to college now to realize the disadvantages that are occurring during the admission process and to not feel bad if they get rejected from elite schools\u2014especially if they are coming from a low income background. It makes us all more aware it isn\u2019t just acceptance and rejection- there is more to that.",
