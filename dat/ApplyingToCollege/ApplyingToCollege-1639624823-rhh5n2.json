  "text": "I read the Applying Sideways article as well as talked to a few high school seniors, and they all pretty much say to follow your passion as best you can. But it\u2019s halfway through my sophomore year, and I haven\u2019t found anything that I love with a passion and I\u2019m getting concerned because then I\u2019ll be behind everyone else. Is this normal? Or do I just pick something I somewhat like and just go with it?",

      "text": "As frustrating as this may sound, I think you should just chill out. You can\u2019t force a passion for something, it will just have to come to you naturally. That may take some time, but when it arises it will be obvious. You are not behind at all in the process, you\u2019ve got another year till things get a bit more serious with the application process so you have time. If you would like a place to begin to try and find your passion, focus on things that you do that make you happy and see if that branches out. Best of luck.",

      "text": "You will find your passion, don't worry! I was on a similar boat my sophomore year - I loved music but didn't have the work ethic needed to study it in college, I loved creative writing but couldn't bring myself to finish anything I wrote, etc etc. Basically everything I liked enough was something I didn't really see myself studying in college.\n\nI only found my passion for physics halfway through junior year! Take your time, you'll find something you're super interested it eventually. Even if you won't in high school, college is a time to figure that stuff out. I wouldn't worry about it.",
