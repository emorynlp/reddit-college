  "text": "Is a high cc gpa worth less than a high hs gpa? I'm mainly talking about oos schools. Am I gonna have to limit my options? I know it's probably going to be alot harder to get into an ivy, but what about t100s? I'm not taking my state schools out of the equation, I'm just scared I'm gonna have to reach lower.",

      "text": "Typically No, but where your cc is at helps. If your in California you have a good chance of getting into T30s like UCLA,UCB, & USC. You could still transfer into these schools from a different state but they prioritize California CC students. \n\nTake a look at the [transfer rates for the t50s](https://transferweb.com/stats/transfer-acceptance-rates/#.YYp7fyU8KEc) a good percentage of the transfers accepted are CC students.\n\nSo as long as your student profile is up to par, you have a shot anywhere.
