  "text": "My mom always gets onto me for not being like her. She graduated top 10 and was very active within sports. I want to go to college for agricultural sciences but she says a 3.3 gpa makes me very unappealing even though I've been an officer for an agricultural club for 3 out of 4 years of hs (cant be one as a freshman) and i'm very active within said agriculture classes. I've taken Dual credit as well but she said that out of 6 classes ive taken the lowest grade I ever got was a 70 and the highest was an 88 so I wont look too hot for colleges. I only want to apply to Texas A&M University and Sam Houston State University but idk, my mom just does not believe in me. Am I taking her words too harshly?",

But the chart for SHSU, at a glance, makes admission seem realistic)",

      "text": "Please ignore your mom. 3.3 is a solid B+ and is fine. You're active in what you want to study, you're interested in things, and you've got dual credits under your belt, which show college rigor. Texas A&M is a good reach, and you're a fine target for SHSU. \n\nPlease ignore your mother. Hopefully she'll cool down after you get those apps in. It's possible she just needs to see one acceptance to know that you're going *somewhere* and that you're a decent candidate , so consider applying to an extremely safe safety that has rolling admissions.",

      "text": "I just wrote a whole huge comment but my app crashed so I\u2019m gonna paraphrase what I said real quick.\n\nFirst - would not hurt to use either Naviance (or if your school doesn\u2019t have it, Niche) to check what results people who\u2019ve applied from your school to a college have achieved.\n\nSecond - you have a shot at both. Your mother is either being an ass or doesn\u2019t know any better. A bunch of schools will take a 3.3. However you should specify whether that\u2019s a weighted 3.3 or not and if you\u2019re gonna take the SAT (A solid SAT will help you a bit for sure). Texas A&M is a high reach for you but SHSU is absolutely a realistic target for you and I would apply to both.\n\nThird - if you\u2019re willing/can afford to go out of state there are a good amount of schools that are less selective than A&M who also have good AgSci programs. Kansas State, Virginia Tech, Oklahoma State, Iowa State, UIdaho, Washington State, and Colorado State all apparently have t30 AgSci programs and are much easier to get into than A&M. Even in state, if you don\u2019t hate Lubbock Texas Tech has a solid program and is again much easier to get into than A&M.  If you aren\u2019t 100% committed to staying in state, and you have the money for application fees or can get fee waivers, I would honestly apply to all of those schools because I think you could absolutely get into at least one. Don\u2019t let your mother dissuade you from applying places just because you were a B\u2019s and C\u2019s student instead of all A\u2019s, there are absolutely places out there for you.",
