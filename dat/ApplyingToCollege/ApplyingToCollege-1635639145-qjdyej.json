Note that not all colleges/universities participate!\n\n## America\u2019s largest regional interstate tuition savings program\n\nThe Western Undergraduate Exchange (WUE) is an agreement among WICHE\u2019s 16 member states and territories, through which 160+ participating public colleges and universities provide steep nonresident tuition savings for Western students.\n\nThrough WUE,\u00a0eligible\u00a0students can choose from hundreds of undergraduate programs outside their home\u00a0state, and\u00a0pay no more than 150 percent of that institution\u2019s resident tuition rate. \n\nSince full nonresident college-tuition rates may exceed 300 percent of resident rates, WUE increases affordable higher-education choices for students, and minimizes the adverse impacts of student loan debt.",
