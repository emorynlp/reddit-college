How should I say proceed? \n\nI\u2019m worried Bc me getting an interview in the first place means that they \u201cneed more information from me.\u201d\n\nWhat should I do? Call admissions office? Let it go?",

Not everyone receives an interview, they are primarily given on the basis of availability of the alumni who are willing to do them. They matter very little, if at all, in your application, and exist primarily as a way for you to learn about the school.\n\nFor example, a Princeton adcom member has said that \u201c\u2018At Princeton, she said of applicant interviews, \u201cthey didn\u2019t matter that much.\u2019\u201d\n\nOther sources estimate the interview to be at max \u201c5% of your application\u201d, saying that \u201cIn truth, college admissions committees give less weight to the interview than commonly believed. The interview actually counts for around 5% of your total application.\u201d\n\nIn sum, don\u2019t worry about it. The interview is just a different way for you to feel the vibe of a college by talking to someone who went there. It won\u2019t help you get in, they\u2019re not given to students because they want more info about you, they just ask their alumni when they\u2019re available and try to match them up with as many applicants as possible.
