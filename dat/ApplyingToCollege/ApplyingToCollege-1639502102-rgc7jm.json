  "text": "Hi everyone, I just got into my ED school (woohoo!!), but haven\u2019t rescinded my applications from the other schools I applied to. One of the schools is coming out on the 20th and I worked hard on my essays/already paid the application fee, so I kind of want to see if I get in or not. Not sure what to do!! Of course, I won\u2019t go to any of the other schools I applied to, but I would love to see other places I could\u2019ve been at since we only go through this process once and we\u2019ve worked so hard for it too. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",
