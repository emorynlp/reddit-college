I am approaching it expecting a rejection so that I don't get my hopes high (but I applied thinking I will get accepted). \n\ncase 1. I get accepted: Jump around the house, celebrate and go write my chem exam\n\ncase 2. I get rejected: I will say to myself, \"ahh, got what I expected\", then take a printout of the rejection letter and stick it on my wall, so that it reminds me of this moment till I get into a college. Then listen to music, watch an episode of silicon valley, clear my mind and then go write my chem exam.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeace",
