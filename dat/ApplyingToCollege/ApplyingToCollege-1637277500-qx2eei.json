  "text": "has y'all heard of anyone who applied early to washu who had the interview they signed up for canceled? i got an email last thursday that said because i applied ed1 and they were only going to consider interviews before nov 15 for ed1 applicants, my interview had been canceled. this is what the email they sent said: \n\nWe were excited to receive your\u00a0ED1\u00a0application and look forward to reviewing it. \n\nWe noticed that you are currently scheduled for an\u00a0interview\u00a0after November 15th, which is the\u00a0deadline\u00a0for\u00a0ED1 students to receive an\u00a0interview. Unfortunately, we are unable to consider\u00a0interviews for\u00a0ED1\u00a0students after this date, and therefore we will have to cancel your\u00a0interview\u00a0at this time.\n\nPlease remember that the\u00a0interview\u00a0isn\u2019t required, and this cancellation has no impact on your admissions decision.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions.\n\ni had no idea when i signed up for the interview that it needed to be before nov 15; there was no indication of that when i signed up. has anyone heard of this happening to anyone else?",
