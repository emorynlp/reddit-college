  "text": "What are some good safety schools for someone who wants to go into mechanical engineering. I'm from Idaho and the schools here don't have the best engineering programs. I'm at a dilemma where I think the ivies and some other private schools will be cheaper than the top public universities because I'm middle class. The top schools don't have many Merit scholarships, and the top public schools won't give me much need based aid. What are some cool universities with good mechanical engineering programs that would give large merit based scholarships to someone with a great application? Thanks for the help!",
