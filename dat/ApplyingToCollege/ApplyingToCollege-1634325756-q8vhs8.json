  "text": "Hello,\n\nI know all the memes about going test optional with a 34, but hear me out for a sec. Carnegie Mellon doesn't superscore, so I will be applying with 35M, 35S, 34E, 33R (34 ovr). I'm pretty sure I'm gonna submit this score to all my colleges and I have no plans of retaking this bumass test. Only thing I'm worried about are these crazy statistics with the CMU SCS, where the middle 50% scores are all 35-36, except for math where it's literally 36. That would mean my score in each section automatically places me on the bottom 25% of students. I'm pretty sure the rest of my application is fine anyway, so do y'all think I should go test optional or just submit it. \n\nThanks in advance (also sorry if I sound pretentious, genuinely curious why the stats are so high)",

          "text": "True lol but since I got 33 in reading and 34 in english when the 50th percentile is 35-36 I assume I'm even lower than that. That being said the only reason I'm asking this question is because CMU statistics are much higher than others (MIT: 34-36, Stanford: 32-35, etc.) and if they're skewed because they care so much about the test score then I might as well not give them an argument to compare me.",
