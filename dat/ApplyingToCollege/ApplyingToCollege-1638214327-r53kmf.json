  "text": "im barely making it to school on time every single day, and im getting less than 6 hours of sleep a night. im mega lost in my classes like to the point where i can't even watch youtube videos to catch up. and in the classes that im semi-understanding, the teachers fr have no chill. my ap csp teacher gives us a quiz, 2-3 assignments, and a huge coding project per week...dawg, this is principles...\n\ni rarely have time for college apps since im staying up at 3 am on saturdays and sundays doing homework or attempting to once again catch up on work\n\ni have no motivation, and this is probably the unhappiest i've been in a while. i don't even have the time to do the things i actually want to do cuz im taking 2-hour naps after school to try and make up for the horse-sleep quantity im getting. i just wanna give up and stop caring about my grades\n\nim not even living, im surviving bruh",
