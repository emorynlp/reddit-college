  "text": "In all of my classes I have almost all A- with not many A's or A+'s. Like 90 to 94. Since my school grades A- as a lower gpa(-.2) for every gpa tier lowered. So an A- counts less than a A+. Even with getting mostly A-, I'm still like 50 places from reaching been the bottom 10%. How do colleges view this? Ik they recalculate it but when they glance through my application, will it look worse?",
