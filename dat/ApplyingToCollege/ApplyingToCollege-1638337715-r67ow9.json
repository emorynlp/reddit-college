      "text": "Practice these 2 strategies till you perfect them (saying based on experience here):\n\n1. When you feel a fart coming, and no one's looking, put your left palm (or right) beneath your left thigh (or right). Your pelvis is now inclined to the seat. Lift your right butt a little, apply pressure on your left palm using your left butt and shift your right butt a little more to the right so that your asshole is wide open. The fart should pass silently. Alternatively, if the chair you're sitting on lacks armrests, shift a little to the left or right until 75% of one butt is hanging out of the chair. Again, try to stretch open your asshole for the fart to pass silently.\n2. If people are looking and it would be weird to try strategy 1, use the old but very effective 'screenshot' technique - fart and cough simultaneously. While this may be simple, I'd recommend you to practice it beforehand so that you get the timing correct and do not end up drawing attention from the loud af cough and then ripping one out.",
