  "text": "Hey y'all!\n\nSo soon I will have to pick my college major, and I'm lost in the process. I enjoy and do well in every subject in school, and I can see myself going down a lot of routes. The problem is I just can't choose one. Right now, I'm leaning toward the humanities (specifically English and Philosophy) as those interest me the most. I've seen a lot about the poor job prospects of those, though. Financial security is important to me, but I'm scared to go down professional degree paths like engineering or CS when I'm so indecisive about careers.\n\nI hear the liberal arts sold as a broad education that will let you work in many different fields, which excites me. I'm willing to develop skills and work hard in college to set myself up for a good job, but how far will learning hard skills like coding and doing internships to supplement a humanities major go?\n\nIs anyone else in the same position or able to give advice? Should I just suck it up and go into STEM?",

      "text": "Very rarely does a humanities major end up directly leading to a career in the same field.   \n\n\nIf you're worried about job skills, you could always double major in Philosophy and Computer Science. Heck... you might graduate with that double major and decide you want to go to law school, or go into the Peace Corps.   \n\n\nTLDR: The link between major and career is not always linerar and that's OK. I know people working at Goldman who majored in the humanities, not finance, for example.",

Any work that involves writing is a good path for a humanities major, and more companies need good writers than you may think. \n\nI\u2019m an English concentrator and I\u2019m planning on becoming a teacher. Not necessarily high paying, but I\u2019m really good at helping kids. Another option is becoming a tutor, which could be more high-paying.",

      "text": ">I'm scared to go down professional degree paths like engineering or CS when I'm so indecisive about careers.\n\nEven as someone who's not majoring in CS, the nice thing about CS is it can kind of be a pathway into anything. Pretty much every field nowadays uses CS to at least some extent, and it's probably the most employable degree out there right now. In fact, some common advice is that if you're not sure what you want to do, and you're good at math and logic, major in CS.\n\n>Right now, I'm leaning toward the humanities (specifically English and Philosophy)\n\nCS and philosophy make a really great combination. The two are more connected than you may think, considering they're both pretty much just applications of logic, with CS just using more math. \n\nCS + Philosophy is also offered pretty widely. Northeastern has a combined major in CS and Philosophy. Purdue has a dual degree program in CS and Philosophy (as well as another in data science and philosophy if you're interested in that). Even if it\u2019s not specifically offered, at a lot of schools, you could declare a double major in CS and Philosophy, or major in one and minor in the other.",
