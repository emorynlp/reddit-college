  "text": "everytime I see someone say they're economically privileged on here and attend an expensive competitive high-school I get so jealous and im not sorry. I'm happy for u but its messed up how some people don't need to worry about resources or money or getting into a good school to be able to go to college at all. and can afford tutors, college advisors, summer programs and trips and whatnot. while I believe I have a strong profile despite being extremely underprivileged, poor, a person of color, AND living in a small island I can't help but think about how unfair it is and the things I wouldn't even need to worry about if I had different circumstances.\n\nEDIT: some of u guys don't get it. I'm happy for those with privilege, but it's also good to point it out to u guys. and for those trying to make a point that we struggle the same amount in different ways, you are completely tone deaf and do not live on planet earth. you will never have to worry about your basic necessities being met, not being able to go to college at ALL if its not a top one because of ur financial situation (and trying to get into a top college with extremely low resources, low tier schools, no tutors, no college advisors, no expensive summer programs, no impressive curriculums etc), fearing or not being able to go to college because you have to help your family out with their financial situation, putting your education and dreams on hold because things like keeping you and your family alive and able to EAT are more important, and even when we get to college there are so many expenses we'll have that extra stress of \"do I have enough financial aid to finish 4 years with no debt? do I have to get a third job? I can't go out eating with my friends tonight because I won't have any money until next month.\" you guys will never struggle with that. your college will be paid for and you won't stress about your basic necessities and balancing 3 jobs and college to graduate without debt. so don't sit there and think we're the same. we're not. I'm happy for you but recognize your privilege. \n\nalso makes me uncomfortable that most of y'alls ECs are about helping poor kids but then you're trying to tell me it's not that bad. does that mean you dedicated those hours so they'd look good on paper? jesus.",

      "text": "My county (in the US) had to send computers, an internet plan, and food to our students. Because without school, these kids wouldn\u2019t have food daily. \n\nNot to mention the lack of internet access. The county made a deal with an internet provider to provide us with low cost internet, and had to send computers to thousands of students.\n\nSadly, many of parents had to work while their kids stayed at home doing zoom. Daycares are expensive, but even those were closed. \n\nImagine having to leave your 5 year old at home by themselves in a zoom class, just so you could have enough money to keep the apartment. \n\nImagine a 5 year old walking by themselves down two blocks to the bus stop in a bad neighborhood just so they could get food. \n\nMy friend was walking to her bus stop two years ago, and her friend was kidnapped in front of all of those kids. The people stopped their van, grabbed the girl from the bus stop and took her. And no one could do anything. They found the girl mutilated two days later. Her death was extremely violent. \n\nAnd this is *normal* for my area. Multiple kids disappear and appear a week later dead. Some of them friends, others faces I recognized, others unfamiliar but just as sad. This is the suburbs, a kind of place most people expect to be some safe manicured lawn type place. It\u2019s not. \n\nAnd you have to send your 5 year old down past all those houses by themselves to get food from the bus driver. You had to pray that you came home to your child and that they were alive. \n\nAs for me, right before Fall 2021 started, I was being watched. Someone was on our porch, watching me in my living room. Our porch is large meaning they came up to the window quietly without me noticing. Without me hearing. \n\nAnd then I heard them shuffle. Maybe they forgot to be quiet. Maybe they wanted me to know they were there. I ran upstairs and hid in the hallway trying to yell my parents awake. They didn\u2019t wake up. Half an hour later, someone tried opening the door. Our door can easily be busted down. But they just jingled the door knob back and forth. It\u2019s almost like they were messing with me. It\u2019s been almost 4 months and it still scares me.\n\nI see a lot of comments saying that it\u2019s hard being at a competitive school. That\u2019s extremely tone deaf to what\u2019s going on. \n\nGrowing up poor can give children chronic trauma. Literal diagnosable trauma. Some even end up with PTSD from poverty. \n\nI starved myself a week or two at a time, just so my dad would have enough food to take to work the next day. I have nightmares where the police come and take our home. I take public transit and I sit in fear if one of these shifty men are going to hurt me because my family can\u2019t afford a 2,000 used car for me. My mom doesn\u2019t have US citizenship (she\u2019s a green card alien) because we can\u2019t afford the 500 US citizenship test and I worry about her being illegally deported. I take transit back home wondering if my brother is still alive because he walks to the bus stop. What if some people take and hurt him like they did to that girl? \n\nMy siblings and I played outside in our driveway like most kids, and someone tried to kidnap my little brother. We were lucky our neighbors shot the mf with their gun in his knee. It\u2019s not even safe to play outside here, and you almost never hear children playing despite there being 15-20 kids at the bus stop every weekday. \n\nTelling people to be grateful for what they have can be harmful. I\u2019m grateful I have a roof over my head, yes. I\u2019m not grateful that our family has been put in a situation where we HAVE to get a home in this dangerous area. I gaslighted myself for years, saying that others have it worse. Yeah others have it worse. But they shouldn\u2019t. And our situation shouldn\u2019t exist either.",

And so I was just looking for some satisfying rants on reddit. But your situation is so fucked up, I started feeling grateful for my life. I thought I had it bad when I went to a school with a majority of really ghetto kids. I hated trying to survive in that environment because I clearly didn't fit there. I wished my parents would send me to a more intellectual school. I survived 10 years of school and finally felt real peace when I scored good marks and went to college. If getting into schools was also a merit based process, I would be much happier in those 10 years. But as kids you are forced to live in an environment which your parents can afford and sometimes that scars you for life. I hope you are doing well. I hope you get out of that hostile place. My prayers for you",

But whenever someone goes on a rant about those quoted things specifically, I seem to not understand.\n\nFor tutors, I'm aware of several free options for both standardized testing and specific school subjects. I understand that you can get enhanced tutoring by paying thousands of dollars, but many of us seem to be doing perfectly fine without those expensive tutors. I personally never paid a single cent on resources to get my ACT score.\n\nFor college advisors, again, so many free options...especially for low-income URM students. I was able to get a free advisor who has done amazing and truly has helped me 24/7 despite not getting paid. And she's on the other side of the country nonetheless.\n\nI attended a few summer programs that were really insightful for my career path and opened up a whole lot of new opportunities for me as well, under need-based scholarships as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut overall going to a...well... \"non-impressive\" school with low standards for curriculum and barely any ways to get truly involved sucks. Hard. The best thing we can do with ourselves is try our best to seize every available opportunity outside of our school, because as I may have highlighted above, its perfectly possible to get the resources privileged kids have. I too am worried that I wont get into a top school with good fin' aid, but sometimes I'm even more worried about my lower-middle class extended family who will have to pay full tuition no mater where they go..\n\nBut everyone wishes they had more money right? What exactly do you suppose we should do about the lower class not having as many resources as the upper class?",

My parents were immigrant parents who barely knew how to say hey in English when they first moved here. Of course they both came when they were in high school. They both attended public schools and attended great universities. Neither of my parents had the privilege and resources they give me. However, I am nothing but grateful. I know how hard they worked to put me and my siblings in the spot we are in today. It\u2019s unfair. I know. Trust me I\u2019ve heard my parent\u2019s stories. However, don\u2019t let something like this bring you down or make you angry at other students. Use this as fuel. Work twice as hard. Give your future kids the opportunity and resources you wanted. You won\u2019t regret it. Remember hard work beats talent when talent isn\u2019t working hard ;)",

Other privileged people might only appear privileged while in reality they are actually not. My point is, don\u2019t focus on college admissions as a competition against others, where some face obstacles and some have advantages. Think of the process as a challenge for yourself; to grow, to change, to be better as a person. The most valuable thing each person has in their application is their individual, and how they put themselves forth is the factor that makes or breaks many applications. Focus not on the less than 200 people who actually get in because their dad donated a building. Focus not on the people who seem to have it easy, as their challenges might be hidden from you and others. Think about yourself and your goals, and with enough effort, you will achieve them.",
