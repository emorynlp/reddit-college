  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m a recent 2020 grad with a BS in economics. I was considering going back and getting a second bachelors in CS because I want to work in tech. I\u2019m curious on how the process would work, since I graduated from a state school with a mere 3.0 GPA. How would applying to a different, more prestigious school work? Do I apply as a transfer student or a new student taking the ACT again?",

You could get into a program with conditional admittance (meaning you have to take some basic CS undergrad courses before you can take graduate courses).

I would look for something else, even a quick and dirty masters designed for someone like you. I keep seeing ads for this one, probably a fortune and hard to get into: https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/data-science/\n\nMaybe you could find something like it though\n\nMy local community college has some great CS classes/certificates",
