  "text": "I\u2019m applying to more than 10 schools, so I know I need to remove schools from my list and then add new ones. But, if I haven\u2019t yet applied to a school but my FAFSA is processed and they\u2019re on the list, is it ok to replace them before I\u2019ve submitted the application to their school?",

You may need to email/call each school currently on your FAFSA list and ask them whether they've downloaded your info, and/or what triggers that to happen (e.g. submitting an application).",
