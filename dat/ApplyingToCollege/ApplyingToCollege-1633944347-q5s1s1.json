  "title:": "Overasked Question about Teacher's Gmails",
  "text": "So long time ago I posted that my my school doesn't have its own email system and so my teachers use their own personal Gmails for LOR and stuff and a user on here said that it's a common issue and I'll be fine. So like yesterday someone told me that T20s might not consider LORs from personal Gmails, and I searched online for a bit (NOT on college confidential lol) and many people are saying that ivies and other T20s don't recognise the authenticity of LORs sent from personal mail. What would you advice me to do... If there is even anything I can do about this??\n\n\n\n(u/prsehgal , u/skieurope12  any thoughts?)",

In most such cases, it's best to get your letter printed on a school letterhead and get it signed and stamped by the school authorities for authentication.",

Oh, and the school's logo is visible at the top of the letter. is that all enough to verify the authenticity of my letters of recommendation since my school doesn't have their own email address system?",
