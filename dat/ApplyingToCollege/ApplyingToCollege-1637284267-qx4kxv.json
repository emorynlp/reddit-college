  "text": "Hi,\n\nI know Thanksgiving is a week from now, but I just want to take the opportunity to express my gratitude for this subreddit. I'm thankful to know that I'm not alone in my struggles, failures, successes, experiences, and in the journey of life in general. I'm thankful that there is a community like this one, where I can learn and participate \u2013 and I've asked more than a few questions \u2013 to expand my perspective. Especially to the mods and the people who make this thing work behind the scenes, thank you for managing 500K+ members like me. \n\nMaybe I can\u2019t repay my gratitude, but I can express it by writing this hopefully warm note. Y'know, I've been fortunate to meet people who transformed my life, who inspired me to stay engaged, curious, and motivated to learn. Here's to those people as well. \n\nHere's to community and gratitude. \n\nHere's to Thanksgiving. \n\nI hope you enjoy this holiday and thank people too. If you don't mind, I'd encourage y'all to comment on something you're grateful for, just to keep the spirit flying high. Thanks! Happy Thanksgiving!!! (in advance lol)",
