  "text": "My UC deadline is in less than 20 days and I still have my last essay to write. I know exactly what to write but I just can\u2019t seem to write anything. And it\u2019s not just this deadline. I started writing essays in September and in one month I had pumped out 16 quality essays that had been edited and passed the reviews of multiple people. Now I just can\u2019t seem to write. Tips please I wanna go to college",
