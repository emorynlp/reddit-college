  "text": "I half decided and half was forced to not apply ed (wifi cut off at like 11:55 \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29(I decided earlier in the day not to ed and then kinda panicked, that\u2019s why I hadn\u2019t done it sooner cuz I literally wasn\u2019t planning on it)) and since then I\u2019ve been feeling quite shitty. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing and I\u2019m so done with the process right now but I don\u2019t feel like I can take a break. This is such a hell process, why do they do it this way? Anyone want to sit down to a cup of tea and cry about it?",

I did submit several eas, which is good, but I\u2019m not sure what my favorite school is anymore, what I should aim for, because my previous one is off the table now until rd. I\u2019d assume it feels similarly with a prestigious ed, like now where do you go? I\u2019d assume that was a top choice if you were eding. Anyways, feel you bro",

I'm happy the deadline passed and we can calm down for a while. anyway the overwhelming majority of students get in rd. and getting emotionally attatched to one college is dangerous lol",

It\u2019d be helpful to hear from those other stupid people who thought they knew what they wanted but don\u2019t know anymore - whether that\u2019s someone who didn\u2019t do ed and realizes they wanted to, or did and wants to withdraw. At this point it\u2019s not realizing I was stupid, it\u2019s giving myself a pat on the back because I can\u2019t do anything about it except move forward.",

I don\u2019t have the mental barrier between me and regret, so even though I genuinely made the decision not to ed, it doesn\u2019t mean i feel like I made the right decision, even though not eding was literally was the conclusion I came to up until 11:50. Yes I know my ass is stupid, but im trying to move forward and crippling uncertainty doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019m here to commiserate for those who need it.",
