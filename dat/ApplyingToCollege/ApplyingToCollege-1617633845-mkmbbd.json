  "title:": "To tomorrow's rejects (which, get real, is basically all of you):",
  "text": "Congratulations! You've worked your ass off for at least the past 4 years, and now you've convinced yourself that you've got a shot at getting into some of the most elite schools in the country. If this is you, don't get me wrong, you *do* have a shot. Just not a very good one, and it's largely beyond your control.\n\nSome of you will be ecstatic tomorrow, and I'm happy for you. You should be. But believe me, for you rejects who browse this sub, you'll feel like you're one of the only ones who received that rejection letter.\n\nI was here back in 2018. Like many of you, I had my perfect ACT score, my own small business, dozens of ECs, etc, etc. Yet - you don't realize until you go through the admissions process just how much of a crapshoot ivy admissions are. These schools can only accept around 5% of applicants (or less - looking at you, Harvard). Now, consider the type of students who *actually* apply. You're not competing to be the top 5% of *all* high school students; you're competing to be \"the top\" 5% of students who got 28+ on the ACT, a 3.8+ GPA, took 5+ AP classes, and won national champions in various school clubs. There is no real \"top\" of this caliber of student, and many of you will discover that tomorrow.\n\nWhen - not *if -* you get rejected from every single top school you applied to, just know that you'll be ok. [**Here's a very famous study**](https://www.nber.org/papers/w17159) **that found, when controlling for student ability, the return on career earnings of an ivy league education over that of a non-selective school is generally indistinguishable from 0.**\n\nI was outright rejected by Princeton, Stanford, Columbia, Yale, Vanderbilt, and about a dozen others that I no longer remember. I was waitlisted and then rejected by Harvard and Georgetown. Ultimately, I ended up choosing to attend my state school.\n\nThat decision was the best I have ever made. To those of you who are great students, but who will get the shit end of the stick in tomorrow's decisions, consider the opportunities you will find at your future non-target school:\n\n1. You'll have easy access to tens of thousands of dollars more in scholarship funding than you would if you attended an elite school. You'll be the top of your class without much difficulty, and people will notice. When you're in that position, you can earn $20-40k on top of tuition direct-deposited into your bank account each year from cash scholarships (just make sure to save some for taxes). It might take a year or so, but once you're in school, constantly be on the lookout for the most valuable scholarships: A single essay is often worth $10k+.\n2. You'll be able to make strong connections with the most prominent professors from your school. True, you won't be meeting Raj Chetty, but you'll have the chance to network with well-known academics, and you'll strongly stand out. At an ivy, you'll be just one brilliant face among many. At a non-target, you'll be much more present.\n3. You'll have access to *the best* internships and experiences your school has to offer. Trust me - whatever your field, you'll find some *incredible* opportunities that many ivy students could only dream of. (My freshman year, I did the exact same internship as a graduating Harvard senior and a UPenn junior. Trust me on this - you'll find great opportunities.)\n\nYou don't need an ivy on your resume. Considering the study linked above, you wouldn't even earn a better return by attending an ivy than attending a far less expensive school that will, in turn, offer you many exclusive opportunities.\n\nI know you'll be disappointed tomorrow when you open rejection after rejection. That's completely understandable. At the same time, I want you to recognize that your success in life does not depend on tomorrow's results. In the long run, tomorrow is relatively unimportant. **What** ***is*** **important, however, is that you maintain the focus on hard work, determination, and personal excellence that has allowed you to succeed so effectively in high school.** If you can do that, I guarantee you'll find success.",

Employers today really prioritize diversity of thought. I\u2019m based in NYC and we noticed our team was heavy on Columbia and NYU grads, (who are brilliant but can be similar in many different ways), so now we really look to hire young people from all types of schools (or even those who didn\u2019t go to college).

          "text": "Thank you!\n\nWith number 3, most (all?) universities have career services offices or other programs to help students land jobs and internships. If you have solid credentials, they'll be willing to help you get the most impressive opportunities they have connections to. I guarantee they have *some* connections in D.C. (if you're interested in politics) or Silicon Valley (if you're interested in tech), or with think tanks (if you like research), or with foreign governments (if you love international affairs). I don't know about *all* fields of study, but as long as you seek out those offices at your university, they'll be able to help you connect with good opportunities. My most enjoyable and impressive internship was through one of these student services. \n\nAdditionally, it's related to number 2 because your professors will also be able to connect you with great opportunities. For example, one of my professors knew the prime minister of a tiny foreign country, and helped me get in touch with him. I did a consulting and research internship where I worked directly for that prime minister the following summer. It's such a unique and cool experience, and I only got it because I stood out to that professor. \n\nMy main point with 3 is that if you go to a school where you'll clearly stand out as one of the top students, people will help you find awesome opportunities. My sense (although what I've heard may not be universally true) is that it is much more difficult to create these sorts of essential connections if you attend an ivy, simply because it is much more difficult to really stand out.",

One of my professors literally pulled me aside after class sophomore year to ask if I had an internship lined up for the summer.  He helped me land a trading internship on Wall Street.  I got to do TONS of other amazing things that went far beyond the normal student experience.  Large universities have immense resources and they are NOT distributed evenly, *not even close.*  The best students get the vast majority of the internships, research, and other opportunities.",

          "text": "Another story from someone who went to a regional state school ranked below T100: I saw a random flyer for a cool summer program at a T30. My professors had zero experience with the program, but I realized that our new college dean was an alumni and former department head at the (T30) school putting on the program. Faculty and staff at my midwestern school generally are pretty humble, down to earth and friendly. I sent an email directly to the Dean's office asking to learn more about his experience at his former school and if he knew anything about the particular summer program. He got back to me, we chatted, and it was really informative! I applied and ended up participating in the program that summer. So in summary: 1) read all the random flyers and emails you get and 2) even if your professors themselves haven't done something, chances are someone else at the university has or they may know someone who has. Leverage big state school networks.",

For black and Hispanic students and for students who come from less-educated families (in terms of their parents' education), the estimates of the return to college selectivity remain large, even in models that adjust for unobserved student characteristics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It is also possible that the benefit in terms of future earnings from attending a selective college varies across students, and that students sort into college based on their perceived benefit. For example, students who expect a lucrative career because they intend to earn an M.B.A. after college may sort into less selective undergraduate colleges. If students sort on the basis of their idiosyncratic return from attending a selective college, then equation (1) cannot be given a causal interpretation. However, if this is the case, then our results suggest that the typical student does not unambiguously benefit from attending the most selective college to which he or she was admitted. Rather, our results would suggest that students need to think carefully about the fit between their abilities and interests, the attributes of the school they attend, and their career aspirations.",

          "text": "Happy to! Most schools provide some entrance scholarships, which are usually based around tuition and maybe housing costs. These scholarships are a fantastic help to any student!\n\nHowever, from what I have seen (and YMMV), once you get into the school, you can find many additional scholarship opportunities. For example, I'm double-majoring, and as a result of that, I was able to apply for the top scholarships in each of my majors (which are $10k and $12k per year, respectively, stacked on top of tuition). I also applied for multiple other university scholarships, which total to $14k per year, on average. All of this together ($36k/year) is on top of the entrance scholarship tuition waiver I received, so it gets sent to me in cash each year. I didn't get these non-entrance scholarships when I first entered the school because they were only available for declared or second-year+ students.  \n\nIt's certainly not guaranteed money, and each year there has been a possibility that my scholarships won't get renewed. However, there are also national scholarship programs that can provide additional support if you need it (although I am not too familiar with those programs). \n\nThis is the part of my post that can vary the most depending on which school you attend and what your major is, but my school is certainly not a rich one, yet they have plenty of these scholarships available. I think the likelihood is high that similar scholarships will be available wherever you ultimately choose to attend. **Just reach out to your scholarship office, academic advisor on campus, and the directors of your major. They'll be able to point you to some great scholarship offerings.**",

          "text": "I agree with you, but only as far as the \"top\" 0.01% of finance or consulting firms are concerned. Going to a state school, you can still find ample opportunities at very prestigious firms in the industry like Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, BCG, etc. Barely any *ivy league* students even have access to the firms you're talking about.\n\nAlso, from the people I've talked to, an ivy certainly helps with quickly getting into a top 5 MBA, but it is not essential by any means.",

          "text": "If it's that bad, you could look OOS. Many state colleges have full-ride scholarships for OOS students (although I am sure they are generally very competitive). Even without a full-ride, you'd get in-state tuition within like 1 year, which is not a bad deal. However, I'm sure your state school *would* have many opportunities regardless. I know it's stressful to think about, but I'm sure it will work out for you :)",
