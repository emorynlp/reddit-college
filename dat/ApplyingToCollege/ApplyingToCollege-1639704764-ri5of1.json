  "text": "Like I\u2019m obviously so so so proud of my friends!! I\u2019ve watched them struggle, cried with them, edited their essays, spent hours upon hours rereading their application, etc. I know they\u2019ve worked so hard for this. I can\u2019t thing of people more qualified to go to these schools. \n\nUnderneath the surface, I just feel so sad. I got rejected from Cornell. My best friends are going to Brown, UPenn, Emory, Stanford, and Duke (update: and now Princeton) HELL MY TWIN BROTHER IS GOING TO UPENN. Everyone is so excited for him, and so am I, but I feel so inadequate??? \n\nI am the ONLY ONE in our friend group to not get into my ED. I just feel so\u2026 stupid? I got into GT, which I\u2019m so proud about. But like, what\u2019s wrong with me? Why couldn\u2019t I do it? \n\n\nI hate that I feel this way. I want to be a good friend and a good sister. Someone, please tell me what I need to do to make my brain realize that just because I didn\u2019t get into Cornell, I can\u2019t be bitter to my friends.",

So just think of Cornell as an ex boyfriend and just imagine that he did something bad to you, like abused you or cheated on you and just get over him. Become a player and start looking into other colleges and find one that catches your eye. Spend hours day after day just looking around the college's website and other stuff related to that college. Move on from your ex and get a new crush!",

BESTIEEE GEORGIA TECH IS AMAZING! I'm in love with GT and GT > Cornell aaaanyday if you ask me.\n\nAlso, about that \"what's wrong with me?\" feelings--it's hard but you really have to remember that colleges *mean it* when they say they had to reject qualified applicants. If you got into Georgia Tech CLEARLY you were plenty qualified for Cornell! You were probably every bit good enough and more, but Cornell decided they were short on tuba players in the marching band and they really needed to fill up the major that no one over applies for and so some other also talented student got in instead. A Georgia Tech AO (ironically) told me once that the student only controls 70% of the application process. I'd bet good money that it wasn't really about you or anything you did wrong.\n\nAnd really, by the time you're all committing, all of you are going to be so happy about wherever you're going no one is going to remember the details of who got in where when, because they don't matter. You'll end up somewhere that WANTS YOU!",

But it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t act out on that jealousy, because that never ends well. Instead, turn it into a strength. If you end up at GT (still an amazing school), take advantage of every opportunity available to you. Reach out and form connections. If you do this you\u2019ll be infinitely more appealing as a prospective employee or head student than someone from penn who slacked and didn\u2019t do much to take advantage of their resources.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t let US News rankings lead you to believe in your worth being determined by your school. Ultimately you will get a remarkable education at most T50 schools, especially if you go to GT for engineering. What matters is that you take the hand you\u2019re dealt and seize every opportunity. Six or seven years from now, when you\u2019re an engineer for a Silicon Valley company, you won\u2019t give a damn who went to Penn and who didn\u2019t (also Philly ain\u2019t really it)",
