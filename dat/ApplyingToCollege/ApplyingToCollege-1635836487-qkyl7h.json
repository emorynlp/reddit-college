      "text": "Hey there, are you talking about the CSS Profile fee for submitting your financial aid application to schools? 'Cause afaik you don't need the CSS fee for applying for scholarships- you probably do it through the schools you are applying. If you are talking about the financial aid application, then most schools either waive the Profile fee by giving you a code or ask you to submit an alternate form. Just email the schools you are applying and you will be fine. Hope that helps!!",
