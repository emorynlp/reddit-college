  "text": "Asian guy, junior year rn, taking best possible courses for all subjects that I can, only thing is in 10th grade I got a B in first semester music theory, but got an A in second sem. Have gotten As in all math/science courses, A in language, A-/A for history and A- for English. 1590 SAT, 1500 PSAT this year. Would a 3.8 GPA from that B look really bad?",
