  "text": "So I just got accepted into my ED (woohoo) school, and the deadline for accepting the admission is February 2nd.\n\nDo I have to withdraw my other applications before this deadline or can I wait and see how my applications did ? For example: the UC decisions come out March 31st, will I be able to wait for the results to come out before withdrawing application?\n\n(I mean after all the time and thought spent on them, it would physically hurt not to know the result)",
