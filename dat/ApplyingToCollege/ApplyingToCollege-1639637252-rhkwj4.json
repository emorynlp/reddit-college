  "text": "I recently got deferred from Brandeis, while a bunch of other people at my school are getting into their early schools. My school has a super competitive atmosphere where everyone is always striving to do better than everyone else and so the deferral has been especially hard-hitting because of this. I got into some of my safeties and honestly like all of my colleges enough where I'd be okay going to anywhere I'm accepted to, but safeties are looked down upon at my school and it's difficult not comparing myself to people who already know where they're going to, while I'm waiting until April-ish to make my decision. \n\nAnyone else on a similar boat?",
