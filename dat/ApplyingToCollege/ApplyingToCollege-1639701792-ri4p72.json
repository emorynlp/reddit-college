  "text": "I\u2019ve never done this bad in school in my life. I\u2019ve never had no motivation. I have an A in ONE of 6 classes. Low Bs and a C in the rest. \n\nI know my midyear grades are actually going to be the death of me. Will it even be possible for me to get into Dartmouth with horrible mid year grades? \n\nHow much do midyear grades matter? I feel so horrible that I let myself fall this much. My best friends got into Duke, WashU, UPenn, Brown, and Cornell and here I am - struggling to pass my class with a B. \n\nIdk man. I feel sad, but it\u2019s mostly my fault. Is there any redemption for me \ud83d\ude14",
