  "text": "So, here's the thing....\nI am the first one from my highschool to apply to a a US university and thus no one had any idea what to do. My transcripts and everything were uploaded on the common app with the school letterhead but not the LORs. \nI did waive my FERPA rights so it should not affect the decision but should I inform the uni regarding the same?\nAll the LORs were uploaded by the teachers in pdf format without the letterhead. Even the Lor uploaded by the ministry of science and technology was uploaded without Letterhead\n\nPls help\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",
