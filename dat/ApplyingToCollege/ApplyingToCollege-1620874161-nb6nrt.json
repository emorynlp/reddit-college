  "title:": "POV: You are applying to HYPSM in 2051.",
  "text": "The year is 2051. All cancers have been cured, all world issues have been solved, all open heart surgeries are performed by high schoolers, everyone at Apple and Google are high schoolers, and everyone in Congress is a high school student. The acceptance rates dropped down to 1% with St.Anford\u2019s acceptance rate as 0.01%. \n\nYou prepared your all your life for this moment. You solved quantum physics problems as a cell, got accepted to RSI at the age of 2, competed at ISEF at the age of 4, and won every year since then. Your GPA is a 7.2 and you scored a 1600 on the SAT when you were 5. At the age of 7, you taught 4 classes at John\u2019s Hopkins. \n\nFast Forward to High School: There is a black hole rapidly approaching earth. While others may see this the end of society, you see this as a guaranteed acceptance to the Ivies. You race against other High School students to find a solution to fix the black hole, and in 6 months you find a solution and send it off to space and you save earth from the black hole. You are internationally recognized. You apply to HYPSM confident you will get in...\n\nbut you are waitlisted, at all the ivies and HYPSM. \n\nYou Write 10 LOCIs in anger and call the admissions officers every 3.2 seconds to add a new accomplishment, and after 21 days you manage to get an acceptance at Cornell. But you have to be the janitor and clean the toilets, while studying as a student. \n\nNot bothered by that, you go on your bio and write Cornell \u201855.",
