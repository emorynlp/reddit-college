      "text": "EFC refers to something different than the manually-entered field on the CSS. That field is not necessarily indicative of your EFC. It may be taken into account depending on the methodology for EFC calculation, but the final EFC is more dependent on the financial information provided. (I don't have information on how that value is handled internally, so maybe someone else can chime in there. It does make sense that the EFC isn't based directly off that value, though. If it were, everyone would simply say 0 and apply to need-blind schools.) You can estimate your family's EFC using college board's [EFC calculator](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/pay-for-college/paying-your-share/expected-family-contribution-calculator).",
