GPA isn't standardized, so a 3.8 means different things at different schools, so they have to compare you to properly interpret that. sort of similarly, if your SAT score isn't great for the school but is significantly higher than your schools average for instance, they'll note that too.\n\n>And with GPA, do they compare the people with the same GPA?\n\nNot necessarily no",
