  "title:": "essay mentioning slightly questionable activities??",
  "text": "i\u2019m playing around with essays, and i have a few potential ideas. one small problem: one of my essays would have to mention me trespassing (and planning to trespass) on school and city property. i didn\u2019t do anything like drink, smoke, vandalize, etc. (i literally just sat there and had a snack lmao) and i\u2019d be clear about that in the essay- i just wanted to ask for yall\u2019s opinions: \nis this a no-go? is this something that (in the perspective of AOs) would make me seem morally deficit?? \n\n\nlike ngl i really dont think trespassing on public(ish) is even anything wrong, but my view might b a little skewed",

      "text": "omg def a no-go. think about it like this: why would AOs be keen on admitting a school trespasser to their school?? + even if you didn\u2019t *do* anything, you\u2019re going to appear a bit arrogant if you write an essay about it, since it kinda shows that you don\u2019t regret it",

          "text": "the essay would have been about my climbing of the city water tower, so there really wouldn\u2019t have been any way to talk abt it w out mentioning the trespassing  LOL. i have a lot of other potential essays that i think\u2019ll be safer, so i might end up going w those instead. this would have been a really fun topic tho, esp since its definitely one of my core memories",
