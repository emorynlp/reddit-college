  "text": "Hello, I am an international student (from Morocco) I finished high school in June 2021 and I wish to apply to study as a first year in the us for the 2022 fall session. The part that bothers me is the recommenders section. Should I invite two of my teachers from last year? How will Commonapp check the identity of the teachers i.e how will commonapp know if it\u2019s really my teachers? And also is there any thing i should tell my teachers beforehand because they are pretty unfamiliar with this whole process? \nA response would be life-saving (literally) \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0a",
