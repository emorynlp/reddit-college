  "text": "(Vent post)\n\nIm losing it. I live in Chile and we have this standarized test called PDT (which is similar to SAT) and you take it by the end of your senior year. The thing is, I\u2019ve been hardcore studying for this test, preparing 25 college apps (13 of them are due in 18 days) and also studying for a big ass amount of tests I have every week at school. Bruh im so done\ud83d\ude2d\n\nTHAT IS NOT EVEN THE WORST THING. College apps to the US are so UNCOMMON here in my country so my school had no fucking idea what a school profile/report/transcript was! I had to make everything! Last night I spent 6 hours creating the school profile document because my conselour (which is my english teacher because my school doesn\u2019t have one) didn\u2019t know how to do one and didn\u2019t want to do it.\n\nAnd the worst part? Im probably not getting into any school. Wasting so much fucking time and I\u2019m probably getting rejected because I\u2019m an international needing aid. \nBut I\u2019m still doing it because I need to get out of this fucking country. Thanks.",

I get you !!! everything is fricking difficult from this side of the globe, but there\u2019s nothing anyone can do to improve anything in the case of college apps. all we can do at this point is hope for the AOs to understand opportunities are not the same here. but hey, everything is going to be okay!!! it\u2019s already so rewarding to be trying our absolute best",
