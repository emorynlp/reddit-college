Instead, Champlain owns like 30 Victorian mansions that have been converted into dorms. Each one houses around 20-50 students. It\u2019s cool because it allows for a really tight-knit small community where you\u2019re living together and making close relationships.\n\n\\#3 - Location: Champlain, like UVM, is located in a great city (Burlington) but not only that, it\u2019s in a great neighborhood of Burlington: a gorgeous historic neighborhood just a few blocks away from the downtown area and the pedestrian shopping/eating street. (I think it\u2019s called Church Street.)\n\n\\#4 - Facilities. Champlain has a beautiful campus, and the buildings are all very nice.\n\n\\#5 - Upside-down curriculum: they have a curriculum where you take a lot of classes related to your intended major right off the  bat, which is helpful because a. If you like your major, you get involved quickly, and b. If you end up not liking your major, you find out quickly, so you can switch early on.\n\n\\#6 - It\u2019s a very accepting and friendly community; the faculty and students are pretty open-minded and outwardly friendly to one another. Really supportive place.\n\n\\#7 - They have a lot of business-related majors, which is what I want to go into. Not a whole lot of other majors though.\n\n\\#8 - So many awesome outdoor activities nearby like hiking, canoeing, skiing, and running.\n\n\\#9 - Merit aid is pretty generous for students with decent stats.\n\nDownsides:\n\n\\-Not a lot of majors to choose from.\n\n\\-Gender ratio is kinda eh (60% male, 40% female), probably because of Champlain\u2019s strength in the animation/digital design/filmmaking fields.",

I'd love to live there when I grow up, and/or go to school there.\n\nThere are a few downsides though:\n\n1. Lacks severely in ethnic diversity. Sure, it's quite progressive and accepting, LGBTQ+ friendly, lots of creative types as well. But the state as a whole is 92.5% White, which is really high. Burlington & UVM & that area are going to have more diversity though, but it's still not nearly diverse as urban areas like NYC, Atlanta, or Miami.\n2. Really cold in winter. I personally love the cold, skiing, winter, etc, so this isn't a downside for me. But if you can't handle 5 straight months of cold temperatures, you might want to reconsider.",

Great education, terrific memories, and no loans.   Best of luck to you!",

There\u2019s a thing called the TAG program that most of the community colleges offer which \u201ctags\u201d community college kids into some of the UC\u2019s as long as they have a certain GPA at the community college . I have heard it\u2019s best to meet with the community college counselor to make sure they\u2019ve taken all the classes required for the tag program.\n\nAs far as their stats in high school, one of the boys went to a public high school and he had a 4.4 but he only got into Davis for nutrition sciences and Santa Cruz for marine biology. He didn\u2019t have a ton of extracurriculars. The other boy I believe had a 3.8 from his public high school near SF, which wasn\u2019t good enough for the UC system at all , so he is now in his second year at the community college nearby and will try to transfer to Santa Barbara . I will ask his dad what his GPA is now at the community college which I think is around 3.6 or 3.7. He will also try for Berkeley but not sure he will get in as a transfer. \n\nI do know a girl with a 4.0 from the same community college who just got into UCLA and another girl with a 3.9 from the same community college who just graduated from UC Berkeley . Both came into those schools as transfer students so remember the Berkeley girl had to spend two years at community  college and then two years at Berkeley.\nI do know for sure that the UC Berkeley graduate had an F in math in high school. Once the student enters the community college and starts the TAG program, the high school stats become irrelevant . \nThe TAG program is at almost all the  community colleges .",

You don\u2019t feel as alienated like in other big schools because of smaller classrooms and you\u2019re \u201cdivided \u201d into groups.
