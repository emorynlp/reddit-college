  "text": "I have an alumni interview with an economics prof coming up because I put economics as my major on my common app. The problem is that I don\u2019t know that much about economics beyond the basic stuff everyone knows. For me, economics is more of a stepping stone to an MBA in the future. Anyway, my question is, is the interviewer going to ask me economics related questions? So like, will they \u201cquiz\u201d me in a sense to assess my knowledge in the subject?",

So think (and feel free to ask questions!) about what interests or puzzles you. Also, interviewers often ask a lot about what you like or find interesting -- and why. I would be fully honest about that: insincere answers rarely sound convincing and even weird-but-true answers are fine.",
