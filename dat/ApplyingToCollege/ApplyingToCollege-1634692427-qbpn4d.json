  "text": "My teachers have submitted their LORs to the schools I'm applying to on the Common App, but I'm considering adding one more. When I add this school and assign them to it, will the LORs automatically be submitted for this school, or will they have to log in and send it to that school? (Also, does the same thing apply for the counselor's school report?)\n\n(Yes, I realize that it shouldn't make a difference, but I don't want to annoy them.....................)",

We have to request them through naviance and usually it takes howeverlong for the teacher to make the letter and submit it. But since they were already in the system, it instantly sent them when I requested.",
