It\u2019s because you\u2019re both only going to go to one school anyway. Sure the other guy can brag and show off that they got accepted into more schools, but at the end of the day it\u2019s not gonna matter and you\u2019re both going to end up going to one school. Also you should be happy a school wants you to go there, that\u2019s an achievement already. It shows you\u2019re smart and you have potential :)",
