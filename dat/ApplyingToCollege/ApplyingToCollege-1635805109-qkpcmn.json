  "text": "Last night I submitted my Early Action application for my state school, UW-Madison.\n\nI literally read over my essay at least 6x and somehow missed these typos? I don't even know how this was possible but I think it was because it was pretty late, and I edited my final version in the common application box (rewording phrases and cutting/pasting some parts to improve the sentence structure) instead of my google doc and missed the grammar squiggly lines.\n\nI left in \"which\" in this sentence:\n\n**\"This experience which allowed me to channel my passion for creating novel projects into a more abstract medium.\"**\n\nand completely screwed up the apostrophes here:\n\n**\"children's\u2019 social categorization \"**\n\nEven though I think my application is strong for the school (1520 SAT, 4.0 GPA), I'm panicking now because they're both glaring errors and I'm scared that the admissions committee will especially notice the fact that there's more than one mistake. Should I email my admissions counselor to resubmit???? Or just email them to point out and apologize for the error? I literally don't know what to do",
