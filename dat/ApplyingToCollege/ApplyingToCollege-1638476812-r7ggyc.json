  "text": "so i know that the usc date to apply for a merit scholarship was december 1st but i didn\u2019t submit anything because i simply wasn\u2019t ready and i really didnt think i could qualify for financial aid (applied for fasfa got near to nothing). my family does okay but by no means can we afford to drop 100,000+ on college tuition. does me not applying to usc on december 1st really hurt my chances of getting aid? does usc really give that much aid for merit scholarships especially for middle class?",
