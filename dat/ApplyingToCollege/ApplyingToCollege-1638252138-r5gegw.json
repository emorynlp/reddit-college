Absolutely NO ESSAYS or other supplementary information.\n\nbeen in this sub for a while, I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong with the essays of US schools.\ndo they actually have time to read hundreds of thousands of them every year? if IVY or MIT require essays, fine because they have to select some 1000 best of best students out of 1000000. but what\u2019s wrong with these average ranking schools?",

      "text": "Because average in the US is almost on the same level as THE school in many other countries. A lot of schools in the US don\u2019t require any essays and even more don\u2019t require any supplementals. A decent part of it is wholistic admissions and lack of standardization even within states.",

      "text": "Probably because there are a gazillion more students applying to the schools? If the school is lower ranked, then usually they don't really take into account essays that much. Keep in mind that a lot of these \"average\" schools are still some of the highest-ranked around the world. American schools also don't auto admit certain students above a certain GPA, and require something called holistic review, which means that they take more than just GPA into accepting a student into the school. Even mid-tier schools apart from ivies get tens of thousands of applicants that all have perfect GPAs and test scores. Accepting all of them based on that just isn't a better system. All I'm going to say is that if you're complaining about doing more work for a US school, then don't apply :). You're going to be paying much higher tuition too. Honestly, I could probably talk about this for hours but please just do some more research thanks.",
