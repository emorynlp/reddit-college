  "text": "So my scores in physics have been extremely unstable. It went from 85% in 9th to 97% in 10th to 60% in 1st semester of 11th grade to 95% in the second semester and back to 70% in the first semester of 12th.\n\nThere is an explanation for the sudden drop to 60%. That's because I moved to a highly rigorous curriculum during the pandemic and did not get enough support during the shift. But how do I explain the 85% earlier and the 70% this year? I have 95+ in all the other subjects throughout high school and am aiming for T10s for CS.",
