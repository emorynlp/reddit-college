  "text": "I've asked this before, and I know its sort of late in the application season to be asking for colleges, but whatever, might as well try again to get some responses.\n\nSo I live abroad, but I am a US citizen. I don't qualify for any in-state tuition since I don't live in any state. My EFC is 0, we poor like that.\n\nFor reference, my gr 11 gpa was 3.8UW, and my gr 12 1st quarter gpa is 3.9UW.\n\nSo i'm wondering what are colleges that give good aid to low income students. I know people will say LACs or T20 schools, but theres some problems with that.\n\n1. I want to pursue a degree in architecture, and I don't think any LACs have an architecture program.\n2. I am by and large, not a super exceptional student, but I excel in certain areas, like art. Either way, most T20s are a far reach for me\n\nFor reference:\n\n* my gr 9-10 gpa was 3.3UW, gr 11 gpa was 3.8UW, and my gr 12 1st quarter gpa is 3.9UW, which is actually pretty good, but tbf, the classes ive chosen aren't the hardest in the world. My school doesn't do weighted gpa.\n   * AP Drawing - 5 (Grade 11)\n   * Grade 12 APs\n      * AP Lang\n      * AP World History\n      * AP 2D Design\n* I think my portfolio is fairly strong, but of course I like my portfolio, it's full of artworks I made, but based on what others have said, it's good.\n* I can't submit an SAT because where I live, testing dates keep getting cancelled\n* Most of my ECs are hobbies with no substantial awards or merits. The few that aren't hobbies aren't big commitments, only participating for 1 or 2 years. I'd say my most notable EC is doing commissioned artwork for 5+ years.\n* I've moved schools 3 times due to my dad's work, so even without the pandemic, it would be hard to gain leadership roles in clubs due to always being the new kid.\n* I'm Asian (Filipino) - American, don't know if this matters really for admissions\n\nSo basically what i'm looking for in a uni is:\n\n* Good aid to low income students\n* Has an architecture program\n* Isn't overly competitive\n\nI know i'm sort of asking for a lot in a university, but anything helps, thanks.\n\nedit: put my stats so people could have a reference point of my academics",

      "text": "It's going to be tough with an EFC of zero.\n\nCooper Union can give good aid and is a great school for architecture, but it's known for that so admissions would be tough. Syracuse, U Miami, USC, are a few others that can give good aid but are going to be pretty selective.\n\nThere are some solid public options that can be good with merit aid -- Iowa State and Kansas State come to mind. I'd at least look at the their net price calculators -- I doubt they can meet your full need, but maybe they get to a price point where the loans aren't too bad.\n\nI'd also look into whether there are any states with public architecture programs where establishing residency is possible.  Utah for example makes getting residency pretty easy so you could switch over to in-state after a year, but they don't offer a B. Arch.",
