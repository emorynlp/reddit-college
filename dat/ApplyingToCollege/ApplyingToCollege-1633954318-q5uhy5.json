  "text": "For context, \n\nI have been modding video games (as in creating mods) for almost the entirety of high school, and I recieved quite a few downloads (in the couples of thousands) on a couple. Anyways, I want to include this in my app as it's my only real hobby I can include  besides reading. However due to personal reasons, I don't want to disclose what my online profile is to any readers or even my admissions counselor. Is it still possible to include it as an extracurricular or should I just leave it off?",
