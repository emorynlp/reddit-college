  "text": "I\u2019ve seen a lot of mixed reviews on here, some say it\u2019s a really good sign, some say it makes absolutely no difference, some say the limited interviews are selected/used for screening, some have said it\u2019s bad. These answers have all come from aggregated application years, but does anyone have any sort of consensus/why? Also does the amount of time it takes for them to contact you for an interview matter?",

      "text": "Getting an interview is always a good sign, especially if you are international. However, I wouldn't look into it too deeply if you live in a densely populated city. A lot of interviews are dependent on region, your region may just be an area where a lot of Harvard Alumni live & your application may be above average and not bottom 25 percentile.\n\nIt's a good sign but not the end all be all.",
