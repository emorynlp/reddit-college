  "title:": "Sending Official Transcripts (Action Needed?)",
  "text": "edit (simpler way of phrasing my question): are official transcripts included within the counselor school report?\n\nSo I've invited my counselor to the CommonApp, and they have submitted both the \"School Report\" and \"Counselor Recommendation.\" However, I realize that some colleges require an official transcript to be sent to them by a counselor/school official/the school. Is this \"official transcript\" already loaded into my application because my counselor has submitted the \"school report,\" or is there still action required on my part to send my official transcripts to my colleges independently of the CommonApp (e.g. through Parchment)?\n\nDoes the CommonApp even transmit official HS transcripts from school to colleges, or do I need to always have official transcript sent via a third-party (Parchment) for all my official-transcript-needing schools?",
