  "text": "When AOs are evaluating your application do they take into account your ability to pay everything? For example, we\u2019ve all heard of international students asking for aid facing a tremendous obstacle, but what if your parents make a lot of money and there is no question you will be able to pay the full price every year with no aid. Fortunately, I am the latter and while this may seem like a pretentious question I\u2019m just curious, would having an EFC of more than 350,000 help my application?\n\nI probably will delete this later, I just am curious and hope I don\u2019t come off as rude.",

Legacy or parents background in the CA could be proxies for that should they want to. \n\nNeed aware colleges (like NUE,  Tufts,  RPI,  WPI) do in fact use that info to build their class.",

They say they won't, but they \\*do\\* have to be mindful (consciously or subconsciously) to not accept too many lower income students, and to balance that out with full-paying students.   \n\n\nYou're not rude to ask. You're conscious of your privilege. You can use this to your advantage.",
