  "text": "Hey, I'm an international student applying as a freshman for fall 2022 here. I'm interested in psychology and informatics which are capacity-constrained majors. What major should I list as my first choice on Coalition and what are my chances of getting in? Am I going to get in as a direct admit or do I have to compete again to apply to the major? To be honest I'm scared of getting rejected because the application fee is expensive in my currency. Thanks in advance.",
