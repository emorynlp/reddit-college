  "text": "He said he wants to look at the results himself and then tell me about it later.  Of course, I wish I could see him as he is discovering the results, but I understand.  He seems more calm about it than I am. \ud83d\ude00. His words:  \u201cI\u2019ve done everything I can do.  The rest is out of my control.\u201d   Some days I wish I were more like my son.  Good luck to the rest of you!  From a 45 year old, I can tell you that if you don\u2019t get accepted, I guarantee some other school will be thrilled to have you.  Also, this will not be the last time you are rejected.  It is cliche, but the best judge of character is how you deal with setbacks; not wins.  But hopefully, the setbacks are few!  Just the fact that you are motivated enough to do ED puts you well ahead of the vast majority of high school seniors.   You got this.  And if you don\u2019t, you will get the next one.   And you will still kick ass at the next one.",
