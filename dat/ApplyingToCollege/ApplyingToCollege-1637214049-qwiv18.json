  "title:": "Would it be a good idea to write my college essay about my newfound confidence in appearance?",
  "text": "I dyed my hair one day and ever since then I've been on top of the world with my appearance. I've never felt this secure in my presence before and I want to write about it. I'm scared that i will come off as shallow focusing on my appearance. I've been very confident in many other ways since middle school, it's just the feeling ugly that has weighed me down. \nI plan on making it interesting and including some details about how being black in a majority white elementary and middle school factored into this\n\nEdit: let me elaborate that this whole situation isn't just \"omg I'm pretty now!\" to me. Since middle school, I hadn't felt okay with my presence in any room; in front of people, or just on my own. Finally able to see the physical beauty of myself has, for the first time in around 6 years, made me comfortable with my body through and through. I can be unapologetically in the presence of people now.\nI've also been experimenting more in fashion and makeup, wearing bright bold colors, which is cool because 1) in middle school, I never wore bright colors cuz I thought it didn't go with my skin tone and 2) I am very artistic and creative, I love color and fashion as an art form and would like to mention that. \nThis is a pretty big development for me, I don't know if it's too arrogant of me, though? \nIf I'm on the right track, what do you suggest I casually mention to show that I have other skills that they want? \nFor example, I could mention how \"I've always been eager to socialize, but I never felt...\" You know? \n\nI promise I write essays in a more formal manner than I write Reddit posts",

      "text": "sure, this is a great topic. be weary not to be too materialistic in your essay as it could rub off the wrong way due to varying interpretations (AOs are older than you so they may not really understand the depth and complexity of the situation -- which is completely valid -- that you are going through). goodluck!",
