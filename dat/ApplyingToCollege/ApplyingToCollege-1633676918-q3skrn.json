  "text": "I have a college interview with a Georgetown alumnus tomorrow and I'm writing a (rough draft) list of questions that I want to ask:\n\n1. What was it like as an African American female at GU?\n2. What didn't the school do well?\n3. As of late, GU has been very active in the fight for social justice, has it always been like this?\n4. What kind of internships does the school offer?\n5. How inclusive was the community? Was it easy to fit in/become comfortable?\n6. Tell me anything about the school's Greek life?\n7. How did GU help you become who/where you are today?\n8. What was the environment like?\n9. Did you ever find out difficult to stand out as your own person; not get lost in the wave?\n10. What's the dining hall like?\n11. Was there a visible divide between students with differing political views?\n12. Communication between admin and students?\n\nThese are questions I am very interested in having answered, but should I hold off on some of them?\n\nAre these too many questions?",

They\u2019ll probably answer 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9 in the process of chatting. Other than that, just see as the convo goes and don\u2019t worry about having too much/too little",

I know you want the answers to all of these but give some room for the person to speak freely. Don\u2019t rifle these off. Stay quiet and some answers may lead to even better insight.",
