  "title:": "Yale received fewer EA applications than last year",
  "text": "Aspiring members of the class of 2026 sent 7,313 early action applications to Yale this fall, the second largest in Yale\u2019s history.\n\nThis year\u2019s pool only fell behind last year, when the Office of Undergraduate Admissions read 7,939 early applications. This year\u2019s application pool is about eight percent smaller than last year\u2019s cohort, and 27 percent larger than 2019. First generation college students, international students and underrepresented racial or ethnic groups bucked this trend, rising in both 2020 and 2021.\n\nSource: [Yale Daily News](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2021/11/19/yale-college-sees-second-largest-early-applicant-pool-in-history/)",

Yale usually gets ~14% of early ivy applications which would mean 52,000 total early applications to ivies: an increase from last year. The number for Yale specifically being lower would be due to Princeton accepting early applications this year but not for the class of 2025.",

I would have expected even more of a decrease with Princeton back in the mix.  What would be interesting is to take H+Y+P last year (P=0) vs. H+Y+P this year.   Remember you have to back out recruited athletes from the # admitted EA to really figure out how many were accepted just from applying.",

But just as students deserve to see their financial aid packages before committing, students also deserve to have OPTIONS well in advance of committing. Who is Yale to say, \u201cwell if you apply to us, don\u2019t even think about applying to another private college until we tell you if we like you\u201d and have a student miss out on other EA deadlines?? It\u2019s sick to me. The alternative would be to just, do a normal EA, quite obviously. MIT does it, CalTech does it, *numerous* liberal arts colleges do it, and they still make their classes.",
