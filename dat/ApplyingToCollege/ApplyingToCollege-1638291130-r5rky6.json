  "text": "I'm filling out my SRAR for Rutgers and I'm trying to mark one of my classes as dual enrollment. However, under \"proficiency level\", there's no way for me to mark that since I don't have that option. I've tried googling, but everywhere tells me to mark it under \"course level\", which I don't have (proficiency level seems to have taken its place on mine). I assume this is because my school is outside of America, but I'm not sure. \n\nHow should I go about marking this course on my SRAR? Why don't I have \"course level\" in my SRAR?",
