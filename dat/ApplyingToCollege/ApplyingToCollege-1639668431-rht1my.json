Should I talk about the school\u2019s clubs I want to join ? Help!",

      "text": "A why us essay should be more about you than the college. Think about which ECs/passions/awards/aspects of your personality you haven't had a chance to write about yet, and look for parallel programs/clubs/research opportunities/traditions the college has. Write about both!\n\nYou can also research the school a bit first and see what sticks out, then find ways to connect that to your experience.",

      "text": "You can talk about your current interests and relate them to their departments/clubs. Let's say you like history then talk about their history department or their history club or lets say you love reading books then mention their reading club. You can go through their courses and see what interests you as they might have some unique courses. Along with that, you can connect your identity with their community. If someone's bisexual then they can talk about the schools LGBTQ+ community. Good luck!!",
