  "text": "So i got a 2 in Econ and I don\u2019t want to self report that score. I heard I am allowed to do that but how? When I go to send the score report officially to colleges it doesn\u2019t give me an option to individually send scores. My counselor has been useless so any help is appreciated.",

But it's a waste of money. Literally nobody will care next July that your score report showed a 2 that you did not report.",
