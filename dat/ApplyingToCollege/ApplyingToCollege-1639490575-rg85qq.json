  "text": "The extra curriculars that I\u2019ve mentioned are that I ran a tutoring service and that I played guitar in a band. I wanna talk about my tutoring service and dive in deep about my love for helping and teaching, and similarly I wanna talk about the reason I got into guitar and why it\u2019s important to me in some supplemental essays. Is that alright to do??",

But, be sure to write about it from a perspective not already explored on your app! \n\nAlso, unrelated but can I ask how you described Guitar playing in your activities section? I'm redoing mine and still struggling to describe one of my hobbies.",
