  "title:": "Naviance sent the wrong recommendation letters to the college",
  "text": "Hi. \n\nSo, my robotics teacher recently told me that he wasn't able to submit his letter of recommendation to Carnegie Mellon, Caltech, and Cornell because Naviance is apparently blocking him. Didn't know why, so I decided to check the 3 colleges in the Common App and noticed that the 3 colleges have 2 teacher recommendation letters that I didn't request specifically. I requested these 2 letters of recommendation to 8 other colleges, but I never specifically requested 2 recommendation letters from them to be sent to Carnegie Mellon, Caltech, and Cornell. I have no idea what to do since Common App doesn't allow one to remove a letter of recommendation. Any idea what I could do to fix this?",
