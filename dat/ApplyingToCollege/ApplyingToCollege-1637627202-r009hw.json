  "title:": "Should I pursue a potentially controversial award/scholarship?",
  "text": "Idk where else to put this so hi. \n\nI\u2019m a Junior in HS and I eventually want to pursue some sort of political or environmental degree, whether that be polisci or international relations or enviro sci or a combo. I found this scholarship contest through the American Legion where you perform a speech about the Constituon, and if you win at the national level you can get as much as $25,000 for college! Obviously I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ll definitely win, but can still earn a solid chunk of money just by placing at the state level. Not to mention, I don\u2019t really have any awards and I want to show colleges something.\n\nThe one problem is is that the American Legion is apparently very problematic because of its right-wing views, history of racism, things along those lines. I am quite liberal. I\u2019ve campaigned for planned parenthood and done other liberal campaign work. If I ended up winning anything, would it look weird to colleges? And do you think it would look bad for me down the line for if/when I pursue my political interests more seriously and it \u201cgot out\u201d? \n\nThanks.",

      "text": "I think you should feel free to pursue the scholarship competition. You may be able to educate some of the elders of the American Legion with your speech about the Constitution. I don\u2019t think it would be reasonable for anyone to assume that your politics necessarily align with the politics of an organization that granted you a scholarship.",
