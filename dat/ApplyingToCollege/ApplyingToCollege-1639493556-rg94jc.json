  "text": "Howdy! Currently a high school student very close to sending in my Questbridge application to UChicago for ED 2. However, while I really like the institution, there are a few things holding me back.\n\nFirst, if I do ED 2 and I am admitted I can help but feel like I stopped my college admissions journey too prematurely and limited my ability to attend a university that would have been a better \"fit\" for me. While I love the institution the problem is that I don't have the money/resources to actually visit the institution and don't know if I like the school because of it's aesthetic or the school itself (I don't if that makes sense LMAO). \n\nThe second scenario, given that UChicago accepts the overwhelming majority of its students through Early Decision rounds, I feel that I may be throwing away my opportunity to be admitted to the school which I like very much.\n\nGiven all of this I'm not quite sure  what I should do. What do y'all think? (I'm a prospective linguistics major btw)",
