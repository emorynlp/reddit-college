  "text": "Hey,\n\nI\u00b4m a student in Portugal, I will finish high school next year(June 2022) and I\u00b4m thinking of studying in the USA. I just want to know how important is my GPA in the admission process. I have made some calculations, converting my grades from 0-20 to GPA 0-5, and if everything goes as expected  I will end school with a 3.75/3.7 (something around that) I don't know If that\u00b4s good or not. But I\u00b4ve looked at PrepScholar, I don\u00b4t know how accurate that is, but it says that for a university I\u00b4m looking into the entry requirement is 3.69 GPA, 1440 SAT/ 32 ACT (I have no idea how difficult these exams are). In Portugal all that universities care about are grades, we have a minimum requirement on some exams but If we do meet those requirements they will only look into our grades.  I want to know whats the balance between GPA, SAT/ACT, and any other factors.\n\nBonus question: How important is my GPA for a scholarship (college in the USA is really expensive).\n\nThanks for your help!",
