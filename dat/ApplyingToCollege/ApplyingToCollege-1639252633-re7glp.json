  "text": "Hello, I'm not sure if this is the place to ask this. I was originally at the r/college subreddit but they mentioned here in their posting section so I figured I'd try.\n\nI am seeking to go to college to learn how to draw. I'd specifically like to learn digital art, but I'm willing to explore traditional and other types of things, such as 3D and Animation, etc. Shawnee has a Studio Arts degree, and a Game and Simulation Development Arts degree. Both sound interesting, with Gaming sparking particular interest as I game pretty heavily. However, I don't want to sacrifice learning to draw by focusing on the Gaming and 3D/Animation aspects of the Game degree. I'm considering taking Studio Arts as a minor, but I would want to ensure that I get the classes I'm looking for, in particular the courses that talk about drawing anatomy/life and digital artwork. \n\nFor anyone that has attended Shawnee with these degrees as points of interest, could you offer insight? Is what I'm looking for plausible at this school? To give more details, I'm specifically wanting to learn to draw so that I can draw characters, environments...essentially creating my own kind of stories/content.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, I apologize if this isn't the place to post this.",
