  "title:": "i'm a just under average international student who wants to study in Canada, what should i do?",
  "text": "(for context, my school year runs from January to November, and I have 2 semesters. semester 1 is from January - June and in June I write mid year exams. and semester 2 is from July - November and in November I write end of year exams or finals. I am also from South Africa and I am in grade 11 or a \"junior\" as you would call it.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmy semester 1 averages (class assessment mark + mid year exam mark) are as follows:\n\n* English: 72%\n* Maths: 67%\n* Accounting: 80%\n* Informational Technology: 79%\n* Science (physics + chemistry combined): 67%\n* Afrikaans (the equivalent of Spanish or French, my first additional language): 67%\n\nits nothing ground breaking and i don't really think its actually worth much value in terms of applying for an undergrad.\n\nin an ideal world i want to be able to study Computer Science and i want to study it in a country that is preferably first world. the goal of leaving South Africa is that i can hopefully start working towards a residence and citizenship in this first world country. 2 of my cousins (that completed high school and their undergrads in America and also have a US citizenship now) say that for my goal i should look at studying in Canada as Canada is much more accepting of immigrants - in terms of legally getting there and living there, not in terms of culture - than the US is. they also say that when i research universities/colleges i need to be smart and apply to universities/colleges that are in accordance with my marks. however when i research this on Google, i can't find specific institutions that do this because Google only recommends the absolute best and top tier universities/colleges that accept only the highest achieving students.\n\nwhich brings me here. if anyone is aware of colleges/universities that would accept me with my state of academic performance then please let me know in the comments and i will look into it. and i don't say accept me as in accept me specifically into computer science, i just mean in general. i'm not 100% fixed on computer science and i can change what i wanna do if it will help me leave South Africa.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso just a bit of extra info. locally the procedure is that after i complete my finals this year i would start doing my applications to local universities/colleges with my semester 2 marks for provisional acceptance at a university/college. then i would receive my final acceptance at that university/college (for study in 2023) at the beginning of 2023 should my results for my grade 12 finals be satisfactory.(grade 12 finals results come out in January of the next year after writing).\n\nhowever for study in Canada i would technically fall into the class of 2023 because of the difference in how the school year runs in America/Canada. and i believe that you guys complete your applications in   october - december so i would start doing my Canadian applications from October 2022 - December 2022 to try and study in september 2023. (i just finished typing this and i have no idea why i put it here but its here.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni also wouldn't mind getting advice about American universities even though i've been told against going to study in America so if you do have some please share!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthis is a lot to try and understand but any criticism/advice/guidance would be greatly appreciated. thank you Reddit!",
