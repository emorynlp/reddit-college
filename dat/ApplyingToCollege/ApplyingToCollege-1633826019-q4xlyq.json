I\u2019ve been trying to be positive and manifest and have mostly been successful, but have had some really anxious moments (Ik it\u2019s normal but I\u2019d appreciate tips)!\n\nIdk I feel really hopeful and excited but it comes in waves :-) eek",

      "text": "ED1 admit to tufts last year here: welcome to hell! <3\n\nUnfortunately, not much worked for me. It was all I thought and talked about about all the time for months (I actually submitted my app around the same time as you last year) and got progressively worse as December approached. I couldn't sleep the night before and was practically hyperventilating the day of; the week of was also horrible. I hate to tell you this, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. I was constantly oscillating between \"how could they accept me\" and \"how could they not accept me.\" I was so desperate I found their past year release dates for ED1 a month before and did a data analysis to predict when they'd release that year. Some general advice:\n\n\\- This may be hard, but keep busy. Sports, clubs, hanging with friends, homework. Generally in college the busier I am the harder it is to worry about things. Do NOT let it affect your daily activities; make sure you schedule in stuff you enjoy with friends, especially as it gets closer. Give yourself excuses to have fun; the holidays are coming up too!\n\n\\- Get real with yourself. Manifesting is great but I know people from last year who manifested the schools really hard and were obsessed with them and got crushed when they got rejected. Try not to tie your self worth to one school and make sure you have a plan for what happens in the worst case scenario: rejection, finaid falls through for ED1, etc. Assuming it will happen will make it hurt more if it doesn't. \n\n\\- Take care of your mental health! Personally, this is exercise for me. I'm a runner and going on runs was probably the only thing keeping me from falling apart during this time. If this is something that works for you, I cannot recommend it enough. Even just walking or scheduling exercise into your day, whatever kind it is. For me at least, covid + college app stress + other factors in my life fucked up my mental health for MONTHS after and exacerbated an existing problem; I may still have to see a therapist. Prioritize yourself and your happiness.\n\n\\- Reach out to people going through the same thing. I spent all my time venting to people in the same boat on a college application discord server last year and we were all each other's therapists. Not necessarily healthy, but you're going to need something to listen to this (and keeping it in isn't healthy) who gets it. Possibly someone in the same ED1 boat. Try not to give each other unrealistic expectations or put unhealthy pressure on each other though. Also: bear in mind that should you get accepted, staying in the panic/applying to college mentality the rest of the school year can be unhealthy and it will be hard not to get caught up in your friends' acceptances and A2C. I stayed in panic mode until June because of this. Please please please try to relax afterwards if the best case scenario here happens.\n\n\\- Romanticize your safeties/other schools. I didn't want to go to my state school, a safety very close by; now I love driving home and back through my stupid suburban town and seeing the familiar streets I grew up on. I love my college, but going home feels good and safeties are really not as bad as you think they are. What actually finally snapped me out of my Tufts obsession in May was researching its flaws, a couple months too late: recognizing that it had a MASSIVE wealth inequality made me realize that as much as I love the people, I shouldn't attach my self worth to a corporation. Think of it this way-would you romanticize Amazon?\n\nFinal thoughts: I promise you you WILL get through this and I'm rooting for you! Just remember you'll be in college in a few months no matter what happens and be having exciting new experiences <3",

I do like the rest of my schools a lot which is good, I just get caught up in the \u201cdream school\u201d mindset which I\u2019m gonna try to keep in check. Again, thank u <3",

Also if you tend to get falsely hungry when anxious like I do I've started just drinking water instead. Actually good for me since I don't drink enough water in the first place.",
