  "text": "I haven\u2019t taken any ap history classes so I\u2019m looking into history classes that will save me some money for college. Is AP Gov a requirement for college students in stem? Should I take it? I was always recommended for ap history classes but I felt that I was stretching myself too thin. My schedule is also getting very ap-filled so would it be worth it?",

      "text": "Every school will have their own policies. Most STEM majors will have some type of General Education requirements, and AP Gov credit will quite often meet one of those requirements.\n\nI looked up the policies for the 11 schools my daughter is applying to for CS, and her AP Gov class earns valuable credit at 8 of them.\n\nLook at the AP credit article for each school to see what credit you might get, then the plan of study for your major (often a general GE requirement list for all STEM) and see if the credit satisfies one of them.",
