  "title:": "Idk if I\u2019m just stressed or I should be worried about depression",
  "text": "I put so much pressure on myself when it came to college apps. Since 9th grade to be exact. \n\nI\u2019ve never been great at anything. I\u2019m not good at sports or music or anything I just lack talent. I joined robotics and did it all four years but I always sucked and everyone told me that. This made me feel so useless so I used college as an escape because I could build my resume to be whatever I wanted. \n\nI studied so hard for the SAT and only got a 1460 superscored. My GPA feels meaningless because my school is stupid. I took 10 APs and like 5 tests and only submitted two scores which obvi looks bad. I keep comparing myself to this super smart kid at my school who applied to like all the same schools as me and I just can\u2019t match up in the slightest.\n\nThe constant comparing myself and constantly perfecting my apps and hating everything has seriously taken a toll. I\u2019m just so constantly worried that all I think about is college. I applied to MIT EA bc it was a goal for so long and I\u2019m obvi not gonna get in and it physically hurts. I\u2019m worried about not getting in elsewhere. \n\nI haven\u2019t been eating consistently and I don\u2019t have energy. Im scared I\u2019m gonna develop an ED or something bc it\u2019s been going on for so long and I can\u2019t eat when stressed or I just overeat and feel fat. I\u2019m either sleeping for 13 straight hours or not sleeping at all. I haven\u2019t gone to a full week of school in a while bc some days I just can\u2019t do it. I just failed my dual enrollment calc class and I\u2019m seriously struggling in AP chem.\n\nTLDR: stress is taking a toll on mental and physical health",

      "text": "Honestly, I would see your counselor or therapist. This sounds worrisome to me, especially you seem to have a lack of self confidence and your hygiene habits. I\u2019m sure you are good at something, and don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. I know from experience because I started to have trouble sleeping, eating, hygiene, and eventually things hit a wall for me. It made my grades suffer, and I suggest you seek someone out if you can. It\u2019ll make a world of difference.",
