  "title:": "You all here need to be more proud of yourselves!",
  "text": "Reading through some of the posts and comments on this subreddit, I feel absolutely regretful\u2014in high school my gpa was never over 3.2 (weighted) and, because of poor mental health, I never participated in any extracurriculars. I ended up not even applying to schools my senior year because I was so depressed, etc. I\u2019m trying now to succeed more in CC so I can transfer somewhere, which is why I follow this sub. \n\nBut this isn\u2019t about me\u2014on here and in real life, I see people who have done so much objectively better hold themselves so lowly and hopelessly. You guys (gender neutral) are so strong and awesome and should be proud of yourselves! \n\nI know it\u2019s a super stressful time\u2014but don\u2019t place your worth on these schools that don\u2019t know YOU and unrealistic comparisons. You\u2019ll get somewhere. Try to remember to do what\u2019s best and most reasonable for you and follow your own dreams and interests, not the achievements of someone else. And don\u2019t let impostor syndrome (thinking your achievements are false or not good enough) drag you down. \n\nGood luck in your futures, everyone, even if it doesn\u2019t go as hoped for or intended, even if you change your path, and if it does work out! I\u2019m sure there are some truly hardworking and talented people reading this, and that\u2019s what matters! You are enough. \n\nI just wanted to share some honest human encouragement and appreciation (or admiration) \u2764\ufe0f",

We put so much weight on prestige and what\u2019s going to look good when in reality that stuff doesn\u2019t matter in the long run. You can make big things happen anywhere you go if you are determined!",
