  "text": "I swear, everything got taken from us. Xmas with our families or any holiday in that fact. Our birthdays taken from us. \n\nThis year is just so awful and sad. Unable to hang out with friends or have any sense of normality is just terrible. \n\nI hope people understand this. A lot of people are like \u201cEveryone is going through this right now\u201d \n\nBut you know what? Not everyone is a senior and a lot of people got to enjoy their last years as a teenager without worry. But we don\u2019t have that, and it makes me so mad. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for venting, it\u2019s just no family around, no friends. This is really taking a toll on me and i\u2019m sure on most of you. \n\nThis sucks.\n\nAnyways, Merry Xmas to all of you and hope all of you are safe and with your families!",

There\u2019s no need to be rude to me and call me sensitive for pointing out the fact that you were needlessly rude to someone with a slight lifestyle difference. I really don\u2019t understand why this entire comments section is flaming me for this, I literally just do what\u2019s asked of me in this one tiny aspect of my life. I\u2019m not exactly a conformist just because I don\u2019t party. Don\u2019t assume things about me based on one fact of my person that isn\u2019t even an actionable trait. The default state of being is not partying, since partying is an active choice. Same as not being a painter is the default because painting is an active choice. Would you insult my parents and refer to me as sensitive for pointing out that it\u2019s weird for you to be rude to me because you painted and I didn\u2019t? If no, maybe rethink this exchange. If yes, you seem to be a rather close-minded individual and I\u2019m not interested in arguing with you about whether my personhood is tainted by not partying, which tbh is a ridiculous assertion on its face.",

Beyond that, there\u2019s only the present and the past. If you want to do something and it\u2019s important to you, make time for it. The future isn\u2019t set. Coffee or breakfast with friends? Send the invitation. Learning a new skill? Grab a book and start reading. Fun clubs or social groups? Go to them starting now (if it\u2019s safe, otherwise you will actually have to postpone them). That hard adult lesson I learned is that if I don\u2019t make time for it now, I never will. \n\nA second one, which may be useful for you, is to never let your life revolve around other people. Make plans for yourself and what **you** want to do, then send invitations to join you. Instead of \u201cwe should go to this movie\u201d it\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m going to see this movie this week, you\u2019re welcome to come with me.\u201d See the movie you want to see whether or not your friends come.",

Hopefully by summer we have enough vaccination going on so we can go out. We can\u2019t enjoy now, please please please enjoy then. Spend time with your friends. Do stupid shit together. We\u2019re teenagers, put academics and college to the side and act like one for once. We will have few responsibilities for potentially one of the last times in our lives.\n\nIf there\u2019s one bright side I keep telling myself, it\u2019s that at least by the time college freshman year starts, shit should be back to normal. Virtual senior year sucks, but I would imagine virtual freshman year sucks even more. At least we won\u2019t miss that. We won\u2019t miss freshman traditions, we won\u2019t miss meeting our classmates, we won\u2019t be stuck at home or isolated in a new city. \n\nAs the great Oogway said, \u201cYesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift.

I will say though that high school feels like a very important milestone in the moment, but college is 100x better. Everything you\u2019re missing out on now, you\u2019ll be able to do it in college and with even better friends. I\u2019m happy you guys will get to experience that at least.

I'm so detached from school and spending way too much time arguing with anti-maskers and covid-deniers on Reddit, and being called a doomer and a sheep all day long. So many people are borderline eugenists these days and I get so pissed seeing people tell at-risk groups to just stay home so the privileged can do what they want. We pander to the 1% of extremely wealthy trust fund hacks, because for some reason being a good person is worthless and running a massive investment bank or hedge fund is the noble thing in life. \n\nAs a side note, bioterrorists are probably laughing in glee. Forget about car bombings and shootings, we are so fucking lucky that covid isn't like MERS with a 35% death rate. We'd have millions dead by now. First swine flu, then COVID, have we not learned? Humanity is going to self-destruct itself one day (if we haven't already with the climate change issue). Maybe that's for the best, I don't know.",

Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana that year, and they wrote me a letter saying that I would have been accepted but they took all the displaced students. So when I tell you, You seniors really got a worse year ever to be a senior, I truly mean it. Covid has been a goddamn bitch for everyone I've talked to.

And this quarantine really let me do all those things, even got to spend more time with my dogs since I barely got to before. I got to learn new hobbies and continue the ones I had (like piano and art). No to mention the countless videogames I was able to play and finish (I'm still very happy about that). \n\nWith that being said, I do still feel cheated from my proper senior year. There was a lot I wanted to do (probably wouldn't have done anyways) but now we don't even have the option. It really sucks and makes me pretty upset, kinda feels like the previous HS years were pointless.\n\nAll I want from this year is to have a graduation like walk the stage type of thing. I want to put my highschool years to rest properly and not online!",

And at least we\u2019re likely to have a normal first year of college. Perhaps not the fall semester, but I\u2019m very hopeful at least the spring semester will be more normal. \nLast years\u2019 seniors had their entire first year either online or with strict precautions. I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t have to do that. I\u2019m a pretty shy and introverted person and kind of relying on that \u201ceveryone\u2019s-new-and-trying-to-make-friends\u201d atmosphere to have the confidence to meet a ton of new people and make friends. And even if our admissions is tougher this year, is getting into a top college more important than the experience? Like, I\u2019d rather have a fulfilling and successful college experience all four years than a prestigious name on my diploma.\nBut idk, maybe I\u2019ll be singing a different tune when I get rejected from all my matches and reaches \ud83e\udd21",
