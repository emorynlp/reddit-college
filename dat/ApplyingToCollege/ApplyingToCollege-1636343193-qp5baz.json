The first tip I'd give you is just be yourself, don't practice your answers, because if you practice your questions, you might end up saying the wrong answer for a question, or rather you might go off the point, just to try to explain your pre-interview practiced questions and answers, research on stuff about the school and know the reasons why you want to go to the school.",
