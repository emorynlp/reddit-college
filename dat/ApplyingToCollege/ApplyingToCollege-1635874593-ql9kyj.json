  "text": "Hey all, i have many colleges I\u2019m applying to that accept 2 or more letters of recommendation, but only require one. \nOne of my recommenders I\u2019m pretty sure is gonna write me a banger, and the other teacher likes me, but doesn\u2019t know me that well. Im worried the second letter might be weak or generic.\n\nDo you think its worth to add their letter on? Or just send in one? Thanks so much for any tips.",
