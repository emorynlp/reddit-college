  "text": "Hi all,\nI\u2019m a Canadian completing hs in the States and am most likely gonna return for university as a music ed major. I just spent the last few hours combing the internet for decent scholarships. I found a couple but was ultimately disappointed. I\u2019m gonna see what my school has to offer but until then, does anyone know of any Canadian scholarships or scholarships applicable in Canada?\n\nThanks",
