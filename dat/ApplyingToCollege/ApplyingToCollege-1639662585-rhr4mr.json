  "text": "Hey,\n\nI was rejected from JHU as my ED1 choice, and now are considering various options for ED2. Ill be requesting full tuition need based financial aid mostly. I'm trying to find unis that are more focused on research and the idea of discovery, etc. cuz I believe that's the best fit for me and my app (to make it clear, MIT is like the perfect uni to me). \n\nThanks in advance!",

Furthermore, they have several signature full-tuition merit-based scholarships you can apply for (Ingram, Chancellor\u2019s and Cornelius, I believe)",

Need-aware schools that meet 100% of demonstrated need are the best option here; the rest are both need-aware and don\u2019t meet the need. Moreover, all of them have more international students on financial aid than JHU, and their average packages are generally over full-tuition in grants\n\nAlso, NYU-Abu Dhabi is need-blind, by the way",

It's really tough competing with the top universities since they only have so much funding they can give out.\n\nAside from Midd, I've heard Grinnell, Colby, Colgate, and Bowdoin are also generous with aid. I also have a friend who got a full ride to Dartmouth, but the competition of applying to an Ivy kinda makes getting in really hard.\n\nHonestly, you really just have to shoot your shot since it's inevitably going to be tough for internationals anywhere anyway. There's really no \"low-hanging fruit\" for any of us and it all boils down to your application and, frankly, luck.",
