Cal (graduate) is very similar, except for the fact that it doesn't have a medical school.  The Ivies have not kept up with modern times and cannot come close to competing in engineering with the likes of Stanford (and Cal, MIT, Caltech, and many others).  \n\nThe Ivies are all outstanding schools, especially the Big Three, but their sense of self-importance and grandiose exceptionalism has a non-trivial delusional aspect.",
