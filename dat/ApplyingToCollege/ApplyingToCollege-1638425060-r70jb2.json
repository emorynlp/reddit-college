  "text": "I see a lot of negativity about this sub, how it's terrible for people's mental health and made them really feel terrible about themselves. I honestly think being in this sub has helped me. The wiki has taught me pretty much everything I know about the college application process and how to write a good essay. I want to extend my gratitude especially to the writers of the Best of A2C posts.\n\nHonestly, all of the posts about ppl with the 1600 SAT and amazing ECs and all is kinda motivating for me more than anything else. In the sense that it's humbling, I mean. I've been in a smaller school most of my life where I was the only one who wanted to push for these goals. It's cool to be surrounded by a bunch of people who are also looking to take a chance, put in a bunch of hard work for the chance to attend an elite university.\n\nAt the same time, it feels like I've just been on autopilot my entire life. At this point, I don't even care about xyz university or abc name. I just want to be surrounded by a bunch of cool people who love to learn and a bunch of professors who maybe see a bit of themselves in their students. I want to escape the mentality of \"busy work\" and pointless assignments, classes where students skip all the time, and monotony. Originally I told myself that getting into a top school would satisfy that requirement for me, and that \"if i didn't at least try, i'd never know how well i could have done\". I didn't even do that much research into which school I think would be best. My college list feels almost random, as if I just picked a smorgasbord from the USNews rankings. So here I am. In this sub, one that has been helpful to me in accomplishing the goals I think I want for myself. \n\nI'm guessing other people here feel like this, since at least by the numbers, we all sound pretty much the same. What does the draw of a top school hold for you?\n\nTLDR: I want to go to a T20 just to be around other thinkers and I am ambivalent enough to not care how much debt I will have to go into or even if any of this will even matter half a decade after I graduate.",

      "text": "The best part is that you very probably will not need to go heavily into debt. That's the reward for you keeping the faith and working hard. And if that makes you happy, here's something else nice: most PhD programs pay you in addition to covering tuition. So, if you really like school and want to live *la vie acad\u00e9mique*... you can also do that without going heavily into debt. And while masters programs cost money and rarely offer scholarships, you don't need a masters to apply for a PhD. So your horizon is farther and wider than you might have realized.\n\nI hope it works out amazingly for you. Good luck!",
