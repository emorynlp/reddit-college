  "text": "So I texted my interviewer last night about a date for the interview. He texted me back at 9 AM and set a time for 10 AM. HOW CAN HE GIVE ME 1 HOUR NOTICE!!! I don't even know what to do, cause I completely missed the message as I wasn't even home. I texted him back and he seems reluctant to reschedule.\n\n\"But now i hv some other work to be done will call u if we can re-schedule\"\u2014his exact message\n\nEdit: he ended up calling me rn at like 11 PM, after me being on tenterhooks all day waiting for a call. The interview ended up going pretty well  despite everything :)",

If there is no opportunity to reschedule, I suggest contacting the admissions office to tell them the situation. don't make it a blame thing, just make it clear that the situation was not ideal for either party so that they don't count anything against you",
