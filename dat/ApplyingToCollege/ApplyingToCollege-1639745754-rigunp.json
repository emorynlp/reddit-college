Just look at it this way: Stanford is much harder to get in than MIT, and MIT is much harder to get in than CMU SCS (you can see this from the fact that SCS is full of MIT rejects, and all the top olympiad winners choose Harvard/MIT over CMU unless they get a scholarship). \n\nFor CMU SCS, if you have decent olympiads (think 3x USAMO + USACO Plat + USAPhO Gold or something like that), a 4.0 GPA and 1600 SAT, and solid ECs and research experience, chances are you're probably getting in. Meanwhile MIT is impossible without an olympiad camp or top award in ISEF/STS, and Stanford is basically impossible no matter what you do.",

      "text": "No, you still have chances. Don\u2019t feel bad or too worried about not getting deferred. Deferral at a school like Princeton is not very valuable. Almost all of the deferrals will get rejected. Deferral is the \u201cfriend zone\u201d of college admissions and Princeton is the beautiful, kind, brilliant, athletic person that everyone wants to date. They had your application, and if they wanted you they would have accepted you already. Princeton Deferrals are sitting around by the phone waiting for the hottest girl in school to have no better options, but she is always going to have better options. Deferral is more valuable at second tier or third tier schools, as these schools will lose their best accepted applicants to schools like Princeton. Acceptance to top schools is largely a statistical phenomenon. If you are the typical very strong candidate (but not gods gift to the admission committee), you have a 25% shot. You roll the dice and something comes up. The individual odds are not in your favor. But if you roll ten times, luck will hit somewhere.",

Probability wise, though, I strongly suspect that someone who is admitted to Princeton would also be more likely to be admitted to any other Ivies to which they applied, and that someone who is outright rejected from Princeton is more likely to also be rejected from other similar schools.\n\nThese are not totally independent variables we're dealing with.\n\nWe don't know why OP was rejected from Princeton.  We do know his application wasn't strong enough to argue for deferral instead of rejection.  Perhaps his essays were terrible.  Perhaps his counselor or a teacher trashed him in a LoR.  Either of these would \\*also\\* damage his chances at other similar schools.\n\nNow, we don't know whether either of these is the case.  But we can conclude they (or other flaws like them) are \\*somewhat more likely to be the case\\* than if he was accepted or deferred at  Princeton (as opposed to outright rejected).",

You changed your approach after the rejection.  My claim was predicated on essentially taking the same approach to all applications.\n2. That one person (you) was rejected at a school and then accepted at other top schools doesn't significantly damage the claim that one rejection bodes poorly for subsequent results.  It would be *highly* damaging if I had claimed one rejection *precludes* subsequent acceptances, but I didn't claim that.\n\n>Princeton is insanely competitive, and even qualified candidates get rejected\n\nThis is absolutely true.  However, candidates that accepted are both qualified *and have something else about them that Princeton finds attractive*.  My contention is that, whatever those attractive qualities are, schools similar to Princeton are likely to *also* find them attractive.\n\nIf being *accepted* to Princeton implies one is more likely to be accepted to similar schools (relative to the scenario where we have no information on the Princeton decision) then *not* being accepted *necessarily* implies one is less likely.  (Albeit only slightly, since a large majority of those who apply to Princeton aren't admitted.)\n\nHere's a contrived thought exercise.  Imagine you had applied to all eight Ivy League schools and had received decisions from all of them except Harvard.  Now consider two scenarios.  In Scenario A you were accepted to all seven; in Scenario B you were outright rejected from all seven.\n\nWould you estimate your odds of getting into Harvard to be any higher in Scenario A than in Scenario B?  I certainly would.",
