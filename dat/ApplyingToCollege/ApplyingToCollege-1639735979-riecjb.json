      "text": "No, it\u2019s a few things.  \n\nFirst, there\u2019s simply far too few spots for the students who want them. This is true as an initial matter \u2014 number of places available in the T20 for the number of students who want them \u2014 but becomes more evident as you start reserving spots in a particular university that aren\u2019t available to the applicant.  Let\u2019s say you have a student who wants to study mathematics at Duke.  When Duke admissions starts filling that class, they are going to have spots that will be filled by athletes and the performance bands.  Then spots filled for students interested in their music and arts programs.  They\u2019ll also have programs that you apply into directly.  At the school my kids attend, that would include engineering, education, kinesiology, and nursing, among others. Then you have Duke\u2019s need to ensure that the class has some level of diversity re intended major so that every department is filled with eager students.  So the prospective math major won\u2019t be considered for spots intended for English, political science, public policy, German studies, health sciences, etc.  Finally, you have an array of other factors.  Universities generally like to have students from every state and split those students among multiple high schools.  They\u2019ll try to admit a certain percentage of international, first gen, and low-income students, as well as seeking out a diverse student body with a male-to-female ratio that\u2019s not dramatically skewed given the applicant pool.  This is what admissions officers call building a class.  So the prospective Duke major wasn\u2019t competing for one of thousands of spots, but one of a few hundred. \n\nSecond, there\u2019s far too many accomplished students out there to allow every one of them to attend a T20.  It\u2019s not as if perfect grades in a ton of AP classes with a strong standardized test score is a sign of genius.  (I say this as a parent who was one of those kids who raised another three of those kids.) Often, it\u2019s simply a sign of being informed \u2014 someone told you in middle school what you needed to attain to be a serious candidate for a T25 \u2014 and means; your family had the ability, time, and interest to employ tutors (if needed), buy practice tests and study materials, and you possibly lived in a school district (or attended a private school) that supplied the background for strong college applications.  As for EC\u2019s, because some students simply \u201ccollect\u201d EC\u2019s for college admissions, or choose EC\u2019s to \u201clook good\u201d for college admissions, many schools value them less in terms of depicting the student\u2019s actual interests.  This is one of the reasons that the number of supplemental essays has generally increased over the years. \n\nThird, the Common Application is making it easy for students to simply blanket the T25.  I was a valedictorian and NMS and I applied to five schools on the west coast.  My husband, also an excellent student and eventual double-Ivy who attended Cornell undergrad, applied to six schools.  It was simply a different process when you had to type every application and use white-out on your mistakes.  We\u2019ve kept our kids out of the prestige hunt, but they still applied to 10 schools each, which was likely 2-3 more schools than they needed.  \n\nFinally, students are simply applying to schools based on rank, rather than seeking out a good fit, which obviously means more applications per school and a smaller likelihood of admission. I\u2019ve seen student college lists here that include Ivy League schools that aren\u2019t actually strong in that student\u2019s intended major. Or students who applied to, say, Stanford, Yale, and Swarthmore, even though those are very different schools, with very different strengths, in very different locations, with very different vibes.  You see the results of such mismatches every fall in the freshmen \u201cI hate my dream school\u201d posts, and it\u2019s precisely this kind of mismatch that causes admissions officers to look so closely at applications; since the students often haven\u2019t sought out a good fit, the admissions officer finds it increasingly necessary to ensure a good fit on their end. Happy students make for better college rankings, happier professors, and an exuberant campus vibe. \n\nSeeking out a good fit also eliminates angst on the applicant\u2019s end.  My youngest, who applied this fall, has a very specialized major in mind. While her prospective schools are in the T75, only one is a T25, due to strength of anticipated major and location.  Thus far, she\u2019s 8/8 for admissions, including three of the top five colleges for her major, with three schools offering fairly generous merit scholarships. Her application season has not been stressful. \n\nObviously, there are other reasons that a strong applicant might not get into their top school. But these are a few of the main ones.  Best of luck on the remainder of your applications.",

              "text": "Thanks.  I particularly like the idea of delivery by fairy.   \n\nI just sort of lost my mind this morning when I saw this post.  I wish I could eliminate the phrase \"dream school\" from the entire college application lexicon.  Because, for most posters here, their perceptions aren't based on much besides a host of rankings and a university website.  In some cases, they don't know how their particular majors are ranked.  They haven't reviewed the courses actually offered by their prospective departments, asked students at the target school how easy it is to get involved in research or faculty papers, looked at the list of clubs and activities available, thought about how they hope to spend their evenings or weekends (hiking vs jazz bars vs cheering in the stands with 80,000 football fans), or checked out the dorms and dining halls.  Many haven't even read the university student paper or student top tens to check out the campus vibe. \n\nAnd I'd truly love to eliminate the false perception that a degree outside the T25 is somehow not as valuable as T1-25.   I went to a T10 law school (was admitted to three) but I did my undergraduate work at a state flagship university -- closer to T100 than T50 -- that gave me a full ride.  I have never regretted my choice.  The D1 sports were amazing, I loved the campus (hiking, climbing, biking, good days trips), and the school was so huge I was able to find classes/professors that precisely fit my areas of interest.  I graduated with something like a 3.96, won a Truman Scholarship, and used it to pay for law school.  I made law review, served on the editorial board, and then went on to work for a prestigious DC firm where I met my spouse, a double-Ivy.  But we did not encourage our kids to aim for anything beyond a good school that was close to home, which was their preference.  They are about to graduate from a public ivy, one with a great job offer (consulting) and the other with excellent graduate school prospects.  And they had a genuinely amazing time with sports, clubs, friends, trips, internships, professors, and classes.  And we still have money left over to help them with grad school.",

                  "text": "I am convinced that students are being given skewed information, if not downright false info from every influential source in their life...social media is not the only culprit. My daughter who was an AO at USC/Babson and private HS College Counselor for the last 12 years keeps me up-to-date on the latest and greatest in Admissions...although i still read/research on my own. We too are a 40+ years in DMV family...the \"baby who is 43!\" is still there and will only leave under duress! To his credit he did spend 4 years in Chad and Namibia with the Peace Corps...totally blew our minds and thrilled...not someone I would ever have projected to ever move out of his hard-shelled comfort zone! I joined Reddit recently (and this sounds totally nuts, but it has served its purpose) to better understand the process and current teenagers' mindsets re college.  Our family is stretched coast to coast...so, I feel as if i don't know my grandsons or friends' offspring s much as I would like to. It has been an eye-opening venture. And, I don't know where the line is drawn between \"having hopes and dreams\\_ and \"REALITY\" for other families. Most of what I see here has no basis in what really happens or what has been my 76-year experience...are people living under a rock? No, you are not going to probably get the financial aid you need and certainly not what you want or have been led to believe. This will crush anyone. There is no explanation (I don't know how many schools take calls after decision days anymore...we did back in the olden days) that will make sense, satisfy. or make you feel better about \"someone I know who has questionable stats, cheated, has no intention of enrolling...got accepted and I got denied\"...none, zippo, nada. Because I am looking at both files and all I can say is at a particular point in time, we liked the other student better. Had nothing to do with any part of your app. I'll stop here as I should. Do you have triplets or Irish twins plus one?",

At the same time, I meet arguably less archived people awards-wise everyday who have made it here. My point is that you shouldn\u2019t  lose hope as you seem to be a strong applicant but understand that at the end of the day it\u2019s truly a crapshot (at least for the majority of int students requiring aid).",

I imagine that 99% of Ivy applicants are beyond \u201cwell qualified\u201d so no one should really be in shock over a rejection, except perhaps double legacies whose families have made substantial contributions.
