  "title:": "Guilt about going to a feeder private school.",
  "text": "Hey guys, I have currently been on and off this sub for some time now and I have read about how much of an advantage feeder private schools are in the admissions process. I attended an extremely expensive private school that cost 40k a year in Rhode Island and I was there on scholarship from the United Nations. I applied to NYU CAS in 2019 with a 3.3 W and a 28 ACT Early Decision with legacy from my sister and being an URM and got in, however I feel very guilty because I didn't work that hard in high school. For example I only had like one or two meaningful extracurriculars and wrote about traveling in my essay. and got in compared to possibly someone else who worked harder. Although I am doing fine at NYU, I can't help but to feel a little guilty because I had such immense resources and advantage in a state where the pubic school systems are really bad. It was even weird at NYU because it was clear that my roommates and some friends of mine had some sort of animosity because I came from a private school. I wondering how I should look at this situation because I have thought about it quite a lot since coming to NYU.",

The bottom line is that you made it into NYU - now try and do your best in college without such thoughts bringing you down... Whatever you're achieving in college is all because of your own hard work - and you should be proud of it!",
