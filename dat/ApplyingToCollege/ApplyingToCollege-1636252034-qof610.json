  "text": "I\u2019m a transfer student.\n\nBackground: \nLong story short, I was chronically ill up until several months ago. This affected my ability to do well in school. My essay/personal statement discusses that. I dropped out of my 1st uni and once cured, I transferred to a CC. \n\nHS: 2.7GPA\n\n1st Uni: 1.14GPA (on Academic probation but eligible to return\n\nCC: 4.0GPA\n\nFamily Income: 25K-35K depending on the year, so I\u2019m extremely dependent on financial aid or low tuition \n\nThingz: URM, First-Gen, Low-Income\n\nSAT: 1080 (retook it today on Nov 6th, awaiting new score) \n\nLocation: Georgia resident, but I\u2019m open to out of state schools if they offer housing for transfers. \n\nCollege ECs: \n* part-time job\n* internship helping low-income Hispanic kids go to college (a program I graduated from)\n* Muay Thai\n* home daycare assistant director (my mom ran a daycare)\n* home responsibilities ( my family is traditional so I cook, clean, and do crop work every week)\n* student government advisory position\n* dorm activities director \n\nMy major is Computer Science, so I\u2019m looking for some CS schools. But I\u2019ve always loved art and Animation. It\u2019s my passion. My dad picked my uni and my major (Marketing) but let me change it to CS last year. He wouldn\u2019t let me go to art school. \n\nI decided since I\u2019m transferring and I\u2019m an adult, I should take a shot at applying for Animation.\n\nI need two separate lists. The animation list does not need safeties/targets/reaches. The CS list does.\n\nAnimation: \n* Champlain College\n* RIT\n* SCAD\n\nCS:\n* Augusta State\n* Georgia State\n* Columbus State\n* University of North Georgia\n* University of Nevada- Las Vegas",
