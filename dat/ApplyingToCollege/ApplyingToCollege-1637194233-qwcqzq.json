I think the only chance they would notice is if there were 1. a very small amount of people in the session or 2. If it was only you who showed up. \nThese are pretty rare so I assume that neither of those have happened. In which case, I don\u2019t think they\u2019d be paying attention to it",

Also realize that if a college says they care about demonstrated interest, the amount to which it matters can be somewhat inferred by their admit rate. That is, a college which admits 50%+ of applicants doesn\u2019t have room to be super concerned about demonstrated interest.",
