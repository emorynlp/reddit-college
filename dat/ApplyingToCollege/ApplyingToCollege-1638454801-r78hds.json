People talking about real wages \"falling\" all the time, even if nominal wages are increasing. If wages/incomes increase by X% and the cost of a good increases by 0.1\\*X %  then the cost of that good has \"decreased\" in real terms.  It has become \"more affordable\" even while it's nominal price has increased.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The fact that your tuition bill didn\u2019t rise as fast as the price of a gallon of gas or a loaf of bread doesn\u2019t mean that your tuition bill has decreased.\n\nAgreed:  like I pointed out, though, the tuition increase is also smaller when compared to nominal wages.\n\nThe main flaw I see is that he's using sticker price instead of net price after all grants/aid.  For instance, if schools are slowing the rate at which they increase sticker price \\*while simultaneously becoming less generous with financial aid and merit awards\\* then the net price may be increasing faster than sticker price.  And it's net price that's more meaningful.",

College can be expensive, and loan interest makes it worse.  But a family that needed a loan of $N in 2019 in order to afford tuition would, in 2021, theoretically require a smaller loan.
