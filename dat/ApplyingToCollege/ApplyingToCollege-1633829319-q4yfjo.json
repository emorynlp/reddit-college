  "text": "I decided to not apply to any Ivy Leagues or Stanford and deleted my applications that I haven\u2019t really worked on tbh and since I live in California I have the amazing UCs and I get 8 total waivers for the UCs and CSUs.  My counselor told me that my current list was good and at least I have Berkeley which is my dream school but my mom would be mad and also I don\u2019t want to regret my decision even though I didn\u2019t really like any of the Ivy leagues or Stanford enough \ud83e\udd29",

      "text": "I think that if you are qualified enough for some Ivies or even Stanford then you should apply. I know Cal' and LA are great, but let me put it this way- let's say you don't get into Cal' or LA but do get into say, Brown. Would you honestly take a mid-tier UC over Brown? \n\nIf you are qualified, then apply. Don't let some essays and fees deter you.",
