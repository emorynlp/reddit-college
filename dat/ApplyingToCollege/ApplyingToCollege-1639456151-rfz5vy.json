If anyone wants an explanation (Georgia Tech is probably the most \"controversial\" ranking on my list), then I can explain my reasoning.\n\n1. UC Berkeley\n2. UCLA\n3. Georgia Tech\n4. UT Austin\n5. UMich\n\nMaybe if UVA hadn't deferred me on Friday... \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f it would be #5 or #4. Sorry not sorry \ud83d\ude0a\n\n\\-----\n\nAnd another note: I think rankings by major are more important than overall rankings.\n\nFor example, if this were for CS, I'd add UIUC to the list. If this were for Business, I'd add UVA, Ohio State, UNC, etc etc etc. You get it.",

If you care more about how strong various departments are thought to be, across the board, then UT-Austin and Wisconsin look better.\n\nUVA does have a shockingly high 6Y graduation rate relative to its SAT splits (better than Berkeley, UCLA and Michigan).",
