  "text": "Okay so, this is going to be a small talk ig. So I got deferred to Cornell the other day and tbh I wasn't too confident that I'd get in at all but knowing that they didn't want to completely reject me gave me this shining light of hope. Not only for Cornell but the whole admissions process in general. Yes I was bummed that I didn't get in right away, but I firmly believe that things happen for a reason and maybe I got deferred so by the next round, I'll be more confident in myself with any of my other applications including Cornell. And I think this is really important for anyone else that got deferred as well because yes it's not the best thing in the world but at the same time, deferral isn't the end. There's always still hope as long as we hold on to it. I'm currently working on my RD applications and low-key feel on top of the world idk. So I guess it all boils down to how we go about our decisions. I see everyone saying, \"stay positive!\" and from experience, I know that those words don't go a long way. I hope you all find your positive mindset through trial and error knowing that not every time will be a sucess just as not every time will be a failure. It was your dream school? Well they didn't reject you. If they did reject you, you can take the next two years to mold yourself better and reapply to transfer. Don't have any other dream colleges? Fake it till ya make it (research till you find a fit basically). Anyway, that's the ted talk lol.",
