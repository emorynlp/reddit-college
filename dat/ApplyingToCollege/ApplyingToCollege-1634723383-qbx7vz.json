And if so, where to begin searching ?",

Contact colleges directly and ask for application fee waiver.  \n\nDo you have SAT scores?\n\nYou can also apply as a transfer student.  Your course credits may count and you need not start from scratch, so to speak. Maybe you can transfer and only have to do 2 more years of undergrad and get an IT degree.",

You can get credit for courses done and therefore can complete a Bachelors quicker than 4 years. So you could be considered a transfer student as opposed to a freshman. \n\nIt\u2019s corrupted in Syria but you got to try. Why not get in touch with schools here and explain your situation? Admissions officers are very nice, I don\u2019t think anybody will ignore you or refuse to answer your questions.",

More schools in USA offer financial aid rather than \u201cscholarship\u201d but the end result is the same.  It makes college affordable. \n\nTry reaching following schools. University of Alabama, Northeastern, Johns Hopkins and  Amherst college. \n\nSorry about relation between Syria and US but student visas should still be doable.

If you are open to not doing a university course, you could check out [https://grow.google/developers/](https://grow.google/developers/), [https://www.coursera.org/](https://www.coursera.org/), [https://www.udemy.com/](https://www.udemy.com/), [https://www.udacity.com/](https://www.udacity.com/). The Google one is apparently recognised by most major tech companies (I'm not too sure about that so you may have to fact check).\n\nThey have tons of courses for whatever CS skills you want to learn (since the tech industry is constantly changing and you always have to learn). The CS community is very open to self taught developers. If you get the some course certificates, get some awards in popular computer science competitions you can 100% get the same education as a university student and show employers that you have the required skills.",
