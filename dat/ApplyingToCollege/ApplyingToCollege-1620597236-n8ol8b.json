  "title:": "Unpopular Opinion: Outside of HYPSM, the average Joe probably never heard of your school.",
  "text": "I know this is probably extremely unpopular, but \"prestige and name recognition\" really stops after HYPSM for MOST people. Now, I know some people might say, \"What about the other Ivies, UChicago, Cal Tech, JHU, etc.\"? Ok, those are all great schools that offer the same quality of education as an HYPSM school or even better depending on the program, but let's be real:\n\nYour typical stranger probably has never heard of Cal Tech. \n\nEveryone knows about the Ivy League, but outside of HYP, some people don't even know what other schools make up the league. For instance, one of my aunts thought the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago were state schools. \n\nUnless you live near those schools or are highly educated in the colleges that are out there, chances are you've never heard of Rice, WashU, or Emory. \n\nAlso, this is another unpopular opinion: the term \"T20\" shouldn't be a marker of prestige. If you threw around the term T20 at a dinner party, almost no one would know what you are talking about. Plus, there are more than 20 amazing institutions in the United States. The term T20 is used around too loosely as well. I know people are going to say \"oh, it's the top 20 universities on US News\" but let's be real, on the prestige scale, there is no way Georgetown (#23) would be regarded as \"less prestigious\" than WashU (#16) by the average person. Same goes with Berkeley (#22). \n\nThoughts and feel free to go off on me in the comments.",

I went to a low ranked undergraduate program in the U.K. at a low ranked institution, and now I\u2019m doing grad school at one of the best schools for my specific field here in the US, at a Big10 school with decent name recognition. If you\u2019re driven, you could go anywhere. My instructor went to a small local college for undergrad, then Cornell. My undergraduate advisor went to a small local college in his home country, then Indiana to a top ranked grad program in the area. On the inverse my HS buddy went to the #1 program in his area at a top 5 school in the U.K., and he ended up dropping out and working a \u201cnormal\u201d job unrelated to his field. All anecdotal evidence, but true nonetheless. \n\nWork hard, smart, and to make connections, and you\u2019ll be good.",

Hard no. Intro classes will be roughly comparable; what sets a lot of programs apart are the electives and upper level courses. Top programs have top faculty; a lot of them are there for the research first, but a significant portion will also teach courses based on their specific areas of expertise. e.g., Penn recently hired one of the leading experts on carbon capture as a ChemE prof, then had her teach an elective course on renewable energy.\n\nAlso, as a rising senior in engineering, we'd be pretty useless engineers at graduation if the shit we learned was all decades old.",

There are industries where name-recognition does matter a lot, like especially for MBA programs, but this is on a case-by-case basis. And on the other hand, even community college nurses have great career opportunities. It's all about your industry.",

          "text": "Right. \"Name recognition\" among the general public doesn't really have anything to do with prestige. If you polled random strangers on the street and told them to name 10 colleges, they would probably mention Harvard, Yale, Princeton but after that it would be a mix. Some people may mention USC because of the recent scandal. Top elite schools in the region would also be mentioned. Southerners know Duke, Vanderbilt, and Georgia Tech are good schools. California residents would name UCs, USC, Stanford, and CalTech. People in New England know Williams, Amherst, and Tufts are prestigious even if people in Alabama never heard of it. \n\nMost people would name their state flagship. College football fans would name Alabama, LSU, Clemson, Ohio State, Notre Dame, Oklahoma, etc. Name recognition among the general population means nothing. If you live in Tennessee and tell people you are going to Swarthmore they will probably ask you to repeat yourself. If you say you are going to the University of Tennessee you are more likely to hear, \"Oh, my nephew goes there. Knoxville is lovely.\"",

Want to work in foreign policy?  Georgetown, William and Mary,  George Washington, and Texas are all great, and only Georgetown occasionally flirts with being a T20.  Want to be an investment banker? There's a half dozen schools around NYC that are a better choice than a lot of T20s.\n\nAnd yes, football and region matters a lot here.  Not a lot of people on the East Coast who don't follow colleges will have ever heard of Pomona, and the same is true for the West Coast and Williams.\n\nAs for overseas, it goes both ways.  Everyone has heard of Oxford and Cambridge, and a lot of people have heard of LSE.  It seems I spend half my time telling people that St. Andrews is not the third or fourth best university in the UK in the minds of most British people (though it is quite good!), and explaining that UCL or Manchester are big deals.\n\nOn the other hand, big universities and places with a big footprint are well known outside the US.  Something curious that my colleagues who help people coming from East Asia have noticed is that a lot of students are interesting in applying to the University of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ because it has a place name that is identified as being part of the US.\n\nThe most important thing is to go someplace where you will be happy and where you'll be able to accomplish what you want to do.",

Like if you interviewed average people on the street in Texas about UT Austin, I'm betting that if you asked \"is it a good school?\" most people would say yes, plain and simple -- maybe just  because they might be able to remember how a few bright classmates from their high school went there or how some coworkers had UT swag in their cubes.",

      "text": "Story time: On JHU decisions day, I checked my portal during lunch time as soon as it was released and I was screaming because I was so excited that I actually got in. Next period was AP Lit, so pretty much all the top students were in that class. I went up to my AP Lit teacher and I told him: \u201cMr. F, I got into Johns Hopkins!\u201d He was really happy for me, so when class started he said: \u201cEveryone, one of your classmates has an announcement to make.\u201d He called me up and he said \u201cDavid, tell them where you got into.\u201d I said \u201cJohns Hopkins,\u201d feeling quite proud of myself.\n\nThe whole class had literally no reaction. I think maybe one person started clapping, but the rest looked very confused, as if to say \u201cwhat school?\u201d Then my teacher started talking about how getting into a top school like JHU can change your life, etc., etc. During this time, a few of my classmates pulled out their phones and Googled JHU (I know because one of my friends told me after class what everyone was doing), then one-by-one they pretty much had a delayed reaction of \u201cWow\u201d after finding out its acceptance rate and USWNR ranking. \n\nMoral of the story here is that if you\u2019re going to choose a school to impress your friends, don\u2019t. They might not even know about the school, and even if they do, they\u2019ll forget about it in a few months once everyone is in college and doing their own thing. If you\u2019re happy with where you go, that\u2019s all that matters.",

I'm from the Chicago area, and if someone around here says that they're going to Northwestern or UChicago, pretty much everyone of all backgrounds will be impressed. Simply because they live close to Northwestern and UChicago, most people from the Chicago area know how great these two schools are. However, saying you're going to somewhere like Rice, Emory, CalTech, a top LAC, lower-ranked Ivies like Brown or Cornell, etc., probably won't draw as much attention. I'm sure it works the opposite way in Houston, for example, where Rice is quite well known, but most people have not heard of Northwestern or UChicago. Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Stanford, and maybe MIT are probably the only schools with true national name recognition.",

My point is that someone's 70-year grandmother may have not even heard of those schools, and it's more often that's true than not.\n\nAt my school, like yours, everyone knows about the T20s. But, when I talk to many of my relatives, the only schools they know are HYPSM, and that's it. When I told my uncle that someone chose a full-ride at Duke over Harvard, he basically acted like that person choose their safety school over Harvard because he didn't realize how strong Duke was academically. He just thought it was a school for basketball, that's it. \n\nWith this post, I'm not trying to disregard other schools outside the HYPSM schools. All I'm saying is that, at times, people are too caught up in the prestige and name brand of a certain school when most of the population probably never thought of your strong as one of the best academic institutions. Ultimately, how recognized your school is among the general population doesn't matter, and I, personally, realize that all of the T20 (or even T50 or T100) schools are amazing institutions. Sadly, a lot of people don't view these schools the same way.",

If you mean you could pluck someone from the street and they'd recognize the name of a school, then it largely depends on what street. Near everyone in Texas knows of UT, A&M and Tech, but I definitely don't expect everyone from every state to know them. If you mean the average person nationally can recognize the name of the school, than I guess you make a valid point. But who cares about name recognition on a national level? Everyone I've met either cared that it's a \"T20\" (and the \"prestige\" associated with a school) or they care about name recognition from where they're from (or both/neither). I've never met someone in Texas who cares if someone in Idaho can recognize the name of their college, unless that Idahoan(?) is an employer, and if this Idahoan is an employer, they likely can recognize a T20. Someone gunning for a T20 isn't trying to impress someone you can pluck off a street, they're trying to impress the higher level people who they want to play a role in their future.\n\nEdit: I might of misinterpreted your post but I think it's still interesting to think about. Why does a person really want to go to a T20? Who exactly are they trying to impress?",

      "text": "I agree since it really depends on what you are majoring in and what you are going into. For example, UI-Bloomington is great in business but just mediocre in everything else. So you are really comparing apples and oranges when you throw out that you went to so and so school and how it is a top twenty university. Since the first thing that a person should ask is in what, for example going to Yale for let's say mechanical engineering is something you should be proud of but it does not even crack the top 30 for engineering programs. Which puts into perspective how they might have been better off going to a less prestigious school like let's say UW-Madison which has hands down the better overall program. While you never hear about UW-Madison, unless you live in the Midwest and have an inkling of an idea about how good the school is despite not having the prestige or recognition of some of these well-known institutions. I mean there are very few schools that are good in everything like Stanford for example, that fall within the top 5 or top 10 for almost everything that a person could possibly want to do involving Business, STEM, or Law. I mean even look at Yale which is considered one of the leading universities in the world and they are just alright in terms of Engineering. So at the end of the day, there is an asterisk next to it, since for example at ASU their accounting and finance undergraduate programs are both in the T20 and they are not exactly the most prestigious school. So I would honestly not care what the college is ranked overall, and really ask what is the ranking for your major and the school for whatever your major is housed in. Since a lot of schools that are good for one or two things, or even just not well known will not carry the prestige that an Ivy would carry but are honestly generally better for what they are studying. While I honestly think that schools are regional minus a select few, so that not many will know some of these large institutions that are just as good if not better than the Ivy League or Ivy caliber schools. For example, most will not know how good of a school and maybe not even know about UW-Madison unless they are from the Midwest. Since the first thing, the average Joe thinks of is Wisconsin as in the cold state with a bunch of cows and the Green Bay Packers. So of course your ones on the coasts will be known, with the Ivies and Stanford, and Cal on the west coast. Since most people who are traveling will go to the coasts, and there are more people along the coast so those schools will always see higher application numbers. Meaning those schools will be more well known, while I think the reason why some schools in the Midwest, in particular, are not well known despite being better than those popular national schools along the coasts for certain areas comes down to the fact that not too many people don't even consider it when applying to schools if they are not from the Midwest. So in terms of prestige and recognition, I think that is a load of bullcrap since it really boils down to the area since someone that graduates from Cal Tech will be more recognizable in California than let's say Dartmouth. While if you took the reverse and say put it in New York then the opposite is true. So, in reality, prestige and recognition only travel as far as the reputation of those schools in those areas.",

For example, I know someone who went from ASU undergrad to NY Law. No problems, grades and LSAT where what makes the difference. Also, as someone who works at a place where a bunch of really, really, really smart people work (I am not one of them), we have people here who went to all different types of schools. We could easily fill the ranks with T20 grads, and they would all be thrilled to get a job here, but I would say less than 20% of our workforce actually went to a T20 school for undergrad. To be fair, I haven't seen the breakdown of how many have post grad degrees, but I bet it's high.",
