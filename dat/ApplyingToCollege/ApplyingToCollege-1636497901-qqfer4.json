I had 750 (so nowhere near yours) with like 8 state awards (maybe that pales in comparison to other people, idk I also had 1 national) and then a bunch of leadership and I didn\u2019t advance\u2026ranked in the top 5 in my class. Whatever though lol it seems like 180k people applied",

              "text": "yeah this is really disappointing ngl but dang it seems like you have impressive stats! i'm sure it will work out for us though, the algorithm couldn't really account for a lot of stuff anyways that AO's can look at. i bet the threshold was higher this year because so many more people applied, and honestly a lot of the stuff they ask for is ambiguous anyways\u2013\u2013i feel like stuff such as leadership should be assessed on levels. like national, state, local, etc. maybe that's just me lol, but i have done a lot for a particular organization on the local, state, and national levels holding positions so for me i couldn't account for those. \n\nnot to mention my school also limits leadership positions to being president of one club, but i couldn't put that down on the thing because it only said the # of positions, which my school doesn't limit. i could be vice president of 6 clubs (just a random scenario...i'm not) but i can't be president of key club AND fbla. not allowed. the stupid application wouldn't let me put that though and i can't put a # of positions because that's lying. so i couldn't say anything. and yeah i probably would have been rejected anyways even with those, but it's just frustrating ya know.",
