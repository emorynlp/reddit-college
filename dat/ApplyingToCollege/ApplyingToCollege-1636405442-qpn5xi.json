And since they are more applicants from Asia, there'll be more rejected.. Internationals from elsewhere aren't put on a relatively easier path.. NO",

      "text": "It's all relative. Being accepted as an international from **anywhere** is hard, with international acceptance rates being about half the overall rate. And few colleges, if any, publish admit rates by country. That said, it is believed that China, Korea and India are the most competitive. So likely an applicant from Andorra would have a relatively easier time. But then so would an applicant from Cambodia. But their chances will still be less than a US applicant.",
