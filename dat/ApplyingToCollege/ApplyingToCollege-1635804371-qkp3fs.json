  "text": "Hi! Just a procrastinator wondering if the UPenn ED is tonight at 11:59 PM EDT, or 11:59 PM according to whichever time zone you are in?\n\nI saw that both Cornell and Columbia posted that their ED deadline is tonight at \"11:59 p.m. your local time,\" but I'm not sure if the same applies to UPenn.\n\nP.S. My time zone is PDT\n\nReally appreciate any help! Thanks!",
