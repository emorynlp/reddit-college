  "title:": "Outside Transcripts Still Not Sent - What Do I Do?",
  "text": "I applied to two colleges for Early Action (UMich and GTown) and had to send transcripts from two outside institutions. One was successfully sent and accepted while another hasn't been shipped yet. I ordered express shipping (hardcopy distribution only) a month ago so there should have been ample time for it to have arrived to these schools. I have called the institution and they said they can't help me (first come first serve when mailing these out) and UMich and GTown said that transcripts can be sent after the deadline. Considering how it's been a week after deadlines, what should my next step be? \n\nFor context, it's only one course but it's a graduation requirement (Algebra 2) so I think it's important for it to arrive.",
