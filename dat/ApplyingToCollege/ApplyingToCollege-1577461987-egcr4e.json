It may have the effect of showing that you are more human, rather than a walking pile of stats. Hopefully, your AO doesn't think anime is all hentai though.",

I ended up going to my second choice in college, which is slightly cheaper and offered me several scholarships. It\u2019s not a bad school, either, but it doesn\u2019t have the prestige of Duke or UNC. I\u2019m still going to try to go to AppState once I apply for my Masters, though.
