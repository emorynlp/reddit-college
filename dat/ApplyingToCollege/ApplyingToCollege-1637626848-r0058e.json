Excellent econ program.\n\nOn the other end, for schools with acceptance rates around 60%, look at the back end of the top 100 universities. There are a whole lot of schools in between.\n\nCheck affordability. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply.",

A lot of other state universities have good programs that are probably reasonable from an admissions standpoint - Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan State, etc.   But it's hard to argue it makes sense to pay OOS tuition for them if you have a good in-state option.\n\nMacalester would be a good LAC for economics in that kind of acceptance range - it's their most popular major.  Lafayette and Villanova are pretty close to that range too for private universities.",
