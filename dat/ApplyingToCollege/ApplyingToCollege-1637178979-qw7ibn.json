  "title:": "Waitlisted by Pioneer Academics",
  "text": "I am a junior at high school applying for the Spring-Through-Summer 2022 term of the online research program called Pioneer Academics. Even though I had applied for biology, neuroscience and psychology (those are pretty competitive) both my application and interview were relatively good; however, today I received an email saying that I got waitlisted. The application deadline for the term is December 19, which means not everyone has applied yet. \n\nDid I get waitlisted because not everyone has applied and how much chance do I have to be accepted from the waitlist?",

      "text": "hiya ! can't answer your questions too well, i think, but here's my perspective:  \n\n\nso I applied for the Summer 2021 term and didn't get it. I was also waitlisted! They had a lot of applicants my round and same for yours, I'd assume. \\[I needed a full ride too, so that may have been a factor\\]   \n\n\nConsidering you had a decision prior to other ppl, I'd assume you applied for the early consideration? When I applied, most people got their decisions \\[early and reg decision\\] at the same time so IDK why you got it early unless they're doing things differently this year or for the spring session.   \n\n\nI knew about \\~10 people who applied \\[early and reg\\] and only one person got off the waitlist. So not a lot of people do, from what I gather. But it's okay! You'll have other opportunities :)",

              "text": "ahh yep, sounds about right. So they also give special consideration for\n\n1. kids who apply early AND \n2. kids who applied for previous opportunities.\n\nSo if you apply again for Summer 2022, you might have a better chance! If you feel comfortable, could oyu let me know if you'd be full pay, partial pay, or full ride? bc from what I recall, that does play a factor as they have limited funds",
