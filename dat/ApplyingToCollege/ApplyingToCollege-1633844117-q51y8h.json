  "title:": "Terrible student who was academically dismissed. On track for significant improvement at state college + notable extracurricular activities. Chances of transferring?",
  "text": "I was a poor student throughout most of high school, I think I ended up with a cumulative GPA of 2.7. I scored a 1370 on my SAT, a 30 on my ACT though, and did well on 4 AP tests though so I ended up being accepted to a decent university (T200). I failed almost all of my classes during my first semester and was subsequently academically dismissed. I got mediocre grades at my next semester, at a crappy state college, and I\u2019m currently on my third semester there. \n\nI\u2019ve dealt with a lot of the issues that led to my poor grades in the past and I\u2019m doing pretty well so far this semester, on track to have all As, and so I want to transfer to a \u201ctraditional\u201d university and give it another shot. When it comes to extracurriculars, I co-founded a successful global youth non-profit and I\u2019m about to be on the Board of Directors of a notable international non-profit. I also have like 3-4 years of job experience, with some being interesting ones like working on a farm as a manual laborer and in a municipality in a third world country.\n\nI\u2019m currently looking at a bunch of state universities with high admission rates like University of Iowa, Michigan State University, University of Delaware, University of Kansas, etc\u2026 I was wondering what y\u2019all think my chances are at getting accepted to one of these universities? I could also apply for readmission to the first university I went to but I don\u2019t really want to go back.\n\nThanks for your help. I\u2019m happy to answer any questions y\u2019all have.",

      "text": "What you're describing is very possible. Colleges are always going to care more about what you're doing now than what you did in the past. It sounds like you've really gotten your shit together, which makes you an attractive candidate. \n\nDo you have 2 semesters of good grades? If so, you could include some more competitive colleges on your list. Even if you've got 2 semesters of mediocre and 1 of good, 45-60% admit rates are reasonable targets for your profile. It shows that you've grown, and made a permanent break from your very poor grades of the past.\n\nCheck out r/TransferStudents for people more familiar with your type of situation. They also have a solid wiki to help guide you through the process.  r/TransferToTop25 has a lot of useful info too, even if you're not planning to apply to top schools. Good luck!",
