I\u2019m sure my daughter will be going through this soon so I\u2019ll be sure to be an advocate for her when others in the family ask her too much. \n\nKnow you\u2019re most likely venting (and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re getting it off your chest instead of holding it all in), but here are a few things from an adult perspective if it will help:\n\n1) Usually when someone doesn\u2019t know what to ask/say, they will continue to bring up the same questions or bring up topics they think are relevant and current to you in hopes of having something to say.\n\n2) For those who didn\u2019t get to go to college or have multiple college options, it\u2019s pretty exciting and a way to indirectly show how proud they are that you have the option to go to college AND get many to choose from! Hence the repeat questions too as its more than likely they don\u2019t understand the process either (or have forgotten it).\n\n3) Some are just too dang old to remember if they asked before or not too, lol! \n\n4) And some are just jerks (maybe without trying to be?) who don\u2019t have the imagination to try and bring other topics to the table.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, as someone who didn\u2019t get to graduate from college, I\u2019m really proud of all of you young adults out there for getting the chance to go and CONGRATS on all of your hard work for getting where you are at! I also hope you know that the well meaning adults out there, despite the annoying questions, really are excited for the journey ahead of you and are so happy for you. And for those who are not well meaning ... screw them, lol! Best of luck to all of you!",

Asking direct questions about college and acceptances and such has always been rude, but it's worse now, I know.\n\nThere are some kids who LIKE talking about it and sharing the details (and their worries, too). I've found that it's best to say something open-ended like, \"What's it like to be a senior in all of this??\" And those who want to share have that opportunity and those who don't can just say, \"It sucks, not gonna lie.\"",

      "text": "When I was at a restaurant with a family, a waitress walked by and casually started a conversation with them. She turned her attention to me and asked if I was currently attending college. I had a lot of personal problems to deal with, so although I didn't imply college wasn't an option, I didn't want to for the 100th time go through this nitpicky and incredibly judgemental \"I think I know better than you about college and the anxiety that a lot of HS seniors deal with\" attitude I so often receive from most of the adults that ask me. I replied back, \"No.\" I didn't feel the need to tell her my worries. She then smiled and asked \"Why?\" \n\nI know it's a very common topic that not only adults ask when someone reaches the age for college. I know. But if every other people badger me, whether it be some relative or an older coworker of mine about this topic, how can I not feel overwhelmed? I felt as if I said anything other than yes, that I was the abnormal one. And it felt frustrating. I wanted to feel excited at that time about the college life. I wanted to be able to chime in like all the other students about what I wanted to do. But I just couldn't. It would have been appreciative if someone asked me anything other than the most stressful question ever. The older generation just doesn't seem to understand that although a lot of seniors do go through the process of prepping up for college, it DOES NOT make it any less stressful. How on God's green earth could I know what I wanted to do at the mere age of 18? \n\nI'm honestly at a better place now, even if it's just slightly so. I remember reading a story regarding the anxiety upcoming young adults go through. One of their quote was, \"Not knowing anything at all is the best time in deciding what you want.\" I wish I had looked at it in that light when I was 18.",
