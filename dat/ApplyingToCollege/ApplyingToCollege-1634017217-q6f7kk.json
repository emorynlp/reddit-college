  "text": "My teacher shared me their LOR before uploading it via Common App and I think it\u2019s perfect. I was a bit worried about it since they\u2019ve moved to a different school, but their letter is amazing and they\u2019ve described me as one of the top 5% they\u2019ve encountered in their career. I\u2019m honestly not too concerned about my other teacher recommender now that I know what to expect.",

      "text": "I wouldn\u2019t worry about your teacher moving on to a different school. If anything, that\u2019s actually a stronger rec. Think about it:  that teacher won\u2019t ever need to see you again. They\u2019ll never have you in class, so it\u2019s easier for them to not feel any sort of pressure to talk you up and it was easier for them to say \u201cno\u201d on giving you a LOR in the first place. That you\u2019ve made enough of an impression that they\u2019re giving you a strong LOR now says as much to me as the content of the letter. Congrats.",
