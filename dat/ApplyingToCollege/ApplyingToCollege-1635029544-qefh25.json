  "text": "Hi. I want to study computer science at Georgia tech but in my schools ib program I was unable to do so. I do have a strong physics background though with advanced maths so I am wondering if it would be more advantageous to apply physics since it aligns better with my courses. Which one would I have a better chance of getting into. Thanks I\u2019m makes btw if that impacts it. \n\nAlso when is the earliest I can change majors if admitted? Thanks",
