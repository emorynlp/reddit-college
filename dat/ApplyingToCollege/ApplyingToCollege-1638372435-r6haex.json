  "text": "So far I got only three schools I applied to. Got accepted to one school I like and I am happy about it. I feel excited and ready to go.  I honestly wish I explored more schools instead of just one in early decision. I could give myself more options to explore and possibly get into better schools. Maybe schools that offer a great amount of financial aid and scholarships. At that time I was thinking there was no point applying to any more schools after being accepted to the school I like. Now I feel ashamed of not applying to schools I could have possibly gotten into like Boston College/ early decision. At the same time, I felt hesitant applying to schools with a below 50% acceptance rate because I wasn't confident enough applying to schools like that. My family didn't have the money to be paying one application fee after another. So I sat there missing out on more opportunities I could have taken. I regret the way I think past few months. \n\nAt the same time, I also wish I could have done things differently past 4 years in high school. Before going to high school, I had different goals in life for my career. I wasn't thinking about college. I was thinking about joining the military and just passing all my classes is what matters to me. Once I started to have health issues, I knew I would be disqualified from joining the military. That was when I wanted to think about college, that was at the beginning of 11th grade. In 11th grade, I did very well after a rough year in 10th grade due to k12 issues and covid 19. With me thinking back to 9nth grade, I know I could have gotten a B in Algebra at least. Instead, I settle down for a C due to me thinking I'm fine I'm going to join the military as long it's a passing grade. This year I hardly holding onto a B in Pre Calculus, with midterms coming up next week, I'm afraid I'll get another C in Math. Im desperately trying to avoid any more C's. Due to me making only C's in the first semester of 10th grade due to my school having issues with K12. I did ask to do a recovery program that year, they told me no that is only for kids who failed their classes so I don't need it. I could have done Ap and honors for history and science but my school never told me they had programs like that until 11th grade. It's too late for me to join any since most require prerequisite Ap classes. If I knew I know I would have done well, I know what Im capable of. I know my strength and weaknesses, I feel unsure about my high school years.  I wish I could have done better enough to allow me to apply to amazing schools. Now I reflected on myself, I plan on doing better than what I did in high school.",

As you've said yourself, just learn from your past experiences and don't repeat for the future (in college). Hindsight is 20/20 - don't perseverate over what you think are\nmistakes, but use them to change your future actions.",
