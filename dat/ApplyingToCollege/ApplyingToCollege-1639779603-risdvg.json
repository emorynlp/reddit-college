  "text": "You can probably tell what kind of post this is from the title. Now, I didn't EA to a lot of places and I only received one decision from a reachhh reach school (deferred), but I was just thinking about how it's funny how we high school seniors manage to grasp onto that little shred of hope that we'd get accepted to one of those 5%-acceptance-rate-top-20-Ivy-League schools. The logical part of my mind is mentally preparing myself for a rejection (I mean... the chances are virtually impossible, especially for someone who didn't find the cure to fucking cancer or something), but there's somehow a little part of me that thinks I might get magically accepted. And when I get that rejection or deferral, I know that it's statistically expected, but there's still that little sinking feeling in my chest knowing that even imagining that I could be accepted was all but a pipe dream. \n\nFor all of you still holding onto that hope that you'll be accepted, please don't let it go - this is by no means supposed to be a \"let go of your dreams - they'll never come true\" post, but more of a \"it's okay that you didn't get in and it's okay for thinking you had a chance\" post. After all, we are all human. :)",
