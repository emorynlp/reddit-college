Hit save, everything disappeared. I had already gone to bed and she didn\u2019t let me know for a few days bc she was so distraught. By the time we went back to correct the essays, we had kind of forgot what the changes were.  (Good thing for her that was Aug 15th\u2026and I\u2019m such tyrant \ud83e\udd23)\n\nYeah, it\u2019s brutal.",
