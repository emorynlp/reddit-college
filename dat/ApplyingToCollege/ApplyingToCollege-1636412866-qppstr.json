  "text": "So during FAFSA, when they ask for dependents - we are supposed to provide dependents we have claimed on the tax return. Two of my grandparents live with my family and have lived with us for the past 7-8 years but we have never claimed them on the tax return because they do not work I think.\n\nThey do receive some governmental assistance like medicare and something but all of their day to day expenses (food, technology, clothing, travel) comes from my parent's pockets and to do that year after year for 8 years is a large sum of money. Now in no way am I mad at my grandparents for this but I am afraid that based on the tax numbers and how much money is theoretically left over, I would not get enough aid as more money is spent on my grandparents. Would I be able to use this information to negotiate more aid? I am hoping to attend a T20 or 30 school so preferably a school with generous aid and hence I am hopeful in this manner. Let me know what my situation entails in terms of aid. Thank you.",
