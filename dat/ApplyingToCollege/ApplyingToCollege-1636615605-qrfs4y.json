I talked to my interviewer about NS (we ended up having a 50 minute conversation about the things I did and the things I learnt) and it didn\u2019t feel like an interview AT ALL. \n\nI\u2019m also a conversationalist! And I asked my interviewer about some of the most interesting/memorable conversations she\u2019d had at Stanford, some of which were really touching.",
