The reality is that my ED school is technically a match for me/saftey, but it\u2019s just the applicant pool is selective and I have anxiety and just there\u2019s a million other factors telling me that I\u2019m not good enough. But I\u2019m trying to remember that I am good enough even if a college tells me I\u2019m not, and so are you. I\u2019m trying so hard to prepare myself to open that letter, but I just can\u2019t. Just remember that you are good enough.",
