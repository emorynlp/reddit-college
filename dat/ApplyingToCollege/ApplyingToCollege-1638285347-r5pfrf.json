  "text": "My daughter is a dual enrollment - HS senior/First year Community College student. Should she wait for her first semester grades to apply to schools? Does it look better to admissions officers? Or is it better to get applications in earlier and apply now?",

      "text": "If the application deadline is 12/31, then the application needs to be submitted by that date. First semester grades need to be sent when available for those colleges that require, regardless of whether those grades are available on 12/31. Those grades will be considered as part of the application. When you send the application does not matter as long as it's by the due date.\n\nIf the college is rolling admissions, you are likely still better off sending in the application sooner vs later.",
