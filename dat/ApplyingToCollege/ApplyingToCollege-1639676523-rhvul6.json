  "text": "I am currently working in nonprofit development for a large homeless resources organization. I\u2019ve been here 6 months now and my boss really likes me. She often praises my work and I believe she could write a glowing letter of rec.\n\nI want to apply to a information/library science program and my goal is to be an outreach librarian with a focus on creating programming for people experiencing homelessness. In a lot of ways it\u2019s related to work I do now. \n\nIf I get into this program I am applying for, I will probably quit my job and move to another state. \n\nCan I ask her for the letter? Is it inappropriate since she is my current employer? Do I need to say that if I get in, I\u2019ll quit? I would continue to stay with this organization for another 6 months regardless. \n\nI only kept up with one professor after I graduated, but who has since passed away, so I\u2019m limited on other options!",
