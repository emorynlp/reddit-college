  "text": "So I was checking my To-Do List for Cornell's Financial Aid stuff which is on this link (if anyone's curious): [https://finaid.cornell.edu/check-application-status](https://finaid.cornell.edu/check-application-status), and it said I still had to (1) submit my Mom's Schedule 2 on her federal tax return form, but she doesn't have one. It was never filed and she didn't need one. And (2), my noncustodial parent's CSS profile apparently did not register, even though I made one, submitted it, and it says like \"other parent submitted on 10/20/21\" at the bottom of my CSS profile. All of these just say \"initiated\" as the status. What do I do?",
