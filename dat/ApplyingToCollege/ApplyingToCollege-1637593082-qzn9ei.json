  "text": "I'm wondering whether or not it's worth reporting my SAT score to more selective colleges like IVYs, MIT (Probably won't report), Northwestern, and WashU as a biology major if my math is lower than my English. I just used up my last free one, so retaking isn't an option. I feel like I\"m in a good place with other parts of my app.",

      "text": "For college admissions, a score in the mid 1500s is better than a 1600. 1520 makes you look human; 1600 makes you look like a boring robot who has no life. It doesn't matter that your math section is a smidge lower than your English --the difference is just a couple questions here and there. Quite frankly, nobody cares! \n\nI applied for social sciences / humanities, but my SAT Math was 20 points higher than my SAT English. I now go to my dream school.\n\nPlease don't go test optional with a score like that. If you don't submit to MIT, AOs *will* suspect that you're hiding a much lower score -- especially if you don't come from a disadvantaged background where taking the SAT is difficult.",

The highest score range is 750-800. This suggests that as long as you're scoring at or above 750 in each section, you're already in the top score category and your standardized testing can't carry you any further. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Should a student look more \u201chuman\u201d and score a 1400?
