  "text": "My family and I have been going through some hardships ever since I was born. It's a very long story but anyways I sent my ED school additional information (they allow it) talking a little bit about my family circumstances and how they actually made me a stronger person and helped me gain some valuable skills in life. Do colleges care? These circumstances definitely took a huge hit on my life both negatively and positively and have become a huge part of my identity.\n\nu/admissionsmom and u/skieurope12 what do you think?",

      "text": "Just another HS student here, but I'd say they probably do. Might depend on the college, but what student can be expected to maintain perfect grades if there are major hardships at home? Telling them about your circumstances gives a lot of context to your grades, ECs, etc. It shows them that anything missing from those areas is not because of a lack of effort or an unwillingness to challenge yourself, but that you had genuine struggles that you had to face that a lot of very qualified applicants might never be able to imagine. So, I'm no AO, but I'd say that those circumstances do matter to colleges, but I don't know to what extent. Good luck!",
