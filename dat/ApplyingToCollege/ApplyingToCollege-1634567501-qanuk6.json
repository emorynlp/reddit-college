I literally have to include my noncustodial parent and his wife\u2019s information only because my noncustodial parent paid like the tiniest bit of child support in 2020\u2026after spending 13 years not paying it before then. \ud83e\udd27 they don\u2019t even do anything for me or help me live like it\u2019s honestly kind of insulting at this point. And plus my noncustodial parent is clueless so literally I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ll be done with the damn thing by Halloween so\u2026yay me and nosy ass CSS \ud83e\udd27\ud83e\udd27",
