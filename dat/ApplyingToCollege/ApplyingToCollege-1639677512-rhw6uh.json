      "text": "Tbh I feel like it\u2019s a frequent feature of all top colleges that you have some absolutely amazing people but also shady people who are there through connections/money. The admissions system has a way of favoring the latter group as long as they can reasonably conceal their shadiness. I always have mixed feelings about Harvard because on one hand, one of the most brilliant and kind people I\u2019ve ever met who saved me in middle school goes there. On the other hand, the person who both sexually and just generally harassed me for three years and made my life hell also goes there. But his family is like \u201chas a private helicopter and eats at Michelin Star restaurants on weekday dinners\u201d rich, so \ud83d\ude43 Just best for your own life to focus on the good people and avoid the bad ones",

      "text": "I\u2019m going to blame it on Bay Area money/money in general.  So many families of wealth hire consultants literally when their child is in kindergarten.  Having a college consultant guide the student\u2019s every move.  What normal people can compete with that?  Apparently I could not as I just got rejected.   Because I\u2019m still hurting I\u2019m going to respond again.  The non-profits drive me crazy.  Most aren\u2019t addressing a new societal issue.  If the student wanted to make an impact they could work with an existing non-profit. But because daddy is or has a lawyer to do the paperwork, a non-profit is created for show.  It\u2019s really overdone Stanford. Move on to the next big thing.",

Literally i dont understand why top schools can't get this through their brains. 90% of these nonprofits are bs and just a way of getting into college. all they do is divert resources from other nonprofits, which splits up the money and makes it so all of them to have less of an impact because they all have a small slice of the pie",
