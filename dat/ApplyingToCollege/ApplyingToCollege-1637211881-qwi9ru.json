  "text": "So typically I'm an straight A type student. The past three years I've consistently gotten A's and A-'s, with the exception of one B my freshman year. My gpa as of right now is 3.85 uw and 4.58 w. I'm not taking too many AP's my senior year: AP biology, AP Calc AB, and APES. AP Calc and AP Bio at my school are known to be pretty tough, and that's really showing in my grades. Currently I have a B+ in AP Bio, a B+ in APES, and a solid B in Calc AB. In my other two honors classes I have a high A. I am truly trying in my classes and not slacking off, but I am scared colleges will think that because of my three B's that I'm just not putting in the effort to keep an A. What do you guys think? Am I totally overthinking this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS. Colleges I am planning to apply to include: Ohio State University, University of Richmond, Case Western Reserve, some UC's, and Purdue. (Perhaps Wash U and Cal State Poly SLO)",

      "text": "UCs/SLO care about your a-g courses from 10th-11th grade. Senior year course rigor matters but grades won\u2019t matter. Just get mainly A\u2019s and B\u2019s.  A C won\u2019t get you rescinded. \n\nNot sure about the other colleges. They may ask you to submit a mid year report, which would make senior year first semester grade matter. I think your GPA now is solid. If you have strong ECs and decent essays, you\u2019re competitive. Wash U St Louis is always a reach, as are UCLA and Cal.",
