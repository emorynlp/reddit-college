She can probably get into any of them and afford it.\n\nBased on conversations I have had with her (and conversations she\u2019s had with others that I have heard about), she plans on going to our city college that is barely T200. Why? While besides it being academically easy, her boyfriend goes there. A brilliant girl is making one of the most important decisions of her life based on this boyfriend\n\nUpdate: The girl wants to be a doctor and plans to get her bachelors and MD at the same university. She\u2019s gone to many summer programs at colleges 12+ hours away so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s staying at home. The only other reason she says she wants to go to that college besides her boyfriend is that it will be academically easy for her.",

It's worked out really well because we've been able to work through how communication needs to work and we're both introverted so having the week to focus on our studies has been very helpful. \n\nThat being said, I'm about to apply to a number of very competitive and challenging programs, all of which are out of state. I know myself well enough to know that, yes, I could do well in the program if I was doing it alone, but I'm going to be absolutely miserable for those two years away from my partner and would risk major burnout that I may not be able to recover from.",

Even if you guys are closer, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll have easy and cheap ways to meet each other, so the extent of the distance doesn\u2019t really change much.",

      "text": "Christmas Day related story:\n\nA little over a decade ago, a family friend living in Iowa was torn between where to go to school. As a 4.5 GPA, high SAT, nationally recognized and accomplished swimmer, he had his pick of the litter. Eventually accepted to and allowed onto the swim team at Stanford and Cal Tech, he was basically set. \n\nBut then his girlfriend who wasn\u2019t as hard-working as a kid committed to nearby South Dakota State late in April. Our family friend, who hadn\u2019t applied to SDSU, got in contact with the admissions office and applied after the deadline and gave up on swimming at Stanford to follow his girlfriend of one year there. \n\nHis parents, his town, his friends.... everyone was livid with him. But he was sure about it, he knew she was the one. Anyways it ended up working out! They lived together all throughout college, got married, and now have two kids!!\n\nTotally kidding, they got an apartment together in their first semester, she cheated on him two months in, he got severely depressed as a result and failed his first semester then dropped out. \n\nLast I heard I he finished an associates in a nearby CC and now works in Des Moines. \n\nDon\u2019t chase, y\u2019all. Never.",

      "text": "just wanted to share a personal story that kinda goes against this:\n\n(i\u2019m a high school senior so not sure how it\u2019s gonna work out yet but my boyfriends a year younger than me.)\n\nMy high school is about a 10 minute walk from a T20 school, and right now i\u2019m torn between a LAC and the giant t20 next to us. Chances are, I am going to pick the t20 EVEN THOUGH i like the LAC, and my boyfriend is a big part of the reason, but other reasons include financial aid, better course selection, nice location, diversity, etc.\n\nI personally think that an s/o and where friends go can be a part of the reason why you choose a specific college, but it definitely should not be the only reason.",

I considered giving up on my dream school to go to my local state school to stay closer. Needless to say, we broke up, but now I\u2019m going to said dream school in the fall and I\u2019m so glad I pursued my dream and didn\u2019t settle. I know so many couples who settled on schools and are super unhappy. High school relationships aren\u2019t everything. Look out for yourself!",
