  "text": "I hate falling in love with a school because the school I really want is just so competitive\u2026 it has everything I want but I have low confidence in my Ed app. I know people say if you are rejected, you just weren\u2019t meant to go there but I\u2019m fairly sure that I would be happiest there.",

Like all I have is some clubs and stuff but these people have research from like Stanford or like Columbia and I\u2019m just like woah\u2026 I have like no chance. I know my sat and grades are good enough but my extracurriculars are just complete shit compared to others lol.",

It\u2019s hard, I know, because most of the reach schools have something attractive, but the heart has capacity to love more than one college, so take advantage of that and also focus on a safety. Whether it\u2019s location, how your major is structured, sports/mascots, surely there is something to get excited about.",
