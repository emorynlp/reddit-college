  "text": "I dream of nothing but getting into my dream college 10 hours away from my hometown and ghosting everyone from highschool. \n\nGhosting the fake friends, the acquaintances, the racist people, the unfunny people, everything. I need that psuedo-freedom that comes with college man please\n\nalso need a second chance at making friends and meeting new people cuz high school fucked me up socially and mentally lol\n\nEdit: thanks for da awards. And an FYI, I\u2019m not trying trying to romanticize college or saying it\u2019s gonna solve my problems. I think anyone else who wants this \u201csoft reset\u201d, including me, needs to work on themselves before they go off to college so that never have a reason to need another soft reset. I remember high school was gonna be my \u201csoft reset\u201d and I came into high school acting like a middle schooler thinking I was gonna be popular LMFAO",

I wasn\u2019t really that close with anyone to begin with when I look back. Anyways that all happened and stuff with my family was deteriorating all the while so I kinda just hated existing. Got to college in the fall out of state and just hit the ground running, my fall semester freshman year was probably the happiest I\u2019ve been in a long time. \n\nThese days it\u2019s a different story but I still much prefer college to HS",

I wanted and did get my soft reset, but I continued making many of the same mistakes I did in high school, and at this point I am kinda wishing for a soft reset again. Instead though I am looking inward on my behavior and choices that led me here and I am trying to get better that way. Ultimately moving doesn\u2019t solve your problems, problems tend to move with you.",
