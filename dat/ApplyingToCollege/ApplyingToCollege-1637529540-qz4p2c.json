  "title:": "Is being a former foster youth a hook?",
  "text": "Throwaway for personal reasons - I was in foster care for a few years during my childhood (exited before I was 13).  How would colleges, especially T20s, view this?  Would it be considered a hook?  I didn't exactly have the best grades as a freshman/sophomore due to a lot of family issues so I'm hoping that they'll be more lenient with my situation.  Thanks in advance!",
