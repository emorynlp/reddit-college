  "text": "I\u2019m having a tough time finding online accelerated bachelor\u2019s programs. Affordable is definitely a bonus. I don\u2019t care about getting into a prestigious university or anything like that because I only want a bachelor\u2019s for law school. Id most likely be majoring in something in liberal arts, like communications (something really easy for maintaining as good a GPA as possible). Any recommendations?",
