  "text": "I was fortunate enough to take the SAT three times, my first test was an absolute disaster but I am able to superscore my SAT score to a pretty good one using my two most recent scores. For the \"number of SAT scores you wish to report\" question, would I put 2 or 3? I am only self-reporting my highest math score from the 3rd time and highest ERW score from the 2nd time on the Common App. My school doesn't accept official score reports until admission.\n\nThank you!!",
