              "text": "I started the application process during the middle of 2nd semester last school year I\u2019m pretty sure, but most people don\u2019t start that early. You can still complete an application as normal. SAs have a very involved application compared to other schools.\n\nHowever, most people don\u2019t start applications this late either. I would be careful to make sure that you aren\u2019t to late to get a congressional nomination at this time (if you\u2019re serious about applying) as many congresspeople\u2019s deadlines have passed. Congressional nominations are required if you want an appointment to most SAs.\n\nCheck your state senators\u2019 websites as well as the website of your representative in the House of Reps to find deadlines and application forms for nominations. If at this point the due dates have been passed for applying for a nom it\u2019s going to be extremely hard to get an appointment for most SAs. Coast Guard doesn\u2019t require noms tho, so if you\u2019re into that then feel free to apply at any time. The Merchant Marine Academy has some weird nomination rules I don\u2019t know the specifics of.",
