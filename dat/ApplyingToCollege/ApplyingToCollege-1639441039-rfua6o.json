I applied RD to a lot of fucking schools because of my insecurity. it was such a magical moment for me when RD decisions came and I got into some of the best schools in the world (cal, ucla, Dartmouth, Oxford are some). I\u2019m now a happy bruin with absolutely no regrets and I truly believe every single person who got rejected in the ED round has something absolutely amazing coming their way and I would definitely wait it out.\n\nwe gotta get that mamba mentality. trust the process homies. peace \ud83d\udd4a",

Also, I did a bit of research, and it was more difficult to get into much lesser acclaimed school than Cornell. I had about a 45% chance of getting into Wesleyan (which I did) and a 65% chance of Cornell (these are averages across multiple websites)\n\nCornell is the worst Ivy. I said it and I won't take it back. If you want to go Ivy, go anywhere besides Cornell. It's the attempted transition  b/w the Ivy Leagues and the Hidden Ivies, and both would be better than Cornell",
