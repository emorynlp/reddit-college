  "text": "So I'm applying to Vanderbilt and their Ingram scholars program. An essay of the Ingram scholars program has a prompt which is very closely related to what I've written in the additional information section of the Common App. Can I just make slight tweaks to what I've already written and submit that to the scholars program or should I write something new? Would repetitive content affect me in a bad way?",
