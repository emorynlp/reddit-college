  "text": "I don't know much about questbridge because I don't qualify, but 2 of my close friends were finalists. Both of them matched with Ivy League schools today and are super excited. I'm wondering if comparing my stats to theirs would help me predict my results. I have better stats than both of them, so does that mean I have a good chance at top schools too? Or is the questbridge process different? If I applied to the same schools they got in, will that affect my chances?\n\nEdit: I just found out another one of my friends matched at an Ivy League. Thats 3 friends!!! 2 at my school and 1 at a school close by. My school has never produced an Ivy league student before and I'm so proud right now.",
