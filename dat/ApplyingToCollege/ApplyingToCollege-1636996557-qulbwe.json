  "text": " \n\nDue to some reasons, I can't apply for the Johnson scholarship on time (most prob) so was wondering if applying to W & L (as an International requesting aid) for need-based financial aid is a good idea or not?\n\nI'm asking particularly because I've heard that W & L mostly gives out merit aid to internationals and receiving the need-based award is relatively v difficult, is that true?\n\nContext:\n\nEFC: 13k Usd/year\n\nCitizenship: India",
