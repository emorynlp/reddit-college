  "text": "im so terrified I wont get into my ED school and I've been rereading my essays over and over and I'm like omg why did I submit this like I hate them now. As a first generation college student my parent have put so much pressure on me to get into a good school and decisions come out in a few days and I don't know what to do. I really do not think I have a chance of getting in even though I worked so hard. I literally do not know what I'm going to do i feel like its actually gonna break me",

      "text": "I'm in the same boat; as a first-gen student with a sister who is going to a really good school, i feel like I have to measure up. I try to remember that my EA isn't everything and I have a lot of other schools on my list, but it's tough because I've wanted to go to the same school since 8th grade. My friend gave me this piece of advice on how to not let rejection consume you after she got rejected from her dream school \"I let myself take one day to mourn and feel really upset, then I move on because theres so much more to the world.\" I think it's important to not get bogged down on one school right now because we are right in the middle of application season; there will be bigger and brighter things in your future. Hope this helped (if nothing else, you know you aren't alone; misery loves company right?) and best of luck with your decision!",

      "text": "Looked at my ED essays awhile ago after submitting them and had mixed feelings. In retrospect though it was mostly nerves driving that reaction, and if I were to edit my essays much more they wouldn\u2019t sound authentic. At a certain point it\u2019s important to recognize that we are all human, we have strengths but we also have limits. Instead of focusing on the one or two things you feel like you didn\u2019t do, focus on the dozens of things you successfully accomplished.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, undergraduate schools don\u2019t have much sway in dictating where you\u2019ll go in your life. It\u2019s ultimately all up to you, some schools can offer more connections and abroad opportunities but if you look you\u2019ll find them regardless of where you are. Hell, if you end up somewhere less \u201cselective\u201d or \u201cprestigious\u201d and work to find opportunities you\u2019ll likely be a stronger prospect for hiring out of undergrad. Stop putting so much pressure on yourself, you\u2019ve done loads of successful work and limitless opportunities await wherever you go.",
