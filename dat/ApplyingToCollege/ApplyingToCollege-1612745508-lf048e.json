  "text": "Edit: Added new sections on paper/potential disadvantages. Hopefully this helps. Thank you for your support!\n\nAre you a high school student? college student? college consultant??? Yes you would love a fountain pen.\n\n>Why should I get a fountain pen??? \\[insert pencil/ballpoint/pilot g2\\] is great!\n\nThe reasons you should get a fountain pens are numerous, but here are a few:\n\n1. Unlike ball points, gel, or pencil, **fountain pens do not require any pressure to write at all**, which means that it's perfect for incoming or present college students when taking class notes or any long session of writing. **Say bye to hand cramps**\n2. It's an investment for life. Although you may go wild buying all the inks and pens later, theoretically you only need ONE pen for LIFE (unless you lose it). Many people pass on their fountain pens as heirlooms - it will LAST FOR YEARS.\n3. It be pretty\n\n>Why are you posting this in a college sub?\n\nIt's per the request of our very own A2C discord server.\n\n>Wait, we have a *discord server*?\n\nYes, yes we do. And it's FUN ova here, join us! [https://discord.gg/a2c](https://discord.gg/a2c)\n\n# Mythbusters\n\n>Fountain pens are only for people with pretty handwriting.\n\nFalse!!!11!1. Fountain pens are just pens, and they're for everybody. HOWEVER, fountain pens prove to be a motivation for a lot of people to improve their handwriting, or at least be deliberate when they write things down, which can drastically improve how your writing looks.\n\n>Fountain pens are for calligraphy.\n\nNah.\n\n>They are so eXPenSivE\n\nNope. See list below for cheap pen recommendations. I STAN cheap fountain pens\n\n# Recommendations:\n\n* [Jinhao Shark](https://www.gouletpens.com/pages/search-results?q=jinhao%20shark) ($4). At an unbeatable price and a variety of color to choose from... you can't go wrong with this pen. They only have one nib size, and it's great for everyday purposes like taking notes/scribbling/sketching. Smooth right out of the box, great for beginners. What do you have to lose other than $4? TRY IT. *\\*does not come with ink, need to buy your own ink!*\n* [Jinhao 51A](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/jinhao-51a-wood-fountain-pen) ($5+). Yes I love jinhao, why did you ask? This pen has one of the smoothest nibs I've tried, and I'm not kidding cuz I major in fountainpenology. Classic, lowkey design with wooden pen body - this one does not disappoint. The one I link is $8 ish, but you can find cheaper ones on aliexpress. *\\*does not come with ink, need to buy your own ink!*\n* [Jinhao x750](https://www.gouletpens.com/pages/search-results?q=jinhao%20x750) ($10). Timeless design and a popular choice for beginners. Smooth ink flow and affordable cost! This one does have a bit more weight than light pens like Jinhao Shark. If you like heavier pens, this is the way to go. *\\*does not come with ink, need to buy your own ink!*\n* [Platinum Preppy](https://www.gouletpens.com/pages/search-results?q=platinum%20preppy) ($5). Another classic. For size, go with extra fine or fine. Finer nibs give you an easier time in terms of preventing feathering/bleeding. This extra fine nib has yet to feather on most of the cheap paper I come across with. Long time company, can't go wrong with it. Note: This one does come with its own lil cartridge of ink, so you don't need to buy your ink until you finish it. It doesn't come with its own refill mechanism, so you'd need to buy your own converter + bottled ink or more cartridges when you're done.\n\nNow, how can I write a post about fountain pens without mentioning -\n\nMY QUEEN MY LOVE MY FAVORITE. [PenBBS 308](https://www.etsy.com/listing/718760120/penbbs-308-acrylic-fountain-pen-54-smog?ga_search_query=smog&ref=shop_items_search_4&crt=1)\n\n...How can a pen be so ***gorgeous***? At $16, you're getting one of the best writing experience of your life. The smog design is *chef's kiss*. And PenBBS is serious about [color and variety](https://www.etsy.com/shop/PENBBSOfficialStore?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=718760120). This pen does lay down a lot of ink, so you'd want some decent paper and/or dry inks (explanations below).\n\n# Paper\n\n* Fountain pen-friendly paper is needed to show off the best of fountain pens. Not only do they allow you to see your beautiful ink better and show off their special properties, they also improve the writing experience and minimize feathering/bleeding/show through.\n* [This website](https://www.jetpens.com/blog/the-best-fountain-pen-paper/pt/730) does a good job showing you examples of bleeding/feathering.\n* If you are starting with cheap paper, try extra fine/fine nibs. Platinum preppy (extra fine) is extremely fine and works well on cheap paper!\n* Typically anything that you put a lil $$ in is going to work, so like non-$0.25 walmart notebooks. I use Five Star notebooks, which is really good with its relatively inexpensive price. However, like a lot of papers out there, \"wet\" inks are going to have problems with it. \"Wet\" inks spread more easily and cause issues like feathering, bleeding, etc on cheap paper. \"Dry\" inks work the opposite and are great on cheap paper! I use R&K Salix (very dry ink), and it's great on Five Star.\n* Cheap paper recommendations gathered through comments and suggestions!\n   * Pen Gear notebooks from Walmart (make sure it says Made in Vietnam, inexpensive, minimal feathering/bleeding)\n   * CVS Caliber paper (make sure it says Made in Vietnam, inexpensive, minimal issues)\n   * Kokuyo Campus paper\n   * If you can print on your own paper: hp premium 32 lb laserjet paper (plain paper)\n   * [Those $0.50 Notebooks from Target](https://www.target.com/p/college-ruled-solid-composition-notebook-black-unison/-/A-17079113#lnk=sametab) (minimal feathering/bleeding, perfect for college students on a budget)\n   * Midori Notebooks\n\n# [Ink](https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/all-ink?offset=24)\n\nNow here's 50% of the fun - you get to choose WHATEVER color you like. Blue? Black? Blue-black? Pink? *Ink that changes color as it dries?? Ink with shimmer????* You got it.\n\nLike I mentioned, fountain pens don't need to be replaced, but you do need to fill up your ink. All the pens I listed, other than Platinum Preppy, comes with their own refill mechanism - it's a lil knob you twist, and it will draw ink from the ink bottle to the pen itself. As long as the ink you're buying from Amazon or wherever is literally called \"fountain pen ink,\" you're good to go. Btw, ONE bottle of ink can last you a really, really long time unless you write 30 pages of notes per day.\n\nBuy ink that **says** **\"fountain pen ink.\"** **DO NOT** use inks called \"india ink\" or \"calligraphy ink.\" It's a fountain pen, then use fountain pen ink \u2728 Wrong ink can clog the pen! Brands I recommend are Diamine, Iroshizuku, and R&K. All are long-time, trusted brands. As I mentioned, R&K Salix is my personal favorite. It's dry, waterproof, and good ol' every day blue ink.\n\n# Disadvantages\n\n* Highlighting\n   * Okay, I get it, yall need your pretty coloring tools to help you process your notes better (I do too). While most fountain pen inks do not fare well under the dreadful neon highlighter, there are ways to get around this. 1) highlight underneath the words 2) if you get multiple pens and inks in the future, different colors correlate to the purpose of highlighted parts 3) there are waterproof inks that can handle highlighters, they're just a little higher maintenance. So far, my experience with R&K Salix (waterproof ink) has been very positive!\n* Cost\n   * Fountain pens don't have to be expensive to work well. However, to have the best experience with them, you would want to have some decent paper. Nonetheless, there ARE cheap papers that work well, I've added several cheap notebook recommendations under the paper section.\n* Lefties\n   * For lefties: there will have to be some adjustments to the rotation of your page and the way you write - underwriters should not have a problem, and for side writers, you can use finer nibs (EF), fast-drying inks (noodler's black), and more absorbent paper, or practice underwriting\n* Maintenance\n   * Regarding maintenance: fountain pens need cleaning every few months, when you've left it out to dry, or whenever you change inks. Cleaning is pretty much just unscrewing the barrel and holding it under running water until it runs clear, then let it dry. Aside from that, just basic care is needed - don't press down hard, don't throw your pen around. it'll work. [Instructions with pictures](https://blog.gouletpens.com/2012/06/fp101-pen-cleaning-and-maintenance/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk. Now off you go on the fountain pen journey. Here are some miscellaneous notes:\n\n* Most of my links are from Goulet Pens because I've made numerous purchases with them, and their customer service is hands down one of the best out there. You get a free lollipop when you buy from them, what's not to love? No, I'm not affiliated ~~(but we can make it come true~~\n* r/fountainpens is the BEST community for all present and future fountain pen users. I'm tryna keep this short, so if you have a question/want more details try their [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/wiki/index)\n* [Advice and paper recs for UK folks](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/lf3ip6/a_fellow_enthusiast_is_penabling_the_next/gmlnne2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n* Alternatively, you can DM me on reddit or discord. I'm snoo btw. Secret code is \"i love fountain pens\"\n\n*\\*Special thanks to* u/skilltaful *for making this post as complete as it is.*\n\nAlso, thank you to every fountain pen enthusiast who suggested good paper/pen/inks! A collective thank-you for making this post better.",

What you're describing sounds pretty normal for me, or at least it happens to **all** of my pens. If you leave them sitting for months at a time then the ink will start to evaporate and dry, especially if there is already air in the barrel (i.e. the pen is not 100% full with ink) which is generally going to be the case. You will usually need to clean your pen every 1-2 months regardless of use.\n\nFountain pens require pretty frequent use. If you've left one sitting for months on end then I'd recommend cleaning it out entirely because if you try to fill it you might mix two different kinds of ink or be dislodging dry bits that can still clog the feed. If you've tried dabbing water on the nib but only seem to get a tiny bit of writing power before it stops again, this may be the problem. To clean, try cycling water through the barrel and feed. If you have a piston then you only need to draw up water and push it out again. You will likely have to do this many times and change water a few times so you can tell when water is coming out clean. Then, leave it open (i.e. keep the lid and casing off if possible) to dry completely for a few days. Then you can refill with whatever ink you like. But don't fill lots of pens if you only expect to use one. \n\nAnd try not to fill a pen with a different brand of ink unless you have cleaned it out. Not all inks play together nicely.",

Specifically, I remember the first essay I wrote with a fountain pen compared to a ballpoint and holy crap it was so much nicer! No hand cramps, faster writing speed, neater handwriting, it was incredible! That was a Pilot Kak\u00fcno with Pilot Black, but since Christmas last year I\u2019ve been dipping my toes into different colours with more fountain pens and it makes writing even cooler! \n\nUsing nice paper can actually feel a lot nicer in some cases too! I use a relatively expensive paper (Midori MD A4 light notebook in grid) for finalised study notes and it feels so open and makes me actually want to use it! Cheap paper for in class notes is easy enough to find and are just as nice to use!\n\nIf you are a student who writes a lot, fountain pens are totally for you! 10/10 post OP!",

HOWEVER, for people who, like me, are ambidextrous and have a hard time with their handwriting, and usually push down hard on the paper, fountain pens are not it. I love using them in meetings and professional settings, but honestly, if you have the same problems as I do, then just get a *really* nice ballpoint pen. You can even get an antique one and just fill the cartage with ink rather than getting the capsules.",
