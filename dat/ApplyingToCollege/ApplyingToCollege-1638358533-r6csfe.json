  "text": "Hi, I just completed my video interview for Commerce at UBC. \n\nHonestly, out of the two questions I had to answer: the first one went bad and the second one was decent. I'm just scared that my first question will weigh me down a lot. \n\nHow much importance do the admission officers give to the video interview and how do y'all think it will affect my chances. Keep in mind my grades are excellent and so are my essays. I just choke when it comes to public speaking.",
