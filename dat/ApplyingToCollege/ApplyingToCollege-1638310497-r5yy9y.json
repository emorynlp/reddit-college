  "text": "Hello.\n\nI recently read a post on this sub where a freshman was asking how they could get into MIT. They listed all the clubs they are in, which contain a lot of science and math clubs. \n\nMy high school has only one math club which is the academic team. So how could I get into a college like MIT despite going to a high school that doesn\u2019t give students a lot of chances for science and math clubs?\n\nAlso, I already know the general stuff: Get good grades, do extra curricular activities, do community service, etc. \n\nAlso, are there any online math and science clubs I could partake in?",

      "text": "The standard stuff really:\n\n1. Take the hardest classes.\n2. Get top grades.\n3. Get top test scores.\n4. Be the type of student teachers will describe as \"superlative\" in recommendations.\n5. Consider trying to compete in various contests; there's a list at the MIT link someone posted below.\n6. If your parents can afford it, consider attending one of those summer pre-college programs.\n7. Consider STEM-related volunteer work. Tutoring comes to mind.\n8. It would be a lot of work, but you could potentially organize a robotics club/team at your school, fund raise to support its costs, then go do competitions.  If you were personally responsible for creating the whole program at your school and raising funds, that seems like a meaningful accomplishment.",
