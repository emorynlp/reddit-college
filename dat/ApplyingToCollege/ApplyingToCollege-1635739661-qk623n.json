  "text": "Extremely worried because I calculated it one more time after submitting my apps (man idk why i did that), and I underestimated a lot of them. Did I screw myself over? My ecs had a large impact, and I tried to be realistic with 12.5 hours a week w/o sports & work, but I'm pretty sure I did more. Worried cause people are saying they spend like 20+ hours on ecs alone.",

      "text": "Don\u2019t worry. A lot of people overestimate the number of hours they spend on ECs because human time perception is weird. Don\u2019t worry about it as long as you tried to be as accurate as possible. I did time tracking junior year which helped relieve stress over whether I overestimated or underestimate how much time i spent on certain activities",
