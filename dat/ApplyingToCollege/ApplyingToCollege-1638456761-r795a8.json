It\u2019s the last sentence in my essay and the previous sentence says what i\u2019ve learned, I just accidentally left that sentence there when I meant to delete it. Am I screwed, is there any way I could fix this?",

      "text": "Bro honestly it doesn't matter as much as you think it might. I misquoted 2 professor's names and a couple of buildings' names in my Dartmouth application last year. Got deferred and waitlisted before the rejection hit. Point is, if I can screw up so bad on an ivy application and go far (trust me my stats weren't no picnic either), your application can handle a half sentence. But that said, it is a BIG error because now if you get rejected, you'll always think about how you could've edited that right ( ik i do). So make sure, this doesn't happen again. All the best!",
