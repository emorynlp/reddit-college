  "text": "So I was rejected from my reach ED (Villanova), not unexpected but still sorta hurt. Then today I was deferred from UVM which REALLY hurt since I really thought that would be a slam dunk. Really woke me up to the fact that none of this will be easy and all bets are off.\n\nNow I feel I have to apply ED II to Denison or American, and I like both but I'm not in love with either. TBH I don't love any other college I have a shot at getting into for that matter. I think I have to do ED II to Denison but ugh I just wish I had a school I \\*really\\* wanted to go to. I have a 90/100 average, 90/300 in my class and a 1250 SAT so I'm going test optional.\n\nI applied to Pitt, Utah, CU Boulder, Wheaton MA and Macalester so far. I dunno if any of those will work out in terms of FA.\n\nMaybe I'll just go to my state school (UNH) and call it quits on this pain. I just really wish I did a little better in high school so I could break into the next level of schools (like a NESCAC) :(\n\nSorry for the rant, just needed to release all this somewhere and looking for some moral support \ud83d\ude14",

      "text": "Hey, sorry man. This exact same thing just happened to my kid. He was rejected ED and then UOregon deferred him. Oregon! Like wth, is everyone racing to be a Duck in Eugene?! \n\nAnyway, we're right there with you. Competition is hard this year, especially in some majors (my kid is doing CS) but there are a lot of good schools still out there. You don't have to settle yet. \n\nGood luck.",
