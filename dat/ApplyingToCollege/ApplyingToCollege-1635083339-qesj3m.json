  "text": "So basically my last year AP chemistry teacher was one of my recommenders, and she liked me quite a lot too. However, and about 2 weeks ago she left school and left to get another job on the other coast. She gave me her personal email to ask her any questions. I emailed her about the November 1st deadlines and that I already submitted my applications, but she's not responding and now I'm panicking!!! What do I do? Is it possible to change recommenders now? Does it look bad if one of my recommenders LOR is just empty? HELP, I'M PANICKING!",

      "text": "Not sure how the system at your school works, but if she was going to leave she should have informed the school in advance, and they should have figured out a solution for you??? I doubt that you can get another LOR in time, but from what I've heard it doesn't make much of an impact. Only the first LOR is required, the second is optional.",

You aren\u2019t going to be at the top of the priority list.\n\nIf your rec arrives a few days past the deadline, it\u2019s not a big deal. Take a deep breath and end the panic. You\u2019re fine.",
