  "title:": "Are there any schools that like introverted nerds?",
  "text": "I hate forced leadership, parties and small talk. I love studying and working on projects alone, and I have very few friends. Yet, all US colleges seem to expect students to be popular extroverts- both by requiring us to do ECs of that kind in high school and by constantly emphasizing that university is not about academics. Is there a college that appreciates introverts who just want to spend their entire time doing academic things?",
