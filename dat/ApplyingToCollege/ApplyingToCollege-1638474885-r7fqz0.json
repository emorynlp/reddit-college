  "text": "How worth it is it to keep demonstrating interest in a college you already applied to? I applied ED to my top school and decisions come out in 9 days, and I was thinking about signing up for some more webinar sessions but I\u2019m not sure how much that will help in terms of expressing my interest. I\u2019ve already done an interview (you sign up for the interviews, they don\u2019t contact you), visited campus virtually and in person, and attended a few other informational sessions. Should I sign up for another sessions or would it be pointless?\n\n(This school does track and consider demonstrated interest btw)",
