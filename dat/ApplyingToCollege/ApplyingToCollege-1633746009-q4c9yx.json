  "title:": "Sophomore \u2014 advice on ECs for T20?",
  "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore and I don\u2019t really have any good extracurriculars at all. I didn\u2019t join any sports in freshman year (COVID), but I was in 2 clubs (did pretty badly in one and mediocre in the other). This year, I joined a different club and continued one of the same clubs from last year (dropped the other because I pretty much hated it). I also plan on joining a sport (that I suck at but I figured I\u2019d just keep going at it because I did it once before). I was going to join 2 sports this year but I missed tryouts for the other one so :/. I also don\u2019t really have my presence in any of the ECs I joined, and I didn\u2019t win any outstanding awards (just certificates of recognition for attending- everyone got one). I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s too early or late, but what should I do about my ECs for college applications? I don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re strong or reflective of me. I also have been thinking of getting a job in the summer, so would that count as an EC? Should I do anything else? I plan on applying to T20 schools (my grades on on the right track for that but I don\u2019t know about my ECs) but would I be outstanding enough? Probably not, right?... so what should I do?",

      "text": "I\u2019m no senior or junior but as a fellow sophomore, I think you\u2019re in a great place! Most people don\u2019t really even start this early and sophomore year has just begun so there\u2019s plenty of time left.\n\nPerhaps something to brainstorm so you can find an EC that is meaningful and reflective of you:\nIs there anything you can do *outside* of school (not school-sponsored) that you would enjoy or just want to try and see what it\u2019s like? This might be volunteering if you are in a position that allows you to pursue unpaid employment, a paid job if you prefer/need, a local club or community, etc. Maybe it\u2019s a hobby that you want to take to life (like maybe starting a digital art Instagram page) or a cause you\u2019re passionate about and want to start a local movement for. Whatever it is, try to find something that\u2019s generally outside of what a school sponsors (in my experience it\u2019s a little limiting and I think it\u2019s less variable if it\u2019s on your time). \n\nHope that helps! We\u2019re working on this together :)",

      "text": "What do you like to do in your free time? Not things like sleeping or eating or idk video games(if you're into that stuff, although I know plenty of kids have started EC's around those), Do you like the outdoors? Do you like to get involved within your community? Do you like things like collecting things, knitting, etc(ok sounds cheesy but I'm trying to provide examples here)\n\nIf you can think of something that you like, and you see a niche within your community, maybe get started there. My best friend loves anime, and he hosts a lot of events surrounding that in the anime club, such as days where they choose an anime and watch it and discuss , and a maid cafe(yes a maid cafe), for example. \n\nJust an idea.",

      "text": "Like the others have said, the important thing is to first find a niche. This can be very tough. Here are some tips for choosing a niche:\n\n- Do NOT choose a niche that is common for high school students. This will only make it less impressive and more competitive.\n- Choose a niche that people know about, but again, isn\u2019t common for high school students \n- Don\u2019t listen to other people and \u201cfollow your passion.\u201d You (probably) do not have a true passion, and you\u2019ll waste time being a perfectionist. Don\u2019t spend a lot of time on choosing your niche, just get started. My initial niche was data analysis, but I\u2019m now also involved with nonprofit marketing.\n\nAfter you find a niche, you need to get involved, usually in boring work. People who do research at HYPSM (w/o connections) were probably cold emailing hundreds of professors, before they started doing tedious tasks in a lab. Do the boring work. Gain skills. Gain trust. Gain connections.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve worked on the boring stuff for a while, you can transition into bigger projects. I\u2019m personally still in the middle of this transition phase, so I can\u2019t speak for anything beyond that.\n\nHope this helps!",
