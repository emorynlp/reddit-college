  "text": "Hi guys! During my senior year (2019) I did apply for Fall 2020 to a few colleges, some I got in and some I withdrawn before decisions even come out, but since then I\u2019ve taken (two) gap year(s) and only have decided this year to reapply for Fall 2022. I\u2019m an international needing aid and I\u2019m considering reapplying to safeties that I once got in, since they offered me very generous aid last time. My question is, would AOs think negatively of me for already rejecting them once and therefore would rather not taking a chance on me ever again (if I\u2019m even qualified)? What about safeties that I once applied but withdrawn before decision was available? Do I still have a shot at them? \n\nAny insights would be very much appreciated. I\u2019m worrying sick about not getting in my REA and end up not having anywhere else to go altogether \ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "Lots of admissions people swap out every few years. They will probably have your files from years ago, though. I can't say if it will help or harm your application. You should still be allowed to apply -- good luck, and I'm cheering for you, especially as a fellow gap year international!",
