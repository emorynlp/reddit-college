  "text": "I've been mentally preparing myself for college decisions season and as much as I'm afraid of the term 'gap year', having seen my brother stay at home for 2 years after H.S, I am not gonna run away from it. I've been thinking about the pros that will outweigh the disappointment of those around me. Incase I do get rejected from most schools (which has major chances to occur), I've told myself that I'll not fight with anyone or blame anyone but I've started preparing for all the plans for a gap year if I'm told to take one. I've been trying to learn cinematography for a long time and a gap year would allow me to do that, I'll invest in camera equipment and make short films (yay, video essays). My friends and I play music but we never have tried to produce some of our own. Doing that would be pretty cool. I've been also working with Meta (formerly facebook) for the past few weeks & my recent idea pitch could be a startup of its own with the right mentors. My non-profit will also see major revamp and so will my social impact work. And, I would finally be able to give the SAT again (and take probably a few APs too). And if I get into a uni, here in India like Ashoka, I might take their offer and then transfer if possible. What do you guys think?",

      "text": "Fellow Indian here. I'm also overwhelmingly likely to be rejected by a majority of my schools, and the chances that I can actually get the financial aid to attend are miniscule, to say the least. It's pretty much guaranteed that I'll go to college here, which worries me because I'm not confident I'll get good enough board scores. I guess I'll try for entrance exams, but it's possible I'll fail to get a good score in one of those either. Ashoka-like unis are my last line of safety if none of the other options work out, so I REALLY hope they'll accept me lol. I haven't considered transferring or a gap year yet. My parents have no idea the former is a thing and have advised me not to do the latter.",

          "text": "I can relate very well, my parents would support any educational decisions but at some point I'd start feeling guilty which I don't want. Everyone has very high expectations, I might give IPMAT and BITSAT or MET but I'm not sure. Seeing everyone get into college is so stressful. I hope atleast Ashoka accepts me too so I can go and transfer. I won't give the JEE, which has already pissed my parents off. It's such a toxic cycle of fighting over it.",
