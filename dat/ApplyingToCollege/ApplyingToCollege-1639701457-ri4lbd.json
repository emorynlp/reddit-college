  "text": "So, I was checking the portal to see whether or not my admissions decision was posted or not(it was, for Brown) but I didn't open it as I wanted to wait a few more hours to see if I got in. My question is, can you tell on the applicant portal  BEFORE your decision whether or not you got in? Will this \"portal\" have any new information about your decision UNTIL you actually open the decision?",
