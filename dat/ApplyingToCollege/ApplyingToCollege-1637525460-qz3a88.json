      "text": "Admissions will look at your GPA, test scores, extracurriculars, income level & your story (which they get from your personal essay). \nWhy\u2019s it special? \n 1) no student pays tuition\n 2) really good education \n 3) Berea fully funds 2 unpaid internships, so none of us have to worry about our living arrangement or going into more debt so that we can get more experience \n 4) they give us VERY generous study abroad scholarships \n 5) many students don\u2019t even have to pay for room & board \n 6) lots of opportunities at the school through the labor program where you can become a student manager/other type of leader - all while earning money (albeit not very much) \n 7) every student receives a free computer, which becomes yours after graduation \n 8) they have tons of funding opportunities like the following: professional clothing (currently a one time opportunity of $350 for juniors & seniors to get a professional suit), grad school app funding, funding for grad school test study materials, funding to travel to grad schools so you can visit them, interview travel funding, networking funding, etc. \n 9) they also fund some weekend trips such as horseback riding, going to a roller rink, white water rafting, & even a ski resort trip (though not sure if they will this year bc of covid). \n 10) it\u2019s a very small school - which is good or bad, depending on your preference, but I love it being small \n 11) the professors really, really care & want to make sure you know the material. \n\nOverall, highly recommend, I love the school. They do have some strict rules, but those may be amended soon.",
