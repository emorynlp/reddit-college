  "text": "i only have like 4 privates- all RD (usc, cornell, nyu, emory) that \u201crequire\u201d css profile (for institutional aid) but idk if i should make one bc i dont qualify for a fee waiver so thatd be $73 ($25+16+16+16). and i dont think id get into cornell or nyu so idk if its worth it to even make a css profile. and usc is so expensive already so idk if id even go there (i dont think id get the institutional aid/merit scholarships tbh) so is it worth making a css account? what if i just made one for 1 or 2 schools? should i just use it for all 4? thoughts/advice/opinions??",
