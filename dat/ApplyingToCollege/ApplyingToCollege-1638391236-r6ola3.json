  "title:": "Among Us College Essay",
  "text": "Hey everyone! I was thinking about writing my college essays about among us. I played a lot of among us lately and it has been pretty much the only thing I have cared about for the last 12 months. My grades and  test scores are slipping and I have been kicked out of every club I was in. I have however started the among us club for sussy bakas like me. My among us KD is currently 316:1 and it is expected to rise to 413:1 before the year is over. Do you think that basing my college application on among us will be beneficial to me? Among us is something I have dedicated my life to and I know that AOs like to see dedication. \n\nThis is an important question as my UC applications are due today and I haven\u2019t started them yet. Please get back to me as soon as possible about my among us themed application. \n\n\ud83d\udcee",
