  "text": "So I\u2019ve already started applying but I don\u2019t know if some of these I should take some colleges off my list or add any so </3\n\nI am applying as a Human Biology / Human Physiology major for the most part. Also interested in Neuroscience so usually put that or Psychology as a second choice major lol\n\nAlready Accepted:\n\u2022 Safety in my town - accepted with full tuition\n\u2022 Safety in state - accepted with 2/3 tuition\n\u2022 Washington State University - accepted with $44k scholarship (in process of applying to honors college)\n\nRest of College List:\n\u2022 University of Oregon with honors college - awaiting decision\n\u2022 University of Utah with honors college - awaiting decision\n\n\u2022 Reed College\n\u2022 Pitzer College\n\u2022 Brown\n\u2022 Stanford\n\u2022 USC\n\u2022 Georgetown\n\u2022 University of Washington\n\u2022 UCLA\n\u2022 UCI\n\u2022 UCSB\n\u2022 UCSD\n\u2022 San Diego State\n\nI also need good financial aid but I don\u2019t know if I even like the idea of going to a top school ?? I also get application fee waivers for nearly all colleges so there is no issue with that so that\u2019s why I might apply to UCs just because I get a waiver for up to 4 colleges but also don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth it to apply bc of tuition price </3",
