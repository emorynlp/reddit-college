      "text": "idk it's easier if u like reading and writing in the first place. I like both and never loved writing them but I did enjoy the process over all. Just think if someone wrote a book about you or you wrote one about yourself how best could you make it interesting and truly something you would want people to read. It's probably too late for this advice but before I started writing i followed collegeadmissionmoms advice and just wrote more period. I already enjoyed writing but I practiced writing for random prompts so i would be prepared for writing college essay prompts i didn't completely know how to write for",
