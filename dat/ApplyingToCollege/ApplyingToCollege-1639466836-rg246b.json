  "title:": "BC Calc vs AB Calc",
  "text": "Right now, I'm taking BC Calc and as the first semester is about to end, I've got a 77 in the class. I am thinking about dropping the class for AB Calc instead, but I am getting differing opinions on it. Since the first semester of BC is all of AB, if I do drop BC, I will probably get an A in AB. But on the other hand, if I try hard enough and put enough effort into it, I can pass BC Calc, but the chance of me getting even above an 80 is a massive long shot. So I'm not sure what to do. On one hand, switching to AB will definitely boost my GPA but on the other hand, continuing BC Calc and passing will make it look like I'm challenging myself for my college aps. I've heard differering opinions from counselors and teachers so I wanted to ask you guys.\n\nQuick note, I'm a junior and planning to major in something stem related, leaning towards computer engineering right now. And the schools I'm applying to are all pretty competitive. So which would look better for college aps, lower GPA but challenging myself with BC or higher GPA but doing AB.",

      "text": "Are you a junior or senior? If you're a junior drop it for AB and if your a senior then I don't have any strong opinion about it either way, but I would still drop it. A C can tank your GPA, which is an admissions statistic counselors care about. If you don't have the GPA for the school, they likely won't read into the specifics of why. There are other applicants that didn't have that issue. Depending on your major and where you go to college, BC calc may be a waste of time. The credit may not even contribute towards your major unless you're doing some type of math or physical science.",
