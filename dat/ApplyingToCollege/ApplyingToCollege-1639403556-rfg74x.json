  "text": "This is a 2nd part of the 4 part series, \"Practicing for College Apps\". If you are interested in the first draft, go search it up. I'm too lazy to past the link here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"THE TITANS ARE COMING! EREN, THE TITANS ARE COMING!\", says the puny Armin.\n\n\"Shut da hell up you blonde loser, I am the protanganist!\", declared Eren.\n\nFrom that day, humanity received a grim reminder, that Eren Yeager was the one transmitting memories to the supposed curator of the AOT series, Isayama.\n\nEren is a mass murderer, orphan, psycopath, maniac, and someone who deeply resembles the nation (and the world's highschoolers). This is no doubt the reason AOT is one of the most popular manga and anime series in the world. Eren Yeager, a sworn believer of the ocean, deeply reveals humanity's pursuit of freedom.\n\nDuring my lonely days sitting in front of a wooden desk at my Pre-Calculus class, I always dreamt of seeing the ocean. The vast serenity Mother Nature provides far exceeds the supposedly beautiful quadratic expression my Math teacher, Dr. Logan, who received his PhD from the University of Texas, Austin, can ever explain to us. The joy birthed from enjoying the warmth of the sun and the freshness of the sea is unparalled to any joy receiving college admissions can provide. Why aim for a momentarily days of excitement followed by years of dread, when all the happiness you need came be found from dropping out of highschool and living on the beach?\n\nEren Yeager's famous words, \"If we kill all of our enemies on the other side of the sea will we be free?\" rang deeply to my inner conscious. Undoubtedly, I argue the prospect of murder has always been on our hearts when we are forced into a cubicle to yet again learn about the complexities of sexual education. \n\n\"Shut up old man, we all know women body better than you ever will\", shouted a rebellious Tommy, 13 years of age.\n\n\"Thomas, indeed you shall know the women body better than me, but it is with a hundred percent confidence I deeply understand a single woman's body - that woman being your mom.\", Dr. Keagen says calmy.\n\nThe whole class explodes into a ruckus, yelling at one another upon hearing this unreversible violence unleashed onto Thomas Dean. \n\nThe prospect of muder was forever implemented on Thomas, as he sees the teacher as an enemy of his state, a state of embarrasement.\n\nAs the day comes to an end, and Thomas returns back to his crib, his mind yet again latched onto his favorite anime, Attack on Titan.\n\nFrom Armin to Eren and possibly but definetly not Jean, Thomas sworn to be a character nobody ever dared to become. \n\nReiner.\n\nThomas, the once pure and excited boy has now turned into an old person contemplating the meaning of life, while seeking an end to the existence he's had to suffer through so far.\n\nThe character and personality of Reiner controlled the entirety of Thomas, and he finally arrived at his house.\n\n\"Mom, I'm home!\"\n\n\"Hey son! Welcome! I heard college apps are starting soon and you need a boost on your GPA. Luckily I had Dr. Keagen home this afternoon to get some things done. I can now guarantee you will get into Cornell, the worst university of all the Ivies\", said Mom.\n\n*\"I\u2019ll slaughter you all\u2026and take back what you stole\u2026 All of it!\u201d*",
