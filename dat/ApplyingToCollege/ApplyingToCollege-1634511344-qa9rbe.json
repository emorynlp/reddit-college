Selecting Black/African-American, does not trigger more boxes to appear. \n\nIs OP\u2019s friend African American? We couldn\u2019t tell. African American culture is its own thing. It\u2019s not just being Black in America. My dad is a Black Dominican. He became a US citizen at 14. He is not regarded as African American by other Black people. All my dad\u2019s culture is Afro-Caribbean. He may have grown up as a Black man in America, but he doesn\u2019t know shit about African American culture or their long term and ongoing struggles. \n\nWe don\u2019t have enough information about OP\u2019s friend to discern whether they are African American. \n\nIs OP\u2019s friend African? Yes. Black? According to OP, the implication is the friend can\u2019t even pass as Black, so no.",
