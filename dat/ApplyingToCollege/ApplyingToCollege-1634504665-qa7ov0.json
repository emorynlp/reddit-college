  "text": "I know MIT has stated that they don't need my official SAT score report (so I am self reporting), but they did not say anything about AP score report/I cannot find anything. Does anyone know?  \n\n\nMost colleges that I have seen say they need the report for credit if I enroll, but I am unsure if I need to send it for MIT when I apply.",
