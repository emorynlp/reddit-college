  "text": "I won't get into the details of it, but due to medical/mental health reasons, I was forced to withdraw from my old college in the beginning of November as a freshman. Since I never finished the semester, I have no credits, so I'm planning to reapply to some other schools this application cycle as a first year student. The question is, should I disclose that in the additional information section? Would the admissions officers even know that I attended college before, if I don't tell them? I never finished any classes at my old college, do I'd believe it wouldn't make sense to send over a transcript. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",
