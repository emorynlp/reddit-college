  "text": "Hi,\n\nI\u2019ve heard rumors that HOSA is a negative aspect of your application because it is mostly for those who do not aim highly in medicine. i am planning to major in Bio as a hopeful pre-med. I have a captain position and would like to include it (although at position 8/10) in my activity section. Will this negatively affect my application?",
