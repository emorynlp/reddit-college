I went to my supplemental essays to copy it for another school and realized i said i was affected by the great DEPRESSION  instead of the recession in an essay about why i want to study economics. I have no idea how i am this stupid. December 15th is going to be the end of me",

But, if you really want to correct this, you might be able to correct it by calling the college and explaining your situation. However, that's up to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish you the best with your college journey.\n\nRegards,\n\nRandom Reddit User",
