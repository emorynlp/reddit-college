  "text": "i want to do ed2 to have the extra 2 months to work on my app (i'll have something decent by nov 1, but i think itll be a lot better by jan lol). HOWEVER, i read that ed2 typically has the largest number of applicants who have been like deferred or rejected from their idk t5 college ... so it's a much stronger pool. my essays will be stronger by december, but my \"accomplishments\" wont be lol. would i be making a huge mistake by doing ed2 instead of ed1?",

      "text": "ed1 is better but ed2 is better than rd. I would do ed2. My rationale is that for crazy competitive schools, the difference in the applicant pool is relatively marginal, you have to remember that anyone getting into uchicago ed1 could have also gotten into a t5 college. The difference between having a mediocre essay and a phenomenal essay, however, is not marginal.",
