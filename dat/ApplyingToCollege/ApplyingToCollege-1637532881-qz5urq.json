  "text": "I have not been in contact with my bio father since childhood, I don\u2019t know where he lives or anything at all about what\u2019s happened with him since I was a kid. He was super abusive, was incarcerated at least four times in my youth for domestic violence, grand theft, DUI, and drug possession charges. One of those\u2014the DV\u2014was him breaking his girlfriend\u2019s arm and I was in the room next door when it happened. That should be in some records somewhere. My mom also had a restraining order against him prohibiting anything other than basic communication regarding my well-being because he abused her and that\u2019s why she left him. He hit me a lot and that was reported to CPS\u2026 point is, there is a paper trail somewhere, but I don\u2019t know where. Are those arrest records and police reports public? Can I access them? \n\nAlso, who would be able to attest to this? A therapist? Who would be able to write the letter I need for the CSS profile waiver so I wouldn\u2019t need his financials?",

      "text": "Therapist and school counselor would be the top choices, I had my school counselor write mine. I also believe the statement can be waived in replacement with the restraining order and police records, though those could be more annoying to retrieve. I hope it\u2019s not too much of a hassle to get everything you need. Good luck on all your admissions!",
