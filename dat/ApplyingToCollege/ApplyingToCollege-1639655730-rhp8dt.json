Your end result in life can still be the same. One school isn\u2019t going to be the sole determinant of your future. Keep searching and looking and you will find a school that fits you and that you want. This is a roadblock in your dream, not the end.",

That is, don't make your dreams about getting into one specific school.\n\nWhat you do now:  go somewhere else, study, have fun, get a degree, go do great things.\n\nWhat you should not do:  mope around for a year before re-applying, which will almost certainly result in another rejection.\n\nIf you really, really want to go there, then your best bet may be to enroll somewhere else, get straight A's for a year, then apply as a transfer student.  But, also very low probability.",

      "text": "Focusing on one school as your \"dreams completion\" is an enormous mistake...and I would not encourage students to do so or continue to dwell on the school. Most often there is no succinct and identifiable \"reason\" why this person was denied and another accepted...none. My answer (which was not really an answer) used to be that Student 2 had a \"more compelling application\"...which could quite literally be any reason...ANY minute reason at that particular time, place, and people. Dreams require flexibility, resilience, and perspective of a larger dimension than one campus (or 12!).",

      "text": "I know of several students \u2014 friends of my kids\u2014 who got into their then-\u201cdream\u201d schools (Tufts, Brown, Northeastern) but whose parents ended up strongly encouraging them to instead attend one of our very good state public universities.  (Basically, the parents thought it made no sense to pay $70-75,000 a year when they could pay $32,000-$40,000 a year, especially when grad school seemed to be in the cards.) Long story short, while the students were initially extremely bummed and/or flat-out angry, all three would now tell you that they completely adored the school they attended and have zero regrets.  All did well academically, spent time abroad, were deeply involved in clubs and activities, and now have lucrative job offers or solid grad school admissions.  Please recognize that the idea of a dream school is in some ways unhealthy, akin to the idea of \u201cmy one true love.\u201d  Just as one is capable of loving many individuals in one\u2019s lifetime, one is capable of having an amazing college experience at hundreds of colleges in the U.S. alone. Best of luck.",
