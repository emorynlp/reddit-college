  "text": "From what I understand, the pros of early action are to receive a decision earlier than RD, to show colleges that you are ready to apply, and for a little bit of an increase in acceptance rate. I was initially planning on applying EA to two schools, but now feel that I need a bit more time for my essay and apps in general, so i\u2019m considering applying RD. Are the benefits of early action worth applying EA? Does EA even really matter that much? Are there any ways I can show a school I really want to go even with applying RD?\n\nEDIT: My schools were Northeastern and Fordham",
