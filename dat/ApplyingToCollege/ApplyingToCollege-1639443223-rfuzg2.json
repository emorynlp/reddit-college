  "text": "currently having mega mixed feelings about my ed school because im not entirely sure if I  want to go and I honestly don't think they'll give me good aid. and I really love some of the schools I applied to for rd (mostly safeties) and I should be able to get some merit aid. and if - for some insane reason - im able to get into my ed school, I won't be able to find out if I can get into my rd schools and that kinda makes me sad.\n\nbut, i mean, im expecting a rejection so it doesn't really matter!!!!",

      "text": "This is why I dislike ED.\n\n* Can't compare financial aid offers.\n* Nukes incentive for the ED school to entice you with non-need-based aid (if it offers any).\n* Can't wait to see if you win a big, competitive merit award somewhere else.\n\nYou have to like the school so much that it's your top choice even IF you were to win a full ride to someplace with slightly weaker brand.  Say a USC, Vanderbilt, Emory or WUSTL.",
