  "text": "This is a valuable tip a teacher and admissions administrator told me: \n\n\u201cIf I have 30 applications for 1 spot, I will first start by selecting which ones I don\u2019t want. Even a tiny grammar or spelling mistake can get you cut in this first round. If you can\u2019t check your work for this application, how can I trust you will in the future? After the immediate rejections then I start selecting on the quality\u201d \n\nTldr; first step of selection is who you want to reject. \n\nCheck your work!!! The first step to getting accepted is not being rejected!",

You can also just not look at it for a week. \n\nBut the gist is typos and mistakes like this are preventable, and so they should be prevented.",

So when you say \"I will have no typos in my work\" there might be one you didn't get. But when you say \"It is fine to make a few typos\" you are not putting in the effort. Aim to make no typos, ask people to review your work, ask for help. It is possible and should definitely be done for a college app. (Same for jobs btw)",
