  "text": "So just for reference I have a SAT score of 1490 and a GPA around 90\n\nI applied to a few schools so far. I applied to Cornell and got rejected, which I kind of expected given how hard it is to get into that school. Most of the other schools haven\u2019t responded yet\n\nHowever, I applied to Fordham and got deferred. I thought I had a 100% chance at Fordham since it has such a high acceptance rate (more people get in than get rejected) but apparently not. What should I do? Should I start applying to community colleges at this point?",

      "text": "Is this a serious question? \n\nFirst off, Fordham has a 46% acceptance rate. They don\u2019t accept more people than they reject and it\u2019s not a safety for pretty much anyone. Besides that, a safety isn\u2019t just a school that accepts more people than they reject. Even if that\u2019s what it was, why would that mean you have a 100% chance? There is absolutely 0 logic in that.\n\nIt seems your issue here is you have no idea what an actual safety is. You do not need to give up and go to fucking community college because you got deferred at one school lmao. Find some actual safeties that you like, and this time look for schools with like a 65-70%+ acceptance rate. The vast vast majority of schools still have RD deadlines coming up in January and February so you have more than enough time to find a real safety that you are interested in. Your base stats (without knowing the rest of your application or aid needs) are good enough to have a chance at any non T30.",
