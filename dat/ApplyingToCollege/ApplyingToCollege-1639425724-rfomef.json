  "text": "Seniors of A2C, last year I was in your shoes. It was the last week of the semester, and I received my ED rejection and I was crushed. A year later, I'm finishing up the semester at a University I never imagined I would end up. It's hard to look on the bright side when you've worked so hard. But, I promise everything **WILL** be okay. I'm ending my semester with a 4.0, something that probably wouldn't have happened at my dream school because I wouldn't have had the resources I needed to succeed. Right after my ED rejection, I received a full tuition scholarship to my in-state and a week before national decision day I was accepted to the program I am currently attending.\n\nIn conclusion: Stay strong. Even when things don't look like they will work out, in the end they will. Regardless of your ED decision (or if you didn't apply ED, any other decision you're waiting on), please take some time over your winter break to practice self-care. Remember that you've been working for the past 13+ years to reach the point you're at. A single university decision doesn't define you.",

It's been a rough past few days and I'm still struggling, but I'm starting to accept the way things are and I'm trying to feel more excited about my safety school. I hope I'm happy wherever I end up, your post made me feel a lot better <3",
