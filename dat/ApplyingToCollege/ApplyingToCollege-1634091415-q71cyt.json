  "text": "Hello,\n\nI'm curious to know what schools I should look at for a Bachelors of Landscape Architecture program...(please!)...\n\nunweighted GPA: 3.58\n\nSAT: 1260, but I only got the chance to take it once. I probably won't submit this to most schools...\n\nacademic strengths: social sciences, music, environmental sciences, etc.\n\nacademic weaknesses: mathematics (I'm not bad at it, I'm just not great...currently taking pre-calculus as a senior). I've also only taken one semester of studio art....\n\nactivities RELATED to Landscape Architecture: I'm a GIS mapping technician for my town. I've held this job for a few months. Also an Eagle Scout.\n\nWhat schools should I look at? I feel that the lack of design experience will hurt me, but maybe schools that don't require a portfolio...\n\nThank you.",
