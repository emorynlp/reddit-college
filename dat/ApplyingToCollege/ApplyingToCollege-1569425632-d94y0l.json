Coaches express interest in many times more students than they intend to enroll because of cases like this girl - if Harvard saves a spot for her and she ends up at Stanford, Harvard's coach has to find a backup.  But no one wants to be told they're the backup.  So coaches commonly pursue many more people than they are able to enroll.  There's really good data on this available for D1 football.  Most colleges will offer scholarships to 200-400 students, but only enroll ~25. The other 175-375 are told that their offer is no longer committable and they should look elsewhere.  \n\nThe difference in the scandal is that the coach was in on it, so they made sure the ~~perpetrator~~ student in question was on the list.  Unless you're very high on a coach's board you can't be guaranteed a spot.  And you never really know where you stand on their board.",

As someone who was recruited heavily by \u201ccompetitive\u201d schools, in regard to their academics, for a sport (and ultimately had to quit because I injured my knee severely), I know just how much time you have to dedicate to both sports and academics. There\u2019s a reason why the kid in your class is being recruited by Harvard and Stanford instead of Central Kansas or Mays State - she probably has high test scores and a damn good gpa. I went on a recruiting trip to a top 30 school and their head coach made it extremely clear that if our SAT was not above a 1400 we would not be recruited to play there - and I know on this sub that\u2019s low compared to all the people who post their stats, but nationally it\u2019s above the 90th percentile.\n\nI know that it\u2019s hard to argue this subject because some people just don\u2019t want to say that athletes deserve \u201cspots\u201d at a university over general students, but there\u2019s some merit to acknowledge just how much athletes do for schools and sacrifice while doing it. They make the athletics departments ungodly amounts of money from merchandise, playing and winning away games, and progressing to national tournaments. These athletes ARE NOT all on full scholarship, some have student loans they will have to pay back after college, and they will not see a dime of the money they made for their school. They also sacrifice their grades because they travel so much, sometimes missing three weeks at a time. \n\nWe work just as hard as a band kid or choir kid, and we dedicate lots of time, money, and pain to our sports. Just because our awards are \u201cNational Club Soccer Champion\u201d instead of \u201cScience Olympiad Gold\u201d does not make them any less impressive - we all have things we\u2019re good at, ours just happens to not be academic.\n\ntldr; there\u2019s a reason an athlete is recruited by Harvard instead of Local State U. Athletes can be smart too. There are high gpa/sat requirements to play for top tier unis. Everyone has different thing they\u2019re good at, ours just happen to be sports.",

Being recruitable for these sports generally starts back when youre 5 or 6 years old and takes a decade of hard work. \n\nGtfo with meaningful research as a HS kid... you shitting me? \n\nAs for athletes PLENTY engage in real research at the collegiate level and go on to take your place at the top med schools, law schools, and Phd programs. I personally know 5 athletes taking precious space in the ~80 person per year class over at Stanford Med\n\nand the rest of the top 20 loves to inflate grades as well",

However, I still kind of question this kind of stuff sometimes. I live in a sports-heavy town, and expressing that sentiment around here gets you stink eyes and told off by some girl who plays field hockey, or something. I understand that athletics can be a lot of work (trust me, I\u2019ve spent enough time in random hotels for my brother\u2019s hockey to know), but sometimes I wonder how the hell it makes any sense that the kids that are just \u201ceh\u201d academically in hs end up at these insanely competitive schools. \n\nI know that sometimes athletes are kind of \u201csmuggled\u201d through their undergrad with BS classes, but for goodness sakes, does playing soccer really give you the ability to keep up with a Harvard workload, WHILE committing fully to your sport? People who are \u201cacademic kids\u201d are overwhelmed by the difficulty of these places all the time, how is it that students that are \u201cjust ok\u201d are getting through their degrees?

But the recruit admission process works very differently compared to general admission process. They first require that the students be great athletically. For example, Stanford golf requires students to have at least 1400 SAT with top national golf ranking status. And..... if the coach likes what he sees, you are in. I always tell students not to compare themselves to \u201cspecial\u201d admission. Believe me.. there are MANY other ways you can get into colleges (\u201crecommendation,\u201d invitation, legacy, so-called non-existent donation, etc.) - yes, I have seen many of these actually happen first hand. Don\u2019t worry about others and focus on what it is that you have to do to get things done for yourself. GL!",
