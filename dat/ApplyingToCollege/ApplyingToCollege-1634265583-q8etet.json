  "title:": "Classism in Admissions",
  "text": "I was just thinking about how significant the disadvantage is for poor, or even middle to upper middle class, students during the admissions process. \n\nFor example, when you think about it, everyone is initially like, \u201cwell yeah, I mean they have to work part time jobs and don\u2019t have as much time to study\u201d.\n\nBut it goes so much deeper than that.\n\nWhile reading what earns a student a \u201c1\u201d in the academic section of an Ivy league admissions process, I was shocked at the content listed. I genuinely wondered how it didn\u2019t bring more attention to classism and abolishing the large advantages of being wealthy in the admissions process. \n\nFor example, there are checkpoints like \u201cISEF Finalist\u201d, \u201cPatent-pending\u201d, and \u201cOlympic medalist\u201d. Huh?? First of all, you would need very lenient (or academically pushing) parents in order to be able to develop a meaningful science project. Even a $500 into the research project is a cost most families can\u2019t just give up for a project. Second, it costs an insane amount of money to file a patent. Like thousands of dollars (I looked it up to see if it was a legit thing or just a common app booster). Should i even elaborate on the Olympic medalist? Participating in regular high school sports alone costs an upwards of $1000 a year, let alone all of the time and money that mosttttt families would not dare disposing of. \n\nOverall, there are the anomaly stories of \u201cwell my friend worked with a professor to get a patent\u201d. Not only is this very rare, but it still supports the argument that those without rich parents have to jump through many more hoops just to get to the same application as a rich student. \n\nThere are more examples that I could go on about, but my point is still there. It\u2019s honestly really sad to see so many students who are just as capable as rich students get screwed over by this elitist of an admissions process. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I still believe that the admissions process has its benefits and everything, I was just thinking about my frustration with not being able to do as much as I wanted in high school because my parents don\u2019t have disposable money like wealthy parents do. \n\nLet me know your thoughts! I\u2019d love to hear contrasting or supporting opinions :)",

He started a business earning six figures in high school. He\u2019s at Harvard now. And he wasn\u2019t even particularly interested in the admissions process or applying to top schools until senior fall.\n\nBut anecdote aside, I think the most important thing in the process is knowing how to seek out inside information and resources.",

      "text": "The problem with your argument is that, while wealth is certainly correlated with things that help admissions (sat scores, EC\u2019s, top public/private schools, high gpa, etc), wealth is neither necessary nor sufficient to \u201ccause\u201d admission.\n\nGiven the exceedingly low acceptance rates at HYPSM-type schools, it\u2019s obvious that most wealthy people get rejected from top schools. And given the percentage of people getting financial aid at top schools (60% or so at Princeton, for example) and the size of those aid packages (\\~$60k/yr average at Princeton) it\u2019s obvious that many non-wealthy people are being admitted.",

The fee to file a patent is like 1000 dollars (forgot exact amount), and I bought a book that essentially walked me through the entire process (prior art search, making quality figures, etc). It does not require huge amounts of parental donations unless you hire a lawyer, which IMO u don't need to do.",
