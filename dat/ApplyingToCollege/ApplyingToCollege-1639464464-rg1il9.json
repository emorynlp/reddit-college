BUT NOW???? not only are all my eas coming out this week but its also FINALS WEEK. it's really scary knowing that my entire future as I know it is riding on the back of these college admissions officers. it's gotten especially scary since I was rejected by my first choice school, now I'm second-guessing all my apps. anyways... good luck ed kids LOL",

      "text": "Not to be like morbid or anything but I have my college suspension hearing during my finals week and had a really traumatic thing happen during midterms week and the only advice I can give here is don't internalize it. You could also wait until after you've taken all your exams to open it, or kind of plan out how you think you're going to feel. Where you go to college also isn't your entire future. Like there is so much the world has to offer and where you end up just has to do with that first job. Doing good in college not just academically but also as a person is so much more important. Finals and decisions are separate things that do not impact each other unless you let it.",
