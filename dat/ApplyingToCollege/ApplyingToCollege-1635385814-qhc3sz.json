  "text": "I'm a Sophomore in Highschool and wondering for rec for what colleges I should put on my list. I would like to say I have a decent set of ecs already. Harvard CS50, Univeristy of Queensland: Intro to Social Psych, Diploma in applied modern Psychology, Dermatology and Pathology Shadowing, animal shelter Volunteer. I want to study as a Pre-med or maybe Pre-vet, what colleges would be ideal for premed. I live in the midwest, so California schools are not honestly preferred you know, but I just want a bunch of schools that I could look into. Case western, Vanderbilt, Purdue, and Boston U is on the list so far.",
