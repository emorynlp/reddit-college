  "title:": "Advantage of going to an Ivy/UK uni vs Local Uni (Australian)",
  "text": "Hi all, I am a student at the top 5 high schools in Australia. I wanted some advice on the benefits of going to a uni in the US vs one in Australia.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinancials: Melbourne Uni will be around 60-70k while cornell might be around $200k based on financial aid calculators. Oxford will be around 150k\n\nMy Major/Course: Commerce, Business or related field\n\nMy options: I am almost guaranteed entry into any Australian Uni for bachelor of commerce. The best one based on rankings in Uni Melbourne. Cornell would be a target to reach school for me. I would also probably be able to get into Oxford/Cambridge albeit at one of the middle to lower ranked colleges\n\nMy anticipated career: I want to go into management Consulting\n\nMy considerations: I am not really worried about college life, etc. I also don't mind which country I live in. I do care about post-uni job oppurtunities. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy main worry would be whether it is worth spending almost 100-150k extra to go to the US/UK over melbourne uni or uni syd. Any advice or comparisons would be very appreciated.\n\nEdit: to all those replying that I should be wary that Cornell isn't a target for international applicants. I completely agree. What I was trying to say was that as an Australian applicant at a decent school, stats aren't too difficult. However, as Australia is very academic focused (and not well-rounded as us unis admit by) I need to put in alot of time and effort to even stand a chance for admissions. Assuming that after all that effort I do make it through, I would need to pay quite alot extra. So before I go about putting in the effort so I have a shot to apply, I want to see whether it would be worth going to a uni similar to Cornell anyways\n\nAlso with Oxford/Cambridge, my basis for those comments was the atar requirement. Based on median stars from my school I easily fall within range for the application. In addition to some existing degree of extracurriculars mean that although I may not get into the better half of colleges in the UK, I stand a very strong chance at the bottom few.",

      "text": "I love your confidence but please do not think your \"probably\" going to get into Oxbridge or think of Cornell as a target. Especially going into business. I'm sure you're very qualified but I'd caution you against thinking like this, especially so early in the process (I'm assuming your not applying this cycle cause if you are you've already missed the Oxbridge deadline by about a month). Oxbridge and the Ivy League are both pretty ridiculous in terms of competition, especially for international students, to the point where it should not be considered anything but a high reach by any applicants. It'd also like to mention that Oxbridge reallocate applicants throughout their colleges during the application process, so your not going to benefit if you apply to a \"lower ranked college.\" You may as well apply to your top college, regardless of competition, and if it doesn't work out and you get reallocated to a college with less competitive applicants that year, so be it. I'm not trying to be mean or shoot down your dreams here, by all means apply if it's what you want to do! Having confidence in your ability to be accepted is great, keep that up! But don't unnecessarily get your hopes too high! A healthier attitude to have is \"I know I've submitted the best application I possibly can, and the rest of the process is out of my control, but I feel confident that I did as well as I could!\"",

Recruiters just came directly to our campus and I shared them my LinkedIn profile and I got interviews on the spot. However, I do want to preface that if you are going to pay a lot for tuition, work hard to make that worth it.",
