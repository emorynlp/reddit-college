  "text": "I\u2019m a senior and will be dropping AP Calc AB and leveling down to regular calculus for second semester. How bad will this look for admissions to UCs and T20s? I have a very low B in AB but will be dropping because it has destroyed my mental health and well-being. It\u2019s not the grade that I\u2019m worried about; it\u2019s more my health. \n\nBtw I\u2019m also taking AP gov, AP micro, AP physics 1, and AP lit.",

The real question is what is the difference between AP calc ab and \"regular calculus\" for your school? If it is an equally challenging curriculum, then you're probably fine. If it is a significant downgrade, maybe reconsider",
