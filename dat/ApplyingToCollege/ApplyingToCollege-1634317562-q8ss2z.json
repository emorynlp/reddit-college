  "text": "So I do a lot of work relating to environmental stuff, and my friend and I wrote a research paper on some interesting concepts we\u2019ve been working on. To our surprise, 3-4 journals were actually willing to publish, FOR FREE, they were peer reviewed too!\nSo I agreed to publish in one of them, and I signed the copyright agreement, but now the journal isn\u2019t replying to my emails or calls and I can\u2019t publish it anywhere else cause I signed the damn copywriter form \n\nI\u2019m so mad at myself\n\nIdk the point of this post it\u2019s just a rant ig\n\nEdit: If I write on my activities section; \u201cAccepted to XYZ Journal\u201d, is it wrong or lying or something",
