  "text": "So my internship supervisor is going to write me a letter of recommendation, but because she isn't from the school I go to, I'm not sure how to register her on common app/Naviance. I've heard different things from friends and online, and I haven't been able to get an appointment with my guidance counselor. Time is running out, and I want to be able to give her enough time to write a good letter, so how should I go about it if I already have 2 teacher reccs and a counselor recc? \n\nThanks!!",
