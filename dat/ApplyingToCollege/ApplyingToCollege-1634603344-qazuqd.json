  "text": "Some teachers at my school allow students to write LORs for themselves or will let them edit the letters before submitting. I\u2019m genuinely curious - to all the AOs: can you tell when a teacher rec has been modified/written by a student? Also, are you familiar with the teachers at different schools from their names and do some teachers\u2019 recs hold more weight than others?",

If I ask them to submit a LOR they say they can only submit this template they had made 2 years ago (now you can how generic that must be in order to pass off for a lot of students)\n\nWould you say that, in comparison to having a generic LOR writing one on my own and giving to teachers for a final edit is better? (Because at the end, it's purely upto the teacher to send that letter or not, if they feel I deserve this specific letter or not)",
