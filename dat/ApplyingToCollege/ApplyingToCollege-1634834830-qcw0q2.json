  "text": "Can I use bold or italics formatting in my supplemental essays? I have italicized specific resources at a school, like names of courses, labs, clubs, activities, and professors. My counselor is suggesting I instead use bold formatting in place of italics. Can I use such formatting, though only sparingly for the phrases mentioned above? If yes, is there anything wrong with choosing bold formatting in place of italics?",
