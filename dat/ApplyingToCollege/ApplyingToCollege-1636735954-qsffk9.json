  "text": "So at my school they use a 0-100 scale and my weighted gpa is 90.57 and my unweighted gpa is 88.23. When I went to convert them to a 4.0 scale I didn't realize how low the gpa would be. My weighted gpa on a 4.0 is apparently 3.5/3.7 and my unweighted is a 3.3. I mean I guess my weighted GPA isn't low but geez I didn't think my unweighted gpa would be a 3.3 \ud83d\udc80 You think colleges would like these GPA's?",

      "text": "Have to take your school/curriculum into context. Often times converting gpas from a 100 scale to the 4.0 scale doesn\u2019t work well. For example, grades in the Indian CBSE curriculum appear to be lower when converted to a 4.0 scale than what they\u2019re actually worth, because grades tend to be more deflated in that system. \n\nThe question to ask yourself is what percentile does your gpa place you in in your whole grade? What grades did people in previous years applying to similar colleges have?",
