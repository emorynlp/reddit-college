  "text": "I don\u2019t know where else to ask this question...\n\nI\u2019m a second year CA community college student looking to transfer to UCSD with a psychology major next fall. I need help ranking the colleges in terms of living and ge requirements on the application.\n\nI tried look at each college\u2019s website but it\u2019s a bit confusing. I do not want to take a foreign language or extensive English classes.\n\nAny ideas on how I can look this up?",

      "text": "It is different for transfers. For one transfers don't live in the college they are placed in, they have other housing specifically for transfers. \n\nJust look at the part on each college's website for the requirements specifically for transfers. If you have full IGETC it should be very simple. Just see what classes people with full IGETC need in those cases. If you don't have full IGETC it gets a bit harder but most have info online. \n\nReally it's best to do your own research. 95% if the posts you see are for freshman and not transfers, so the ranking will be quite different. And most of the posts I do see are pretty bad, putting focus on meaningless things or just being wrong.",
