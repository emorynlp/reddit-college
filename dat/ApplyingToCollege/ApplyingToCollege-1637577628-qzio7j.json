  "text": "My counselor uploaded my transcript on the common app but she forgot that she need to stamp and sign it and so she uploaded it as is. The transcript is checked as recieved on the checklist of all the EA and ED universities I applied to, and she hasn't recieved any communication from any universities yet about it either, but I read somewhere that your transcript won't be considered without the signature and stamp. Is there anything she can do to fix this? Does it even need fixing? Is it really that bad?",
