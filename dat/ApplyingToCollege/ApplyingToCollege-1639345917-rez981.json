  "title:": "Best way to distract yourself from worrying about EA/ED results is to work on your other apps",
  "text": "My kid was stressing out about the final countdown to her REA decision date and procrastinated working on her other applications. I think her subconscious thought process was that if she got into her REA school it would be wasted effort.\n\nShe redoubled her efforts on her other applications recently, and I've definitely noticed an improvement in her stress levels. When she writes a good essay she's looking forward to finding out what the admissions committee will think of it. The \"why <university name>\" essays in particular are helping her imagine herself as being happy at one of her RD schools.\n\nIt's probably too late for many of you stressing out about ED results but juniors should try to keep this in mind for next year.",
