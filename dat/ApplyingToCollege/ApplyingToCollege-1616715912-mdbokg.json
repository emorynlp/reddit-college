  "text": "Ever since I was a kid people told me how intelligent I was.\n\nAlways did well in class with little effort.\n\nCan hold my own in intellectual discussions of most common topics.\n\nOther people ask for my IB coursework/for help on tests.\n\nGot distracted by depression and other things at high school.\n\nPlus I've always been painfully lazy.\n\nHaven't fulfilled my childhood dream (and my parents belief) that I would land a T20.\n\nWhat a waste of potential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm not a prestige slut, I think prestige is a meaningless hoop that innocent 15-18 year olds are forced to jump through instead of enjoying their extremely unlikely yet magnificent consciousness. I'm just aware that the *real* world will care what brand I am, and that's what worries me. Also I really wanted to study in the US as it offers interdisciplinarity, unlike the UK's academic tunnel vision. But, to make paying 300k+ instead of 30k+ justifiable, there needs to be a certain amount of prestige.\n\nEdit edit: You guys are my therapist haha. I appreciate the support and glad to hear I\u2019m not alone in this boat. Tbh I wouldn\u2019t even be so upset if I was going to a mediocre university for a course I love (I\u2019m most likely doing mechanical engineering \u2639\ufe0f) . If I was doing literally anything else (such as applied maths which would\u2019ve been nice), I could\u2019ve transferred in F2022 to a US College of Arts and Sciences or a LAC.",

Worked my way up and got hired on at various companies to build their marketing department from ground up.  Then decided to switch career again, this time into analytics where Im working side by side with data scientists and engineers.  Worked in consumer electronics, publishing, automotive, etc... My point is, my college didnt really take me far.  I looked for opportunities and added new skillsets with every job I had which became stepping stones for me.  Once I feel like there's nothing else to learn at a company (usually 3 years for me), I'll move on to another opportunity that interests me.  This is just from my personal experience.",

You\u2019re not locked into anything (keeping in mind, of course, that changing your major midstream may delay graduation and cost more).\n\nAnother thought \u2014 spending ten times what you have to for your education is nuts. Don\u2019t do it. We justify our insane tuition and fees with prospective earnings, which is bullshit. A degree is no guarantee of gainful employment. Don\u2019t believe the hype.

      "text": "I was in your shoes. I kind of still am. Here's what I can say. The sooner I simply focused on what I truly wanted to study and put my effort into that, instead of on the name of the place, the better situation I would be in. It was agony watching many of my peers get into the schools I applied to, while I had what all my teachers and advisors thought was a stronger chance. I got one rejection, two acceptances, and six pointless waitlists. I felt like I had failed myself and failed to live up to others' expectations as well. If you're intent on attending a T20, it's still possible to investigate transfer admissions - hell that's what I actually did. But I'll say what I wasn't prepared for was the feeling when I started sophomore year, having spent a miserable year at one school where I didn't feel I belong, instead of treating it as a formative experience I treated it as a sentence. After transfer, I was infuriated, wondering how so many of my new peers were able to \"best\" me in admissions when so many frankly didn't seem that impressive or academically committed. It's not a game you can win - you're not really going to \"realize what was wrong\" with your app or yourself it seems. I've spent much too long fretting over how I felt I failed once, and this has held me back: I felt like an imposter, and despite my promise I did not let myself flourish in college because I took the admissions game too seriously, assuming that they somehow knew more about me than I did. It's incorrect, and not worth thinking twice about, let alone allowing it to consume you for years. I felt I was never \"good enough\" for this program or that, this or that major, and stifled my own experience feeling that I was never truly meant to belong. The mental illness I had in hs became exacerbated to such a level I didn't think I would survive; I did the unthinkable of earning an F, several C's, and withdrew from 3 courses. I finally got a bit of control towards the end, but im still astounded that me, someone who takes this academic stuff so seriously and has always been an enormously pensive and analytical person, has this as part of my \"official\" record. I have since graduated T20 with a major nobody has heard of and a mediocre-to-sour gpa that gives me grief. As I say, the only thing I got from school was a degree. It wasn't to do with the \"elite rigor,\" it's because I couldn't accept myself, believe in myself, and be decisive and take control of my college experience because it never unfolded in any way I ever expected. I have now become more at peace with the past several years, but I still often wonder about where I \"could be\" had I not fallen into this pit. Please don't let the disappointing sting of this moment limit you further on. A T20 degree is lovely (and not inaccessible to you, again transfer or for a later grad program), but it does not win anyone over on name alone - I and many friends of mine have been hunting for months now in the job search, and I can assure you people are more interested in what you do with the education available to you, the orgs and internships you get involved with, than the school's name. People I consider mentors who attended college I had never even heard of are accomplished working at highly selective companies and T10 PhD programs. None of this is out of your reach based on your first year of college, but I urge you to define what it is you want to study and get involved with, and the opportunities will follow. Forgive the wall of text, I'm on mobile and this was therapeutic.",

Less prestigious schools have a much higher percentage of students from poor and middle class families. For that reason, the fact that less prestigious schools produce most Fortune 500 CEOs is more impressive than the fact top colleges produce some too. Those who rose from less prestigious schools likely did it without someone else paving their way for them. \n\nFor example, someone I personally know of at a top college has one parent who's a Wall Street exec and another who's a former CEO of one major company and now started a new one. Someone groomed from birth, attending private schools with every resource. Their success will make the top college look at the more impressive, but their success will have nothing to do with having gone there.",

      "text": "Junior college student here:\n\nI felt the EXACT same way in high school. I have just a few things I\u2019d like to say :)\n\n1. You are not your school, your grades, your social status, or any other label. Any of that can define you if you choose to let it, but the second it falls away you\u2019ll be lost. In my eyes, you\u2019re defined by your willingness to believe in yourself and to get up and keep going. You\u2019ll let yourself down. A lot. Too many times. But as long as you never give up on yourself, you haven\u2019t lost. Believe in yourself.\n\n2. Depression and anxiety is not a \u201cdistraction.\u201d It\u2019s a real, complicated, difficult thing that so many go through. You are NOT alone and you WILL come out the other side. Believe in yourself.\n\n3. This is kind of an addendum to the first thing but I got rejected from my dream school while I watched everyone, including my girlfriend at the time get in. I went to the generic state school and after 2 years, I transferred out to the same dream school I got denied from. Here\u2019s the kicker though \u2014 I LOVED that \u201cconsolation\u201d school and I almost didn\u2019t leave. College, life, is entirely what you make of it. You can choose to settle for the current situation you\u2019re in or fight to make the most of it. I don\u2019t mean that in the white-knuckled grind kind of way either. College is one of the most incredible experiences if you\u2019re privileged enough to attend ANY university. All you have to do is keep your eyes open, say yes to that party invite, and damn believe in yourself.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f - I hope this helps, even if just a little :)",

      "text": "A lot of people on here are talking about how going to a T20 isn't necessary for success. That is true in a lot of industries, but I don't think most kids who are sad about not getting into a T20 are sad purely because of a career perspective. It's more a lot of us built up our self worth around our academic performance and our intelligence, and the culmination of that according to our society is getting into a 'good college', so if we don't get into a traditionally prestigious college, that might make us feel like we aren't smart as we thought and the one thing we built our identities on is now in question, which creates a lot of doubt and insecurity-- if you think of yourself as the smart kid and suddenly, you get rejected by your top choices, that might make you question how smart you truly are. And if you're not as smart as you thought, what are you? So while the career advice response to not getting into a T20 is correct in a lot of cases and heartfelt, a lot of times imo it doesn't really address the true reason kids are upset about not getting in-- most people who know enough to be on here regularly know you don't need to go to a T20 to be successful, so repeating that doesn't really hit the crux of the reason most people are sad about it. It's an identity issue, not a career prospects one.\n\nJust my 2 cents.",

I\u2019ve probably screwed my chances at a t20, or even any good college.\n\nYou\u2019re still a sophomore, you have lots of time left to change things.\n\nI was in a similar position as you at one point, so I get how you feel. I breezed through middle school and thought I was the shit for effortlessly getting As; turns out middle school was just easy. I was not actually prepared for high school.\n\nNinth grade was rough for me. My extracurriculars were nearly *nonexistent*, and I was pulling mostly low Bs in standard classes (I ended with a flat C in the single honors class I took).\n\nBut it\u2019s never too late to turn things around. I promise I\u2019m not just trying to brag, but I\u2019ve done a lot of things that I never would\u2019ve dreamt of two years ago. \n\nMy freshman grades barred me from a lot of advanced classes as a sophomore, but I still took the hardest classes possible. I joined a bunch of clubs even though I knew I would be at a disadvantage relative to kids who\u2019d been there since 9th grade, and I started reaching out to people for volunteering opportunities. I worked harder than I knew I was capable of for a 4.0 in 10th and 11th grade, and I studied my ass off till I aced every standardized test. When I was getting ready to apply, I spent hours on the websites of all the places I applied to so I could write the best essays possible.\n\nI honestly thought getting into my state college with an acceptance rate in the mid-50s was a stretch at the end of my freshman year, what with my low B average in relatively easy courses, essentially blank activity list, and lack of unique hooks. But I turned things around. About a month ago, I was accepted to one of my top choices\u2014it\u2019s ranked in the low 20s, though it\u2019s within the top 5 for my major.\n\nGlancing over your profile, you\u2019re already *way* ahead of where I was as a sophomore. I took my first two AP classes and started browsing this subreddit as a junior; you took your first two APs as a freshman and you\u2019re posting here as a sophomore. I promise you\u2019ll do alright. \n\nIf *I* can pull through and get into a good school even in an absolute shitstorm of an admissions cycle, you can too. You don\u2019t get to say it\u2019s over till you\u2019re a senior :P",

In my family, I'm dubbed as the smart one , and everyone has these high expectations that I'm going to do something big and honestly the expectation feels suffocating. Also, what keeps me down is the fact I have to take the SAT soon and I barely studied. I got a 821 on the PSAT so I'm very nervous that my score won't be high to get into top 20 schools. Don't get me wrong, I'm not stupid and I'm definitely a hard worker but when I get anxiety, it numbs me to the point where I'm afraid to move because of fear of failure. Hopefully things won't always be this way.",

That program has crippled an entire generation of people that could have helped prop up murica in this decade of crisis that we've entered, but instead we spent excessive amounts of time making sure the kids that didn't want to be there got to graduate with all Ds or whatever so the schools could have 100% graduation hoorah. . .?\n\nI've seen how other countries don't require education beyond certain levels for certain careers & it baffles me why murica doesn't wanna let kids skip high school so they can go work a fast food frier & spend the rest of their time trying to \"make it big\" on tik tok or whatever. That's what these people are gonna do anyway, so why hurt the \"middle class\" of students that could have excelled in something given the proper motivation or opportunities to try several things before college where trying different things costs you thousands of dollars for classes that potentially could have no academic value to you whatsoever because you decided in the middle of your second year you would have been better off in a completely different major or in a trade school instead.\n\n& how amazing our schools could be if 10, 20, or even 30% of the students were allowed to leave traditional high school after the first year to go to a trade school instead? But that would be \"socialism\" or whatever, so there's no way this idea is ever gonna go anywhere in murica.\n\n\ud83e\udd23",

      "text": "You're not a waste - you just aren't there yet. I know this sounds trite, but it's impossible to be happy when you compare yourself to others. I was you once. Always the gifted kid, never had to study, perfect ACT, full rides handed out, and then I went to college and shit the bed. I didn't know how to go to make myself go to class, how to study, etc. I loved partying and boys. My avoidance behavior was on point. I crashed and burned - hard. I tried to go back to school a couple times as an adult, and it never got far. I'd knock out a class or two here and there, but I just couldn't get my shit together.\n\n Then I got diagnosed with ADHD and I started seeing a therapist. Highly recommend! They helped me with strategies and coping skills, time management, and overcoming the ridiculous executive dysfunction that has plagued me my entire life. I'm fucking brilliant, but I forget to brush my teeth or put on deodorant almost every day. Once I finally understood myself through therapy and medication, I went back to school and kicked ass. (I mean, I still write papers the night before they're due. Some things never change.) I'm in my 40's and I \\*just\\* graduated with my BSc in a stem field last year. I'm applying to grad school this spring. \n\nA few of my kids are already college grads, and most of my friends have advanced degrees. I had to let go of the notion that getting a bachelor's as an adult was embarrassing, something I should have done at 22, that even in graduating, I was still a failure. I decided I was going to be proud of myself no matter what people thought. Sometimes you have to fake it a little in the beginning, but I hope you don't take 20 years to learn about yourself and love your life. \n\nLife never turns out the way you think it will, but you will have a LOT more chances to do the thing. Hating on yourself for your failures is a waste of energy and only hurts you. You got this.",

      "text": "I hear you and sympathize with your feelings. It's difficult to receive rejection especially from colleges. When I graduated high school back in 2018, I got rejected from many schools while my peers got accepted into high ranking schools. I had very similar feelings of inadequacy and failure as I felt I was a great student, but now I was unsure of my own worth and worried about how others would view me based on the college I went to. I spent the next few years trying to combat this feeling, holding unfair standards and judgements for myself.\n\nSince then, I've transferred a few times and experienced being at a couple universities. COVID in particular caused me to transfer to a school closer to home. During my educational journey, I've learned a lot about success and happiness. By attending different institutions, I've learned that there are opportunities wherever you go -- all you need is to have determination to continue pursuing your goals. In also watching my old high school classmates, both in prestigious universities and lesser known colleges and CC's (even some who decided college wasn't the right path for them), I've learned that there are many ways to achieve your goals and live a fulfilling life. **Academic achievement does not reflect your worth, and at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what school you go to, but what you** ***do*** **in college.** *You* define your own success, not the branding of the school you go to.\n\nTo anyone reading who also feels this way: Your emotions are valid, and take some time to feel what you are feeling. Appreciate and acknowledge your hard-work -- don't let anonymous admissions officers determine your self-worth and capability. Take a deep breaths; you are not alone in your feelings, and I promise you that things won't always feel this way. Feel free to reach out anytime, and best of luck to you! **You got this!**",

I went to a very average university in Canada and the \u201cprestige\u201d associated with the school was non-existent.\n\nBased on your goals, prestige might not matter. In my case, I started up a business in LA after graduating. Nobody cares where you went to school when you\u2019re self-employed. Wherever you get in, you\u2019ll carve a path that works for you.",

Won crap tons of National and international awards, president of several extracurriculars, and did research too. My dream was to get into an Ivy, and for the first 3 years of my high school experience, it set me up for success... then covid came and right after depression and anxiety. I didn\u2019t do well in my classes averaging B\u2019s for most, C for one and A for a couple. I talked with my teachers about what I\u2019ve been going through in my personal life and shared that info with colleges. After receiving a couple decisions from T50 schools, I\u2019m not optimistic at all for the Ivy decisions. Kinda sucks that everything was going right and then the unexpected happened and killed my dreams. Covid not only hurt my senior year, but it likely impacted where I\u2019d be going for the next four years and potentially the rest of my life.",

It might be worth taking some humanities courses on the side - just enough to get your mind going. Aside from that, if you can make something in the humanities a hobby, like writing or reading, that's half the battle. Just reading some good books can really open your mind. If there's a quality book club in your area I'd recommend joining",
