That's a long time. 22 percent of our current life.\n\nFinally, Going to elite universities is A MUST for most finance, medical, law and even cs jobs these days. They MASSIVELY help with basically every other field as well. Chances are if you want to pursue a passion, get rich, or maybe a mixture of both, going to an ELITE university matters.

The T10 law schools care about excellent grades, high LSATs, and a rigorous undergraduate course load that includes considerable writing, analysis, and quantitative skills.  They do not care about whether you are attending a private college, an LAC, a state flagship university, or a regional college.  My T10 law school class included large cohorts of students from all of those institutions.  And once you are in law school, no one cares one bit about where you did your undergrad.",

Going to Harvard versus going to UF isn't that big of a difference from the standpoint of your still going to college in a challenging environment. The academic abilities of the students there and the difficulty of the courses is really the only thing that would be different during your time there. You're going to meet some great people, and some really awful ones. Some great things will happen, and some really awful ones. So it goes... Point is, being stressed about some hypothetical idea of what you think it means to go to a school not happening because you don't get in is pointless. It's honestly going to be so different from that if you do go their anyways. I go to the perfect school for me that fits all of my boxes and is academically challenging and gorgeous, and I also spent today in long term trauma therapy that I have to go to now to stay enrolled. Point is, life is going to be hard whether you do it at HYP or an average state school.",

And what so many miss is that \u201cyour average state school\u201d likely comes with an honors college, terrific professors, and a cohort of exceptionally bright and engaged students who chose that \u201caverage state college\u201d because it offered a generous merit scholarship, was higher ranked in their particular major than most ivies, was close to a well-loved family, or was the school whose sports teams you\u2019ve been cheering on since you were three.  I was a first generation applicant, high school valedictorian, and a NMS with a great leadership resume.  I still chose a school that barely breached the T100 over several T20\u2019s because that university offered me a full-ride, was within a 4 hour drive of home, had been attended by a favorite teacher, and was pre-season ranked #17 in college basketball (yep, this mattered to me). I graduated with a 3.98, a Truman Scholarship for law school, the top paper at the honors college, and acceptances at five of the T10 law schools.  And I had an amazing experience and still obsessively follow my beloved basketball team, which is once again ranked in the top twenty.  As for practicing what you preach, my spouse is a double Ivy grad but my kids, whose resumes are very solid, both attend a well-regarded state school because it met their requirements of being a short drive from home with in-state tuition and exciting  D1 sports.  (And I cheer for their basketball team, too.)",
