  "text": "I am a senior in high school and have completed 3 credits of math, ending at Algebra II. One of the schools i\u2019m considering requires 4 years of math. If I were to take an online precalculus course, would that count for the 4th credit? Or does it vary on each school? The course would be through UNE, University of New England. \n\nThanks",
