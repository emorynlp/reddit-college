Well, so be it. \n \n\nI'm hopeful there will come a time when you put less stock in test scores (I understand the college admissions process has reinforced your perception of their worth) and, perhaps even more important, get less enjoyment out of using scores as funny or pejorative differentiator between yourself and others.  There are people who scored less than you did on the ACT or SAT or whatever test who are going to do just fine in life.  You may end up knowing and liking these people.  You may end up avidly consuming the things they make, the ideas they share, or the services they offer.  ",

You can learn these tricks by yourself but you can also hire a tutor that is familiar with these strategies to teach it to you. It\u2019s about working hard to learn the material and the test. Time is only an issue when you are, like you said, confused by a question, or can\u2019t manage your time. Learn to concepts so it\u2019s like second nature that you won\u2019t even hesitate and learn how to manage your time.\n\nHave you taken the SAT recently? It\u2019s become much more simplified and repetitive. It\u2019s now truly just about learning the test, the strategies, and the basic concepts.\n\nPersonally (coming from a poor standardized test taker), the first practice SAT I took summer before my junior year went just like you said. I didn\u2019t know anything about the test and ran out of time and got confused by questions. I got a 1200. Spent a couple months learning the test in detail and drilling all the concepts (took about 20 practice tests) and got a 1550. If I did not study efficiently you bet I would\u2019ve stayed in that range of 1200-1300.",
