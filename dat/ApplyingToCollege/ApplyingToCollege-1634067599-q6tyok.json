The *option* to be anonymous in a class, if you wish, is nice.  I attended a large state campus similar to Michigan and didn't feel lost, but your mileage may vary.\n\n>Kids on average will be stronger at Tufts\n\nQuestion whether this is true.  SAT percentiles are similar.  Can't compare GPA since Michigan doesn't release class rank stats and Tufts doesn't release GPA range stats.  In any case, they're fairly close.\n\n>and there won't be 50% from one state (but most will be from Northeast)\n\nIs 50% from one state much different from 50% from New England as a whole?\n\n>And Tufts does NOT have less name recognition, at least in US.\n\nHave to disagree here.  Outside the Northeast and/or academic circles Tufts is less well known.  Not disqualifying of Tufts, but, all else being equal, I'd prefer more name recognition to less.",
