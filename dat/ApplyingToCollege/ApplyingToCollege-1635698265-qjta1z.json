  "text": "So I am a junior in high school taking dual enrollment college classes at a local CC. The bio class I am in is super challenging but I\u2019ve been managing. Up until a week ago. I had a big online test that day. In the middle of my test, I got super sick due to some food poisoning. Completely broke my focus and I wasn\u2019t even able to finish. I ended up failing it which is very unlikely. It\u2019s tanking my grade and I will most likely end the class with a B now instead of an A. I normally get all A\u2019s. \n\nI got a couple of B\u2019s in freshman year when I wasn\u2019t trying yet. I wasn't even planning on going to college then. \n\nI\u2019m worried that this college class is going to rank my GPA and I won\u2019t be able to get into any T20\u2019s anymore. My heart is broken. What do I do?\n\nEdit: I forgot to say I have already asked and explained the whole situation. He will not let me retake it.",
