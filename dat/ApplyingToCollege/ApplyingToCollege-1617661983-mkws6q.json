You may also apply to other colleges early depending on the policy of the school.\n\nREA (Restricted Early Action) same as SCEA: It's like EA. The difference is that you cannot apply to other schools. REA is non-binding, but you may only apply to one private school REA. Most schools allow you to apply EA to public schools, however.\n\nED (Early Decision): It's EA but now it's binding and you have a boost in your admission chances of you apply ED.\n\nED II: Same as ED. I think the difference is timing whereas you can apply ED II later than ED (the deadline of ED's are usually around October and November).",
