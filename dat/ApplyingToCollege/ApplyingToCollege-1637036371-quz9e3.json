  "text": "this isn't directly related to college admissions, but it's on the topic of ECs so i figured i'd ask here. hopefully its not too niche- feel free to redirect me to a diff sub.\n\ni want to enter some research competitions-- except i don't really have research to enter into them lmao. i like math (specifically abstract algebra) and physics, and i'd be happy to do research in either, except it seems that research opportunities are kinda scarce in those fields, for high school students at least.\n\nso two questions:\n\n1.  how exactly does one go about getting research opportunities with professors, or undergoing tutelage/starting a project with professors to learn about advanced subjects like that? if anyone has experience/more specific details on this, i'd be so grateful.\n2. might be a reach, but if anyone knows of math/physics intensives/research programs for hs students, that would be great, as im trying to dip my toes into research in these two subjects. like simons/rsi/pioneer types?\n\nthanks!",

      "text": "Hey, I have participated in a lot of research projects during high school and for me, I researched professors that I wanted to work with or did research in areas that I was interested in and then emailed them asking if I could work in their lab. The professors will then respond back to you. There is typically a 1/10 chance (for me, maybe different for others) so I suggest you email a high number of professors. \n\nAlso for #2, rsi and mit primes are two really prestigious summer programs. Maybe apply to ssp too (but more astrophysics and biochem related) or RISE.",

          "text": "thanks for the info :)) i think ill definitely try emailing profs just to get to a starting point, its definitely the most straightforward way to go about it.\n\nalso thanks for the suggestions about the research programs! im thinking about ssp and RISE bc primes and rsi both seem like absolute crapshoots lol, and id think most of the people applying are usamo quals anyway (i don't enjoy competitive math :/ ) so it'll be impossible.",
