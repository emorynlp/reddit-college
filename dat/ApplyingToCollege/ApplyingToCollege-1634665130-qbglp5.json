      "text": "I'm a newbie to all this as well, so take my advice with a heavy pinch of salt. But I think a fun way to slow it down would be to zero in on specific moments of that period. Also do try and find ways to make it more concise so you can fit in some descriptiveness. Although, at the end of the day, if you're able to effectively get the events of that period across, and meaningfully show the impact they had on you, it should be good. Once again though, pure speculation here, total noob at essays.",
