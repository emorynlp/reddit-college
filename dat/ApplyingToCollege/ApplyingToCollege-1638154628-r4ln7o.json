  "title:": "send an additional letter of rec / change my rec to USC?",
  "text": "USC says:  \n\n\"One letter of recommendation is required from your school counselor or a teacher from your school.   Additional letters are not required for admission to the university, but you are welcome to submit them for consideration. \"\n\ndoes that mean it's ok to send another letter? because when I submitted my app (I submitted early; it's due 12/1), I didn't realize common app automatically defaulted to submitting just my counselor's rec, not any of my 2 teacher recs.  should I add my 2 teacher recs (=3 recs total), *or* email my AO to delete my counselor's rec to send in 2 teacher recs instead (=2 recs total)?\n\n(because USC's website also says \"If you have already submitted your application and need to make changes, you can email your admission counselor with the subject 'Changes to Application'. Please use the same email address you used in your application for these requests\")\n\nsince i heard teacher recs  r better than counselor recs. any advice? thank you!",
