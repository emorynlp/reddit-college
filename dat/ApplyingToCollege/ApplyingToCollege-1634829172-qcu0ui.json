  "text": "hi y'all,\n\nthis might be a stupid question, but could you guys help me with ED/EA decision? My older brother doesn't want me to apply to Brown, even though he went there, and wants me to \"do better.\"\n\nHe wants me to apply ED/REA to Dartmouth or Yale instead, especially since he thinks its a better fit for me socially and since I mentioned I'm interested in following his career path (he's an investment banker), he's pushing for those two as they have better \"placement\" than Brown generally.\n\nHow do I navigate this? All three schools are at 5-6% acceptance rates (4.9, 5.8, 6.1 respectively I think), but I think I get a slight legacy boost at Brown because of my brother. I've also been there hundreds of times and I can do my Why Brown essay very easily. I do agree with him that Yale and Dartmouth (especially) are a better social fit for me, but I do enjoy the seemingly laid back vibes that Brown can provide. I also want to study Economics, which I know Yale and Dartmouth are ranked higher for, but the difference seems marginal and I would be able to take a lot of interesting courses at Brown pass/fail and just focus on learning.\n\nI get the logic of what my brother is thinking, and I know he wants me to go to a \"better\" school than he did, but I really do enjoy Brown and I'm just confused on why he doesn't want me to go to Brown, as he loved it there (at least 5 frat brothers would come over every holiday) and ended up on a great career track regardless. I would also have legacy at his frat and other organizations, and I'm sure he knows it would make my social life a lot easier, especially since I've met some brothers who would be seniors when I get on campus.\n\nHow do I go about this? Outside of the social aspect, I don't think there's that much of a difference in acceptance probability (east asian male, lower middle class, public school, stats are all competitive with perfect SATs and numerous sports and national academic comps). Career wise, it seems that I'll be set no matter what, even if it might be marginally less common for people to go into finance at Brown. He also tossed out the idea of Harvard, Princeton, or Wharton but didn't think they were worth it socially.\n\nWhat do I tell him? Is he right? I would also need financial aid (heavily) so REA at Yale would give me a chance to apply to other schools to see their financial aid package.",

      "text": "10 years out of college, and having gone to a top 5 school for undergrad, my two cents is to spend MUCH more time thinking about your career than you do thinking about your \"dream\" college.  My sense from your post is that you might be doing the opposite.\n\nDo you know what career you want to have? That's the ideal question in my opinion.\n\nDoctor? Lawyer? Teacher? Inventor? Business? Something else? Have you volunteered/worked in your field of interest to test your hypothesis? 10 years from now, nobody will care if you went to Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Yale, or Arizona State... including you. What you'll care about is what career you have and whether it supports your dreams and lifestyle. If you go to a fancy school and have to borrow 6 figures in student loans for undergrad, you might even regret choosing your dream school upon realizing you could have landed the same career and had just as much fun elsewhere.\n\nMost of this \"dream school\" stuff is simply successful marketing of a product. Schools invest heavily in selling you on how different and special they are when they are mostly the same. Your undergrad degree is a product. Don't over pay for it, and make sure it does something useful for you. You'll know it was useful if you progress towards your dream career with little to no debt from undergrad.",

      "text": "Okay lemme try and give you my perspective on the pros and cons of Brown: \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a relatively laid back vibe, Brown is a much better choice than Dartmouth and Yale. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a place where you don\u2019t want to be surrounded in a petri dish of aspiring finance bros, Brown is a much better place than Dartmouth, and Yale is an equally good choice. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a place where you can take advantage of grade inflation (because GPA is sacrosanct in finance recruiting), Brown is a much better choice. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a place where you can pursue a very interesting or your own custom major, Brown is the better choice. \n\nNow - if you\u2019re looking at a place where you can maximize your chances of working at elite boutiques/HF/PE then Dartmouth and Yale are both better choices. The thing is, even at these schools, it\u2019s a small minority getting these roles. Sure, Browns alumni presence on Wall St isn\u2019t at rampant as Dartmouth\u2019s, and its name isn\u2019t quite as hallowed as Yale\u2019s, but for all practical purposes you can do as well from Brown than these schools. \n\nThe fact that you\u2019re able to write the Why Brown essay easily shows that it\u2019s an amazing fit for you. It also means that you have a better chance of getting in than somewhere where you have to force it out. \n\nI feel like the reason Brown doesn\u2019t naturally fit into Wall St jobs (and you should probably verify this with your brother) is that finance jobs, especially IB, are an absolute grind. So going to a place like Wharton where there\u2019s that competitive culture from the get go, or doing a STEM degree from a T20 shows to prospective employers that you can put in the work. Brown, however, is known for a lax culture and massive grade inflation, so perhaps one won\u2019t naturally develop the same work ethic as they would elsewhere. So if you do go to Brown, I would advise you to actively seek internships, and take on some rigorous courses to show employers you\u2019ve got what it takes, and actually build the work ethic needed for finance. \n\nIn short - I\u2019d say go Brown. There are a million things other than career prospects that should feed into your decision, but be aware of the couple of disadvantages you *may* have.",

You'll enjoy/hate college as a function of your own decisions much more than which particular school you go to, especially when the comparisons are between the Ivies. \n\nIt's true that Yale and Princeton have higher rates of IB graduates. It's also true that Brown has extensive interest from IB recruiters and many of my friends work in that field. Getting into IB is very much about connections...and if you have a brother in the field to the extent that you can have your pick of Ivies, you already have a ridiculous leg up. \n\nI am unsure how much your family makes, but I absolutely needed a generous finaid package. Brown exceeded the offers for my in state college by a long shot. In general, getting into an Ivy means you'll have really nice financial support.\n\nGood luck!",

Open curriculum is hella sexy and the quarter system tends to be pretty intense. That said, Dartmouth is known for being the other 'chill' ivy so it shouldn't be too rough I'd expect.",
