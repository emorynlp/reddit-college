  "text": "Background: Former gifted kid here. I guess everything was sort of handed to me without me work, plus I am an undiagnosed ADHD kid, so yeah it all goes downhill from there. I was one of those kids who peaked in elementary school.  Over the past few years I've completely fallen off-from top student to failing a semester, not doing anything with my life, and losing hope. I am uninvolved, don' really do any sports, and have no hobby except for writing. I don't even think I'll graduate high school due to my bad grades last year. \n\nAnd then I met this girl. \n\nWe had met a few years prior, and we were both at the same stage of life, but the problem is everything has just gone downhill for me while everything has gone uphill for her. We both work the same job, and although she only started a bit earlier than me she seems to be much more favored for her go-getter personality. She is part of all these exclusive clubs an groups within the school district and is heavily involved. Our teachers love her. Our manager loves her. Harvard even chose her to be part of this committee thing. She knows every event that goes on, has an impeccable work ethic- and on top of that she works out at, like 5am. So basically, I'm jealous of somebody who deserves everything they've got. Do you see the problem here?\n\nLook, I know not everything is at it seems on the surface level, but as a person who can't even do more tan one important task a day, I feel like shit. I know its wrong to be jealous, but I can't help but feel the envy bubble up inside of me.  But most importantly, she is like this messed up symbol of who I could've been if I had just made better choices in the past.  You know when people are like, \"Yeah I was depressed and anxious but I pushed through an won a Noble Peace Prize at the age of sixteen.\" ? If I wasn't so lazy, so clueless, so socially anxious- I could've been Golden Girl. If only I wasn't so stupid. The frustration just wraps itself around me to the point where I literally hate her sometimes.  . It's like Im fighting with myself, too. This evil demon side, the green eyed monster, and then the more understanding you know better\" side. \n\nyeah maybe I need therapy again",

You\u2019re only like sixteen years old, there is an almost unbelievable amount of time to get things turned around.",

You're the only person you will always have in your world and if even you don't serve your own self, youll find that life will get even harder to get through for yourself. And yeah, making the right decisions is hard. But in this life, we choose our hard. Choose the right one",

Jealousy is a natural human emotion which can get the best of you but this isn't a marathon, it doesn't matter if XYZ person is doing better than you or not. You're the main character of your life and what you're doing is what matters more. Sending hugs, take care <3",

      "text": "I applaud you for admitting this. You will get a lot of downvotes, because believe it or not, jealousy is the most stigmatized emotion, even more than pedophilia or sociopathy.\n\nI felt the same way. I started of the same as a kid I know, but he is now a USACO Camper. I felt like shit. I mean I have a patent and news coverage, but nothing on his level. By the way, we are bay area Asian males, so the bar is extra extra high for us. We were both on the same level in middle school. Worst thing is was that I too had the same emotions regarding him as you did for that girl. I stalked numerous LinkedIn profiles which made me feel even more jealous and resentful.\n\nI recently got over this. You have to get this in your head: If you heard the quote, comparison is the thief of joy, do not take it as face value. Comparison is actually the thief of success, which comes from joy. I internalized this after reading a medium article by a Harvard/Oxford graduate that outlined the negative impacts on your life if you compare yourself against other people. Spoiler: It is not only happiness that is affected, it is your ability to get success. So whenever you get those thoughts, repeat the thought that \"I am destroying my life\"",
