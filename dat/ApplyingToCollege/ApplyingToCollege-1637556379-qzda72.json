  "text": "For one of my research projects, I mistakenly said I *helped* design a device to do X. This isn\u2019t the case, it was an independent project done solely by me. I submitted all these applications on the 31st of October. Will it make me look insane if I email my colleges about this? Is it even a big deal? It\u2019s literally one word and it\u2019s about 22 days after submission so I don\u2019t want to look weird.",
