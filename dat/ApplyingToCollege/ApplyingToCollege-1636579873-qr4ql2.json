  "text": "Im very confused about the recommenders and ferpa section. I asked my counselor to write a letter of rec for me. On the recommenders and ferpa, it says that the letter was submitted. There is no option to choose which colleges to send the letter to, it just says that it is submitted. So does this mean all colleges I am applying to will get the letter if I submit my application?",
