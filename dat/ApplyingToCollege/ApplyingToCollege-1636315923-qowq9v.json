  "text": "I know a lot of advice centers around creating a narrative about yourself in your applications, a central theme that can represent you. What if you have a variety of ECs like debate captain + water quality nonprofit + robotic club founder that you cannot tie around any central theme without saying something like curiosity. \n\nI am applying to a competitive major and I don't have a distinct theme about myself no matter how strong my app is.",

You could reach out to a college and explain why it\u2019s not feasible to provide a recommendation from a FIRST mentor and see if they\u2019ll still consider you. \n\nSyracuse does not require a recommendation from a FIRST mentor. You can just fill out this form so we have a record that you\u2019re on a FIRST team. (The form asks for a mentor\u2019s name and email but if the team has an email like \u201cTeamXYZ@gmail\u201d that will be fine.) We use the Common App and our deadline is January 1st. \n\nhttps://undergraduate.admissions.go.syr.edu/register/?id=e37c2805-8e65-4404-8934-aa9731b9b442",
