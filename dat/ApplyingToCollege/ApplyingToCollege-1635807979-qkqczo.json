  "text": "I\u2019m previewing my application to Rice, but the self-reported test scores aren\u2019t showing up. Are we supposed to send the scores via collegeboard or something? Sort of scared because Rice is my first choice and my test scores are pretty strong, so I don\u2019t want to go test-optional in the app process.",
