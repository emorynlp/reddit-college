  "title:": "Does it negatively impact your chances if you drop an AP course?",
  "text": "I'm a sophomore in highschool, and I recently dropped AP Human Geography for quarter one.\n\nI dropped the class, because my course instructor made me uncomfortable via racially charged jokes. Additionally, I wasn't a fan of how he \"taught\" the coursework, either. In the end, I finished the quarter with a \"P\" grade\u2014which is technically a \"C+\", but it won't impact my GPA nor will it show up as a C+ on my transcript. For context, my current GPA is a 3.91 UW and 4.56 W.\n\nInterestingly enough, I excelled really well in AP World History and scored a 5 on the AP exam last year, however I have no idea if this will change anything. Moreover, geography isn't even related to the major I'm pursuing.\n\nOverall, I'm just worried how badly this will hurt my chances of getting into a top/accredited school (UC's, Umich, and NYU, for example, are some of the schools I'm looking at).",

Some advice - everyone I know who has taken APs has always said to take APs you genuinely like, not to just take APs to take APs. (Also, a lot of schools don't even offer AP Human Geography - not having it is not a loss!)",
