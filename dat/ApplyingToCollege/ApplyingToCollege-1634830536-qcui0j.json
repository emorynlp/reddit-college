  "title:": "Would it hurt my chance of getting into a college if i talk about me leaving a school due to bullying?",
  "text": "In the education section, they asked me why I left my school, mainly because of the bully, and I wanted some fresh air. I don't know if it will hurt my chance of getting in because it seems like I just ran away from my problem instead of trying to stand up for myself. I did try to stand up for myself and even talked to my teacher or counselor, but they did not help. I am just wondering if I should even talk about the reason I left my school was because of bullying or something, or how should I approach it?",
