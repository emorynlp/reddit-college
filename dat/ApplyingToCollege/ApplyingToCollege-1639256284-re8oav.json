  "text": "Basically the title.  I got into Hopkins ED1, but I applied to Case Western, Umass Amherst, Clemson, University of Connecticut and Johnson and Wales (I got into Uhart and Quinnipiac).   The confirm attendance form is due in January, but I haven\u2019t received my aid package yet.  \n\nI have done the calculator and decided I can deal with my parents not paying; but I know those aren\u2019t final results, so I\u2019m hesitant to rescind my applications in case it was really off and I can\u2019t afford it.  \n\nIs it unethical to let my Amherst, JWU, and CWRU decisions come out and then decline?\n\nI\u2019m not applying to any more schools, because that seems dirty to me.",

Wait until you get your final financial offer from JHU then withdraw*",
