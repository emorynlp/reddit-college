The publisher is not like one of the biggest in the country but still legit and somewhat well-known. However, the book hasn\u2019t been published because the process tends to take a while there (I\u2019m a senior in hs now).\n\nI do feel like this is a somewhat noteworthy accomplishment and that maybe it would help but I don\u2019t know if I should put it on my application because:\n1. I wrote the book in middle school, not in high school\n2. The book has not actually been published, although there is a contract saying it will be\n\nShould I still put it on my application? I feel like it is an accomplishment that says something about me but I\u2019m not sure it would be relevant. Would this show more of who I am and possibly help my chances?
