  "text": "Aside from a school\u2019s prestige and academic capability, what are other things that you all look at when applying to universities? For instance, I\u2019m coming from a school with very poor diversity. Because of this, I\u2019m looking for a university that contains students of all different types of backgrounds.",

      "text": "The two most important factors for me are **A: Having my Major** and **B: Cost.**\n\n**A: Having my Major** \\- As a prospective business major, it was important for me to look at the schools I was thinking of, and making sure they had my major. A surprisingly high number of prestigious schools don't have an undergrad business school. *(UCLA, Harvard, Yale, Brown, Princeton, Dartmouth, Duke, Northwestern, Stanford, just to name a few.)*\n\n**B: Cost -** This is why I'm not applying to UMich, UC schools, U of Washington, or CU Boulder. As an OOS applicant, all of those schools would cost upwards of $55k a year for me to attend. Be sure to run the net price calculators for any schools you're considering. (On Google, look up \"\\[name of school\\] net price calculator\" and a link will pop up that will be a cost estimator for you at the given school.\n\nIn second, **location, undergrad size, distance from home, vibe.**",
