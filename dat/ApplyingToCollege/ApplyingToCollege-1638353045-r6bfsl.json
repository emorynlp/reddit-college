  "text": "Edit - just realized it\u2019s Wednesday, this is not a shitpost /gen.      \nThere\u2019s a bit of background I need to cover. I\u2019m currently doing online school (junior year) due to illness\u2026 well, \u201cdoing\u201d is a bit of a stretch. I haven\u2019t touched my classes in a month. I\u2019ve dealt with both physical and mental issues for as long as I can remember and 6 months ago something snapped. I\u2019ve since been diagnosed with a long list of mental disorders and doctors are working to understand my, rather mysterious, chronic illness. It\u2019s a lot. I simply don\u2019t have the ability to complete my course load this year. \nMy sophomore year, I was a straight A student. I have always had my sights set on T20 universities.     \nIt looks like I\u2019m going to be taking a year off core classes (I may do an elective course during my second semester so that I\u2019m doing *something* as I (hopefully) get better - it would be incredibly low stakes). \nThe plan is in it\u2019s early days and my family is working closely with the school board. Right now, I\u2019m worried about the repercussions. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is helpful, but this is what my current situation looks like - \n\nPhysical -     \nLPR (my symptoms - can\u2019t swallow food properly, can\u2019t speak during flare ups, general discomfort, acid reflux, fatigue, weight loss, poor appetite). \nR-CPD.     \nWe are still working on a full diagnosis for my physical issues, as I mentioned, the whole thing has been very mysterious.     \n\nMental (professionally diagnosed)-     \nMDD    \nOCD    \nGAD    \nSpecific phobia (root of many of my issues) (emetophobia)    \nSocial Anxiety    \n(I\u2019ve been dealing with all of these things for a while now. I pushed myself to my breaking point sophomore year (I\u2019m talking retaking quizzes I scored 92% on for 100%), finals put me into overdrive and something within me went \u201cabsolutely-fucking-not-you-neurotic-dumbass. And here I am :,))\n\nNon-medical reasoning for why I\u2019d like to take a year off -     \nMore time to prep for standardized tests.   \nGaining back lost time for internships and volunteering.     \nFocusing on getting better and *then* getting back to school, rather than multitasking (which has failed miserably thus far).    \nGeneral stress reduction.     \nFull course load junior year (If I were to finish the year out, I would be taking 3 normal courses rather than my planned 4 APs, 1 honors and 1 normal).     \n\nNow, onto my questions\u2026.    \nHow will this affect my chances when I apply to university?     \n\nWhat are the possible social repercussions? I\u2019m not super worried about this, the pandemic and my subsequent online schooling have left me pretty out of the loop anyway, but I would like to consider everything. I\u2019ve been looking at the possibility of switching schools when I return, but I don\u2019t want to cause unnecessary stress for myself. \n\nI was born in May, 2005 (I\u2019m class of 2023, will be pushing to 2024) - how will this affect me if I stay back?    \n\nHow do I spin this to work in my favor?     \n\nHow will this affect my GPA?     \n\nI\u2019m mostly concerned with college, any additional thoughts are much appreciated.     \n\nLet this be a warning to all you crazy people out there. It\u2019s not worth it. Take the B (,C, or D) if getting an A will mentally drain you. It\u2019s about cumulative success, not individual perfection. Stay strategic and for the love everything you hold dear - do not do what I did.",

      "text": "First, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re going to be taking care of yourself, first and foremost. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about the social repercussions. This is about you. If you have a good core of friends, nothing else matters. And by the time you get to college it\u2019s a clean sheet anyway. \n\nWith regard to college, they will have seen and experienced most every scenario around. Taking time to right yourself is important. Even better, if you can fight your way back to a wholesome you and excel, you will shine in your application and they will see your turnaround as a huge positive. \n\nGood luck!",

          "text": "My counselor bumped us up to a higher level (not really sure why), it seems like he\u2019s willing to go along with whatever we decide. Thanks for the help, I\u2019ll be sure to have that on file :))\n\nWe are pretty sure this is not Eosinophilic Esophagitis - although I am curious how you know about that!\nMy symptoms don\u2019t have the typical pain from EoE, and the swallowing issues happen at a different part of my throat. My best guess (and for now, my Doctors\u2019) is some incredibly intense anxiety knocked me out of whack and caused a flare up of LPR. The continued swallowing issue is most likely (at least partially) psychological (tied heavily to the emetophobia). It\u2019s been rough. But anyway, how do you know about EoE? Seems to be pretty rare.",
