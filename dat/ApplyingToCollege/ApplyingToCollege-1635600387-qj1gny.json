But I was under the impression that ED just looks really good and gives the school a feeling of security, so it just really raises your chances of getting accepted.  Especially when you're also applying to places like Harvard, Yale,  or UChicago(that competition factor). But other than that it doesn't really do anything.... \n\nWhat I'm getting at, is I don't believe more ED applicants = less chances of acceptance as an ED applicant. I think its just like people who do add test scores and don't add test scores currently.  Like it can help you if you do. But most likely it won't hurt you. Well... test scores might be a shitty example..... if you post a low enough test score, a application that looks like gold will turn into a Cadbury(sp?) coin real quick. But you get what I mean.
