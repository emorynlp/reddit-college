  "text": "(This is my first time using reddit so I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this)\n\nOk so basically I'm a high school senior in America and I really want to go to the UK for University. I overall have had pretty good grades throughout high school except for my second semester of my junior year (lots of mental health reasons lead to not the best grades and failing like every AP test). Due to this, I don't think I would be able to get into a lot of the universities I had originally wanted to apply to. I want to know what the best universities are that I would have a good chance of being able to get into with my stats. \n\n\\- I have a 3.5 unweighted GPA (4.5 weighted) \n\n\\- AP tests scores: World History (3); Art History (3); Biology (3); and Seminar (3)\n\n\\- I am taking the AP Stats and English Lit tests at the end of this year\n\n\\- I also plan on taking two community college classes second semester",

      "text": "unfortunately, you don't stand a chance in the 'red brick' universities of the UK. In the UK, they do not look at GPAs, your academic life is determined by 2 standardized tests taken in what you would call high school (we call it secondary school and 6th form). the tests are GCSEs which are taken at 16, and A-levels taken at 18. for you to be eligible, you need to have a 5 in 5 APs. UK universities don't look at SATs, they consider them irreveleant. the only US equivalent would be the AP course. as for the best universities, much like America's ivy League, UK has a group of prestigious universities called the red brick universities. these include Oxford, Cambridge, etc",
