I have slight phone call anxiety and I'm freaking out if there's something I've done wrong... Also I'm always paranoid about getting scammed, the number is from beverly hills though",

      "text": "You're right to be skeptical. People from prestigious scholarships do not cold call applicants. If you applied for the Gates Scholarship (or some similar award), then it makes sense that they would be calling you. However, a good way to protect yourself from scammers is to not answer the phone if they call you, but to instead hang up, look up their phone number separately, and call them at that number. It is very easy to fake a phone number, and as you can imagine, scammers routinely fake a Beverly Hills phone number. I don't know where the offices of the Gates Scholarship are, but the Gates foundation is famously located in **Seattle** \\- so that's a red flag to me. \n\nI would use the contact us form on the Gates Scholarship page to reach out to them: [https://www.thegatesscholarship.org/contact-us](https://www.thegatesscholarship.org/contact-us)\n\nI would make sure to hear from them before giving any personal information over the phone.",

          "text": "I agree...this should be a really quick, easy but important call to verify authenticity for the Beverly Hills number. I was reading about GS awhile back and I think there were (\" 6-7\" satellites) in US. If the call is verified, please call them ASAP...I also experience phone anxiety, but this is no time to let it dominate. NOT ONE BIT! Good Luck!",
