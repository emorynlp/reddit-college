  "text": "i prepped a lot for this! i got ~10% of my school hooked on drugs and then reported them so the crime rate would increase. i also got a lot of my friend\u2019s parents to get divorced so the single parent numbers would increase. i also did extensive work decreasing the value of people\u2019s homes by having highway construction projects funded, fracking projects started, and having 200 registered sex offenders move into my neighborhood (thank you craigslist!). ~200 homes went down an average of $20k. is this enough prep to give me a good diversity score? will i have a shot at HYPSM??",

While the latter may not be a common situation, I\u2019d argue it\u2019s unjust for this inaccurate metric to benefit the wrong people when an accurate metric is already available in the form of stating your personal situation.

There\u2019s many reasons why the top colleges have more children from the top 1% than the bottom 60%, but a prominent one is the fact these rich kids can afford feeder schools.",

All it is is a separate score scaled from 1-100 based on 31 factors to illustrate the adversity you faced to get your score (1 is least adversity, 50 is average and 100 is most adversity). \n\nSo a 1500 with a 78 adversity score is more impressive to colleges than a 1500 with a 32 adversity score. The person with the 78 was less likely to do well based on a variety of external factors like income, neighborhood, school, parents\u2019 education levels, race etc. than the person who had the 32.",

ON AVERAGE Asian-Americans scored better than European Americans who scored better than Latino Americans and African-Americans. This lead to the restructuring of the test several times in order to focus its testing more on high school curricula.\n\nWhen I include race among the external factors that influence one\u2019s SAT score, I mean CollegeBoard knows the SAT is not absolutely 100% fair to students of all races. Some of it is due to systemic oppression against minority races in this country. But they know part of it is their fault and they aren\u2019t expecting the average Black and average White student to get the same score because they know their test has issues. The adversity score is there to highlight that issue with the test and to remind admissions of CB\u2019s situation.\n\nUpon further research, race is actually not one of the 31 criteria CB uses to form the Overall Disadvantage Level we call the \u201cadversity score.\u201d\nThese factors are listed in the table [here.](https://professionals.collegeboard.org/environmental-context-dashboard/detailed-data-description) \n\nHope that made sense",

                              "text": "Thanks for the response. It cleared up some things while opening up others. It seems that you support the new adversity score. I\u2019ll make it clear that although I\u2019m for the idea, I\u2019m against that collegeboard\u2019s version due to the way it is implemented. So with all that out of the way I have some questions. They may come off as attacking but they are honest questions.\n\nYou stated that the test is biased based on race. My question is how so? You stated that Asians score the highest while Europeans, Latinos, and Blacks scored lower. Wouldn't this be expected if you consider that the former group studies more than the latter?\n\nThe reason I asked the previous question about why you included race was because I interpreted you comment as follows: \n\nA student did poorly on the SAT because he didn't have resources (income), his school didn't give any attention to the test (school), crime in his neighborhood prevented him from peacefully being able to study (neighborhood), or his parents couldn't help him whatsoever (parents qualifications). If we use the same logic for race, it wouldn't make sense. How would the color of someone's skin contribute to how many points they get on a test? Again, this is not something you or I am saying. It is simply what comes to mind when you read that previous comment.\n\nFinally in response to your comment about collegeboard not being fair to students of all races, I would tend to disagree. Name me one advantage that a student of a certain race gets just for being that race (I don't want to get into the argument of resources being LINKED to race; just something that is STRICTLY due to skin color). You also mentioned systemic oppression in this country. Can you please elaborate on that because I don't really know of any system/institution that was made for oppressing a certain race. Also, how does CB know that a black student and a white student will get different scores due to the test having issues (and also what issues in particular are you speaking of). Is there something taught in schools that are predominantly white that is not taught in schools that are predominantly black?\n\nLooking forward to your response!",

For instance, every time some asked me about what I want to be, I tell them I want to pursue a career in medicine. Immediately they ask me if that\u2019s what I really want to do. I tell them yeah but I have a feeling they don\u2019t believe me. Reason is because where I\u2019m from, many people become doctors. \n\nI also want to add that certain cultures VALUE  education more than others. The parents have certain expectations. Some parents could care less. Kids are cool with it too. It\u2019s rare that you see a kids go against what they\u2019re expected to do.\n\nAlso, I know countless kids who go to a school that has 10x more resources than mine but the kids there end up having their own kids. You see 16 year old girls walking to school with their babies (the school actually has a daycare for the students\u2019 children). It\u2019s ridiculous to deny that this isn\u2019t a part of culture.",

Then there are two bar graphs, one for school and the other for neighborhood. I can\u2019t recall all of the categories but some of them are: crime, housing stability (vacant lots, rent vs purchase, etc), family stability (basically how many single/divorced households there are), education levels.....stuff along those lines. All of these categories are assigned a number, the number is determined by numerous factors, including some of the parameters mentioned above.\nThe graphs weren\u2019t broken down into specifics, and I could not see/tell what the factors that came into account were. \nIt would just say something like \u201chousing stability: 53\u201d\nBut I\u2019m assuming that there are numerous factors taken into account that are reflected in that number. AOs themselves don\u2019t need to hunt for that info, it\u2019s built into the algorithm of whatever platform they\u2019re using. The AO hinted that this sort of setup was not Yale-specific, all schools essentially had a similar system breaking down this information. This was why she claimed she was against the SAT adversity thing, because colleges already have built in systems that practically do the same things",

The SAT is still standardized, it just has another score attached to it. Doesn't make a difference to me if that score were smacked onto the SAT or just given to colleges directly, the result is the same. Also, a standardized test doesn't tell the full story without including some context about the student's life. On average, a student from a poorer area will often have to work harder and be smarter than one from a richer area to get the same score on the SAT thanks to the disadvantages they face. Without some easy means of getting some information about the context of a student's life, what a student's SAT score says about their intelligence and work ethic is more vague. That makes it less useful in college admissions. At the end of the day, life presents many special circumstances and to really examine a student's potential, it is a good idea to try to control for those circumstances. I don't see why you think trying to eliminate these circumstances and get a better picture of someone's true potential is such a bad idea. It helps us work towards more of a meritocratic system in college admissions where the bias towards people with more privilige and potentially less aptitude and work ethic is lessened, which I think is a good thing.",
