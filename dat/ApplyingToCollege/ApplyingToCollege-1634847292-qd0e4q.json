  "text": "I've sacrificed so fucking much. My physical health, my social life, my mental health, my hobbies, just to do good in school. I've slept 5 hours nights for the past year and a half. I've stopped hanging out with my friends so I could ace all my tests. I stopped playing video games, stopped watching movies and TV, stopped watching YouTube, to get straight A's and take 16 ap classes. I've gone home at 7 for the last 2 years to be on varsity athletics. But for what?\n\nI have no leadership. I'm not going to be captain on any teams. I'm not going to win any national level competitions. I'm not going ever go to state. I'm going to do jack shit. Nothing ever goes my way even if I put all my effort. There's nothing I can do anymore.\n\nI'm not going to get in.\n\nI'm just so done with it all. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. \n\nThere's only two things left that I can do. And I don't like either.",
