  "text": "Uhhh so it's 11/7, and Yale hasn't received any of the documents my school sent yet... I submitted my application mid-October, but my school messed up sending the documents at first. I had to email them about it, and they had to resend them November 2 because they somehow didn't go through the first time. Will my application still be considered? AAAAAH",
