  "text": "The college I want to go to I want direct admit. Would this be a good excuse? So I couldn\u2019t take the SAT/ACT because last year my state closes almost all of their testing centers. This fall most of them were closed but the open ones were really far away. Now I can\u2019t take it because I\u2019m being precautious about the delta variant.",
