      "text": "Most people apply into a major and are admitted in the context of those applicants. There\u2019s limited mobility into some majors at some campuses (eg, EE & CS at Berkeley, Bio at UCSD). I have friends who decided to apply to less selective majors because their profile was borderline and they really wanted to be on a certain campus. Otherwise apply to some less competitive campuses if you have a highly selective major.",
