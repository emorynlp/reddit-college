  "text": "Was always tired of the person who is biologically my father. He just called me 'useless'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Story time:** \n\nI applied to PennState as an International student for early action. The university was supposed to receive my IELTS English proficiency scores by 5th November but my IDP IELTS testing center did not send the scores on time. In fact, its 16th today and they still haven't sent the scores. \n\nI sent an email to the undergraduate office at PennState explaining the situation and that it's not at all my fault that the center is high on fucking crack and adamant on ruining my chances in the uni (ofc I didnt exactly bring about this meaning). Got a reply a while back saying that there is nothing that can be done and that I basically would not be considered for Early Action. \n\nI told my dad about this and he asked me for my PennState application login id. I was serving myself some food at the time. I told him that I will tell him my login ID right after I get the food onto my plate. He kept insisting until I very politely told him once again to wait since I do not remember the ID and password as I made a different one for each university. \n\nOnce again, he did not listen to me and started screaming at me so I screamed back and told him to have a little bit of patience. He ironically instructed me to lower my voice like I'm his pet so I just started to walk away. During my walk to my room, he kept screaming at me and saying god knows what but what stuck with me, is the last thing I heard him say before I slammed my door, \"You are useless\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am screamed at, by him, for the smallest things on a daily basis. Ignorance has been my bestie since many years now. But being called useless as a result of something completely out of my control, now that shit sticks.  \n\nI just wanted to type it all out and hopefully get some advice on both my 'daddy issues' and whether or not there really is nothing I can do about my application to PennState.",

      "text": "Parents think their kids are leading perfect happy lives and so do the children about their parents. Your father might be having a very bad day at work (maybe his bosses are shouting at him all day) or he has financial problems that he cannot share. Parents think kids just need to study and do well at school - of course, there is more than what meets the eye. So best thing is to be calm, accommodating and adjust. Anyway, only have few months of this as you will be leaving to college hopefully.",
