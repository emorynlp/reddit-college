  "text": "I am an international student currently in a gap year and probably applying for early application and fall 2023. So, I recently got an internship offer and the condition is I have to commit full time for 5 months till April. So as it is full time I won't be able to give time to my preparation. That's my problem and I am looking for suggestions.\nI am planning to take SAT on June and also expecting to get language test waiver. I also have many application preparation left which I won't be able to do during 5 months.",
