      "text": "If you want to serve in the military, it's a pretty good deal (or can be - varies by service).   If that isn't what you want to do when you graduate, there are other ways to consider paying for college.\n\nApplying for the scholarship doesn't commit you at all, so if you are thinking about it but aren't 100% sure it is ok to go for it.  I think most if not all of them even let you drop out before the second year if you decide the military isn't for you.",
