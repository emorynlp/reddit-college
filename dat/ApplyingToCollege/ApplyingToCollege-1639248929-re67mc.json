  "title:": "Decisions Come Out the Same Week as No Way Home",
  "text": "Just realized that college decisions for schools like Harvard, Stanford, MIT, etc. will come out the same week as Spider-Man No Way Home and I\u2019m watching it next Friday. College decisions will either turn me into Bully Maguire or make me wanna say pizza time, either way, the enjoyment of No Way Home rests on the shoulders of these decisions.",
