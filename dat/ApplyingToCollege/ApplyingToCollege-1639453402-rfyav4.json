  "text": "Ugh okay I just need to blow off some steam. \n\nMy early decision result comes out in less than 3 days, and I am *very* anxiously waiting. I feel like I have the support of all of my close friends and girlfriend but when it comes to my parents it\u2019s a different story.\n\nMy parents understand the binding and financial commitment that comes ED (or else I wouldn\u2019t have applied) and they were generally on board with my plan. However, as it gets closer, I can\u2019t help but feel like they are hoping that I don\u2019t get in and choose a school that gives me a lot of aid or scholarships, because my ED will probably not give me as much. Today I received nearly a full ride from a lower ranked school, which I am so unbelievably grateful for. However, my mom keeps making remarks about \u201cmoney leftover for masters\u201d and saying things about financials in general. It\u2019s lowkey stressing me out because I feel as though this could have been prevented. If she is that worried about me not receiving aid, she could have not allowed me to apply ED. She and my dad agreed to the binding commitment in September. Also it is important to note that attending my ED school with full tuition would not be a huge burden on my family, and I also recognize that is an opportunity most people don\u2019t have. However, I feel like if I get in, I am going to be over the moon while my parents will be thinking about the other merit scholarship opportunities I could have had, which would be a shitty feeling. \n\nAnyone else experience this? I\u2019m really not trying to sound ungrateful or resentful to my parents; I understand their concern, but I will be saddened if they are not as happy about my result as I am (if I get in, of course).",

      "text": "I relate to this honestly. Like obviously you don\u2019t want to seem ungrateful, but if they were that uncomfortable with the cost of the ED school\u2026 they should have just said that. Now it\u2019s this weird pressure if you *do* get into your dream school. \nGood luck over the next couple of days! Hope it works out",

      "text": "Hi.  I\u2019m writing as a parent who didn\u2019t make this mistake \u2014 my kids are attending a T25 in-state school \u2014 but for many parents and students, the actual cost of attendance doesn\u2019t truly become real until the student starts receiving acceptances. At that point, many parents start to realize that their student may very well want to attend law school, medical school, or get their PhD. And you also start to think about the fun opportunities that you\u2019d like to provide to your student, such as study abroad, alternative spring break, and full membership in college clubs and activities. So while I feel for you, because it\u2019s hard to know your parents may be having regrets, realize that some of those regrets may be based on their realization that you might have a richer academic experience, including grad school, were you to attend a less expensive undergraduate institution. Best of luck to you in your decision making.",
