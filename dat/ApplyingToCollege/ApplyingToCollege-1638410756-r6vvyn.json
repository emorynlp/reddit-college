  "text": "So I applied to UNC Chapel Hill EA, and I keep getting emails from them saying to log into my applicant portal. Since decisions come out in January, I haven\u2019t bothered to log in until today.\n\nTurns out, UNC won\u2019t consider your SAT scores unless you self report them, and you have to do that through the applicant portal. I submitted my scores today, but it may be too late.\n\nMy mom has been fantasizing about me going to UNC-CH for pretty much my whole life, so I hope I don\u2019t get rejected for this. (I can literally walk to UNC-CH from my house, we live that close)",
