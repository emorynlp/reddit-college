  "text": "I was struggling w my \u201cwhy usc/this major\u201d essay and was doing more in depth research on the school and while i found several opps related to my major, I discovered this gem of a research program that\u2019s tailored for specifically what I want to accomplish & address in my career. I was so happy that I found it cuz it actually makes me so excited to write abt the school now cuz this program fits in perfectly with literally my overarching career goal. \n\nAnyways I just wanted to share that small win with u guys. Moral of the story is to not just put a school on ur list but to go in depth when u do research on a school cuz when u find that gem of a program that speaks to u it feels great \ud83e\udd20\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe",

You should show you've planned very well for college and what you want from it and why.  \n\n\nGood luck!",

I would also recommend emailing admissions reps and asking for the same thing. Good luck!",

Also, I sometimes watch YouTube vids from students @ the schools I\u2019m interested in and some talk abt how they were able to explore their interests.",
