GPA, SAT, and Course rigor are never \u201ceye-catching\u201d parts of an application unless they are really low that is. AOs view these stats as a sort of pre-requisite for admittance. And a 1560 meets that requirement. You really should focus on ECs, keeping good grades, and essays now. Studying to improve a 1560 will not improve your application.\n\nThat being said, if you want to retake it, you might improve marginally. Just don\u2019t waste time studying and understand that from an admissions perspective, anything >1550 is pretty much a 1600.",
