      "text": "Being an international student applying to US colleges, I'll try to explain my reasons for applying to the US.\n\n1. Education in my country isn't good. We just have 3-4 governmental universities. Since it's run by governmental officials, most of the fund allocated for the educational sector probably goes inside some politicians' pocket.  The universities here are really old and the curriculum is outdated. \n2. We apply to the US specifically because we have hopes of getting in. Yes, it's extremely difficult to get into US colleges as an international student but it's not impossible. Sure, Canada and other countries could be way cheaper but they don't have enough scholarships for international students and they don't give need-based aid either. So yes, the US is our last option. \n3. I feel like if I stay here, I won't ever be independent and free. People are extremely close-minded and we HAVE to live with our parents until we die. And if you identify as a female then you WILL get married after a few years and WILL BE forced to LITERALLY serve your in-laws all your life and live with your in-laws. If we refuse to obey these patriarchal rules, then the blame comes to our family for not raising us well. We can't dress the way we want, we can't eat the way we want, we can't live the way we want. So, I just want to live a better life, even if it's only for 4 years.  (this turned out to be a rant)",

I really hope she gets into the best place (she needs a lot of aid, probably full) that she aims for.",

Pretty much no other country has nearly as many full-tuition/ride opportunities for low income internationals & I think that's a big factor to consider.\n\nYes, all the other factors like economic opportunity, diversity, etc definitely matter but they're available in many other developed countries as well. For many students, it's more about leaving their country for better education rather than choosing the US specifically, but financial restrictions often mean that American colleges offering aid are the only ones they can consider. In my case, I definitely prefer the British/European style of education far more over the US liberal-arts approach. However, the best UK offer I got was like ~$5.5k/yr (\u00a34k) in scholarships lol, whereas in the US, my tuition is fully funded plus I get a stipend. No brainer there. \n\nAs for your other question, Canada is definitely getting a huuuuuge influx of international students these days. The UK has been a very popular choice for over a century now lol & many European countries are on the rise recently like the Netherlands, Finland, Germany and others. The reasons are almost always the same regardless of destination, but the ones who can actually afford to choose where they go are either extremely meritable or very strong financially.",
