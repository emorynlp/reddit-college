      "text": "For EA, generally 5/1. Any deposit is placed when you commit, and is usually not refundable. There are no advantages to paying a deposit earlier than the deadline. Depending on the college, there may be a separate housing deposit which you may want to pay if the college starts to assign housing before 5/1.\n\nFor ED, very shortly after you receive your FA package.",
