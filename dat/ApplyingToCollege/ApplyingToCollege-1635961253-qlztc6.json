  "text": "Hey everyone!  So I've been extremely busy working 40+ hours a week, along with taking multiple rigorous classes at my Community College regarding Bio, along with multiple volunteer sources.  Ive been working on my Personal Insight Questions for approximately the last 2 months, and wanted to know how much it matters regarding TAG Transfer students as I'm really stressing about it.  My GPA is 3.75 and I met all the requirements.  I've heard some people say UCI specifically doesn't look into the Personal Insight Questions since they just look if you completed all your requirements for UCI TAG.  Others have said, it's very important and very crucial.  \n\nThanks.",
