  "text": "I have to do my essay and to explain what I\u2019d bring to the Uni, I want to write details about the IR program. \n\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but it\u2019s offered by the \u201cFrederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies\u201d, which is housed within CAS right? \n\n\nQ1-So do you all recommend basing my essay on CAS or the Frederick school in particular? \n\n\nQ2- What do you think about this:I thought I\u2019d write about extra curricular based on CAS and about IR based on the IR link: found these two links about the IR major, which leads to Q3\n\nQ3: Which one is the latest/better one to use to base my Major(IR) related details on? The second one seems to have more details while the first one is more precise, but they seem similar.\n1- https://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/academics/undergraduate/international-relations/\n\n2- https://www.bu.edu/academics/cas/programs/international-relations/ba/",
