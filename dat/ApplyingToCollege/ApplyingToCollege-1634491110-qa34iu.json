  "title:": "Is it bad to use the word \"meme\" in an essay?",
  "text": "So for one of my supplemental essays I'm writing about why I like chess, and one of the surprising things I found about the game was the vibrant online internet community with a large variety of different content, including lots of humor and memes (see r/AnarchyChess for examples). I'm not really sure how to describe memes without using that word, but I'm not sure if this would be considered unprofessional or hurt my essay. Do you guys think it would be okay and AOs would understand? If not, what are some good synonyms for meme that I could use?",
