  "text": "When I first started filling out my common app, I was class rank 59. I filled out my entire common app besides essays, then about 3 weeks later copy and pasted my essay in common app and submitted to UF and FSU. About 2 days later I filled out the ssar and on my unofficial transcript I had moved to rank 62. I submitted this number to them on the ssar. Is it bad that I submitted my class rank as 59 on common app and 62 on ssar? Will they think I am lying?",
