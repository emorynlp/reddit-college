  "title:": "Engineering before medicine",
  "text": "I\u2019m doing a Bachelor of Science but was unsure if I should major in Electrical or Biomedical engineering as my undergrad. I have a guaranteed placement into medicine after my undergrad from my Uni, and I\u2019m looking to be a neurologist. I\u2019ve always been fascinated with brain-computer interfaces and neurotech in general (I might do a concurrent degree in computing). People tell me biomedical is more fitting, but electrical is more specialised and you learn more since it\u2019s harder (apparently). So, what should I major in, electrical or biomedical?\n\nPlease note, I want to pursue medicine in the future, but who knows, I might want a career change and do something related to neurotech at 50 years old. Which major would be more helpful in this sense?",

      "text": "If you\u2019re planning to complete the pre-med requirements + a bachelors degree in engineering in the regular four years, then biomedical makes more sense logistically because there is more overlap between the pre-med + biomedical engineering requirements as compared to pre-med + electrical.\n\nBiomedical Engineering is multi-disciplinary by its nature so you should have a few required electrical classes as a Biomedical major. And maybe you could minor in Electrical, too?",
