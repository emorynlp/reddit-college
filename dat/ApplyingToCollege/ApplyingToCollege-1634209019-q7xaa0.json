  "text": "obviously quality>quantity (like I wouldn't submit something if it wasn't quality) but assuming everything is high quality, I still do not know if it's strategic to write a lot? Like if they have to rush through reading all of it maybe that would be bad. (But I guess this assumes they have a set time limit per applicant). I think I'm overthinking. lol",
