  "text": "i\u2019m making finishing touches on my personal statement but then realized some words i used might be risky. \n\nI used the phrase \u201cshut up\u201d a couple of times. not in a negative way, but i\u2019m worried it\u2019s too informal and considered a form of profanity by some people. \n\nshould i delete it? sorry if this is vague, but my essay is kind of personal so i didn\u2019t give too much detail.",
