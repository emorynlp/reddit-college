  "text": "So I applied for 4 colleges, and submitted the SAT scores on last Thursday. I received an email from the admissions people from one of the colleges saying tjat they don't have my SAT scores yet. And i was like huh? How come since its been a couple days already, so I checked college board and it said \"date sent \"today's date\"\" and i was like whaaa? So I emailed the admissions ppl like hey it said It sent today when I actually paid and stuff last week, and the guy was like, \"you can just put test optional then\" and so I put test optional and asked him if he got it, and he was like oh its from a diff part of the admissions department so they'll confirm it in 5-7 business days...BUT in 5 days it'll be Nov 1, and that's the deadline for early decision. \n\n\nThat whole thing was kinda stressful.",
