  "title:": "NYAS is a little shady, no cap.",
  "text": "A lot of applicants, especially in Asia put NYAS (New York Academy of Sciences) as a major E.C on their Commonapp and yeah, it does sound good to be a part of an organization that had some of the biggest names in STEM in the past. HOWEVER, SOMETHING IS ALARMING. I applied to NYAS' junior academy for the year 2021-22, I even got invited to a few virtual talks with them. I was pretty confident that my application and essays were good enough to get me in. BUT BOOM, I WAIT FOR DAYS AFTER EVERYONE GETS THEIR DECISIONS. No reply. I try asking GSA support, they say they'll check my file. Another week, no response. Finally, after a lot of pestering, they said the following in official language:\n\"Hey bruh I think you're not eligible cause you're like way over 17, we didn't even touch your file lmfao\"\n\nNow note, my D.O.B is literally 6th November 2003, which means I'm not gonna be 18 until November. NYAS has the policy of being 17 till September of the admissions cycle, which is what I qualify for, duh. Well, I send in my D.O.B proof and they stop replying once and for all.\n\nAnother thing, almost everyone ik got into NYAS Junior Academy? I know someone who is 18 and still got in? Like that's not possible for the 10% acceptance they talk about, how is every single person getting in. Thankfully, I'm not the only person to notice this trend. I just wanna warn any potential applicants that their system is rigged and they absolutely have no cap on how many students to admit. Don't be disheartened if you don't get in!\n\n(I feel really fucking stupid for wasting so much time on their essays lol)",
