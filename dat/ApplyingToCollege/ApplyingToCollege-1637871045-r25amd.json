  "title:": "QUESTION: Beginning my essay with \"What the fuck\"",
  "text": "Okay yeah, I know what you're thinking from that title, but hear me out:\n\nI want to write an entrepreneurship supplemental essay centered around the movie Risky Business, which, if you've seen the movie, there's a line in there where the protagonist says \"Sometimes you just have to say 'what the fuck'\". The context to this line being his idea to create a brothel out of his house while his parents are out of town.\n\nConsidering the explicit nature of this film, is it even okay to go through with this idea? And if so, how should I write the expletive in my essay?  \n\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geDCtBQeN8c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geDCtBQeN8c)",

I'm old enough to be familiar with (and appreciate) the movie, but it probably isn't appropriate for your college app.\n\nP.S.
