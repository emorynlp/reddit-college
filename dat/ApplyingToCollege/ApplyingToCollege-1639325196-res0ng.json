      "text": "It depends on where you apply! If the schools you applied to use the IDOC you can check that to see if you're missing anything (it tells you what you need to upload). If they don't use IDOC, check your application portal once you have access. They should give you additional information there. If you still can't find anything check the financial aid tab on their website or reach out to their office. Most of them are super nice people! I hope this helped, and good luck!",
