  "title:": "Is \"Northern California\" classified as a city/community or a state for awards on the UC App's Awards & Activities section?",
  "text": "I won something a couple years back for a competition that encompasses most of California except for the Los Angeles and San Diego areas. It represents Northern California, so it's not technically a state award, but city/community also doesn't seem quite right, since it includes everything from the Oregon border down to Santa Barbara. I'm not sure what I should put it down as on the UC Application, since there's nothing in between city/community and state for an award's level of recognition. Should I play it safe and mark it down as city/community or do you think marking it as a state competition would be okay? Thanks!",
