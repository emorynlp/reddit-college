  "text": "Hi! I have a quick question about the activities section. I am aiming for T10s and I have no idea which ones to choose for this section. Should I include more ECs that I did at school (clubs, student council, etc) or outside of school (research, internships, leadership programs etc)?? I am def adding school club activities which I received an award for. Idk what to do with the majority of ECs that received no special recognitions (like awards)! \n\n\nThanks!",
