  "text": "My mother is very adamant that I stay in Texas with her and all of our relatives. She even compromised that she\u2019ll let me study in a different city and that I won\u2019t have to be at home (I did get accepted by a state college from a city she approves of). \n\nI\u2019m trying for a school in Connecticut, I wanted to experience what it\u2019s like up north. Plus the school have really good need based aid and I believe they would fund most, if not all, of my tuition since my family is low income. Definitely more money than any state college would offer me. \n\nMy mother\u2019s arguments:\n1) Connecticut is not diverse like Texas; I could be \u201chate crimed\u201d or face prejudice \n2) driving in the snow is difficult\n3) there won\u2019t be many ethic food in Connecticut \n4) if there were any emergency, there would be no relatives to help me\n5) single mom and only child house hold; she\u2019ll want me close when needed\n\nI see where she is coming from\u2026but I just want that typical college experience in a new area away from home and most importantly (maybe) DEBT FREE education.\nPlease help with counter arguments!\n\n[[ I applied early decision to the school in Connecticut ]]",

      "text": "Hey! As a parent of a senior I get wanting to keep my children close, but it is important to be able to stand on your two feet.  \n\nTo address the actual comments:\n\n1. I think CT is pretty liberal and the campus will be likely diverse. You will be fine in the sense of being safe. But I would tell your mom that part of growing up is being exposed to new ideas and experiences. \n\n2. You likely won\u2019t be driving. I went to college in MA coming from CA. Senior year I brought a car. Yes, driving in snow is different.  But again, you probably won\u2019t bring a car.  \n\n3.  Pretty sure there will be places with different foods. But not a good reason to not pick a college. \n\n4. Emergencies are tough, but that is when you really learn how to be adult. Now you do have the support from the campus. But I remember being in college 3,000 miles from home and my wisdom teeth got infected. I had to find a dentist and figure it out. Yes, my parents helped via the phone (back when there were calling cards and long distance was like 25 cents a minute) but I had to get myself there and take care of myself in recovery. It is part of being an adult. You can figure it out. \n\n5. I get it that your mom will miss you. I will miss my daughter, but you need to live your life. Promise to come home for holidays. FaceTime with her a lot. \n\nMy daughter\u2019s ED school is 3,000 miles away. I will absolutely cry my eyes out when she leaves, but as a parent the ability to see your child thrive independently means you did your job. \n\nBest of luck!",

      "text": ">Connecticut is not diverse like Texas; I could be \u201chate crimed\u201d or face prejudice\n\nConnecticut isn't the most diverse state, but it's one of the most progressive states as a whole. It's one of the states with the highest percentage of residents who support LGBTQ+ rights, and although there's some conservative areas of Connecticut, particularly some of the rural areas and some \"old money wealth\" areas close to NYC, it's a solidly accepting state. Racism is obviously prevalent, but it's prevalent in Texas as well. Anywhere you go in the USA, you face the risk of racism; some places more so than others.\n\nCollege campuses are generally pretty accepting in the Northeast.\n\n>driving in the snow is difficult\n\nConnecticut is really good at clearing away snow. It's not like somewhere in the South, where an inch of snow devastates entire cities. Because Northern states get so much snow, they're great at clearing away snow. They're not perfect, of course, but they're still good at clearing away snow. And chances are, you might have public transportation nearby in lieu of a car.\n\n>there won\u2019t be many ethic food in Connecticut\n\nMisconception; lots of great ethnic food in Connecticut. Is it going to be like NYC or LA in terms of food variety? No. But are there going to be a decent variety of Indian, Japanese, Italian, Mexican, etc restaurants, especially in urban areas? Yes.\n\n\\-----\n\n>if there were any emergency, there would be no relatives to help me  \n>  \n>single mom and only child house hold; she\u2019ll want me close when needed\n\nTwo valid reasons. It's hard; this one and #4 are really tricky and personal, especially with you being an only child with a single mother. I'm sure you two are really close and these two points made by your mom are the most personal to you so I'm not going to provide input here.\n\n\\-----\n\nBest of luck. :)",

      "text": "1. Connecticut may not be diverse, but it is more progressive. Not sure which school this is, but college campuses (particularly in the northeast) tend to be very forward. I'm comfortable saying that you will likely be safe at school.\n2. Depending on the school, first-year students are not allowed cars, but once you do get a car on campus, it will be relatively easy to find a winter driving course at a local driving school. As someone from Ohio, I can say that driving in the snow isn't actually as difficult as it seems, but that's a moot point.\n3. This may be true, but depending on the school, you might have good dining options. Some schools have several different ethnic/regional options in the dining hall. Many residence halls also have kitchens in the common room, so if you're really missing a particular comfort food, just make it!\n4. Again, true. College campuses have a lot of resources designed to account for this. For example, my school provides a student-operated transportation service to both routine medical appointments and to urgent care. \n5. I honestly can't speak to this specific family situation, but you can always offer to come home on breaks and make sure to keep in touch. Have your mom get a pet too!\n\nMy best advice is to visit the school if you've not already, particularly so you can see what the dining options are and find out about campus resources. Good luck!",

Please tell her that hate crimes can occur anywhere, but honestly, CT is about as liberal of a state as you can get. It's also relatively safe, and pretty close to NY, where you can get on a flight and get home to TX pretty quickly. Good luck!",

      "text": "To speak to your first point \u2014 you won\u2019t face a hate crime, or explicit prejudice, in all likelihood. That does not really fly in the wealthy northeast, and that especially does not fly in academia.\n\nWhat you may find is more\u2026 subliminal bigotry. There are many, many white people in the NE who are nominally liberal but out of touch, whether it\u2019s letting their biases slip in a million ways or speaking aggressively about race in an overwhelming, corporate DEI lingo manner. In that sense, what I have heard from minority friends often is that going to a PWI can wear you down by making you feel like a fish out of water. But at the very least, I doubt you will be assaulted or called epithets and such.",
