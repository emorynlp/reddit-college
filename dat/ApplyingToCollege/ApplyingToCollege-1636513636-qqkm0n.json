  "text": "So basically I applied ED to an Ivy League school and I would say I'm decently qualified. I submitted the optional resume and it was my first time ever making a resume and I didn't include the dates of my activities because they were listed on my activities list on the Common App and I also made my resume 2 pages long. Would I get rejected for something like this? Should I send the school an updated resume?",

Are there ways that submitting an optional resume would have more of a negative effect than a positive effect? How commonly does a resume have a positive effect on applications?",

First, there is no preset guideline for resumes (except for UT Austin), so without specifying what they\u2019re after, they can\u2019t penalize you. Second, an updated resume will just be more clutter for them to sift through when they probably won\u2019t even look at your first resume.",
