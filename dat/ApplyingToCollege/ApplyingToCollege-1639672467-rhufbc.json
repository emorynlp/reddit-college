  "title:": "would this go under honors in education section or journalism/publication in activities section - common app",
  "text": "over the summer i was a winner of a national poetry contest and it got published in a magazine\n\nsince this isn\u2019t really an activity in itself and was a one-time deal i\u2019m not sure where to put it, because the activities section with journalism/publication asks for hours/weeks and expects it to be a continuous thing which i assume is leaned more towards research that leads up to a publication or work for a certain journalism company.\n\nthe honors section \u201csays honors related to academic achievements\u201d, but i\u2019m not sure if it falls under this (it\u2019s to do with literature so i considered that maybe it could)? there\u2019s even an academic option in the activities portion.\n\njust want to make sure so i don\u2019t mess up my application.\nthanks for reading",
