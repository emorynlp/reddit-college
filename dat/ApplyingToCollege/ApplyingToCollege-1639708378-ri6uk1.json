  "text": "Okay so I'm a sophomore and today's the final exam of our 1st sem. My prof messaged me that I can't take the exam because I dropped his class.\n\nThis is my first time experiencing this and I don't really know how to deal with it but is dropping a class bad? How would it affect my overall grades and credit? Does that mean I'll just have to retake it next school year? I feel like I should be more worried than I do now so any advice/answers would really help. \n\nThank you in advance!",
