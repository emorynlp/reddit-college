      "text": "> My career interest is Stock Investor/Start-up, and I prefer to study Finance major or Global Business with a Finance concentration.\n\nCould you clarify exactly what you mean? \"Stock investor\" is not exactly a role. You could work in a role that involves trading (S&T, quant, portfolio management, etc.), or you could work in a role that helps companies go public and such (ECM IB), you could also invest in startups (VC), etc. but you should probably figure out what it is that you actually wanna do. \n\n> Am I right to have the mindset that I should study in NYC (where there is Wall Street) and a university that has a high rank in Finance?\n\nRanking in finance doesn't matter much nor does studying in NYC. Outside of Wall Street being an antiquated metonymy (only RBC and GS IIRC are still in the area, most banks moved to Midtown), most target schools are not in NYC because there's a relative paucity of top schools in the area (the only bonafide targets are Columbia and NYU, Cornell if you're willing to go upstate, and then if you look outside of NYC you have Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Penn, etc. all the other targets in a 3-4 hour radius of NYC). \n\nThat being said, being located in NYC certainly doesn't hurt. \n\n> Is Fordham a good choice? (Internship opportunities, connection with investment funds, etc.)\n\nI've heard that Fordham is on the up and know someone who broke into IB from Fordham; certainly isn't impossible but there are other, less selective options that place well into banking. \n\n> Are there any schools that I should apply to (EA2, RD)?\n\nJust google Wall Street target schools and then it'll give you a general list of targets and semi-targets, from there sort and look for what you think you can a) get into, b) afford, and c) would like. Dartmouth and Columbia might both be targets but they're very different vibes.",
