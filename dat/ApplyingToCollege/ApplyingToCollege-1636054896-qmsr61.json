      "text": "AFAIK this question is only used by Cal Poly and they give you a couple of points for it in their system. They aren\u2019t going to really check and if you\u2019ve taken on leadership roles you can probably feel ok about saying yes\n\nIf you really want Cal Poly I\u2019d suggest going to College Confidential to see if they\u2019ve cracked the new code for calculating MCA without the SAT score, and check the points required for your major. \n\nFor CSUs admission is by major, with the most popular/practical ones requiring the highest GPA. Something like CS or nursing or engineering is really tough to get into, especially if you live outside the area. It\u2019s pretty easy to get in for, say, sociology. Pick your campuses and majors wisely. Here\u2019s how it works at SJSU\nhttps://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/freshmen-impaction-results/index.php",

              "text": "If it exceeds it by a fair amount, probably. Most of the CSUs have always done impaction scores based on a combination of SAT/ACT + grades with a couple of points for being local. Last year they dumped test scores for the first time. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they tweak the formulas a little bit, and it\u2019s also possible for a major to somehow randomly be more popular than in the past or to have a bigger score jump than you\u2019d think (one year I noticed child development at Cal Poly had a higher cutoff than some engineering programs - what\u2019s with that?). So if you just cleared the point total for last year I\u2019d consider it a target. If you are well over the impaction score then yeah, almost certainly a slam dunk safety. \n\nNice thing about California is that if you don\u2019t get in the first time you can collect 60 transferable community college credits (APs count!) and try again. If you research which classes and GPA they want to see and shoot for that (withdrawing and retaking classes if needed), you can have guaranteed admission almost everywhere except the top 3 UCs. Although it\u2019s harder if you really want a competitive major like CS.\n\nThis is something to think about. https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/transfer-requirements/uc-transfer-programs/transfer-admission-guarantee-tag.html There are guaranteed admission programs for the CSUs as well but I\u2019m less familiar with those. Most of my CSU students though were transfers saving money by doing GE at CCs.",
