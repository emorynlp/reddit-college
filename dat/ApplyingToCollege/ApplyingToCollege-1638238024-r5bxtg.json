  "text": "hello hello so if at one point I have a sentence along the lines of \"my parents gave me the nickname 'insert nickname',\" would I capitalize it?? Quite confused on this one... the nickname works in the sentence as if it weren't a nickname if that makes sense, like it flows because it starts with 'the' and idk if it needs to still be capitalized.\n\nthanks for any help!!",
