      "text": "As someone who lives very close to Duke, maybe I can give you some reasons to dislike the area... (I've only toured the school once in middle school, and I don't really have much to say about it)\n\n* Durham isn't doing so hot dealing with crime right now. We have shootings in Downtown on a pretty consistent basis, and local schools have had multiple lock outs (its barely been second quarter) because police chases keep getting way too close to campus. Sure, Durham isn't the safest place ever, but this year is absolutely ridiculous considering we've had 3 or so lock outs and it's barely halfway through the year. ALSO, we have a huge 911 dispatcher shortage right now, so wait times can be up to 30 minutes for emergency calls. Not sure if this will be solved by the time you may matriculate, but times are rough.\n* People asking for money (homeless are not) are everywhere, both in and out of Downtown. Every street block you'll find someone with a cardboard sign asking for food, money, etc. Most of the time they're chill and respectful, but I literally was just at a Cookout on Friday night trying to grab some food and this homeless guy asked me for cash. I gave him my change and talked about respecting life on the streets and staying away from drugs. Dude immediately transitioned to asking if I had a husband (I'm a 5'0\", 80-90lb petite Asian teen) and if I could give him a ride to the inn down the street. Legged out of there, came back \\~10 mins later and saw him hassling another Asian woman with the same story, motive, etc. There's also Fake Violin guy who pretends to play on the violin but is actually projecting music, claiming he has a family to feed (there's an article about how this scam is repeated in other cities as well). Scam or not, they're a characteristic of Durham.\n* If you are feminine looking you will absolutely get catcalled by randos walking on the street. They will have no shame. And they will only do it when you are alone. And if you are a minority, there's a 50/50 chance they'll throw a slur out there like it's nothing more than a bag of crisps. \n* Onto Duke: Duke is borderline cult here, oml. People simp for either Duke sports or Duke college, and like everyone and their mama have gone to Duke. So if you're going, expect a LOT of legacy students. Duke runs some of our major healthcare and energy centers, so Durham is deeply intertwined with Duke, creating a codependence that may or may not be favorable to you. Duke also espouses \"clean energy\" while also simultaneously polluting the area by sponsoring fracking, so... yeah. And during the pandemic, they closed a lot of venues-- some of them made sense like the Nasher Museum of Art, but they kept the Duke Botanical Gardens (an outdoor, relatively distant area) closed for a looooooooong time. The visitor cafe is still closed iirc lmao, but even before the pandemic it was poorly staffed. \n* If you don't have a car, you're going to have a hard time. The bus system (GoDurham) works alright but it's tedious, long, and sometimes runs earlier than usual so you miss your stop. Having a car makes traveling places much more convenient, but expensive. Though the immediate area around Duke is convenient for late night Mexican food crawls (Cosmic Cantina) or bubble tea (MogeTee) there's a lot of shady places for necessities that get real dangerous once the sun sets. \n* The area gets HUMID and HOT during the summer. Winters are mild with little snow. But spring/pollen season is AWFUL. The sky will literally collect a yellow haze from how much pollen there is in the air. Entire cars and streets will be blanketed in yellow pollen and you will have to slough them off yourself! They'll collect in these mucusy puddles on the sidewalk and if you have allergies, good fucking luck. \n* Durham may be a blue city in a red area, but you will absolutely find MAGA-nuts here and the Westboro Baptist Church visits the area to \"protest\" too... luckily, Durhamites know how to counter protest. You really just need to avoid politics until you're sure you're safe. \n\nThe campus is genuinely gorgeous, especially during spring. Let me know if you need any more discouragement, but going to college is so much more than staying on campus. Durham is a beautiful place with such a wide variety of people from various cultures that have made their homes here, but with rising prices of everything, it's not worth going into major debt for. You can always transfer or go to Duke for graduate school.",
