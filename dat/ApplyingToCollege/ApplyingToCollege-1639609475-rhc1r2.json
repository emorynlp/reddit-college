  "text": "I think the number one piece of advice people get when asking for advice on college essays is to just be genuine and be yourself, but I really don't know how without just saying stuff that tanks my admissions chances. I think I've totally lost the ability to talk about who I am - all I can think of is whether talking about something sits on the good side or bad side of the admissions officer reading my essay. I don't know what I like, I don't know what I care about, I'm not especially interested in anything, and nothing makes me especially happy or excited. \n\nSometimes, I feel like I shouldn't be applying to college anyways if college is filled with students who have something that they actually want to study or at least have some sort of genuine personality. However, I know I'll regret it if I don't since I've \"worked so hard\" to get to the profile that I have now, but I can't write any of my essays without feeling like I'm half lying when I talk about how \"excited\" I am about subjects I don't really care for. It's not even that I solely dislike the areas of study I kind of pigeonholed myself into with my extracurriculars, it's that I'm not attracted to studying anything at all. I just feel so stuck and discouraged and I have nothing to write on my essays when my head is literally blank. I know what I *should* write to be an attractive applicant - all about how I'm so passionate about the subjects I've done some work with outside of school, how I care for the community, how I'm a 3D person - but it just makes me feel so guilty when I'm writing things I don't believe are completely true.\n\nI'm so confused - is this normal? All I see in the people around me at school and online are people who have at least some things they're interested in pursuing further, and at the very least, have some issues that they care about. How am I supposed to write about what kind of person I am and what things I care about when I truly don't know? Help :(\n\nI've never posted on Reddit before so sorry if anything is incorrectly done.",
