  "text": "I am so stressed I feel my heart falling everyday.\n\nI am currently an international junior in high school with some pretty decent stats imo. I'm a prominent member in the school mun and student council and have been in many prestigious programs and honours throughout the years, with a fair share of courses. \n\nFor the next two years I'm trying to solidify my stem ECs as our country has a weird system for Olympiads and what not so I wasn't able to immerse myself at all in them, so I am going for the next best thing: research. \n\nThe problem is, there's a big chance my lack of oomf with stem will not let me enter the most prestigious research program in the country. Applications are in 1.5 months and I'm stressing everyday thinking about what I can do. I know a bit of python, and so some self taught math and physics but I dont know what I can do that will stand against other applicants. Some have done researches already, others Olympiads. I'm scared I won't get a position.\n\nI don't even want it for university, I just am genuinly interested in and want to try research for myself but might miss out on this opportunity because I lack experience. Its killing me mentally",
