  "text": "Hi I\u2019m a senior planning to apply ed to cornell\u2019s arts and sciences and was wondering if my chances would increase if i applied undecided rather than psychology. my profile and ECs don\u2019t really show a focus on psych and that would probably impact my admission chances so would applying undecided and elaborating on which areas (life sciences and social sciences) im interested in exploring in the supplement be better? i\u2019m interested in psych but environmental science and bio as well",

      "text": "I applied undecided after previously applying microbio and practically failing an admissions cycle (to summarize very briefly). Schools that admit by major typically have more space in undecided programs, and accept students with less impressive stats. Ex: if you want to go into engineering but you have a poor math SAT and mediocre grades in STEM. If your application shows no real direction. Or if you don\u2019t know what you want to do and assume you\u2019ll change your major. I want to go into science and my strictly science grades are good but I\u2019m lacking in math classes, got a 600 math SAT score and a much higher English, my gpa isn\u2019t awesome. Applying undecided to schools that admit by major strategically gives me a needed boost. I\u2019m also not entirely sure I would stick with microbio. Counselors I\u2019ve talked to like students that apply undecided and explain why, ones I\u2019ve talked to have been incredibly supportive and understanding.",
