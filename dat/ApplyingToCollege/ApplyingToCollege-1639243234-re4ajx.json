  "text": "Not done this before, so please let me know if this is the wrong place or the wrong format. \n\nAlright, so I've been an idiot and put off my RD applications (I am working on them now, though!). I got deferred from my ED, and it was a real reach, but it still shook my confidence. I think I'm applying to too many top reaches and don't have enough targets, so if anyone has any recommendations, let me know. These are my stats / what I'm looking for:\n\nIntended major: Computer science (original, I know /s)\n\n36 ACT, Subscores: 35 in math 36 in everything else\n\n4 APs, CSP, CSA, Phys C mech, Calc BC (this is probably the most I could have taken, my school is weird)\n\nGPA: 3.81 uw\n\nDemographics: white female\n\nECs: independent research & research mentorship around machine learning (computer vision and natural language processing), robotics club leadership (not competitive team), NHS, math & code club membership, summer job, some volunteering before covid hit but not too much\n\nHonors: some academic awards from my school, but nothing recognizable \n\nPreferences (doesn't need to be so in-depth but the info is here if it's helpful): huge interests in AI/ML research in college (it's a bonus if I can take a bunch of ML classes), would love to try out more robotics stuff (programs/classes), would rather stay East coast (don't mind west cost) but the location isn't too important to me, looking for low reaches / high targets, but I'm not sure if I'm setting my sights too high\n\nI'm sorry if I shared too much or too little, or if I'm asking for something too specific (some unicorn college). Any help or advice is appreciated. \n\nThank you all!",
