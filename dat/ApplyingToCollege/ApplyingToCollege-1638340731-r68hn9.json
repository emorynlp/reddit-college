  "text": "We're acquaintances so I can't exactly report him because I'm one of the few people he showed his apps to.\n\nAnyways, I looked over his application about 2 weeks ago.. and there was so many rampant lies. He claimed he attended a few programs, won a few awards, and did ecs when he only participated once. He's not flexing his words to show that he did more; no, this is actual lies - like... I know he never did any of these things. At all. He also claimed he was of a different sexual orientation, you know, to show \"diversity.\"\n\nHalf of his awards are made up but they're subtle enough that it's almost impossible to check. (Local club awards) If I were to estimate, his app is around 50% just .. lies.\n\nHe's a good student, don't get me wrong. He got a near 1590 on the SAT, and a 4.0 GPA. What do I even do in this situation?",

He's petty, and has a small inner circle because he doesn't have a lot of friends, so it's likely he'll know who I am if I choose to rat him out. \n\nAfter he figures that out, he'd probably rope me into his situation. Worst case scenario, he makes false claims about *me* and I jeopardize my chances of getting where I want to even though my app is 100% true. \n\nIf that does happen, it'll be an absolute mind fuck for me to dig myself out of the situation.  It'll also only increase anxiety and, yea, I don't know. I will consider annonymously emailing the uni's he's applying to.. because I do feel compelled to do something.",

      "text": "Lol a kid a year older than me (last years class) did the same thing. Obviously, he was eventually caught as my counselor mentioned she got a phone call from an AO just to confirm activities for students in my school. After the counselor had no idea what the AO was talking about as it wasn\u2019t in the student\u2019s CV, she went to ask the student for confirmation (because counselors don\u2019t always know everything about every student). The student, unable to provide proof, was easily found guilty of misrepresenting himself on the app (application fraud + was also involved with the police, unsure of the result of that) and was required to tell all his schools about his lies. As a result, he was not accepted anywhere and also was suspended from our school (not sure how long) and this added to his HS permanent record so he it would carry forward to any university he applied to in the future. As far as I know, he did not attend college (Atleast this year) because of this. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy how a couple lies and 1 phone call changed this bright kid\u2019s future. Although no one was supposed to know what happened to this kid, obviously in a school gossip and news travels fast. Now he\u2019s just a bad example.\n\nMoral of the story, don\u2019t lie. AO\u2019s routinely call counselors (they give them their number and emails on CommonApp) for applicants they want to admit. It\u2019s not worth it, and don\u2019t risk you future by finding out the hard way",

But afaik (just rumours because the principal/counselor is never gonna go into detail so can't guarantee as facts) the school contacted the school police reps in order to have a solid talking to about falsifying his application. Obviously, there are multiple places on the common app where you confirm that everything you are talking about is truthful and not fraud.\n\nMy school took this very seriously, as many schools that do not want to be blacklisted by universities in the future do.",

Affirmations usually list the possible penalties if you're found to have misrepresented your experiences, but these are never pursued as a criminal/civil violation. There's not actually a disclaimer saying that misrepresentation is considered a legal matter; in general, a student lying and getting into a school is just not impactful enough to prompt a consequence from the legal system. It would require much more effort than it's worth, and furthermore jailing/fining a high school graduate is terrible optics. \n\nYou need also to prove fraud beyond a reasonable doubt (the same standard as other criminal charges), and that's not easily accomplished or worthwhile for any school that can simply reject a student. If you want a real life corollary, the parents and participants in Operation Varsity Blues were not formally charged with fraud, but with money laundering and conspiracy, as there's a substantially better case to be made.",

                      "text": "There are some important specifics to note here that differentiate this case from the majority of others:\n\n1) The student at the end of the day was not charged or even expelled from college over the fraudulent circumstances of her admission\n\n2) Wire and mail fraud charges for Lori Laughlin were largely brought as she was a wealthy figure and the scandal was that of a large scale *conspiracy* to admit students under false pretenses. The publicity attracted by this case necessitated *some* move by federal prosecutors.\n\n3) The circumstances of the fraud in this case is quite different from simply writing untrue statements on an application. Loughlin was indicted and pled guilty based on her payments to a holding company, disguised as a donation, which was then used as a bribe to interested coaches. What makes this actionable is the illegal exchange of money, moreso than simple misrepresentation of the student. You cannot reasonably prove charges like \"wire fraud\" and \"mail fraud\" without indicating that money changed hands - in fact, it would just be \"nepotism\" if Olivia Jade's parents didn't pay someone off and instead just asked for a backdoor entry. \n\nThese are subtle, but very important differences between the Varsity Blues case and kids simply fabricating extracurriculars. It would honestly be much more of a nightmare if the legal system had a bigger role in policing how true someone's app is. Where it gets dicey is when money is involved, I'll agree there. It becomes a new matter when you accept money on behalf of untrue statements - in general though, it won't become a legal matter if money's not involved.",

Some obviously won't get caught, but I think they are missing the point.  It isn't to fill out the activities list that one should do a program or run a club, it is WHAT YOU GET OUT OF IT. That is what comes through in essays and LORs. I don't think most fakers can write a compelling personal statement with insight from something they didn't do or experience. I think the lack of mention of those things is a red flag that probably tips off AOs that the app is not authentic.  So, Karma.  One way or another.",
