  "title:": "Different supplement deadlines on website and SlideRoom",
  "text": "For Yale, the webpage for art/music supplements states that they must be submitted on the application deadline (Nov 1st). However on SlideRoom, the actual deadline is 2 days and 10 hours away (Nov 3rd).\n\nObviously I REALLY need to take the extra 2 days and polish up my portfolio, but I don't want to risk my supplementals not being reviewed.\n\nIs it ok to submit the supplementals on the 3rd? Does anyone have experience with this?\n\nAlso a side question- when it asks for recordings, does it want video or is pure audio fine? I'm submitting both a performance and composition, so tell me if the requirements are different.\n\nThanks!",
