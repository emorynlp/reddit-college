  "title:": "Will Depression be A Benefit or a Detriment to my college application?",
  "text": "I\u2019m now a senior in hs and all throughout I\u2019ve been a fairly above average ppstudent. I hold a leadership role in several clubs, am the captain of the varsity boys tennis team, and have a 4.6 w/ 3.9 uw. The latter half of last year and current year have been pretty tough grade wise due to a lot of family deaths and what I thought was a feeling of burnout. It\u2019s not too extreme, just a slight drop. I received 4 B+ out of the 34 classes in high school I\u2019ve taken and they are all in APs.Recently this feeling of burnout has been diagnosed as something a little more serious: clinical depression. Dealing with these deaths and juggling depression/it\u2019s treatments have been exceptionally difficult to balance in tandem with college apps, sat retake studying, etc\u2026 My question is will explaining this grade shift is mostly due to depression compensate for the shift or will it be looked at as a negative as depression will make me a less likely candidate succeed in college this a worse candidate to accept. I really would appreciate the help and this is my first Reddit post so I\u2019m sorry if something I\u2019m doing is wrong/structured wrong.\n\nExtra question: I\u2019m a half Lao(Asian)/half white male. Would white, asian, or both be most beneficial to my application?",
