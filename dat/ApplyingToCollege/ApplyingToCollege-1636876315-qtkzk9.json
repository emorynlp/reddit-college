  "text": "My thought process is they'll think, \"oh, she's just collecting positions like pokemon cards.\"\n\nThe three clubs are Art (vp), Writing (president), and Book (president). \n\nI'm launching my school's first literary magazine for writing club. For book club i just organize meetings and contests. I just received the art position, so I haven't done anything yet.\n\nI'm really interested in writing and literature, if you can't tell. It's pretty much going to be my \"niche.\" I also do a lot of art, but not nearly as much as i write.",
