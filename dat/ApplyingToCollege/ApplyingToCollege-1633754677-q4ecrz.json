  "text": "Hi everyone, this is my first Reddit post :)\n\nI'm currently filling out the activities section on the Common App and I have a question about the extracurricular list. \n\nWhat counts as a \"similar activity in college?\" For example, one of my EC's is cross country. I don't plan to run collegiately, but I do plan to continue running and racing (more like marathons, that kind of thing, but not connected to the school). Can I check \"yes\" for intending to participate in a similar activity in college, or does it need to have a direct connection to the school and/or XC team?\n\nThanks!",
