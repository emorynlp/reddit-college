  "text": "So if I'm a finalist in this ITMO Russian Math Contest thing, how should I categorize it in terms of a Common App Honor? Is it a School, National, or International level honor? \n\nI think it's an International one but I just want to make sure so as not to overexaggerate it. Because it's nowhere close to the big International Olympiad stuffs so I'm a bit confused.\n\nHere's the link: [https://ec.itmo.ru/p/math2021/780](https://ec.itmo.ru/p/math2021/780)\n\nThank you! And yes I think I'm doxxing myself pretty hard with this.",
