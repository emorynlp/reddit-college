  "text": "Fuck it. I didn't want to do this but I cant hold it in anymore. It feels like everything is going down. Today was the worst day. My Midterms are going shit. I just got my 3rd ACT score which was absolutely horrific. Im an international needing aid and got deferred by my ED College I didnt even want to go to( bc it has a very bad program for my major; I applied purely for aid) I have got 3 rejections so far solely because of my financial status. Im from a stupid ass country where only the rich kids get into good univerisities. Im out here trying my best, doing everything that I can but failing in all possible ways. I dont know what's gonna happen in the future but I have no hope left from the rest of my applications. It sucks being an international.Im helpless at this point. And all I feel is, even if I do get accepted by a college in the US, it wouldn't be a good university like my friends will go to. I hate my life.",
