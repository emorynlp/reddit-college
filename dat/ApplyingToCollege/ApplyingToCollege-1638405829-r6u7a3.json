      "text": "UCLA - rejected from the school (can only apply to one major unless you are a transfer student in the TAG program) \n\nUCI - a few people rejected from nursing do get into their alternate major but it may drop your chances because you won\u2019t pop up in the second major pool for a while\n\nIf you are going to apply be thoughtful with that nursing supplemental app and share a story about why you need to be a nurse. The average ACT for nursing at UCLA was only around a 27 when they were using those. Nursing experience and essays count for a lot there, and I think the nursing school picks and then sends their choices over to the main admission office for approval (I was told this is what the dance program does) \n\nAt UCI you have to get into the university before they will ever read your application",
