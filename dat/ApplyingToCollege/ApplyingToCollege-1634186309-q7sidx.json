  "text": "I'm struggling finding a topic for this admission essay. \n\nLittle background, I failed out my nursing program when I had one semester left causing me to change my major and stay an extra year. I've decided to try again and apply to a different local college for nursing again for next year. \n\nI'm currently in an application process and I've reached the essay portion. I'm drawing a blank on what my topic should be about. The suggested topics were \"1) what factor, more than any other factor, caused you to apply to Molloy? 2) what do you hope to accomplish during your college years?\" \nThey also offered a personal topic of your choosing. \n\nAny tips?",
