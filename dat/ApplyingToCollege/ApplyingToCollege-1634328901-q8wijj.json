CU Boulder is good and has a great setting - not usually good for merit aid though.\n\nIowa State is solid, and can be very affordable - they give out lots of merit aid.  UT Dallas and Texas Tech will waive the out of state costs if you get a merit scholarship, which makes them really affordable.  Arizona State is a good option and also gives out a lot of merit aid.",
