  "text": "Not what are (ik the data is in the common data set for each college) -- but what you think should be: \n\n\\- Standardized Test Scores (SAT, ACT, AP's)\n\n\\- GPA/Class Rank/Course Load (this could be a separate factor) \n\n\\- Letters of Rec \n\n\\- Essays \n\n\\- Interview\n\n\\- EC's/Honors\n\n\\- Background (first gen, socioeconomic status, race, geographic region, etc.)\n\nIt'd be cool if you rank them if your respond lol this is just for my curiosity",

      "text": "imo GPA and similar components (along with the profile of one's school that's already sent), ECs/Honors, and background in that order. Though with background I think the first two factors you listed (first gen and socioeconomic status) should be more prioritized. Letters of rec would be 4th. Test scores seem too \"fluffy\" for me, especially the AP test scores (the grade you get in the AP class is way more important), and essays are kinda just the college app's version of busywork. Interviews count the least of all in most cases and are more of a way for alumni to stay involved than much else.",
