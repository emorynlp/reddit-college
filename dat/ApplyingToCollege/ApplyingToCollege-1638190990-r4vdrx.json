  "title:": "Addict in Recovery, Nearing 10 months sober, still young (19) but want to pursue my dreams",
  "text": "On February 4th of this year I started my next round of going back into recovery after a 2 1/2 - 3 Month Bender. I will admit it I didn't do the best in high school, drugs took me by storm and unfortunately was my go to resort to deal with a lot of stress. A week prior to starting high school I moved to a new state. Knew nobody, mom was abusive and was dealing with what has since turned out to be Schizoaffective (Bipolar) Disorder. It sucked a lot. But I am not here to give a sob story. I was weak in the head and turned to drugs and chose it over everyone and everything.\n\nIt wasn't fun, I thought my thing of fun was scoring a nice piece to load up in the rig or an 8 ball to smoke under a small crossing nearby my house.\n\nBut yet again not here for sobby pity \"you can do its\" but here for advice and help to guide me properly and start mt journey.\n\nSince I didn't get to the best standards but for sure not below average (2.5 GPA Unweighted) and some shit SAT and ACT (I went to trade school in another county. My home school county mandated the SAT and the trade school county mandated the ACT).\n\nEver since taking the whole thing of sobriety seriously I wanted to get up to par and challenging myself. To my surprise I ended finding out once I put in effort I was actually good at sciences. I spent this past year learning the ins and outs and want to go to a good school like MSU, UC-Boulder, etc. for the more spacey-like foundations of it.\n\nI just don't know a good ground to start. I have re learned and self taught myself up to Basic High School Calculus to re learn because I really want to achieve and not do the normal addict thing which is to go start a foundation, treatment center, being a tech or anything of that sort. No disrespect might I say as these people have helped people like me to get to where I am today.\n\nI just wanna know where my starting point should be. Should I go to CC? Is there anyway for me to redo my ACT and SATs? I can't do a GED considering I (shockingly) got my diploma. \n\nThank you to whoever can help show me something around to get towards it. I live in California and will be working a good enough job soon to make enough to where I can support myself to a proper point to put mysf through CC or whatever I should do.\n\nHave a good night \u2764\n\nP.S. Considering my Grandma worked over at Michigan State University and went to school there what would that entail for me? I dont think I would get any legacy benefit would I? It's my dream school.",

      "text": "If you're starting from a less than ideal place (low GPA, low test scores) then I'd recommend going to CC first! It'll allow you to develop an upward trend (grades-wise) as well as allow you to develop relationships with new teachers for Letter Of Recommendations. \n\nI don't think legacy will do much for you but MSU has a relatively high acceptance rate so you could compare your stats to those in their Common Data set to see where you fall as an applicant.",
