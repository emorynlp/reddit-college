I'd suggest still trying to apply to some of them even if you haven't gotten your portal link.

      "text": "If you applied REA somewhere, submitting your application to another school by an early deadline for consideration for scholarships is considered a violation of the REA restrictions. From Harvard's website:\n\n>You may not apply to a US private institution's Regular Decision program prior to our REA decision release if there is any type of early consideration involved (e.g., scholarships, priority deadlines,\u202fBA/MD admission programs). In the case of a Regular Decision program with no early consideration of any kind, you may apply at any point before their deadline.",

That scholarship app was the only one I hoped to submit (other than apps for 3 public universities), but I didn\u2019t submit it. So, luckily I didn\u2019t violate any REA policies on accident \ud83d\ude05",
