  "text": "Hi! I recently sent in my collage application for Scad and Ringling, but just today after looking at my application I found that I put a typo in my \u201cactivities description\u201d tab. I added an \u201cand\u201d at the end of one of my sentences, I didn\u2019t notice it while reviewing. I know it\u2019s a super small mistake but it\u2019s freaking me out. I\u2019m scared the school might think I didn\u2019t put effort in my application when I did! I really want to go to art school, and my panic self thinks any small mistakes I make will cost me this. (I also have OCD, so it could me intrusively thinking but it\u2019s really hard to ignore it).",
