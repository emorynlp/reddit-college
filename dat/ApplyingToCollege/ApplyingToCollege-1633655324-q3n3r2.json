  "title:": "Feeling like a zombie wading through a sea of applications",
  "text": "Does anyone else feel somewhat detached or dissociated from this entire application process? I've been going through the motions of writing essays, requesting recommendations and transcripts, etc., and it's obviously been very stressful. But the most difficult part of it all has been a total inability on my part to muster up any enthusiasm about what should be an exciting new chapter in my life. \n\nI was so eager to start this process at the end of junior year, and I've been thinking about applying to college since the start of high school. However, now that I'm actually in the thick of it, I can't bring myself to actually feel enthused about any of my schools, inject passion into any of my essays, or get excited about researching and visiting colleges. \n\nI'm tired from handling my courseload, extracurriculars, and I don't really get out that much or see my friends beyond the 7 hours I spend at school each day. All anyone ever talks about at school or at home are college applications, essays, and acceptance rates. It seems like there's no escape. Not to mention, this entire process of putting my life and personality down on an application to be judged is making me realize that I'm really not as interesting of a person as I thought I was. I really feel like I'm stuck in this awful malaise with no one to talk to about it, and there are still so many more months of application season to deal with.",
