Fit matters a lot more than people think it does.",

      "text": "Caltech's the hardest imo because they have a similar acceptance rate to the others, but a far, far more self-selecting pool of applicants. Anyone applying to Caltech knows exactly what they want, and is likely already very good at it.   \n\n\nThe rest all want different things, and there are more doors into them. It gets less objective here. Because of the prestige, Stanford and Harvard both get flooded with underqualified applicants. According to my school's Naviance, half our Stanford and Harvard applications were below a 3.9 and a 1450. Stanford's probably next for the average joe, unless you're a legacy or athlete in which case it's far easier since those make up a good chunk of their class.   \n\n\nI'll put Harvard after that for similar reasons, then Princeton (again similar reasons but slightly higher acceptance rate). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast I'd put UChicago. Again according to my Naviance, stats don't really matter as much here as the other schools. We've had a fair few students get in with lower SATs and GPAs. I think outside-the-box ECs and essays count the most here though, and again a higher acceptance rate.",
