  "text": "I'm looking to be admitted at Penn State UP, my LORs, essay, class rank, academics, GPA etc. are good but my SAT is a 1160. My ECs aren't bad but are nothing special. My counselor told me to go test-optional but since my score is right at the 25th percentile mark I'm wondering if I should change this and submit scores anyway before I get a decision?",

And basically with test optional, you don\u2019t have to submit the score and they will just instead look at your GPA, but if you submit the test score then they WILL consider your score in the admissions process.",
