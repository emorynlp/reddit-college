For instance, in class discussions, some of her peers have a tendency to name-drop certain authors even when it isn\u2019t necessary to explain their point or to move the discussion forward. They also will often use overly complicated language when a simpler word would suffice and convey exactly the same meaning. This doesn\u2019t apply to every student there, of course, but these are the types of students who tend to dominate class discussions.",
