      "text": "My sister is a student at UC Hicago right now and she says that a lot of times, the school\u2019s reputation for intellectual rigor mostly just manifests in the form of pretentiousness. For instance, in class discussions, some of her peers have a tendency to name-drop certain authors even when it isn\u2019t necessary to explain their point or to move the discussion forward. They also will often use overly complicated language when a simpler word would suffice and convey exactly the same meaning. This doesn\u2019t apply to every student there, of course, but these are the types of students who tend to dominate class discussions.",

Some people definitely think that about college students, but I have to add that my sister is actually a grad student at UC Hicago, although some of her classes have college seniors in them as well and some of them act exactly as what I described above. She went to undergrad at a good state school where she was one of the top students (graduated with very close to a perfect GPA) and while there were definitely some pretentious people there, the percentage of pretentious people at UC Hicago was a lot higher.",
