  "text": "I\u2019m an international junior doing the IBDP and was just offered a full government scholarship to attend university in the United States next year. I\u2019m absolutely stunned, 1 year of tuition fees alone would cost more than 4 years of fees+housing+expenses going to Uni in my home country, so I would never otherwise be able to afford it. I\u2019m just so grateful for this life-changing opportunity and beyond excited to step into the US next fall! Time to start drawing up the list of universities to apply to haha",
