  "text": "Good luck to myself and everyone who applied ED to UPenn!\n\nWhatever happens tomorrow, we're still the same amazing, intelligent, talented, unique, hard-working individuals we were before we opened that status update. I love UPenn so very much, I've poured my heart into my essays and wrote the supplementals like I was an actual student walking down Locust Walk. But even if I get deferred or rejected tomorrow, it's not the end of the world. I still have my UCs and the gazillion other colleges I'm applying too.\n\nBest case scenario, I'll be admitted into UPenn, my dream school. I'm wishing that's the outcome, but it's okay if it's not.\n\nGood luck to all the amazing fellow UPenn applicants out there and I wish the best of luck to all of you!",
