  "title:": "As a (possible) future bio major, is it bad that I switched to regular precalculus?",
  "text": "Perhaps this is a dumb question, but based on everything I've seen online I might've made the wrong choice here.\n\nI'm currently a sophomore in high school and I started the year off with honors precalculus. Even though I've been working with a tutor and doing lots of extra practice, I still didn't do too well on the first test (81%). Assuming I'd do better on future tests, I used a retake (we get 2 retakes). On our second test, I got a 62%. I ended up meeting with my school counselor and we decided that it'd be best for me to switch down to regular precalculus because the tests were only going to get more difficult and of course if I stayed in honors I'd have to retake the second test, leaving me with no retakes.\n\nI'm taking 3 AP classes this year, including AP Bio which my counselor says it's important for me to earn a high grade in because I want to be a bio major and possibly go to med school. My other classes are honors, but when reading about regular vs. honors I've heard it's better to get a lower grade in an honors class than a high one in a regular. It's also important for STEM majors to take rigorous STEM classes. I likely would've ended up with a C in honors precalculus -- would that really have been better than an A/A- in regular? Is this going to hurt my chances as a bio major?\n\nThanks! :)",
