  "text": "I did not do early action. Just want to apply regular. I have my common app done except for essay, and my teacher is working on his recommendation letter. I have a decent grade on the SAT but am scheduled for the ACT also. Is it worth it to take that one, or is it too late since my colleges do rolling admissions. I\u2019d most likely apply early December if I don\u2019t take it, or late December if I do take it. Not sure what to do.",
