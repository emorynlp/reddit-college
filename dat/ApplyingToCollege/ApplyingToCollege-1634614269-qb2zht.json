  "text": "Hey everyone,\nI\u2019m a senior looking to apply early by November 1st. I have got my supplementals approved by my school counsellor, however I still have not been able to get my common app essay approved as I had to restart. Could someone give me feedback on my essay, if it plausible for them to do so? Thanks",
