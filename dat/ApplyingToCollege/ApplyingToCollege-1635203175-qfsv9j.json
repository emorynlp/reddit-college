  "text": "Has anyone else experienced this? She told me that she wants me to write out what I want her to say and she'll just tweak it a little bit. She reasoned that the schools I'm applying for require highly personal and specific letters, and also I requested the letter a bit late (the standard is to ask with 2 weeks notice, but I gave her a little over a week) so she's busy with others' at the moment.\n\nShe doesn't know me personally much but are counselors expected to? What do I do? How do I even know how to write a counselor recommendation? What am I supposed to say?",

      "text": "It's not that different from the counselor letter at many schools - you fill out an extensive questionnaire which also has a paragraph section that the parents are supposed to fill out. I suspect they just cut/paste, since there are 2 counselors for ~700 kids. (Not all need letters though)\nAlternatively, this is a great opportunity for your parents to write a letter about you.",
