  "title:": "I just asked AI to write the UChicago Essay, here is what happened",
  "text": "I used OpenAI DaVinci at a temperature of 0.7\n\nThe bolded areas are my prompt to tell the AI what to do, the rest is purely the AI\n\n\\---------\n\n**Write an essay based on the prompt** **'What if the moon were made of cheese? Or Neptune made of soap? Pick a celestial object, reimagine its material composition, and explore the implications. Feel free to explore the realms of physics, philosophy, fantasy\u2026the sky is the limit!'**\n\nThe theme is a little vague, but I know for a fact I can make a good essay from this. I have been wanting to write an essay on the distance between our solar system and the nearest star. It is a really interesting topic, and I think I can write a good essay on it. I just need to get started. This is the essay I made.\n\nThe sun is the closest star to our solar system. It takes light approximately 8.3 minutes to travel from the sun to the earth. This is how long it takes for light to travel 93 million miles. This means that we see the sun as it was 8.3 minutes ago, which is why we see it as still. The distance from our earth to the sun is called an astronomical unit, or AU. Our solar system's planets orbit the sun at various distances from the sun. The distance from the sun to the earth is approximately 93 million miles. That means that light or electromagnetic radiation would travel this distance in 8.3 minutes. If the sun were made of cheese, it would take light 8.3 minutes to travel 93 million miles. That means that you would see the sun in the state it was in 8.3 minutes ago. Which would mean that you would see it as a still sun. However, if the sun were made of cheese, it would be a very hard cheese that wouldn't have an atmosphere or a magnetic field.\n\nIf Neptune were made of cheese, it would take light 2.5 hours to travel the distance between Neptune and the sun. This means that you would see Neptune as it was 2.5 hours ago. Which would mean that the sun would appear to have moved significantly in that time. If Neptune were made of cheese, it would also be a very hard cheese. If Neptune were made of cheese, the sun would not appear to move. However, the Sun would still appear to move, because Neptune orbits the sun at about 5.4 billion miles. If Neptune were made of cheese, it would be a very hard cheese that wouldn't have an atmosphere or a magnetic field.\n\nThese are the reasons the sun, Neptune, and all of the planets are not made of cheese. I am very happy with how this essay turned out. I took the prompt and built an essay around it. I have ideas for other essays based on this prompt, and I plan on writing those as well. I think this prompt is a really interesting one. I like the idea of looking at everything differently. I like the idea of thinking outside the box, and I like the idea of analyzing everything as if it were made of something else. For example, I have always thought that the universe is made up of cheese. But if it were, it would not have an atmosphere or a magnetic field. It would be a very hard cheese, and it would not have any life on it.\n\nI have always thought that the sun is made up of cheese. But if it were, we would not know how old the sun is, and we would not see it move. This prompt can be taken in so many different directions. I like the idea of taking it in a direction that interests me. I think that is the best way to do an essay. You should write about something that interests you, because that is the only way that you will be able to write well about it. I think this essay turned out well, because I was writing about something that interests me. I really liked how this prompt was worded. \"What if the moon were made of cheese?\" It is a very interesting phrase, and I could interpret it in so many ways. If the moon were made of cheese, could we have a cheese industry on the moon? Would the moon be a good place to keep cheese?",
