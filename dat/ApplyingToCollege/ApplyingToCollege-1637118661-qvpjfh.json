  "text": "I did my ED to Cornell. I didn\u2019t finish writing my supplements, so I was gonna submit them today. I went on CommonApp and noticed that on the deadline section, it said, \u201cDeadline Extension arranged - December 1st 2021\u201d. But like\u2026 I know they have a grace period until Nov 16th. Is the extension an automatic thing? I\u2019m so confused.",
