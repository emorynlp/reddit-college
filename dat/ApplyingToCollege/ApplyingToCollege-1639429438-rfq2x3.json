  "title:": "Forgot to list a \"W\" grade on my Cal State applications?",
  "text": "Exactly what it says in the title. I'm currently a community college student and was taking a creative writing class this semester that between my two jobs I just didn't have the time for, and had to withdraw. This is the first withdrawal I've ever had after 6 years at the community college (2 years as an adult plus 4 years part-time dual enrollment in HS), and I completely spaced when filling out my transcripts on the application and it's already turned in. \n\nWeirdly enough, the W also doesn't show on my unofficial transcripts, hence the space-out-moment since those were what I was referencing. I'm not sure if that's normal.\n\nIs this something I should e-mail the individual colleges about, or just let it be? I'm not sure if I'll be able to go back and edit the fall classes once the transcript stuff reopens for spring. I'm the first in my family to attend ANY kind of college, so I'm unsure of how to proceed. Any advice is MASSIVELY appreciated.",
