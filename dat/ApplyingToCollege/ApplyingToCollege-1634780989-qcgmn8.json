  "text": "On my college apps, I said i did a fundraiser through a club I was in and initiated it. But it wasn't that much of a success so there were no news articles written about it. Will college admissions officers be suspicious about that?\n\nAlso, since I did all the work for the fundraiser, the other president of the club is not putting it in application( I already think he submitted some and didnt put the fundraiser in it). Since we are applying to a few of the same colleges, will those colleges be suspicious of me?",
