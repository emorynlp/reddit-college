  "text": "it is friday.  october SAT scores are in.  i click the download scores button (i have no idea how getting scores work but this is how it was in my dream) and i had to install several layers of software to open it.\n\ni'm shaking with nerves, my mom yelling from the kitchen demanding to know what i got.  i scroll...and it's a 1600!  i've never been so happy.  it feels almost too good to be true...\n\ni keep scrolling to a page that reads \"END OF SAMPLE RESULTS\".\n\nthe page after has \"960\" at the top.  i start to cry.  my math score is 420 and my day has been ruined.  my mom is screaming bloody murder.\n\nlet's just say i've never been more relieved to wake up.  i hope friday comes sooner so i can STOP THINKING ABOUT IT IN MY SLEEP.",

I forget what happens so quickly that I need to reread the part once I get to the question. Also the first time I took the actual sat I just made it to the math side with 10 mins left only did like 3 questions and got a 1080 idk if that\u2019s good but I know I can do better",
