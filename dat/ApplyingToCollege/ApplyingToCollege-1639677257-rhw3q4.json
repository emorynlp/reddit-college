  "text": "So I applied to rice recently and just got my portal. Even though my SAT scores and APs were included in my common app, they weren\u2019t in the PDF when I reviewed to submit my application to rice. The portal says they received my SAT scores but has no indication of whether they have received my AP scores.\n\nAlso, I requested that my PSAT be considered for my application along with my SAT score but I don\u2019t know how to send my PSAT to rice.",

So either try to figure it out at the CB website, ask your GC, or drop a note to the admissions office and ask them.  (Or call.)",

If they say they will consider a PSAT score, which is very uncommon, the only way to get it to them is to self report on an application/portal or download and send the Score Report pdf from the College Board site.\n\nThe PSAT is not intended for use other than practice and the NMS, so there\u2019s no way to send official scores, as there is with the SAT.",
