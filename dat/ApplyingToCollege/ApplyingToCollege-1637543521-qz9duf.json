  "title:": "Cum laude: international level of recognition?",
  "text": "I received cum laude in 11th grade and am not sure whether the highest level of recognition (as asked on the honors section of the common app) is school (because it's based on my peers' grades and how I compare), or international (because the cum laude society has member schools across the world) and my school counselors and principal said it's international, but that seems rly big.\n\ni already submitted apps for 2 schools on the common app and put \"international\" bc that's what my college counselor said, but now am worried it's a mistake.\n\n& for the UC App, it also asks for level of recognition, so I'm hoping I can get it right this time.\n\nThanks",
