  "title:": "How Do the Average Student Graduate With Only $30K in Debt?",
  "text": "To attend my state university, it would cost that much to attend for one year, and over the course of undergraduate study, that's about $120K. I'm genuinely curious how people manage to achieve this. Maybe it's because this number is the maximum amount a student can borrow in federal loans, so they only include those and not private ones? I'm just really curious how people can get through 4 years of study without going over this figure.",
