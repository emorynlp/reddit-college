  "title:": "So, our counselor is asking me to send in some of my EC certificates: what should I focus on?",
  "text": "I know colleges don't require certification as proof of ECs. But my counselor has asked me to send in some certificates from my extracurricular activities. I had the following questions:\n\n1. Some(actually most) certificates are not in English and it's not possible for me to translate those officially right now. Should I avoid them completely? Some of these were great and all, but unis aren't asking for it, and I feel they'll be annoyed if I burden them with the job of translating.\n2. Most of my ECs are from middle school, and although I haven't said this directly, it's understandable from some essays. Should I include some middle school certificates to reinforce that? My middle school certificates are somehow actually kinda impressive.\n3. Should I include certificates from activities that aren't my main ECs? For example, I was good at MUNs and have best delegate awards, but I didn't mention it even once because my other ECs are way important.\n4. Lastly, how many should I send in?",
