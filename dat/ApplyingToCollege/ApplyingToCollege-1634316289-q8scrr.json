  "text": "I dont mean like days when you feel tired or overwhelmed but generally no concern about your future. I have been in a slump for more than 6 months. I don't have any motivation to do anything (in fact eating also feels like torture to me) and I haven't researched the courses and colleges I am applying to. I want to do physics specifically astrophysics. but I am really bad at math (in fact my parents have gotten a call from my teacher that I should drop math - I have taken math aa hl in IB) I don't also do very well in codding so my parents don't want me to take physics.\n\nBut its mainly because I don't show any concern about anything and have a very flippant attitude. Is anyone else also going through this? Any ways I can change and convince my parents to let me pursue physics? They are quite adamant on me not taking physics because of my attitude and I want to change, but I think its too late since I am already applying EA. I was planning on getting into college via any major and then working hard to get into physics. But I don't have it in me to work hard. Any ways I can change this?",

Make active choices that you know are good for you even if they don\u2019t feel that way know. Put your phone away to do homework. Meditate (my best advice). Go outside everyday. Fake it til you make it. One day, you\u2019ll be happy you put the work in now even if it feels so difficult now. Also, reach out to your friends and family. I saw another comment talk about the flat effect and I agree that if you think something deeper might be happening that you should look into it.",
