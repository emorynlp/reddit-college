And when I say doing the best, I don\u2019t mean having that 36, ed\u2019ing to an ivy, or having a research publication. I mean just trying your best. \n\nYou\u2019re doing good, and I\u2019m proud of you.\n\nedit: idk why this is getting down voted. I'm not saying you're wrong for having all these high stats and good for you, but I'm saying it's okay to not have them. This sub creates a toxic culture that says you can only be successful graduating summa cum laude from Harvard, and I'm just trying to show it's okay to not do that.",

Many graduating students ik go to work for reputable but not brand name companies, it\u2019s not like T20 = golden ticket to Facebook SWE job with $250k yearly comp; those jobs are hard to get even with an elite alma mater. Some of my friends didnt care that much about HS, had 1300 SATs and 3.6 GPAs etc. but they never went out of their way to study super hard for the SAT or AP classes. Went to study CS or Bio at schools considered pretty average by this subreddit, got into decent jobs or med / graduate school and are doing really great for themselves rn. Their coworkers or classmates went to good or top schools. \n\nThis isn\u2019t to say elite schools are useless but their advantages outside of certain fields like finance / quant trading or humanities fields (where prestige is more critical, and only if you pursue a related field after graduating) are overblown. I went to HS in the Bay Area and a lot of people gun super hard for UC Berkeley and UCLA, which is perfectly fine, but then sleep on schools like San Diego State, San Jose State, Cal Poly Pomona and sometimes if they're elitist enough Cal Poly SLO. Those schools pump out solid engineering graduates into many Silicon Valley companies and are nowhere near as difficult to get into as UC Berkeley or UCLA for EECS/CSE, with the exception of maybe Cal Poly SLO for CS. All of these schools are highly respected except by those who don't know what they're doing.",

      "text": "Tbh it's just a lack of confidence that underachievers have on this stuff. The only way it can be normalized if people who fit your criteria actually post about this. But they don't and that's why there's a flood of people who have high scores who don't have to worry about being 'embarassed'. Ive seen a fair share of students on this sub with average scores and posting about it and pretty much everyone in the Post's comments supports them and congratulates them. What youre really suggesting is to stop the overachievers to stop posting their accomplishments so the underachievers dont feel intimidated by them which isn't fair... Personally, I think it's stupid to mention scores or achievements on this sub in the first place. There's chanceme for that..instead it should be reserved for college related questions and the occasional shitposts as it was originally intended to do so. Now it's slowly just becoming a sub where people share their opinion and then people disagree with it or rant/brag about something which sucks. New mods have just changed this sub's intended purpose and have failed to regulate it but hey it eez what it eez.",

I only took 3 actual AP classes during HS and I didn't do too hot on the tests. I had two EC's, one a recent one and one I've done all my life that became my major. \n\nI started Senior year with absolutely no idea what I was going to do in college. I knew I wanted to be a music major but little else. I fought with my parents about college a lot, had no idea how to even go about applying, and when the pandemic hit everything was even more of a mess. I was completely stressed and overwhelmed by trying to balance all the things I wanted to get from college. I ended up blindly applying to a bunch of places, only a few of which I could even see myself wanting to go to. I wrote basically all of my essays the day before they were due and hoped for the best. \n\nAnd I'm almost done with my first semester of college. I'm at a very good college, not Ivy league for sure but still prestigious. What matters much more, it's the best fit for me. It is the school I started considering my dream school at some point when I was applying. I got most of my tuition paid for by scholarships. \n\nSo the point is... it's okay Seniors. You will get into college. Everything will work out just fine, and a year from now you will not believe how easy it was.",

There\u2019s more people applying to state schools posting on here then you\u2019d think I feel like the T20s posts get big because everyone\u2019s heard of those schools. Something else to normalize tho: not applying to 10+ colleges lmaooo I thought I was weird for applying to 4 schools but then I did a poll on my personal account for other people at my high school and it\u2019s pretty normal actually",

There r other schools that r hella competitive and have the average around 1470 SAT and 4.7 GPAs. I am in a school where getting above a 4.0 GPA is normal and 1500/34 is considered to be average. That\u2019s why some of these kids r anxious even tho they have rly good stats. \nNow, I\u2019m not saying the rest r dumb, but each school has their own standards.

Get off your high horse bro. Most people who are described by my original comment are gonna go to a T20 school, get an office job making 80k a year, and live a mundane ass, typical life because of their mindset.

I probably spent too much time studying for this, and it's not something I use to lord myself over people and prop myself up as superior. And test scores are completely meaningless in the real world.
