  "text": "I\u2019ve been give an application fee waiver for a certain university, but idk how to use it. When I want to submit my application, it still asks me to pay, and there\u2019s no section for a fee waiver (keep in mind that this is a fee waiver for one specific university and not the general CA fee waiver). Has anyone ever done this? Plzzz help!!!",
