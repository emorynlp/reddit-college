  "text": "Over quarantine my cousin and I worked on three volunteer projects together and we both decided to write our college apps on it and he's a year older \n\nWhat I'm worried about is that my cousin put \"Founder\" when he applied to college last year when talking about these projects and I'm worried that if I put \"Co-Founder\" of XXX project (I'm applying this year), college admissions officers will think I'm lying if they recognize the name or etc and I would get punished. Am I worrying to much>",
