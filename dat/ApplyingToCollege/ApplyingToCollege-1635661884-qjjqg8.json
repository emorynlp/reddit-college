  "text": "I\u2019m deciding whether or not to apply ED to Cornell, with the issue being I could miss out on the possibility of deciding to go to the U of M with in-state tuition.\nMy parents make over 300K a year combined so we can afford it, but I\u2019m wondering whether I\u2019m being stupid or naive to want to pick Cornell. I feel like I\u2019d do better in the smaller classes and colleges, and I\u2019d like to branch out and move out of Ann Arbor. I really don\u2019t know much about job placements but I do know there are perks that come with an Ivy education, especially with Wall Street Stuff. I feel like the general environment at Cornell will be more enjoyable and beneficial for me but I don\u2019t know if all these reasons are enough to justify and extra 30-40K a year.",
