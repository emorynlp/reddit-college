      "text": "Hello! I am a current MOSTEC student and I was fortunate to get in with like some pretty mediocre stats. My advice for you is to really put your all into your essays, bc I think that\u2019s legit what will make or break you. Tbh STEM-wise before MOSTEC I don\u2019t think I was that impressive, but I was extremely passionate about what I did and I made sure to communicate that. Another reason I\u2019d strongly recommend taking the essays seriously is because they\u2019re good practice for your application season and will make things sooo much easier in the fall. Also, make sure to attend office hours/application workshops when you can and engage with the applicant server as those were really helpful as well. Good luck and feel free to pm me if you need anything!",
