  "text": "I'm a junior in high school and honors chemistry has been killing me all year. I've gone to tutoring, I've retaken quizzes and still my grade is subpar. My other grades are still relatively well, and yet I'm still worried about what colleges week think when they see my low chemistry grade (even though I want to major in English Literature). I'm not looking for sympathy or anything, I just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading.",

      "text": "I took honors chemistry in sophomore year, and it was by far one of the hardest classes I took (the labs and write-ups would take me over three hours long). I too am leaning towards humanities majors, so didn't even know why I took that class tbh. If it helps, one year or even five years from now you probably won't remember what grade you got in that class.",
