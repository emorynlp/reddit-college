Haven't even looked at their website, and I've only applied to my state school.\n\nEdit: also, SCAD - Savannah College of Art and Design in Georgia. Turns out it's a for-profit college and tuition is higher than their students. Can't afford it, and pretty much the only people that go  are the pretentious ones whose daddies paid for it out of pocket.",
