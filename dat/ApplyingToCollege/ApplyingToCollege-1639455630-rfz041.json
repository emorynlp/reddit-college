I thought it was a crazy idea when my oldest daughter\u2019s smart friend said that was her backup plan. Then I watched a few people do 1-year transfers to UCLA and Berkeley. For a few reasons a year of CC + TAG made more sense for my second daughter than the schools she was accepted to. It saved so much money and was definitely a better call than paying a lot if money for a school she wasn\u2019t in love with. And we have even better parental bragging rights. She is super smart AND practical. We are a family of academic snobs who undervalued CC but now so proud of her for getting a top-tier education at a bargain price.",

FAANG isn\u2019t prestige hungry, finance/banking is the main culprit of that. I see what you mean, but also consider this. You could go to a state school, try your ass off, be the top (which is easier at state), or you could be at a school where everyone is gunning for the same offers. Obviously you know what\u2019s best for you, but just wanted to put that out there. Let me link a post one sec",

Every school will have people who like it and people who hate it. Not all students and not even all internationals will have the same experience with the college. If you've done your research and feel like it's the right school for you you shouldn't let this scare you. From her stories I personally felt like I wouldn't enjoy it too much either but it's a personal opinion. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n(one thing to keep in mind tho is that they are not admitting internationals with a lot of financial need  anymore or at least that's what she heard from admissions people)\nGood luck with your college applications!",
