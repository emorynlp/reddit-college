  "text": "No one told me. Not my teachers, friends, and I consider myself a big \"college maniac\" but I never heard that the PSAT was important.... and now I feel like I missed out on a big opportunity.\n\nI'm taking the PSAT this week, and like most people, didn't study for it because well - it's studying for studying. Well, I overheard two boy's conversation today and apparently the PSAT is the only thing that qualifies you for national merit which can win you some full-rides at a lot of schools.\n\nI'm *extremely* heartbroken because this feels like such a big loss. My parents can't afford college and a full ride at any college would have helped me a lot. I'm appalled that no teacher, no counselor, no nothing ever told me this. Please, if you are a sophomore of a freshman, **study.**\n\nIt's basically free money thrown at you. STUDY FOR THE PSAT.\n\nAlso: if you guys know of *any,* and I mean *any* colleges that offer full-ride programs that don't need national merit to qualify and it's pretty easy to get in, please please let me know. I am petrified of coming out with debts.",

      "text": "I'm at Iowa State. University of Iowa & Iowa State both offer automatic scholarships based on GPA & ACT (would have to email if they can sub SAT. ACT is based in Iowa so). I'm full ride because of 3 different scholarships & Pell grant. There's a couple full tuition scholarships but no full CoA scholarships I know of. But I'm a hick from a graduating class of 20. ACT was 34 & 4.0, but still. \n\nState schools are amazing & your experience heavily depends on you, not the school. I have world class professors that do research with undergrads. I'm in the best program for my major in the nation. I go to the largest engineering career fair in America & have multiple ties to industry already as a sophomore, with internship offers to match them. The world is a lot bigger than t20's, & most leaders, scientists, engineers, etc don't come from them. Your pathway is what you make of it, with some luck thrown in. \n\nISU is top for ag engineering (mine), but also offers like 10 other engineering programs all pretty well ranked. Great in anything animal or ag related. Pretty decent college of design as well. \n\nU of I has great law, medicine, dental, health, etc. Also their graduate creative writing is world known.",

          "text": "I didn't study for the PSAT either. It was a fun test. Don't worry about it. Most college students don't even know national merit exists. \n\nI would however consider paying attention more. It seems like this was a big deal of importance to you, yet you didn't know how to get it. Be sure to read details when applying for scholarships in the future.\n\nAlso, if you don't get enough scholarships for a full-ride, go to community college to knock out pre reqs. Cheaper & better GPA \n\n\nBack to Iowa Schools, both have one apps. One application for hundreds of scholarships through the school. So you fill that out, FAFSA, before priority in December 1, & if you win any, you get emailed sporadically. The latest one I won was a month before college started, so it sucks for choosing. But the automatic ones are, automatic. So that's quick feedback.",
