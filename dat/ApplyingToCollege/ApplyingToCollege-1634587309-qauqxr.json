  "text": "How is UPenn for biology in CAS? I\u2019m also considering having a second major in the engineering school later on, potentially for computer science or bioengineering. Any insight as to how these programs are at UPenn? I\u2019d be interested in taking a management class/minor as well, such as the healthcare management minor or environmental management minor, but of course Wharton is incredible. \n\nThanks!",
