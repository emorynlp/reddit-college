  "title:": "Thinking of a Gap Year Before Applying To Colleges",
  "text": "I am a senior in my high school and preparing for the joint entrance examination in my country. My marks are average and above average. I am in the top 5%-10% of my class. \n\nI want to pursue Computer Science in a good university. But the chances getting into an US university on a full ride are pretty slim. So I have been thinking of taking a gap year so that,you know get better ECs, participate in major events. But even then I still think getting a full ride in a top-tier University seems the same like it would be now. \n\nAlso,My SAT score are almost 1600(no superscore,gave it once scored 1598). My TOEFL marks is 120.\n\nWhat should I do? help?\n\nShould I take a year gap? \n\nAlso, full scholarship is a necessity without which it would be almost next to impossible to study abroad for me.",

I understand the end of 12th grade you gotta do a shitload of projects+study for preboards so there's no point having more stuff to stress about.\n\nYou can ask your parents/guardian to take care of the application as much as they can for now and apply to the colleges you want this year. If you don't get in you always have an extra year! \n\nAt least that's what I'd do( take my advise with a grain of salt.)",

Try to strengthen your existing application in the next couple of months and go ahead with applying to a few select universities.",
