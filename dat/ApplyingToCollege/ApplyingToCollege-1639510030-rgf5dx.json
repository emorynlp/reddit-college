              "text": "Yes, I did apply to UIUC! In regards to engineering and computer science, it is most definitely one of the top schools in the nation and its programs are excellent. However, it's important to note that the seemingly high acceptance rate at 63% isn't representative of your chances of getting in because it really depends on your major. Since it is so highly regarded and ranked in engineering, admission for engineering majors is much more difficult and has an acceptance rate a whole lot lower than 63%.\n\nBut for pretty much any other major besides engineering or CS, I would say UIUC isn't anything too special compared to your typical state school and is relatively easy to get into. For example, I put Biochemistry as my major and I, along with many others in my school/state with average and/or relatively high stats, consider UIUC as our safety school. Don't get me wrong, it's still a pretty good school academically but if you're looking for and value prestige as a non-engineering or non-CS major, it may not offer the same \"oomph\" as say, a T-20 private university.\n\nAlso, just my general thoughts of UIUC outside of academics. I've visited the campus and I know dozens of people who are currently students (I would say UIUC is the most popular school kids in my area go to). The social setting (besides the in-state tuition) is honestly one of the biggest reasons why it is one of my top choices if I end up getting rejected from all of my reaches. Even if you're not interested in greek life (which I  am definitely avoiding), you can still have a good social life while balancing it well with academics.\n\nMost major downside for me is the location. It's pretty much located in the middle of nowhere (as we like to say here in Illinois, it's in the cornfields) but the college town makes up for it, especially since UIUC has such a large and diverse undergraduate population. There's an abundance of places to eat and especially with its large Asian demographic, there's so many good Asian restaurants and boba shops. Plus, Chicago is only around 2 hours away so you could always go on a quick trip there with your friends if you get bored of Urbana-Champaign. The campus is huge and beautiful as well.\n\nSorry if that was super long. Let me know if you have any questions :)",

If you live in Cali/GA/TX/Washington and do well in school it's either much easier or straight up guaranteed admission to your flagship university for competitive majors (Washington CS, UT CS, GT CS). In Illinois, they don't really give a shit if you're in state or not, because they make more money from out of state students and there is no law or requirement saying they have to accept X percentage of instate students like there is in other states. UIUC is literally building a recruiting office in New Delhi to try to draw more international CS students instead of spending it on in state people. Our in state tuition is also really high (relatively) and there aren't any decent scholarships (again, unlike Georgia). Plus we pay batshit insane property tax.",
