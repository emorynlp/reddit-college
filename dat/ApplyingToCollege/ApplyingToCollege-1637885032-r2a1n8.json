  "title:": "A Success Story",
  "text": "A short success story that I hope helps you distress. College admissions are a big part of your lives but the best advice I can give is to calm down and don't overthink. Last year I did my common app and College essays all in 1 day.  In total I applied to 10 colleges and I got acceepted to all of them. Ultimately I chose to go to Umich and am currently a freshman there. My essays, I can guarantee, are/were worse than yours. Ultimately my success wasn't based on the quality if my essay but rather then story I told within my essay. As long as its good and shows your passion or real you, I'm sure you'll do fine.\n\nThe details are scarce and the grammar is worse, but I hope this story helped you in some way. Stay loose, don't think about it to much, and put your best foot forward. Even if your essay isn't top tier, just make sure it tells your story and conveys it to the reader.",
