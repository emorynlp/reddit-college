  "text": "I recently submitted my Common App for UMD and Northeastern about 2 days ago and have not received any confirmation from either college about them receiving my application.\n\nI also realized I was missing my SSN and that my GPA was slightly off, so I emailed each college about that. Received a response from Northeastern and an automated email from UMD, but no actual response from UMD.\n\nI just want to make sure I did not mess anything up, since I find it weird I got confirmation from Common App but not the colleges themselves, and it isn't helping that I am the first to do this in my family.",
