                  "text": "Princeton is very good for theoretical computer science (better than Cornell), not sure about industry; the course selection is a little lacking in comparison to Cornell\u2019s. Cornell is also straight up better for artificial intelligence, which pretty much everyone wants to go into. \n\nHarvard undergrad CS is also good, but not better than Cornell or Princeton. For undergrad, however, it doesn\u2019t really matter (if I could get in, I would probably go to Harvard over both Cornell and pton lol). \n\nI\u2019ve also heard that Harvard\u2019s graduate CS program is somewhat poor. You\u2019ll notice that all of Harvard\u2019s Turing Award laureates didn\u2019t major in CS, but instead some related field like applied math or physics.",

The people on this sub though are mostly in the top 1% of test takers, want to major in CS and are major clout-chasers which does not represent the real-world ED applicant pool. Don't worry about things you can't control like number of applicants, and enjoy shitpost wednesday while it lasts",
