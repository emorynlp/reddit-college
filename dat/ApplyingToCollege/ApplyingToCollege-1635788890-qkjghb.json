They all offer quality education and they're friendly towards internationals (or at least they have a sizeable population of them).\n\nI think some will say that it's a reach but seems possible with your stats. I have a senior who got into Harvard with lesser stats (SAT-1500, GPA-3.1ish if we convert from A-level style grades) than you (also severe grade deflation).",
