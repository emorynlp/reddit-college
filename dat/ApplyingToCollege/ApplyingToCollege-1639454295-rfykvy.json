  "text": "hi y'all! i'm adding to the string of encouragement for all the seniors who are getting their ea/ed decisions this week. as a college freshman, i can assure you that everything will be fine in the end, and as daunting as it sounds, you'll be proud of yourself even if the path you end up in isn't the one you planned for.\n\ni got rejected ed from my dream school and felt so crushed last year. i had friends who'd gotten in their dream schools, and friends who also got rejected. it was a hard time for me to see people celebrating and posting on social media, and while i felt happy for them, it always crushed me that, in the competition between my classmates and i, i'd lost. as cliched as it sounds, PLEASE DON'T TIE YOUR SELF WORTH TO AN ARBITRARY DECISION FROM A COLLEGE! you're only competing against yourself, and compared to where you were a year ago, two years ago, at the beginning of high school, you've grown so much. \n\ni was always one to seek validation from others. if i achieved something i'd always tell my family and friends, and sometimes even teachers. but i realized how shallow and toxic this is, and especially when  others also expect validation from you and project their successes onto you at the cost of your failures.  as such, people who are celebrating do deserve it, but that shouldn't determine how valued they, or you, are. you can feel sad, angry, overwhelmed, hopeless, and do let your emotions out freely (call a friend, take a long walk, write a long rant), but move on. \n\ni'm sure there have been instances where you looked back at your past \"failures\" and wished you didn't spend so much time mulling over it. don't let a rejection become that \"failure.\" instead, it'll become your success story later on in life: when you get into an amazing school in the rd round, when you step onto your college campus on the first day of school... the only remedy might be time here, but reassure yourself that everything will be alright. \n\ni ended up at a college (t20 but not ivies) that i love, and i wouldn't trade an acceptance into my ed school for this. colleges don't determine your worth, and it's their loss that you aren't attending that school. think about everything you've done for your community, and i don't mean it in a pretentious, resume-packing way, but the times you've reassured your friends, the times you've worked so hard for a project, the times you've come up with brilliant ideas. the fact that your dream ed school isn't getting  any of that proves how much they're losing. \n\ni know it's hard right now, but don't give up! frankly, don't make excuses to hate the ed school you got rejected from, but find hope in other places. you're going to end up where you need to be, and honestly, you'll find great communities and resources wherever you end up. \n\nif you got in ed, congrats! this is probably the happiest moment of your life and you deserve the fruits of your hard work. do be considerate to the ed-rejectees though, and instead of showing off your acceptances (even in a subtle or unconscious way), try to encourage your friends who got rejected/ deferred, and over them some advice too.",
