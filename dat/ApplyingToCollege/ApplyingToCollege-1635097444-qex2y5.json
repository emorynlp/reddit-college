  "text": "My sister and mother want me to add to make essay how much I love computer science and how much I want to go to college. \nI think my college essay is fine the way it is. It\u2019s about my struggles with feeling isolated and being bullied has a child, and how I began putting effort into changing my situation by committing to slowly changes like doing things I\u2019m afraid of: like talking to people. My essay is about working towards improvement and taking things one step at a time. \nI really don\u2019t want to sudden change the ending to computer science and saying how I really want to get into college. I do not even know if I like computer science enough to choose it for my career, I just choose a major I semi-enjoy. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m going to change majors.\nMy counselor said my essay was good so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s terrible. I\u2019m thinking about just telling my mom I don\u2019t want to change it and submit my essay with the edits my counselor did.",

At the end of the day,it's your essay and you must have kept in mind what you wanted to write and followed a theme and executed it to your best ability.\nRandomly putting CS in the middle of it would make it seem very unprofessional and weird and that's something you don't really want to do.",
