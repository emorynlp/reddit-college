      "text": "Depends a bit on field within engineering. \n\nIf you want to go into biomedical engineering, JHU is terrific - that is by far their biggest engineering major.\n\nThey are good in other fields too (chemical especially), but it's a pretty different environment from the big state schools - a lot fewer students, and a higher proportion planning on going straight to grad school instead of working with a BS.",

              "text": "It's not my field at all, but I would think JHU is going to have a lot of research opportunities on the soft side of materials - biomaterials, nano materials, things like that.  Basically the opposite side compared to somewhere like the Colorado School of Mines that would focus on metallurgy and ceramics.\n\nSomewhere like UIUC is going to have more breadth in the field as a much larger department - if you aren't sure you want to go into the specific areas that JHU's professors are doing research in I wouldn't choose it.",
