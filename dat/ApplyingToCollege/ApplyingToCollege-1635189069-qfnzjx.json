  "title:": "How to send Oct. 23 ACT scores to my ED school if the scores come out after Nov. 1?",
  "text": "I\u2019m applying ED to UPenn (due Nov. 1) and on their website it says they accept ACT scores from October test dates.  However, since ACT scores usually take at least 10 days to be released, this means the earliest my score will be out is Nov. 2. How am I supposed to send UPenn my scores if they come out after the deadline?",

      "text": "From their website:\n\n>Penn will review self-reported SAT and ACT test scores from first-year applicants with some exceptions. Recruited athletes who submit standardized testing as part of their application are also required to submit official testing through the appropriate testing agency or University-approved source. Also, any students required to submit English-language proficiency exams must have official results sent through official testing agencies to be considered with a student\u2019s application.  \n>  \n>To self-report your scores, use the testing section of the Common Application, Coalition Application, or QuestBridge Application. To ensure accurate super scoring (taking the highest composite score across multiple sittings), we recommend that you self-report each test you have taken to select the highest score in each section. **You may also report your scores directly through your Penn Applicant Portal once your application is received.** (Note: if you are using the Common Application, your scores will not appear in the PDF preview but we will still receive them.)",
