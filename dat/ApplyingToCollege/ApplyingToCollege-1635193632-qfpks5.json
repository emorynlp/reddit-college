  "text": "I am an international student not applying for aid, and Barnard is one of my top choices. But, I know I will be limited in my budget during my entire college life since my parents will be paying. Barnard is very expensive; How do broke students manage life in Barnard, if there are any? And also please leave some advice for applying as well. \n\nI appreciate you taking out your time to answer. Thank you so much. \n\nAny information helps!",

      "text": "Hi, I applied ED to Barnard as an international from India. Now I really don\u2019t want to discourage you at all but Barnard barely gives aid to international students and as far as I know they don\u2019t have merit scholarships as well. If your EFC is low it might hurt your chances a little + living in NYC is not cheap at all. My parents were pretty reluctant with the cost as well since it goes up to 80k usd per year for internationals. Maybe you can try similar schools like Barnard who might give you a little more money? Like I\u2019m applying for aid at Bryn mawr, Drexel and Fordham",
