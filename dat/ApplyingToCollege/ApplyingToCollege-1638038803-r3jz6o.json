  "text": "So I've heard a couple different things about whether or not senior year GPA matters\n\n1. I've heard that they can see your grades on your transcript, but it doesn't get weighed into your cumulative GPA.\n2. I've heard that it does get weighed into your cumulative GPA if you apply regular decision.\n3. I've heard that if you apply early decision they don't see it when applying, but they do request it later on\n\nWhich one/ones are true?",

      "text": "ED1/EA colleges may or may not request first quarter grades, which will be considered in evaluating your application. For ED2/RD colleges and any deferrals from ED1/EA, midyear reports will be required by many, and those grades will be considered in evaluating your application. Your final grades from second semester will only be sent to the college you commit to, so it\u2019s only important that your performance doesn\u2019t significantly worsen.",

      "text": "I would say number one is accurate. For most colleges, your cumulative GPA is for grades 9-11. Senior year grades matter (a lot, in many cases) but they often aren\u2019t calculated into the cumulative GPA since they don\u2019t represent a full year of work. These details, like many things in the college admissions process, can vary from college to college.",

      "text": "Whether they say \u201cthe GPA dropped to a 3.7 after including four Bs and a C as Senior year grades\u201d or \u201cthey had a 3.9 through Junior year but have four Bs, and a C for Senior year grades\u201d isn\u2019t a meaningful difference.\n\nThey will look at and use your most recent grades, indicating your most recent performance in high school, regardless of the mechanics.\n\nED decisions are often made before Senior grads are available, but all schools,will require final grades and expect at least similar performance to that used for your acceptance.",
