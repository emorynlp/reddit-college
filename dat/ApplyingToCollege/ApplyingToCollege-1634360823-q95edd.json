  "text": "I just spent weeks working on my UNC Chapel Hill application to submit EA. I was triple checking everything on my application and pressed submit at 11:02 P.M. Central Time, but it was due at 11:59 P.M. EASTERN TIME. So basically I have to wait 2 extra months because I submitted three minutes late. That's what I get for reviewing so close to the deadline ig. I can't believe I didn't think about time zones. I'm posting this so hopefully nobody does this on a deadline that is more important like RD. Good luck to everyone applying to schools and don't do what I did lmaoo",
