  "text": "It\u2019s not the writing itself that\u2019s the problem, I\u2019m actually pretty good (I think) at writing it, but as a transfer student, when they\u2019re asking me what I did as extracurricular, activities, or to prepare for my career, I really didn\u2019t do much except study for my classes, take care of my younger sister, work sometimes, and be depressed. Like what do I even say to them",
