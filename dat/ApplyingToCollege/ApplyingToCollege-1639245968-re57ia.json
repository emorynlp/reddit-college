  "text": "Hi A2C, i\u2019ve already submitted all my applications so this won\u2019t make a difference but i\u2019m still curious. I go to a performing arts magnet school, and though it\u2019s public they don\u2019t grant out awards for academic and excellence because that\u2019s the \u201cstandard\u201d at our school anyway. I am a 4.0 student, with three extracurriculars under my belt ( an honor society, a business, and african student association.) But I don\u2019t have any awards besides the titles I\u2019ve gotten in my honor society, i\u2019m currently the secretary. When I was in eighth grade and graduated, I received a stamped seal from President General J Trump for academic excellence. I forgot about this during my entire application process, so naturally I left it out of my application. I was complaining to my dad about how we didn\u2019t get awarded for anything at my high school, he said \u201cwell you should\u2019ve put that down that would\u2019ve been a really good award.\u201d But I was also under the impression that awards meant ones that we were granted in high school, not prior. Did i miss out tremendously? Or is it something I should just let go lol. I\u2019ve gotten accepted into 4/17 schools i\u2019ve applied to so far, so obviously not having anything in the awards section didn\u2019t harm my application too much. Just feel like i may be overthinking it",

      "text": "Regardless of which president signed the award, an award from eighth grade is pretty useless anyway (I have one too). I doubt they would have held which president was in office against you, though, because you would have just called it the \"Presidential Award of Excellence\" or whatever the certificate says, I'm sure it's not a program specific to his administration and it's likely something all presidential administrations do.",
