  "text": "Dude it makes me sad. I am in the top 10 at my school stats-wise and completed the most community service projects and major-related extracurriculars, but I decided to go to CC to save money. \n\nImmediately, all the work I did was discounted by everybody. During the senior commitment week, our school is posting seniors pursuing higher education, and on the front of every post, they highlight the kids going to four years, and shove all the cc kids in the back using the multiple picture post feature. It's awful and discounts the hard work we call did. I've gotten made fun of for choosing community multiple times, and when registering for my spot I had to fight for attention because another student was getting help committing to a four year. \n\nDude I just want some credit for the work I did and the choice I made. Community is awesome! I just wish there wasn't a stigma around it, it makes me feel shitty.",

I don't think I did much, except learning how much pressure kids are under and make sure he feels no pressure from me. I should probably unsubscribe now that he's been accepted somewhere. I just see these posts from suffering kids pop up in my feed and then I want to say something to make them feel better.",

CC is just the same type of course work as a four year college, it\u2019s just cheaper and class sizes are generally smaller. All the classes at my CC have a strict max capacity of 30, so no lecture halls of 200 kids, which actually can make the education better. People need to stop spreading the narrative that the only people who go to CC didn\u2019t get good grades or whatever.

The second you graduate and get out of that environment, you\u2019ll wonder why you cared so much what everyone else thought. It sounds like you are happy with your decision, as you very well should be! I know plenty of people whose kids begged to go to colleges they knew they couldn\u2019t afford. In nearly all of the cases, they gave in because they wanted their child to be \u201cproud\u201d of where they were attending (i.e. so they could flex to other kids). Also because the parents thought it gave them status sending their kids to private universities. But those \u201cbragging rights\u201d are very short-lived, and most came to regret their decision when they were saddled with hundreds of thousands of debt (and that number is not an exaggeration, sadly). Without knowing anything else about you, the fact that you are being financially smart about college shows a level of maturity that is admirable. I have a feeling you will be just fine.",
