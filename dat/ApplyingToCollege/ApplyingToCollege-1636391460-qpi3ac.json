  "text": "Wsg A2C, \n\nI am currently writing the Cornell Supp. I am recalling and writing what a friend of mine who is also from a big city said about Ithaca. I want to add emphasis by having the quote say \u201cIthaca is NOTHING like *city*. But there\u2019s a beauty in that because you can always find a way to create your own fun.\u201d Does the all caps ruin anything? Does it add the emphasis and tone that I\u2019m going for? He said it in like a colloquiual/playful way, certainly not to demonize Ithaca, so I don\u2019t want to do that either. I want to add the all caps because I think it adds some personality, but I\u2019m not sure how an AO would read that quote.",
