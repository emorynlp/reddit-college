  "text": "It was just average, I guess. It didn't feel like a \"conversation\" like most posts I've seen, it was just interviewer asks a question, I respond for a few minutes, he says an anecdote that relates to my response, then we move on to the next question or a follow-up question. I'm curious if this is what most people experience in their interview or if I'm supposed to say more?\n\nIf anyone wants to know the questions I got asked, I can put the ones I remember in a comment but tbh they were all pretty generic",
