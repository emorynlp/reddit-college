      "text": "Apologies for the delayed response here, but I just noticed this post. Hoping you or others could still find this helpful, so please feel free to message me if you have any questions! \n\nThe InitialView interview is not school-specific, so you would be able to send it to as many schools as you want at no additional cost. It isn\u2019t a a requirement, but you can think of it as \u201cmore evidence\u201d that an admissions counselor can bring to the table when they are advocating for you in committee. Schools have software integrations that make the InitialView interview automatically sit in the student file, so if there is one, many admissions officers will click on the video while reviewing the other materials (i.e. your activities/EC list). It provides additional context and literally brings your voice into the admissions committee room. \n\nIf a college is offering you a fee waiver, that\u2019s even more of a reason to do it \u2014 it means they would really appreciate more context for knowing you better!
