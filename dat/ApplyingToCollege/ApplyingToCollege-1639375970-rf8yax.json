  "text": "Completed a 3 year Australian bachelor's degree in psychology, but now I need to extend it to a 4 year.\n\nUnfortunately I don't qualify for the 4th year (honors) as in Australia they require a distinction average, I'd have to re-take a lot of subjects to raise my GPA just to qualify...\n\nSo, I'm wondering if there's another way to get a 4th year? I contacted a few US universities and they would only accept 60 hours of credit, so, I'd be looking at 2 years of full time study; Australia is likely the same as I'd need to study a double major degree.\n\nI only need a 4 year bachelor's degree so that I can obtain a US state teaching license as I've already met all the other requirements.",
