  "title:": "How much do lower grades 1st semester of senior year matter?",
  "text": "I have pretty average stats, a 3.9 weighted GPA and a 3.6 unweighted and i didn't take the SAT or ACT. I usually get mostly As with a few Bs but this semester I have been struggling and I am expecting to get 1 A, 2Bs and possibly a C (if not then 1A, 3B) how badly will this look on my transcripts and will colleges reject me or rescind their offers because of this? I applied to the UCs, a few CSU, as well as Colorado state, Colorado Boulder and University of Denver",
