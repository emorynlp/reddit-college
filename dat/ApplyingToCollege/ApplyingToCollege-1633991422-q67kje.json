  "text": "Hello everyone! So I\u2019m applying to transfer from a California CC to UCB next fall and I\u2019m working on my PIQ\u2019s rn. I\u2019m hoping if there\u2019s anyone who can offer me some tips or advice on how to write really good ones. I especially wanna know some tips on writing heavier topics that might include mentions of death and illness and suicide. \nI had some health related issues that prevented me from going to school in person even before COVID (I took all online courses) and I wanna write about it bc it did actually help me grow and mature even tho it was really hard to recover from but I don\u2019t wanna be too detailed ab it because it\u2019s still a sensitive topic. So how should I go about writing such heavy, personal topics without turning them into sob stories or making it seem like I\u2019m writing it just for sympathy points (which I\u2019m not)\nThanks in advance!\n\n(This is a crosspost. I have already posted this in r/transferstudents but didn\u2019t get any responses yet)",
