      "text": "What I did was I went into the interview thinking that it wasn't a \"Question and Answer\" type of thing. It's literally like meeting a stranger on the bus and having a conversation with them. I just spoke whatever I wanted to and for as long as I wanted to. They want humans not robots who just answer their questions. It's more of like oh this is me and I can't wait to get to know you as well.",
