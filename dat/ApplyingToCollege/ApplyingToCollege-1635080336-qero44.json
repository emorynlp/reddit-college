  "text": "Hi, I would like to ask will NYU ED and Purdue EA accept TOEFL official scores that arrive late? (Does anyone have experience?)\nOr will they accept self-report and wait for your official score?                                                        Ps I got my score at September, but I accidentally forgot to report because I was focusing on the essays...\nI got a 100 on TOEFL\n\nI checked UMichs website and they allow, NYU said they also do but they can\u2019t tell if you\u2019ll get killed first, and Purdue simply says all things have to be done before deadline, but I\u2019m not sure if this means self-report or official score.",
