  "text": "I have genuinely never wanted to move away far far far FAR from home more than tonight.\n\nIt\u2019s 11 pm, and I\u2019m literally sleeping when my dad, who is so fucking drunk, barges into my room and starts *interrogating* me on why I tutor math and make $20 an hour. \n\nHe tells me that I\u2019m a useless piece of shit for having to reschedule my tutoring session because \u201cunlike a doctor, I\u2019m clearly not respected because why do I needed to take the other person\u2019s schedule into account.\u201d He screamed that $20 per hour is NOTHING compared to what I apparently will start making as soon I step foot on an ivy.\n\nExcuse you, wtf?? I\u2019m the one who rescheduled in the first place because my mom couldn\u2019t give me a ride. And plus, isn\u2019t it basic human decency to be considerate (like how my student is to me?) Also, I\u2019m 17 and $20 is a lot???\n\nThen he goes on to ask me *why* I have to tutor people. He\u2019s said \u201cdo you really value tutoring that much? to us, the most important thing right now is you getting into a good college and us crushing [insert friend name\u2019s daughter].\u201d\n\nGuess what. First of all, I *have* to do it because I was already paid. Second, have you considered the fact that maybe I just enjoy teaching others? Third, you just openly admitted that you\u2019re using me to make yourself feel better among your friends.\n\nMy mom then comes in and legit gaslights me. \u201cYour dad just loves you too much. He has good intentions. Don\u2019t overthink this.\u201d\n\nIdk about you but I don\u2019t want love if it\u2019s like this.\n\np.s. he\u2019s never supportive of anything I do when he\u2019s sober either. he tells me that I waste my time by doing ECs that I\u2019m passionate about, but brags to his friends when I make it into competitive programs/competitions THANKS to those ECs. I\u2019m just so tired of this negativity, because it\u2019s so hard for me to be kind to myself since I\u2019m constantly told that I\u2019ll never be enough.",

Your dad is trying to live vicariously through you because of his insecurities and trying to use your success to prove that he's not a failure. \n\nThe fact that you can work so hard in the first place in such shitty conditions proves your character, and you're far more mature than he will ever be. You will be successful, and once you're an adult, you're under no obligation to share it with people who were hindering you.\n\nJust bear it a little longer- you'll be free soon.",

Tbh don\u2019t care that much about your dad bc he wasn\u2019t conscious at that moment and wasn\u2019t really in his senses. Even in a drunken state your dad was concerned about you and this really shows how much he cares about you. Don\u2019t let your Dad\u2019s or someone else\u2019s words be a hindrance towards your goal or what do love to do. I know it\u2019s tough but stay strong. What you\u2019re doing at this age is amazing especially considering those circumstances. I know it\u2019s tough but stay strong. Indeed, Your Hardwork will prove your dad wrong.",
