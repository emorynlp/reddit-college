  "title:": "did i screw up the covid section?",
  "text": "i applied to a couple schools rea/ea, and in the covid info section, i used one sentence on how long my school has been online, and another describing my current living situation (i sleep and attend zoom school in my parents\u2019 living room due to the lockdown). the rest of the section was about four programs/ events that i was meant to be a part of, but was unable to join since i didn\u2019t have a vaccine in time (these were all super selective events that are super linked to what i want to study, and two are like the \u201cflagship\u201d events for their fields). i also mentioned if i participated virtually instead.\n\ni didn\u2019t bother doing much research on the section beforehand, since i figured this was more a direct prompt than anything else. but i just scrolled through other reddit posts and discovered that you\u2019re not meant to use the section unless there are severe/ long term impacts? so i\u2019m freaking out bc i\u2019m pretty sure i\u2019m going to come across as a self-centred b!tch \ud83d\ude2d",

I included a small bit about how I wasn't able to take a sport as well as my mental health struggle due to it that dragged down by junior year grades. Don't freak out too much, is what I'm trying to say. You will be perfectly alright. I doubt that section will make or break your entire application",

              "text": "No, it shouldn't. The covid section is to talk about the meaningful ways that covid affected a person. If you don't think covid made any meaningful disruptions in your life, then it's not going to screw you over to leave it blank. As I said, the section is probably not going to make or break your essay. That applies if you didn't do it either. Don't worry about it.",
