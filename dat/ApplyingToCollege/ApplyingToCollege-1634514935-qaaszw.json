  "text": "Hi guys, wondering if any of you know how accurate the college acceptance rate predictors of sites like college vine, college ai, and Parchment are. \n\nSome have you enter more information than others but the ranges they give me are pretty similar. Anyone have experience with these who's applied to college afterward?",

      "text": "I'm not really sure, as I'm someone who just got into this college application scene. However, CollegeVine was already a little weird for me because one of the schools I'm applying to is completely test blind (they don't even LOOK at test scores in the admission process) and they gave me a chance that was significantly higher (\\~15% higher) if I apply WITH SAT scores. \n\nTake that with a grain of salt though since I haven't applied/gotten results from anywhere yet.",

      "text": "does your school have Naviance? on mine, it shows the stats of ALL the past student alumni and every single school that past students applied to and whether they got rejected/accepted/waitlisted depending on their stats (SAT & GPA). It's very helpful because it lets you know exactly how you stand in comparison to people who attended your school. Even if your school doesn't have Naviance I think it's worth asking your counselors if you can have access to similar data!",

If you use Naviance with your school, they\u2019ll use something similar, but will gauge based on the information they have of yours (sorry, I\u2019m not necessarily good at explaining.)\n\nSome people would suggest chanceme, I would argue against that. The better option would be r/collegeresults IMO. Search your school and see results based on who was accepted/who wasn\u2019t/who was waitlisted! I\u2019m applying myself, and that\u2019s how I\u2019ve gauged my \u201codds.\u201d I haven\u2019t used any other programs a la collegevine though, so I cant say what my thoughts there are.",
