Something must have gone terribly wrong, and if is hasn't already it will. Maybe my essays were sent to the wrong school, or my AO will have a personal grudge against me, or there was a typo in my GPA and I will be auto rejected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know how I'll feel opening it: a sick kind of dread, which I'll force down and pretend I've already accepted my rejection. But if I actually get rejected I'll be DEVASTATED. The thing that puzzles me is that I have NO IDEA how I'll feel if I'm accepted. I'm an eternal pessimist and IDK if I can just let myself enjoy it.",
