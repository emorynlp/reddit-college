Excluding pure conservatories (e.g. Curtis, Berklee) unless attached to a university (e.g. Eastman/Rochester), here are the names that come up most frequently (in no particular order):\n\nYale\n\nNorthwestern (Bienen)\n\nHopkins/Peabody\n\nVanderbilt\n\nRice (Shepherd)\n\nUSC (Thornton)\n\nNYU (Steinhardt)\n\nRochester/Eastman\n\nMiami (Frost)\n\nMichigan\n\nFlorida State\n\nIndiana/Jacobs\n\nU. of North Texas (Jazz especially)\n\nOberlin\n\nSt. Olaf (choral especially)\n\nU. of Cincinnati/CCM\n\nNote: these are just \"strong music programs\" in general; not specifically for music history, production or musicology.",
