  "text": "my dream school is mit and i applied there ea. everyone around me is telling me that im guaranteed to get in and blowing up my ego. so the realistic side of me knows ill get rejected, but the other side of me is convinced ill get in. all i know for sure is that it'll hurt when i inevitably get rejected. i don't think i have a chance at deferral even with like 80% of ea applicants getting deferred. please humble me before i delude myself so much that i cant even imagine not getting in on saturday",

      "text": "Honestly... I was in the exact same situation as you. My friends kept saying that I will be the first one in the school's history to get into Stanford and guess what: I got rejected, not even deferred. It hurts but I feel like when the decision comes out you will be back to reality, so why not enjoy a bit of self encouragement by imagining that you got in? But use the rejection simulator as a way to soften the blow tho... Good luck, I believe in you!",
