  "text": "I've been in my school's student council every year and was just elected to the executive student council this year (my senior year), and since I've had different positions each year I don't know how I can fit that all into the activities section of the common app. I can barely list all the titles in the Position/Leadership description\u2014it looks like this: Treasurer, President, Officer, Exec Pres (9 - 12).\n\nI worry that if I include all of them in one activity my description would have to be a bit vague, i.e organized events and fundraisers etc., so does anybody know a better way to do this? Thanks",
