  "title:": "Should I be a Political Science Major?",
  "text": "I'm 17 and a senior. A lot of deadlines are coming up in January and I felt pretty confident in being a political science major for awhile now. I take interest in politics, and wanted to do something with policy analysis (concentrating on public policy, or alternatively environmental policy) or as an alternative career option urban planning. I also though minoring in an environmental science, economics, sociology, or just something that would pair well for more career options in the future. I don't plan on becoming a legislator or anything like that, I have social anxiety so I don't think I could do a job that social.\n\nSpeaking of social anxiety, I don't want to limit myself because of it. I grew up in a rural area that had nothing around so I spend most the time inside. Recently I've been getting better and hoped College would help me with it even more.\n\nI've recently heard though many Poli Sci grads are miserable and didn't even get a job they wanted, and it was all a waste. I don't have many other interests in majors besides Environmental Studies/Science, Anthropology, and Sociology. All of which (besides environmental sci) are even worse from what I've heard when it comes to getting a satisfying career in it.\n\nSo I guess what I'm asking is, is poli sci a huge mistake? What major or minor could I do instead? Am I just overthinking? Any other comments or help I welcome and appreciate :)",

      "text": "A few things: \n\n* You're a senior in high school. Unless you're planning on studying outside the US or if you're applying to a handful of very specific programs, you still have plenty of time to choose an exact major. It sounds like you should take a few poli sci / government courses in college and see if it's your cup of tea. \n* On your Common App, just put down the major that matches the most with your activities and your profile. Again, unless you're applying to a special program, these major choices are in no way binding and you can major in anything you want once you're in college.\n* I think you're overstating the link between major and career quality. Yes, there are plenty of poli sci grads that are miserable, but that's the case for any major. On the other hand, there are also plenty of poli sci grads that have a career that they love. At the end of the day, it's your own effort and drive that determines whether you succeed.",

Some other schools (Penn, USC, etc.) have a philosophy politics and economics major if you want even more interdisciplinarity.",

      "text": "I went into college apps as a political science major. I ended up going to a community college because of the pandemic and financial issues under a political science major too. After two years I can confidently say that as someone who likes politics that it was a fun major to learn about. I took classes on comparative politics, political philosophy, international relations, and more. It eventually led me to taking a journalism class which I now intend to do as my major and career after college. Just letting you know it\u2019s okay not to know, that\u2019s what the first few years of college are for, to explore and take classes that are related to what you like and hone in on what you want to do.",
