  "text": "I am an international student living in the Middle East, however unlike in America or other areas of the world, options for volunteering, competition, and any other extracurricular activity are extremely restricted. That is, there were a few already, but due to the pandemic that began here in March 2020, it is now nearly non-existent. Do colleges care about the country from where each applicant comes and are they aware of the vast inequalities in access to such things?",

They admissions officer might not know the exact town youre from but even just knowing the country plays a huge roll so they will not penalize you for not doing something if u never had the opportunity to do it",
