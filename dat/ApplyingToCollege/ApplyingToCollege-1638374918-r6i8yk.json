  "text": "one of my teacher recommenders mentioned a specific school in her recommendation letter for my commonapp (she didn\u2019t know that this was not allowed). i\u2019ve only sent it to that school, not any of my others\u2014none of my schools have received a letter of recommendation with the wrong school name. however, i would really like to submit her generic recommendation letter to my other colleges. unfortunately, commonapp will not let me remove her as a recommender or submit a new letter. my only idea was to submit her recommendation letter under someone else\u2019s email, but that comes back with an error message. is there any way to fix this? i don\u2019t want to contact the individual schools because none of them have actually received an erroneous letter or my commonapp in general.",
