  "title:": "How much does Savings affect FAFSA?",
  "text": "To be brief, my Mom gave me a gift of money earlier this year, because she got it in her head that I needed to be a homeowner... This money is STRICTLY for use on the down payment of a condo, but I can't actually afford to get a condo on what I make currently.  Whatever.  But I want to go back to college in the Fall of 2022 and I've been working on everything I need to do.  \n\nToday, I started filling out the FAFSA and there is a section that asks how much I am worth - including what is in my savings, which has a very small amount of my own money that I have saved up for school... and that gift from my Mom.  I'm sure the government won't care that a big chunk of my net worth is not actually mine to use unless I want to buy a condo, they'll just see how much I have total.\n\nSo my question is - how much is that gift from my Mom going to affect my financial aid?  Should I say \"Thanks Mom, but it's not a good time for me to be purchasing a home\" and try to get her to take her money back as to not skew my financial situation?  I also want to be as honest as I can in this whole process and that money is not something I earned or saved for my own personal use... Thanks in advance for any advice.",

I forget the actual numbers, but it\u2019s like 20% vs 5% or something like that.",
