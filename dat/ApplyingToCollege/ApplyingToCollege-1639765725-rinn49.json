  "text": "I\u2019m considered an international student even though I\u2019ve lived in the U.S for 7 years. It just really really sucks, I don\u2019t have the ability to change my visa status really fast for this. The American immigration process sucks, but so does living in a third world country where your talents will be wasted.\nI feel like I\u2019m in an awkward situation, I don\u2019t know if I have anywhere else to go. \nI just got rejected from Notre Dame, I really really wanted to go.\nI\u2019ve worked so hard in my classes but I still couldn\u2019t get the SAT score I wanted because my parents always wanted me to help around the house and sincerely I barely had time to study. \nI applied test optional and I know they say it won\u2019t hurt but I\u2019m an international that needs aid in the US.\nNo one gets it. My parents think I\u2019ll get in everywhere because I\u2019m a good person. Ha. If these schools cared, I hate making this a sob story but I\u2019m so afraid I won\u2019t have anywhere to go. It\u2019s not my fault the only visa we can have is the one that makes us international. \nMy counselor doesn\u2019t even know my name, and every time i ask her for help she tells me she is not equipped to help with international admissions.\nI\u2019m so alone. I\u2019m so scared. I don\u2019t know what I did wrong and I just want to go to a good school. \nI wish I could go back in time and focus more on my SAT. my class rank is also not that impressive because people who take dual enrollment classes go first but I didn\u2019t even know that. \nI\u2019m so mad. I know it\u2019s 1 rejection but I don\u2019t know what type of schools I should be looking at; Harvard? Obviously not, but American U? Can I even get in ? \nI\u2019m so mad. I\u2019m so alone.\nI\u2019m so afraid.",
