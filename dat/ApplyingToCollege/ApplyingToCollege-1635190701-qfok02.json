  "text": "My last recommender just submitted her letter!! I am so, so happy. I can\u2019t read it because I waived my FERPA rights, but that doesn\u2019t matter to me, I trust her completely and I\u2019m so relieved that she got it done!  \n\nI feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my chest because that\u2019s really the one part of my application I have no control over, but it got done and I\u2019m sure she did an amazing job (my recommender is one of my biggest role models and I feel really silly saying this but she\u2019s literally my hero and I\u2019m so honored that she ever agreed to write it for me).",
