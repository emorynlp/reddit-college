  "text": "i dropped out of ap calc this year as a junior and couldn't get into another math class so now i'm not taking math this year (i took two high school classes while not in high school so idk if that counts as one of the uc years? idk) and now i'm obsessing over my other grades. ceramics and history are easy a's but i'm so pissed at myself because i'm close to having an a minus in spanish 4 h and i'm definitely going to get a b in ap lit and if i don't get a perfect score on my remaining quiz and final in honors physics i won't get an a (i have an 89.57 rn). seeing what classes everyone on here took and what grades they got i honestly just feel kind of pathetic. like, i dropped a class and i can't even get good grades in the other ones? \n\nlike one part of me knows that it's just one grade and it probably doesn't matter in terms of college and stuff but the other part of me will never forgive myself if i fail the physics final and get a b. i did the same thing in alg 2 last year - i came so close but in the end i still got a b. i don't want that to happen again but i feel so stupid and helpless",

      "text": "All you can do is try your best. Putting undo pressure about thinking about potential consequences is counterproductive. Easier said than done, but as a junior just do the best you can. As a senior you will see where you are and can decide on the best colleges for you at that point. Good luck on finals!",
