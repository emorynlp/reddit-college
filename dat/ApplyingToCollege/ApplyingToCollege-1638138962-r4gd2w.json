  "text": "Hello all, I have a couple of questions.   \nI'm a freshman at Stuyvesant High School(Probably a big mistake saying my school on the internet but whatever, throwaway account). The first semester, my grades... haven't been the best. I've got an 85 in my APES class, and an 80 in... health. Altogether, my average is around 89%.   \nAm I screwed over? Do I even have a chance of getting into a good college(idk, like top 20) anymore? I'm aware my school is extremely competitive, and full of nerds. Everyone seems to have 95 averages somehow, and I really feel like I'm slipping behind. I just don't know how colleges may see this, considering it's my freshman year.   \nAlso, my parents have just made me aware that they aren't putting a single dime towards me anymore besides rent/food. That unfortunately includes college, among other things such as transportation to school. Assuming my grades pick up a bit, are scholarships usually able to save people from crippling debt? Also, I'm aware this isn't exactly about college, but is anyone able to give me some advice on what to do here?  \nI probably sound extremely na\u00efve/uneducated in this post, and if that ticks you off, I'm sorry.",

      "text": "What your parents said to you is awful. What kind of parents are those?\n\nYou're a freshman and in first semester. It's usual for your grades to slip. Go to your teachers' office hours for extra help when you need it, make a firm study schedule, and study with friends. Those are all strategies I used to save myself freshman year.\n\nIf it makes you feel any better (though you won't be applying to colleges until 2024) schools like the UCs and Stanford don't consider freshman grades at all.",

Really sucks cause now I'm missing out on a lot of opportunities that would ironically help me in the future.   \nDang I didn't know some schools don't count them at all. That's reassuring, thanks.",

Anyways, I feel like getting into this school gives me even more reason to get good grades, since everyone else will be as well(and they're actually getting them). Maybe I'm thinking about this the wrong way",

You definitely aren't screwed - but you'll have to make up for it. I would ask your college counselor or smthn for your school's Naviance - it has a scattergram of what test score and GPA past students from your school had to go to certain colleges. It'll give you a decent idea of how your grades should be.",

Schools like an upwards trend, and they know the first year of highschool can be a little wonky. \n\nIf you fix your GPA up from here they'll see that 9th grade was an accident. If you let it drop again after 9th, they will be concerned.\n\nEdit: Your parents are overreacting. Schools offer need-based aid and I know Duke and some others have merit scholarships you can apply for. As long as you have a strong app you shouldnt worry too much.",

Once you find your groove and you get used to the schedule, you'll be able to balance more in later years. \n\nAnd like I said above, schools offer need-based aid and some offer scholarships, like Duke.\n\nIts wayyy too early to give up, just buckle up and you've got this",
