  "text": "Okay, so what happens if a college on common app under the questions section asks if you are sending in SAT scores and you say yes and then you submit your common app but you realize you don't want to send your SAT scores anymore? This didn't happen to me because I didn't even submit my common app yet, but I wanted to. My SAT score is coming out on like the 19th or something and if I say \"yes I'm sending my scores\" but get a bad score when the score is released and don't want to send my score anymore I don't want them to be waiting for a score that will never come and then they won't view my application.",

Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll \u2013 self-reporting is faster. Other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission. )",

      "text": "If you leave it as is, your application would be considered incomplete and not evaluated.\n\nWhether you can switch back to TO after sending the application depends on the school. I\u2019ve seen a few that allow this, but not the opposite. Check each school\u2019s policy.\n\nAs we are past most early deadlines, the deilvery of December tests before January 1 should make this a non-issue. Just wait for the scores. (Other than the few Nov. 15 early dates and November testing).",
