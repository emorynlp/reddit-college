      "text": "Hi there. Believe me, you\u2019re not alone. \n\nIt\u2019s time do some emotional planning. Get real with yourself and hope for the best but expect the worst. Know that you did everything you could possibly do but it just probably isn\u2019t gonna work out in your favor and be ready for that. A lot a lot a lot of kids with super shiny amazing applications won\u2019t have decisions go their way.\n\nHere\u2019s a post I wrote this weekend that talks more about emotional planning. https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/r8sjp7/happy_weekend_beautiful_seniors_if_you_applied/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nAnd here\u2019s a podcast from Inside College Admissions from Scoir where I chat about planning for your decisions. https://insidecollegeadmissions.buzzsprout.com/1384537/9651241\n\nThese early decisions can really hurt if things don\u2019t go your way for sure. And it\u2019s ok to give into the pain. But either way \u2014 you got this. You are way more than your college admissions. You will grow and learn and be stronger for it in the end.",
