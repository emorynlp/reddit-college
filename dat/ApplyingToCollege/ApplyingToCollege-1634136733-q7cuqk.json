  "text": "It would be best for me to superscore between two sittings for a 1530. But would it kinda hurt my app for the AOs to see my relatively lower-scored sections/lower overall score? \n\n(for context, all of my section scores are either lower 700s or above, with 800 in math for the second sitting)\n\nI heard that it helps to still send the official scores, so I just wanted to ask about this. Thanks!",

I just feel confused on a general scale as to why some people told me to send official score reports to all schools, even if I have the option to just show my highest sections through self-report. Like I don\u2019t know why the official scores, which would show some lower scores, would be better practice. That\u2019s just what I wanted to clear up haha",
