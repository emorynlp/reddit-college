      "text": "Success story... Honestly? Applied to colleges in the US. My English is fully self-taught, I'm from a tiny city in the middle of Russian Siberia. Never went to an intl school, never had a counselor, most of my teachers couldn't even speak English. Moved alone across the country to go to a better school in the capital and managed to sustain myself here with some side hustle (although I have to rent a flat with 6 other ppl cuz it's the only thing affordable for me but who cares). Prior to that self-studied for 2 Olympiads, made it to nationals in both, won one of them. Had to spend countless hours researching the college app process, creating an art portfolio, researching every single summer program cuz almost none of them are for intls. \n\nWill I get in? Most likely no. I'm not a bad applicant but I am an international student with a $5000 annual household income. But it was a fun journey. Learned a lot, did a lot. Met the most wonderful people. So fuck it ig. The fact that I could apply is itself a miracle. The process made me a better version of myself",
