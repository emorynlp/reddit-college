  "text": "I just got admitted to my dream school yesterday! \n\nHowever, about two to three weeks ago, I dropped AP Psychology. I was doing fine in the class, but the teacher had made me feel uncomfortable (and she is now being investigated due to multiple complaints). I am still self-studying the AP Exam and planned to enroll in an Intro to Psych course at the local community college. \n\nDo you think they\u2019ll rescind my admission? Yesterday\u2019s joy is now plagued with fear, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ve lost my offer. For reference, I intend on studying English and Religion.\n\nI\u2019ve contacted my counselor, but need all the advice I can get.",
