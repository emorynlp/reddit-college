  "text": "I just submitted my EA application to Michigan State University (MSU)!!\n\nBut in the application portal, they said my application is incomplete because they are 'awaiting' a transcript from my previous high school. For context, I attended two high schools and moved between my sophomore and junior year. My counselor at my current school received an official transcript from my counselor at my previous school and submitted it as a part of the package with other office materials.\n\nDoes the 'awaiting' status mean that MSU has not received/seen the transcript or that they are not counting it as a part of my application? Please help because I'm lowkey panicking!!",
