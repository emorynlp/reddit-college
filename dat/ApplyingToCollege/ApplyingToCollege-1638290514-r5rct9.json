      "text": "It's true at need-blind schools. For international students there are 5 of them: Harvard, MIT, Yale, Princeton, and Amherst. If you get accepted there and they decide you need financial aid, you would get it. \n\nThere are a few dozens of need-aware schools that meet 100% of financial need and offer financial aid to international students, but instead of deciding if you need financial aid after admission, they consider it during the admission process, meaning how much money you need will have an impact whether they want to admit you or not: if you need, let's say, an 80% scholarship, but they don't want to give you that much, they can reject you solely based on that.\n\nOther schools either don't give scholarships at all or don't meet 100% of financial need, meaning, let's say, you need an 80% scholarship, but they give you a 20% one instead",
