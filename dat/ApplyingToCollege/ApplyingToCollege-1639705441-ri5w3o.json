      "text": "Clearly, your \u201cfriends\u201d are lost in the disparate world of college admissions. I am a sophomore a top 30 university, and my friends at top 150 schools are getting internships at the same places my peers are working. It\u2019s all about what YOU make of your college experience. The school can make it easier to get your foot in the door, but if you are not doing the work, I can assure you top companies like Google or grad schools like Harvard will not care about your Yale degree. I will continually argue that someone with a 4.0 from UMaine, with strong involvement and drive, will absolutely triumph over someone \u201caverage\u201d from a top 20-30 school.",

But really don\u2019t listen to them, schools can be 80% and still have amazing employment rates after and give you opportunities throughout your time there.",
