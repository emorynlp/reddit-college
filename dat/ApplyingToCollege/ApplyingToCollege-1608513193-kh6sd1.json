  "title:": "My son was accepted to one of his REA schools, and I am not proud of him for that.",
  "text": "I am one of those parents who reads and learns an awful lot from this subreddit but doesn't really post much, don't think it's my place.  But seeing everyone dealing with ED/EA decisions made me want to offer this.\n\nMy son applied to two highly selective EA schools, was deferred at the first and accepted at the second a few days later. When he told me he had been accepted my first thought was \"I'm so proud of him,\" but a moment later came the thought \"No I'm not, I'm happy for him that he got accepted, but I'm not proud of him for being accepted.\"\n\nI'm proud of him because of the way he worked his ass off for the past 4 years in high school.  I'm proud of the way he built a life for himself in high school, with friends and involvement and accomplishments.  I'm proud of him because he turned himself into the kind of student and person who could step onto the field and take a legit shot at applying to the best colleges in the country.  That one of them accepted him just reflects their good judgment (and the other one can f*** off).  I had already maxed out on proud before they made their decisions.\n\nMy son has many talents, but athletics isn't one of them.  Before his basketball career came to a merciful end at the end of middle school, I used to give him the same pep talk as we drove to each game.  \"You know son, some people say that if you don't end the game with at least two fouls, you aren't doing it right.\"  The point wasn't that he had to win, it was that he had to compete.  My twist on that for the college application process was \"son, if you don't get rejected by a bunch of colleges in this process, you aren't doing it right because you didn't shoot high enough.\" To paraphrase a recent post, don't reject yourself.  Force them to reject you.\n\nYou are all warriors and you are in the fight and you are taking your shots.  You deserve to hear that from those around you.  I read enough here to know that you don't all hear that every day and I'm not surprised, our town is overrun with parents doing the same thing.  But they are wrong. Be proud of what it took for you to get to the point where you are able to stand here and take these legit shots at great schools, and keep moving forward.  No surrender.\n\ntl;dr - a way too old Dad thinks you are all awesome and ought to have someone telling you that every day. Also,  any college that can't see it can f*** off (I think this is probably a little long for a tl;dr but f*** it, I'm an old Dad).",

          "text": "It's a good sentiment. \n\nLike OP, I am a parent that subs here to get some insight into what my kids are going through since the process is much different than it was when I started college in the 80s. \n\nMy kids attend a high performing magnet high school where there is a ton of pressure to be successful. A few years ago the school started a \"Wall of Rejection.\" Seniors take pictures holding a sign with the name(s) of the college(s) they got rejected from and pin them up to the bulletin board near the school entrance. Some kids cut out parts of their rejection letters and pin them up as well. My kids are only in 11th and 10th, but I think it's a great idea. It shows the kids that rejection happens to everyone and doesn't have to be this terrible life ruining thing. It's not as embarrassing when everyone else has their picture up there and the rejections are out in the open. You don't have to participate if you aren't comfortable but most do. The kids apparently even bond over it. My son said last year he saw a senior walk up to another senior and high five him for being part of the Duke ED Reject Gang. My son played sports with one of the seniors and said the kid was rejected from a bunch of other schools but ended up attending Georgetown. I hope they find a way to do that bulletin board this year even if the kids continue with virtual learning for the remainder of the school year.",

He got his safety\u2019s squared away early, but that meant that during regular decision season, application after application was met with rejection. Even his targets. He didn\u2019t get in to the competitive universities that many of our peers had already gotten in to and he felt crushed because he knew he did not want to go to the two safeties that had accepted him. He was so demoralized that he wouldn\u2019t open his last decision, saying \u201cI already know I got rejected\u201d. I urged him to open it, thinking that the best thing he could do is at least have closure. Whether or not the decision would contain good or bad news, he knew his potential and wouldn\u2019t give up his dream regardless of where he would be taking classes. \n\nThat last school, one of the highest ranked schools he applied to, whose update he felt was futile to even check, is where he is now enrolled.

It helps because I can emphasize how really low almost everyone's chances are but because I work there it's worth applying, so their expectations are set low. But it hurts because it has made it hard for me to accept their great efforts as good enough when they are just short of the reach school mark.",

Generally most college curriculums are the same, but the environments are likely completely different. One should pick a college that gives them what they *want* out of it, not whichever one is the most prestigious.",

In literally any other case it doesn't mean jack when it comes to getting a typical job and it also doesn't mean you are any smarter now that you've gotten in then you were five minutes ago, all the ranking pages just make it seem that way.\n\nBasically college rankings are stupid and aren't indicative of the whole picture but rather force seniors to play an applications game and send the selectivity and as such \"prestige\" through the roof.",

I\u2019ve learnt so many times that their first reaction to me failing was to yell at me for sucking, humiliating me to the shit ass ground til I collapse, instead of encouraging me. My mom was the straight up in your face \u201cyou fucking suck ass you piece of shit\u201d type while my dad tho seems to \u201ccare\u201d and be \u201ccalm\u201d I know he\u2019s passively aggressive. \n\nI\u2019ve been accepted to a few schools now but I don\u2019t even bother telling them bc they\u2019d just say \u201cthat school isn\u2019t even highly-ranked\u201d or \u201cthat school sucks\u201d. They care so much about ranking that even if a school that I like or a school that offers pretty good education and resource but not highly ranked by some news site accepts me they\u2019d not recognize my effort and achievement. I know it\u2019s not the best school in the world but I worked hard for it. I don\u2019t even bother arguing with them because they don\u2019t reason. I don\u2019t even wanna talk to them about my college results. \n\nI\u2019ve been working so fucking hard since before the summer of 2020. I\u2019ve been stressed every fucking day during my college application process. I\u2019ve written essays after essays. I also have school work. I know my work load isn\u2019t probably as much as many who work much harder than me and who are much better students than me. But my effort isn\u2019t really recognized by my parents while it should be. The only people who acknowledge my hard work are my college coach and maybe my teacher. My passively aggressive dad may say \u201cit\u2019s ok if you\u2019ve worked hard\u201d but I know deep down that if I don\u2019t get into highly highly selective and prestigious schools those \u201chard work\u201d to him means shit. \n\nI know I sound like I\u2019m whining because I know there\u2019re many people who come from worse family and have the worst parents in the world who abuse them. But I still need some place to vent because my parents aren\u2019t supportive. They only care about results. They do love me, maybe. I wish they can at least be 1/10 as supportive as the parents I see on this sub. Not getting the recognition and acknowledgment from the people who\u2019re closest to you is really hard.",
