      "text": "Check the school for their policy.\n\nMany take the scores you enter in the Common App or Coalition App. Some have their own applications.\n\nSome require official reports from College aboard with the application.\n\nI see claims that a school uses the Common App but required you to enter a score on their web site, even if it\u2019s on the CA. This sound dubious, or at least very rare.\n\nAny school portal will tell you whether they have received what they need. Always check there to be sure.",
