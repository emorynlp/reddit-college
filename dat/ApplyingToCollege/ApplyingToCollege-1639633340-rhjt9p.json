  "title:": "Unsure if I should actually apply to any T20s now because of my unimpressive stats",
  "text": "Hi, Reddit-\n\nI'm really doubting if I can make it into any of the T20 schools I'm planning to apply for.\n\nSo, my relationship with my family has always been strained, (Mom is really erratic from what I suspect is untreated mental illness, Dad is emotionally distant and has been physically abusive towards me in the past) and since neither of them really know anything about the college application experience (Immigrants from El Salvador and Mexico), they're not being helpful in the slightest in even just telling me information to fill out college applications. My Mom is telling me to lie about her employment status to make things look better for me, which really doesn't sit well with me, and I'm scared that colleges might see that she does work and reject me for lying. \n\nNot only that, but I fear that if I highlight my mental health, (I don't want to self diagnose, but I believe I have depression, anxiety, and OCD) when I haven't been checked out for a single one of these, as my parents don't believe in mental health, I feel like colleges won't be able to accurately view all of my stats. \n\nI'm the daughter of immigrants, low income, in the top 10 of my class, low test scores (We love anxiety destroying me the night before of both the SAT and ACT, still got a 30 on the ACT though but that's fairly low for T20s), Co-Captain in two of my ECs and Historian in Orchestra (which I've been in since middle school), and would have joined more ECs were it not for me having to take care of my younger brother, which I've done for awhile, since I'm older than him by seven years. \n\nI feel like I'd be pretty unimpressive, unless I describe my circumstances involving my mental health and also fear of discrimination for my sexuality (I nearly got stabbed in a parking lot in Florida for wearing a pride sticker, leading to me avoiding being in the GSA club at my school, very great story for college essays, I've gotta say). \n\nAnyway, TL;DR, please tell me if I should include my mental health and also my relationship with my parents and sexuality for college applications.",

      "text": "hi! my advice would be to apply. i am also a first gen with hispanic parents and a lot of my time went into family responsibilities. i also explained my mental health / financial circumstances in the covid section, but didn\u2019t make it the main focus on any other places in my application. i had similar stats to you and i got accepted into my dream college (T20). in short, you will never know unless you give it a shot and apply. as for disclosing mental health and your relationship with your parents, i would not make it the main focus of your application. mentioning it (though i don\u2019t know if it varies by school) probably won\u2019t hurt you as much as you think it will so long as you\u2019ve shown that you have grown from the setbacks. good luck!!",

      "text": "If you feel there are extenuating circumstances that can explain part of your app, then you should discuss them! But, I'd only caution how you go about that. Mental health issues and the like can be very tricky to explain in a way that won't hurt your chances of admission. I'd check out the wiki since I think ScholarGrade has some info about it.",

          "text": "To add, here are some posts on it! CollegeWithMattie's can be a bit discouraging at first glance but I'd look at some of the comments from another consultant and take the general advice that if you do it you must do it well. Framing it as a difficulty you overcame or learned something from seems to be a popular recommendation! \n\n[CollegeWithMattie: Don't Write About Mental Health](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nv671n/do_not_write_about_mental_health_or_any_of_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n[ScholarGrade: Guide to the Addl Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/myxupb/if_it_matters_to_you_it_matters_to_us_guide_to/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)",

      "text": "Whatever you decide to do, my advice is never lie on your application. We need to talk more openly about the mental health crisis in high school and college aged students and get rid of the stigma. But the reality is that colleges are overwhelmed with kids struggling w mental health issues and they just don\u2019t have the resources and staff to accommodate it all. For that reason I certainly wouldn\u2019t make your mental health struggles the focus of your application. The universities want students they believe will finish and graduate. If they can avoid bringing in someone already struggling w mental health issues  I honestly believe they avoid admitting them. These are just my opinions but I would find another struggle you have faced and show how you learned, grew, built resilience etc\u2026\nAlso go see a dr bc if you do get into a t20, I assure you any mental health issues you are struggling with will be exacerbated by the stress of attending a top university.",
