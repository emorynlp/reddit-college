  "text": "I have an important question (want to ask Northeastern if I can use my home room teacher as a counselor since we don\u2019t have one in my country and principle is unreachable). I mailed their office and didn\u2019t get an answer in over a week now. \nI found my regional officer but there\u2019s no email. Should I dm him on LinkedIn? \nI need an answer (commonapp says I can use it but I wanna make sure with the school I\u2019m applying to)",
