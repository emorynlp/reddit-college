  "text": "Hey, so my school's profile talks a lot about my senior year, but I realized it doesn't talk about the previous years - especially the course load, which is completely different. In my senior year, I have 19 hours more of class per week, which explains why I spent more time on my ECs in 9-11 grade. Should I put this on the Additional Information Session?",

Is this not included?",
