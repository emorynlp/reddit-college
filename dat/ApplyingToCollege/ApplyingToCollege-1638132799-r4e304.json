  "title:": "Will this UC Application Error get me an automatic rejection from all UCs?",
  "text": "When listing colleges I attended while in high school on the UC application, I listed a summer course I took at Berkeley titled \"Exploring the Liberal Arts\". When I was asked for the department, I couldn't find it. I ended up typing in \"Letters and Science\" as the department. After submitting the application, I looked up \"Letters and Science\" and found that it is a college within Berkeley, not a department. Will this error be enough to make my application look bad/get rejected?",
