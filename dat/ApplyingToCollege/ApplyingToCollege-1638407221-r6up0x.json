  "text": "I'm a junior and I see that getting closer to your counselor is important to make sure you don't get a generic letter of rec, but I'm not exactly sure how to do that. I don't have any circumstances that would make me need her for anything besides generic stuff like schedule changes or transcript requests. Does anyone have any ideas or experience?",

My junior year I started asking her questions about college, financial aid, good majors, etc. I also eat lunch in an area of the school that the counselors are (they\u2019re there to meet with student/offer advising/etc) which made it easier to ask a question or offer any help.\n\nGood luck to you!",

      "text": "There is A LOT of bad advice in here. You want to get close to your counselor? Do the right things without being too needy.\n\nIf you have a competent counselor they will touch base with you concerning junior steps in the process such as interpretation of your PSAT results with you. If your counselor has a manageable caseload they should be having a 30 minute meeting with all juniors in the late winter or spring. Use that time to set yourself apart.\n\nDon\u2019t be overly obvious but find reasons to come into the counseling office - while being respectful of all they have to do - to discuss your forthcoming application process without being too needy or too much of a know it all. See if your counseling office allows senior aides and ask them what you can do to get a senior aide position next year. That is an excellent starting point at which you can meet with them regularly to close out this year as a means to \u201cprove\u201d you deserve that responsibility. \n\nIf involved in sports or theater, invite your teachers to a game or showing of the play/musical and then invite your counselor, letting them know you\u2019ve invited all staff that work with you.",
