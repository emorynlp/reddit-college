      "text": "I got into both and am now a CS student at UMich; however, I have friends that go to GaTech, and from what I can tell, it's very similar to UMich (academically). The only difference being that UMich has slightly more interesting project teams and student orgs, which may look better on resumes (depending on what you want to go into). As such, I suppose it really comes down to what you're looking for in a school apart from academics, since they're effectively one in the same. If you have any questions about UMich, feel free to drop a reply or PM me :)\n\nP.S. consider price! UMich is (for whatever reason) the most expensive public school. If GaTech offers you better financial aid, then by all means choose them (unless there's something that you find particularly alluring about UMich).",

Is it easier to get in? Academically are there any major differences? I am just considering it because if it increases my chances to get in and is not too different I will most probably apply. Sorry for bothering you with these questions, and thanks a lot again.",
