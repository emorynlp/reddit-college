  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nWith the utmost gratitude and surprise, I am able to announce that I will be committing to Columbia '26!\n\nGuys, hear me out. Columbia was a gigantic reach for me. I never, never, never thought I would get in. I regretted \"wasting\" my ED on a school that I would never get in. Decisions came out at 7, and I was crying at 6:30 because I knew I was going to get rejected. I took a nap, because I couldn't deal with the pressure. I didn't open my app till 8, because I couldn't handle my rejection. I'm here to tell you, apply to that dream school. You have worked so hard in hs and you deserve to give your younger self a try at your dreams.\n\nFrom my experience, test scores don't really matter anymore. Especially for this sub stop freaking out about test scores. I had a low test score in comparison to the mid 50 of Columbia. I'm Chinese too, yet I still got in. Everyone was telling me to not submit since it was lower than the mid 50 of 1500; however, I thought it would positively impact my app, so I did. I am also engineering for context. Trust yourself, please do not trust some random high schooler more than yourself. I was always completely destroyed by this sub seeing so many kids who looked so much better on paper than me. Your essays and teacher recs definitely matter more than most think they do. Please be yourself and try your hardest in school; it will reflect within your recs.\n\nI never really believed the emphasis on context but after my acceptance, I do. I am from MA but a lower ranking school; however, I did everything in my power to take as many opportunities as possible. I maxed out my school's ap classes and this was def reflected through my counselor rec. I emailed 300+ professors for research opportunities and was very fortunate to do 3 throughout my high school time. I did not publish anything! Take advantage of all your opportunities. Most importantly, do the things you truly love. In addition, actually apply to schools that attract you. I was also gonna shot gun if I didn't get in ED but it doesn't work. Columbia was my number one school for the fit. When I submitted my ED app, I told my mom, Columbia is the school that will make me the person I want to become. If you can't envision yourself taking advantage of all the opportunities and liking the community... don't apply. Your passion and fit for the school will bleed through your essays. Columbia was my most authentic app and truly showed who I am as a person. I edited my supps for 3 weeks and got many people to read them. I wrote 15 drafts of my common app and had a dozen people read it.\n\nRegarding ChanceMes,I know it's a very attractive thing when you are filled with anxiety but don't do it. I did it and a lot of people said I had no chance due to my SAT score. Ivy bro's gave me less than 15% which is the ED rate. It greatly discouraged me, but I got in. Please don't do it. Believe in yourself and trust the process. I know it's hard when people say trust the process; however, besides some corruptness, I truly believe the AOs know what they are doing.\n\n**Your application doesn't have to be perfect:** I always stressed about seeing other kids apps on this reddit. My app was far from perfect. Heck, I submitted a music supplement that had 8 very clear errors. On the last page, I completely messed up, but I still submitted the video since it was a culmination of all my hard work over the years. We are all humans; we all make mistakes. AOs want to admit humans, nothing else. Please, please listen to me. Even if something is not perfect but in your opinion is something very dear to you and is a big part of your growth throughout your life, please submit.\n\n**To all my first gen, low income:** You got this! I was first gen and I'm not low income but lower middle class. Please shoot your shot especially with ED. My family's finances are low enough that I knew I would get a ton of aid if I got into one of the top schools like Columbia who offer amazing, amazing aid. In worst case scenario, you can always get out of ED if the package is unbearable; however, the LACs and top 20s+ ivies have amazing aid. ED has always been seen as a barrier for lower income students so let's change that. To upper middle class, ED may be a problem since they're in a sticky spot but lower income please, if you are ready, apply to your dream and do it! I really cannot say if I would have gotten into Columbia without applying ED. My family got amazing aid. I could not have asked for anything better. My sister goes to a top LAC and her aid was amazing; however, mine beat hers! I am so. humbled and overjoyed and am willing to help anyone. Please stop obsessing over stats and be you. When you have the feeling that this is the most authentic, raw app I've ever written, you've done it. Now just trust the process.\n\nPm me if you ever need help. I am overjoyed and will try to help anyone through this treacherous process.\n\nTo all the people receiving ED results, you got this! No matter the result, you will end up somewhere amazing and where you will find your lifelong friends/people.\n\nBest of luck!",

Nobody from my school in its entire history has ever gotten into HYPSM and I'm an international Asian with slightly lower than average stats. I was thinking of EDing to schools with higher acceptance rates due to acceptance rates alone. In hindsight, I'm really, really glad I didn't.\n\nI'm so happy for you and so glad you're sharing your story! Enjoy your time in NYC :D",
