  "text": "I just got deferred and I don't know whether to think it just means delayed rejection (since they only accept like 10% of deferrals?) or potential acceptance (probably unlikely for me since I'm an international who needs aid). I can't decide whether to be sad or okay, since its my top school...\n\nOther deferred people, how are you doing? Someone please tell me how to feel lol",
