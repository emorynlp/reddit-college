  "title:": "College is hard - An perspective from a college freshman that went through the application process last year.",
  "text": "Hey guys! I'm a current freshman at Northwestern and I'm making this post to share some things I realized after my first couple of weeks here and midterms. \n\nYou guys are going through the application process, and I understand how frustrating the process could be. But what I want you guys to keep in mind is that getting into college should NEVER be the end goal. \n\nCollege is hard. It might be the first time that you have complete autonomy over time. You are going to meet new people and create new relationships. Perhaps you can't keep up with the lectures or won't know what to even do with your problem set.\n\nAnd because of this, time management and self-discipline are key in college. College is the place where no one would care if you skip lectures or fail a midterm. No one will hunt you down because you missed a lecture, it is your choice that you missed a lecture, and you take full responsibility for the consequence. Along with this, you probably wouldn't want to miss out on things like clubs and social life. \n\nWhen you try to juggle all of these things without the proper skills, things could crumble down really fast. I had trouble balancing these things, but the only thing that kept me up was the work ethic I built up from high school. Regardless of what college you go to, the work ethics and time management skills that you've accumulated throughout high school will help you succeed where ever you end up. \n\nMidterms just ended for me, and I managed to get 99% on both my Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra course. College is hard, but what you bring from high school will help you change hard to manageable. \n\nThe following couple of months will be really challenging for you. Writing essays is hard, and waiting for decisions is even harder. Perhaps you get into your dream college. Maybe you won't. Wherever you end up, know that the hard work and effort you put in high school will always be worth it in the long run. \n\nGood luck everyone and keep the hard work going!",

              "text": "Sorry lol, my B, I basically love the main schpiel, like their whole interdisciplinary study\u2019s is so cool sounding, their whole \u201cmore emotional and connected connection to learning,\u201d research oops out the wazoo, amazing academic advising, great learning disability support (I\u2019ve got adhd), and a the quarter system... all that, all amazing sounding but then just the vibes seem all wrong. Like it seems super preprofessional and Independent, and all the kids in the YouTube videos I\u2019ve been watching just seem kinda shallow (like I mean this in no offense to you, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not like this, but my mom and I joke with each other that the kids making the YouTube videos all have this dead eyed stare, the northwestern stare). I way more into visual arts then performing arts, I\u2019m way more into scientific theory then applied sciences (I like doing the application myself) the campus seems a little off, even the purple seems a little just \u2018off\u2019. Online says everyone there drinks, one degree of separation from the far superior intoxicant, being weed, and the party + social scene seems a little too high energy (one degree of separation between me being insanely social, but in more chill and low key settings), like I want to party in the classroom and think at my party\u2019s if you know what I mean. I hate to sound like all I care about is the social scene, but that really just the think I can\u2019t seem to get by. Also\u2026 the campus kinda seems like a California campus, which must be so disconcerting in the winter.",

                  "text": "I'm not the OP but I'm a recent grad of Northwestern. I'm not quite sure what you mean by \"off\" but I really, really loved my time at Northwestern and felt like I grew and learned a lot during my time there. I would *hope* that my friends and I are not all shallow or dead-eyed LOL but the school definitely leans pre-professional, for better or worse. No school is perfect, though, and I think the importance of \"fit\" here (as cliche as it sounds) is really important. If you feel like you aren't vibing with Northwestern, that's OK! I would just apply RD then, and only use your ED for a school you 100% know is your top choice.",

It sucks because I keep telling myself that once RD comes around, and I can apply without as much stress it\u2019s gonna turn out to be like my \u201ctop school\u201d and then I\u2019m gonna beat myself up for not applying ED. I mean off as in like it kinda feels like a uncanny valley school to me, so close to being perfect, but just with something about it that seems disconcerting, I really mean no hate at all, but it seems like it could be featured in a black mirror episode.",

                  "text": "I'll just go over the points that you mentioned in order. \n\n1) The school definitely leans more towards the preprofessional side, but there are plenty of people here planning for a PhD, so you could probably find your bubble here if you end up at Northwestern. You could mostly find the preprofessional people at Engineering/Econ/Premed (tbh that's like half the school), but I think you'd be able to meet more people aiming for academia in other majors. \n\n2) Not too sure which YouTube videos you're mentioning, but I assume its a pretty small sample size? I rlly haven't gotten that vibe with ppl here yet\n\n3) Can't rlly say much for arts, but I did hear the RTVF program is pretty nice from my friends. In terms of sciences, there are a handful of non-engineering pure science ppl here, I keep saying this but there's 8000 ppl here and there would always be a group of ppl doing things that you are looking for. \n\n4) Not very sure what you mean by color and campus is a bit \"off\", but I'm enjoying the campus so far so can't rlly comment about this one\n\n5) There definitely is a work hard play hard culture here, but there are people who just work hard, just play hard, and finally people who have a nice balance. Also most parties most likely will happen outside of your dorm(unless you live in bobb) so ultimately its gonna be your choice to customize your social life here.  There are wild frat parties here, but also nice chill gathering so it rlly comes down to your choice and friends you make here. \n\n6) I guess it got cali vibes cuz its next to water? Other than that I can't rlly find a resemblance between Northwestern and an Californian campus. Its not rlly that huge (around 15min walk north to south, west to east does not exist), but you might need to get some sort of transportation (bike, skateboard etc.) if you have classes all over. I haven't experienced winter here but I think I can survive here cuz most of my walks between classes are sub 5 mins",
