  "text": "Hi all I am applying to Rutgers ED but totally forgot to submit my SAT scores before.\nIt may most likely not submit before the ED deadline so I am wondering if rush service is worth it or if I should take the chance for it to be a few days late.",

They're not going to fill the class before your score report arrives.\n\n>These are not deadlines. You may apply after due dates have passed. However, if you apply after the due dates or if your file remains incomplete after due dates have passed, you will be withdrawn from admissions consideration if your school(s) of application meet enrollment goals before Undergraduate Admissions reviews your application.",
