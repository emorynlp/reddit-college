  "text": "https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2021/12/10/abolish-yale/\nThis brings up some good ideas about the hypocrisy and elitism in top schools. Not a new topic by any means, but I think it's a good reminder for us all that elite institutions shouldn't be personified and glorified like they are. Y'all acting like 7th graders with \"perfect\" crushes that you wanna marry. Like, their personality is kinda flawed...\n\nAnyway, personally I tend to agree that HYPSM doesn't add that much to the world with their undergrad student body. Research stuff and grad school imo do have a positive impact though, at least in modern times with implementation of, like, ethics in research (specifically thinking medical stuff). \n\nSo much of undergrad admissions seems to be based on marketing ourselves as best we can given or opportunities, not actually being superior to other students. I can only come up with a few things max that would make me \"better\" than my peers and they're probably all fallacies. Obviously most people here aren't under the impression that this is a meritocracy, but there seems to be a disconnect between that understanding and how much respect T20s get on this sub.",

He\u2019s well aware of his own hypocrisy as a Yale student.\n\n>I tried to imagine what the world would be like without Yale. But the winter night was cold, and my 300-year-old room in Vanderbilt Hall was warm and cozy, so I dozed off instead.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t point to any solutions after explaining that the institution is harmful and regressive.\n\nThere are groups on Yale\u2019s campus fighting for better treatment of New Haven, faculty and staff workers, and students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Why not at least give them and their stances a plug? \n\nIt\u2019s an op-ed that seems to just serve as a \u201clook how noble I am!\u201d piece rather than serving any community education or mobilization purpose.",

You can do things to help that aren\u2019t just saying that the institution needs to disappear, which is a very dramatic change that\u2019s probably not wholly feasible in a short period of time. \n\nIt\u2019s just really easy to criticize the elitism of the institutions when you\u2019ve already made it into one. From the outside, that sort of elitism is, for better or worse, coveted by a lot of people. I always see articles like these, especially those written by students of the universities in question, as kind of lazy. The low-hanging fruit.",

      "text": "I need to speak on a few parts of this article. \n\n>In last year\u2019s admissions cycle, only 4.6 percent of applicants were offered a place in the incoming class... and though Yale has the money and power to expand its student body, it continues to manufacture scarcity for spots on campus.\n\nWhat the author doesn't understand with this part is that that is the point of private schools, to be small institutions where students can get lots of attention from their peers and professors. Even the best public universities struggle with the \"sink or swim\" issue because their simply do not get all of that extra attention and resources. \n\nEven if Yale were to somehow double their freshman class for 2023 that would mean an acceptance rate of roughly 10%, still highly competitive, resulting in them still rejecting the majority of their qualified freshman class. \n\nYale, and other Ivy Leagues, prides itself as a university that fosters and regards individual change. The ones who are lucky or smart enough to start this change are rewarded with chance of admission. Students of the freshman class then network with one another and create even larger change. Yale combines the absolute best and brightest students of each year with the established legacy family students each freshman year. The whole point of this is to build their brand as Yale, and to consolidate more power in growing industries. \n\nNow, the question, is if we should abolish one of the largest and most well known institutions in the world? I don't think so. I'm not a fan of these romantic and emotional ideas that we should just tear down or destroy things that we don't believe are beneficial to society. The author has all of these ideas but no ideas on how the abolition of Yale would actually take place. \n\n Tune in next time for more shitty takes from me.",

          "text": "But he kinda does address it. Elite institutions only stay that elite because of scarcity. Is Yale really that different from U of Georgia? Do they teach math in some revolutionary way? Do they havesome secret formula to solving unsolvable problems? No. The reason they keep their elite-ness is because  historically basically only rich kids went there. Even now 20% of their kids are top 1%. 1 in 5 Yale students makes 500,000+ dollars. For even some doctors that\u2019s an unthinkable salary. Of course, many industries love pedigree, and they get all of that at these elite institutions. Why do you think elite schools didn\u2019t let women in for the longest time? Because it would ruin their image. They change to fit whatever\u2019s cool in the era to keep their little group. I don\u2019t think anyone is wrong for wanting to go there to make a lot of money, but cmon. They\u2019re no different than any other college at the academic level. There\u2019s a bunch of 40-80% acceptance rate colleges that have comparable faculty student ratios.",

              "text": ">For even some doctors that\u2019s an unthinkable salary.\n\nRealize that the sizable majority of these students at Yale live in families with double income. If you divide $500,000 by 2 to account for one person, $250,000 doesn't sound too far off for a doctor. \n\n>They change to fit whatever\u2019s cool in the era to keep their little group.\n\nThis is very true. \n\n>There\u2019s a bunch of 40-80% acceptance rate colleges that have comparable faculty student ratios.\n\nFaculty student ratio isn't the only thing. If we're looking solely at career prospects, it helps to look at future compensation for graduates for example. \n\nMy point is, people do not just go to school for learning. if we went to school for learning, there would be no reason for all of this extra work because we could just go to our local community colleges and sit in classes. \n\nMost people cannot financially afford to just sit and learn. Which is why important factors like networking potential and future salary come in to play, where higher ranked universities often trump lower ones.",

On another note, I think one thing to consider about your more \"prestigious\" universities is that they often bring together like-minded people. By keeping this \"scarcity,\" they maintain a place for those with ambition to aim for. Not just for the networking, but for a place that can foster ideas to begin with. In your normal high school, it's everyone from those vaping in the bathroom to your geniuses who finished all the math courses in 9th grade. While this is a good experience, this is definitely not the perfect environment for someone to build a successful foundation. I guess what I'm trying to say is that experience-wise, a top university will give a better experience because it attracts the best people into one place. If you didn't have place like this, then you end up with everyone scattered in their state university and not meeting one another. For me places like Yale promote collaboration or competition between the best of the best (whichever you prefer) and that leads to new ideas, and in my opinion a better stepping stone for the real-world.",

I get what you mean, but this \u201cgenius\u201d Ivy League thing was definitely not always true. Also, we can already see this happening to state schools now. UVA/UNC/UCs are all going lower and lower and lower in acceptance. In fact, some states have an undoubted disadvantage. Massachusetts kids have the advantage of great in state schools that are overall great for their majors. Can the same be said about poorer states? No. And their kids can\u2019t really go to the nice state schools because of OOS acceptance rates. Why are entire industries blocked off mostly only for Ivy leaguers? Are they really that superior? I think not. I feel like this sub never sees the other side. I just read a post recently where this kid was mentally destroyed by going to an Ivy because they bought into the whole prestige trumps all thing and now is 200-300k in debt.

Honestly, I'm not convinced that the author truly believed that Yale really needed to be abolished, but instead was trying to stress the very significant difficulty of change and suggest that it might never change at it's core. That was my impression reading it at least.",

      "text": "I saw the videos. I don't think I've ever eaten a meal like that in my life. It's definitely a reminder that there are some institutions and people who are unimaginably richer than you.\n\nIf you're a low-or-middle-class student, I don't think there's any issue in trying to get into one of these schools - it's about as guaranteed of a ticket to the upper-class as you can get. It's hard to blame people who are just trying to make the best for themselves.\n\nI will say that this is an interesting read as a Canadian. We don't really have any Ivy-like schools - all of our schools are state-funded and large compared to the Ivies. For example, my school (Western) has about 25K students, we pay about $5K USD each in tuition each year if you're not on scholarship or financial aid. Our endowment will never be as large as Yale's, we may not churn out as many Nobel Laureates and Rhodes Scholars, but I think Western gives everyone a good education at an affordable price, and the resources are still great for those who want to use them. It begs an interesting question: is it preferable to concentrate a ton of resources into a few very talented students, or to try and help more decently talented people achieve the best of their abilities? I actually think it's a false dichotomy. I think there is room for both kinds of these institutions and schools in our world, although others may disagree and they have their reasons too.",

Have an unorthodox teaching style to accommodate for students who don't like the format at any of the public schools or 2.

The school's pretty well-known for its strong co-op program. And as a plus, K-W is a nice student city, about 500K ppl - big enough for there to be interesting stuff, not so big that it's suffocating or stupid expensive like Toronto.\n\n\\---\n\nIf you're interested in a bit of Canadian history:\n\nThanks to a higher population, a flourishing Evangelical Christianity faith (most universities were religion based) and economic prosperity brought on by the industrial revolution, the United States had larger endowments and funding injected by private citizens into the country\u2019s postsecondary system.\n\nMeanwhile, the build-up of Canada\u2019s university system was based on government support due to the need to serve a smaller population spread across a vast geographic space.\n\n\u201cI think that is part of economic necessity \\[in Canada\\]: We had to build public roadways, we had to build public hospitals and public educational institutions because the private resources in a country that is so huge, theoretically, weren\u2019t going to be there,\u201d Dr. Axelrod says. \u201cIt\u2019s the case for the existence of Canada as a whole: Without state initiative in so many areas, the country probably wouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\n[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/education/canadian-university-report/article-why-there-are-only-a-few-private-universities-in-canada/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/education/canadian-university-report/article-why-there-are-only-a-few-private-universities-in-canada/).",

          "text": "Could Yale's grad students come from state flagships instead? Yale isn't the only school with undergrads. My point was more that a prestigious undergrad education isn't really very important in the scheme of things. Sure, getting your undergrad degree from an ivy can certainly be very helpful on a personal scale, but if (ignoring financial constraints) Yale was purely a graduate school and research institution, how much worse off would the world be? Probably a lot less than vice versa.\n\nYeah, probably right there. It was a poorly executed argument at best, I'll give you that. I think I was trying to explain that in the context of AP classes and A2C and whatnot, most people are quite smart, so how do you objectively and accurately determine who is the smartest? Or who the top 1000 objectively best students are? This was \"inspired\" by a recent AMA where an MIT student said that they didn't find their peers to be extremely smart (like genius level) but instead very knowledgeable about certain topics, something that presumably a lot of students could qualify as if given the opportunity.",

      "text": "I loved this article so much that I read it a few times. It speaks to me as a person from a poor underresourced country crippling in debts. The way I see it, ordinary people can rarely change things on their own because the elites are gatekeeping resources from them, thus they have to unite and tear the system down. Theoretically, this should be easy, but practically, people are indoctrinated from birth to wait for the Messiah who will save them and the elites are spreading this narrative so they can take bright young minds and turn them into corks in the system. I've always been a good student, mostly because I was trying hard to look for information and opportunities outside my immediate surrounding. And I've always had people tell me I should go to an elite school and gain the knowledge to come back to my country and be the prodigy who will save everyone from their problems. But the thing is, I've already tried to make a change in my community and do something to improve it. It usually ended up by me arguing with people or pushing them to unite because we can dismantle this system only if we work together. They, on the other hand, would just ignore me or expect me to do all the work. So to them I was always \"the person who speaks about how we should do something and proceedes to do nothing\", while actually I didn't have the power to much on my own. The worst thing is, when you do go to an elite college and have the means to change the state of things, you become part of the system and try to change it from within, which is also impossible. The only way to really change a certain system is to teat it down completely. I just wish that in the era of internet there were more people who realised how things work and not buy into the elitist propaganda. The sad thing is, even though I deeply wish to help my country, I think I'll never be able to. So I might as well abuse others resources to share my knowledge and make more people realise this truth.",

I think there needs to be a lot more cultural emphasis on group efforts. A lot of my history education has pushed the idea of individuals causing change. I certainly don't mean to discount any of these figures, but they were successful largely because of many other people that also were dedicated to the issue. The flip side of this is that a truly good leader is able to inspire people, I suppose. Much easier said than done.",
