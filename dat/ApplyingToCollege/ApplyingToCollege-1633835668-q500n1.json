  "title:": "Why do some colleges have so many supplementals?",
  "text": "Texas A&M requires three supplemental essays two of which have 500 word limits and the other doesn't have a word limit as well. In addition, engineering majors have to write another essay with a limit of 3000 characters. The Texas A&M supplemental essays are bland and uninspiring and are honestly a chore to complete. On the other hand, all Georgia Tech has is a 300 word why us essay? Georgia Tech is a superior school compared to A&M and yet they only require one college specific essay? What's up with that?",

      "text": "it has nothing to do with superiority, some schools just want to know more about a student than others or check if a student is genuinely invested in their school.\n\neven if it did correlate with prestigiousness, maybe Texas A and M has fewer applicants, and thus more review time per application than GTech, hence more essays. there's lots of reasons the number of essays vary.",

      "text": "A couple reasons -\n\n1. The Common App isn't giving them the info /data the need to make decisions, or rather, to make the tough decisions when two candidates are otherwise exactly the same. \n2. They have scholarship/honors program opportunities and use the supplements to screen for eligibility.\n3. They have too many applicants and the supplements will deter some from applying.",

      "text": "Purdue's like that - 4 supplements plus 2 more for Honors college.\n\nThe first three aren't bad. They're why Purdue, why your first choice major, and why your second choice major, with a word limit of 100 words apiece.\n\nThe fourth is the extracurricular essay, a bit more annoying since its 250 words. I'm honestly fine with it except it sits right in that sweet spot where its too short for me to tell a story and too long for me to be direct and to the point.\n\nThe worst are the honors college essays which are 500 words each.",
