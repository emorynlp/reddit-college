  "text": "Listen up! Why spend hours upon hours each week **WASTING** your time on extra-curriculars to impress colleges when you can just make them up? The CommonApp doesn't require you to submit proof that you actually engaged in any of your activities, so why bother actually doing them?\n\nHere are some benefits and limitations to making up your ECs:\n\nBenefits:\n\n1. You save so much time! (can finally play video games)\n2. You can pretend you're doing something incredible when you really can't! (**IMPRESS AOs!!**)\n3. If you're good enough at creative writing and making up a good enough portfolio, your grade doesn't even really matter! (**GET INTO YOUR DREAM COLLEGE**)\n   1. I have a 400 on the SAT, and am a highschool dropout (failing grades), but I'm basically an auto-admit for HYPSM (columbia as my safety \ud83e\udd71\ud83e\udd71)\n\nLimitations:\n\n1. Your \"friends\" will likely be jealous of your accomplishments \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that you know what to do, here are some tips to find ECs that really impress admissions counselours. Go on r/collegeresults, search for people admitted to T10s, copy their extra-curriculars into your CommonApp account, and you're good to go!\n\n\\- What would've taken you upwards of 20 hours a week now only takes you 10 minutes \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are my EC list that I applied for colleges (feel free to copy and paste!):\n\n1. Secret co-founder of a multi-billion dollar company (Amazon)\n2. Discoverer the COVID-19 virus, single-handedly invented the vaccine\n3. Pioneer in the field of cancer research\n4. Multi-platinum modern artist (Peaked on the Billboard top #100s multiple times!)\n5. Olympic swimmer\n6. Male model\n7. Founder of a charity organization (idk if you've heard of it though - The Red Cross)\n8. Published own cookbook - NYT #1 best-seller **(ez)**\n9. Hobby of photography - Multiple time Pulitzer Prize winner\n10. I walk my dog **(remember to include this so that colleges don't get suspicious!!)**",
