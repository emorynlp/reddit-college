  "title:": "Should I take AP Art senior year if I\u2019m going into Biology?",
  "text": "Ik Art isn\u2019t remotely related to stem. The only reason I want to take it is because I dont have many extracurriculares so I was hoping it would spice up my personality by introducing myself as an artist. My Art teacher has personally encouraged me to take it and I would like to take it. But if it is useless in terms of college apps my other option would be to take Ap physics and totally challenge myself bc I\u2019m would be taking Ap Spanish andAp calc AB with it.\n\nTL:DR- is Ap Art useful for college apps if I\u2019m going into biology?\n\nEdit: with Ap Art would mean I would take Ap Spanish, Ap calc, and anatomy. Without Ap Art would mean Ap Spanish, Ap calc, anatomy, and Ap physics",

      "text": "Yep. Take art AP because you want to take it. Don\u2019t take a class specially because you think it\u2019ll help your chances. A random AP class here or there isn\u2019t going to sway a college. \nRemember school is a place to learn and explore. Don\u2019t forget that part. \nEnjoy and good luck.",

      "text": "So the question is do u take ap art or ap physics? Ap physics is a science and so may be more useful but I\u2019m sure you already knew that and are wondering if it\u2019s a big difference. Honestly, no it\u2019s not no college is gonna criticize you for not taking ap physics or for taking ap art. At this point take the ap you think will yield the best results. I made the mistake of overloading myself in my senior year and now have to tell colleges I\u2019m dropping a course.",
