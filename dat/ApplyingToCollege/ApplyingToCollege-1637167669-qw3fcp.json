  "text": "I've asked my friends what their class ranks are and most of the them told me how they are ranked in the 30's, 20's, 10's, and etc out of 522 while I'm over here ranked 89. I know 89 out off 522 is in the top 20% and is not necessarily bad, but I can't help but be jealous. I thought, \"maybe they didn't take AP classes and therefore it was easier for them to get good grades,\" but no. Some of them did take AP classes and they're still ranked in the 40's and below. I'm not applying to extremely competitive schools like Harvard or anything, but still. I feel like the dumb one out of the group.",
