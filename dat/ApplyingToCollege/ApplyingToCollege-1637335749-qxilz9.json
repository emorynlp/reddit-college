Otherwise, everyone who wanted to would bail on their ED acceptance just by saying \u201cit\u2019s not suitable to me.\u201d",

He can\u2019t pay the full tuition which is 70k (idk if the tuition is 70k, I\u2019m just guessing) but his family can only cough up 10k every year which mean he\u2019ll need at least 60k worth of aid every year. However, when Tom filled out FASFA or CSS, idk whichever one, it states to the colleges that his family can very well contribute 30k every year so in turn all Tom would need is 40k in aid. \n\nTom got into Duke but the school only gave him 40k in aid when he really needed 60k, however, since the school met his demonstrated need, he still have to go.",
