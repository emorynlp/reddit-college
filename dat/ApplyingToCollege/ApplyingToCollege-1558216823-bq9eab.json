  "title:": "I wrote 1,655 words about my college application process to help current juniors (and younger people) with theirs. You should read it but you'll probably skim it and maybe upvote it because you respect how much time I put into it. Oh well",
  "text": "Hey /r/A2C,\n\nI graduate in about week and haven\u2019t been spending much time on here lately because my college apps process is done. I\u2019ve been meaning to write something like this for a while but just never got around to it because I kept putting it off. I\u2019m going to list off some tips that helped me during the process.\n\nTo start, I\u2019ll give some background. I\u2019m going to be a CS major next year at a pretty good CS school (PM me for more info because I'm not trying to give away a lot of personal info, but I would say it's one of the most popular schools on here. It's not an Ivy, but it's near the top for CS).\n\n***\n\nResearch now what you need to do. I found out last September I needed two recs and SAT subject tests for some schools. Make sure you find that stuff out now so you aren\u2019t in trouble next fall.\n\n***\n\nI think essays are a big source of anxiety over the summer before senior year and your first semester of senior year. It might sound crazy, but my honest advice is to not take them so seriously. Like, yeah, they matter, but you can literally write about almost anything. **You don\u2019t have to write about some life-changing event.** All that matters is that it says something about you. Looking back, I spent way too long thinking about what to write about, but it became clear after the process that I didn\u2019t need to dedicate so much time and energy to picking a topic. Have fun writing your essays. It sounds wild, I know, and I actually enjoy writing when I get to write about a topic I\u2019m passionate about, but just chill out and write about whatever the hell you want. It\u2019s supposed to be a view into your personality, not your best rendition of Joey's letter for Chandler and Monica. I\u2019m the kind of person that doesn\u2019t take things too seriously, but I know not everyone is like that, so this advice might not work for everyone. But I\u2019m just giving my $0.02 on this whole process, so that\u2019s what worked for me. I remember everyone freaking out about essays and what to write about last year, and, sure, I was stressed, but I just didn\u2019t think of it as that big of a deal. Be yourself, that\u2019s it. Some of this is on the schools too. It\u2019s really freaking hard to write about why you want to go to a school. I\u2019ve seen people say, \u201cIf you can\u2019t write 300-500 words on why you want to go to a school, you shouldn\u2019t apply there.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I struggled to reach the word minimum even for my top schools. Shoutout to schools like UChicago and Georgia Tech and other schools like that for actually giving us a chance to showcase our personality. For the Why X schools, I kind of just BS\u2019ed them. Just wrote I thought they wanted to hear and left it at that. It was in the Common App essay and other more personal essays that I took my earlier advice about just having fun writing and not taking myself to seriously.\n\n***\n\nSecond, there\u2019s a *lot* of great info on this subreddit. That said, there is a *lot* of misinformation too. Again, I don\u2019t want to get into this too much because I\u2019m trying to keep it private here because people from my school go on this subreddit, but I know way too much about my top three schools because I researched them hardcore, and I have seen a lot of wrong things on here about them. Still, in general, this subreddit is hugely helpful, especially for someone who didn\u2019t have much help from parents throughout this process.\n\n***\n\nKeep an open mind. The school I\u2019m going to next year wasn\u2019t even on my mind in August of last year. My counselor gave me a list of schools he thought I should apply to, and I went back and forth on even keeping it on my list. Come December-January, it was my top school.\n\n***\n\nDon\u2019t ED unless you\u2019re 100% totally sure you want to go there. My top school in October didn\u2019t have ED but I probably would have ED\u2019d there if they did. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t.\n\n***\n\nStart essays early. I say it, everyone says it, and I know you probably won\u2019t. For me, it\u2019s not that I was so super stressed in late October, but instead it was looking back later and knowing I could have done better if I started earlier. That probably didn\u2019t make sense. Let me rephrase: I started most of my essays about a week before they were due (I know, I\u2019m literally the worst). I finished in plenty of time because I didn\u2019t go crazy trying to think of ideas and nitpick every single thing. But I looked back at my essays in March (after I had gotten my decisions - *never* look at your essays after you apply until you get your decisions because you will drive yourself nuts finding tiny mistakes) and realized that I had gained so much knowledge of the college apps process since applying and I would have done a much better job if I started research earlier. Do that. It helps. I know you probably won\u2019t, but you can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you when you look back at your essays next year and kick yourself for how much they suck.\n\n***\n\nFinally, don\u2019t be a dick. Don\u2019t brag to others about where you got in and didn\u2019t. I made a point to be vocal with where I got rejected because I think it\u2019s important that people know it\u2019s not the end of the world. Ask \u201cDo you know where you\u2019re going yet?\u201d instead of \u201cWhere are you going next year?\u201d because some people don\u2019t get in anywhere they applied. Don\u2019t look down on others because you never know what they\u2019re going through (money concerns especially. College is expensive). I heard someone say, \u201cOh, I thought you\u2019d go somewhere better\u201d to one of their friends. They probably just didn\u2019t think before they said that and meant it as a complement of their intelligence, but, I mean, come on, don\u2019t say that. People say it\u2019s a crapshoot, and that applies when you get in as well as when you\u2019re rejected. Be humble when you get in places because a lot of people didn\u2019t, and brush it off as best you can when you don\u2019t in places because there\u2019s another place out there for you. I\u2019m not a big believer in the whole dream school idea because I honestly think a lot of schools can give you pretty much the same experience. We sometimes fetishize certain schools in our heads even though you\u2019ll probably have a relatively similar experience at most of the schools you apply to. At least for me. I know some people are just applying to the top X schools for their major. Miss me with that. I would despise life at Carnegie Mellon even if they\u2019re really good at CS. I\u2019m just different than that socially. Not trying to hate myself for the next four years, you know? Editing to add this last part in now because this sounds like I\u2019m just roasting CMU. I\u2019m not. I just mean it\u2019s not right for me personally. It\u2019s perfect for a lot of other people. I just think I wouldn\u2019t like it there.\n\n***\n\nBefore I go, I want to echo what I talked about in my first paragraph about not taking this process too seriously. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s not a big deal - it is - but don\u2019t base your self-worth around where you\u2019re going to college. My parents were pretty hands-off throughout it all so I didn\u2019t have that much pressure, but I know some people\u2019s parents aren\u2019t like that. Sit back and think every once in a while, like, whoa, I get to pick where I study. I get to pick what I study. In X months, I\u2019ll have independence and be living on my own in a place I earned the right to be at. That\u2019s pretty fucking cool. Make this thing fun. You only get to/have to do it once. Stop putting so much pressure on yourself to get accepted to all of these colleges. If you had told me this a year ago, I would have sent you to /r/wowthanksimcured because I know you can\u2019t \u201cjust stop\u201d putting so much pressure on yourself, or at least most of you can\u2019t. Just, please, try to have some fun with this. College isn\u2019t the end, it\u2019s the beginning (and now I\u2019m a philosopher I guess). This is the start of your new world of independence, but thankfully you\u2019re eased in with the help of parents and teachers and counselors. Enjoy it. Sit back and smile and think about how you\u2019re picking your own path.\n\n***\n\nThat\u2019s it. Definitely not proofreading this so my bad for any typos. Again, PM me for any personal/CS-specific/school-specific questions. These are just my $0.02 so YMMV. This process is different for everyone, this is just what helped me.\n\n***\n\nOne more thing, about ECs, I literally had 0 CS-related ECs. 0 math competitions. 0 science competitions. No DECA or Science Olympiad. Nothing like that. I had a couple years of varsity sports, community service, and some clubs I\u2019m interested in. Do stuff you like. Not stuff you think colleges will like. I\u2019m not going to lie and say it wouldn\u2019t have helped me if I had USACO Gold (I honestly don\u2019t know what that is but I\u2019ve seen it on here as a good thing), but I don\u2019t think the cost of trying to get that (and probably failing) is worth what I would have given up. Do shit you like.",

I've been extremely stressed about the SATs and Subject Tests, and I think it's because I've been subconsciously putting pressure on myself to get into a good school. Also, it doesn't help that society places importance over certain schools over others, so people feel like their self-worth is automatically increased if they get accepted or attend one of the top schools on the US ranking list.  The US college admissions process is crazy, and I'm slightly envious of places that have a much more straightforward process like Canada and Australia. I honestly have no idea how people remain sane during this process as college expectations keep rising and their acceptance rates keep decreasing. Finally, I agree with the fact that people should see if a college is a good fit for them rather than the other way around. I think that would lift off the pressure of people getting into a top school just for the sake of the brand.",
