I have no idea what my gpa (although I get straight a's and like 3 b's a year), I haven't taken the SAT yet and I haven't done a single thing outside of school. I don't want to go to an ivy league school or any top schools, I just want to apply to a state school ( for a few reasons) and I want to know how to build a college list.",

              "text": "Then you should start with that! Think about what you want out of a college: \n\nLocation - Is it close to the city or more rural? Which do you prefer?\n\nSocial Life - Is Greek life popular if that something you want? Sports? Does it have a competitive culture?\n\nWhat's your major? - Some schools may not have it or they do and the program doesn't align with what you want to learn (like some CS BA programs had language requirements so I didn't apply to those schools)\n\nBig or Small schools?\n\nWhat are the dorms like - Are you okay with communal living? \n\nDiversity - Is the student body made up of a lot of one group? Is there a prominent LGBTQ+ community if your looking for that?\n(etc)\n\nWhat do you want your college experience to look like? What do you want the place your going to live for the next 4 years to be like? Write all that down and look for colleges based on that criteria. It doesn't have to be so specific but generally a school should be one that fits with you.",
