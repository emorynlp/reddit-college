  "text": "I have the impression that bodybuilding is viewed as a narcissistic sport, when in reality that is not necessarily the case. I spend about 8-10hrs per week in the gym bodybuilding and powerlifting (lifting as heavy as you can on compound lifts), and have been doing so for the past year non stop.\n\nI am scared that adding this EC to my application might negatively affect my application due to the negative stereotypes. What should I do?",
