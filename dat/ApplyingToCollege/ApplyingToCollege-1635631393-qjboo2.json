  "text": "So I submitted my CSS profile last week and on the website there is a thing under my application status called \u201ccorrection status\u201d which takes me to a place where I can fix my CSS profile. This is just an optional thing if I want to update/fix something right? Kind of paranoid that I did something wrong and it\u2019s telling me to fix it.",
