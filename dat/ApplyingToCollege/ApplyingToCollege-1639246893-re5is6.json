  "text": "I\u2019m pretty curious. Considering that Reddit is *not* one of the dominant social media platforms amongst all the others, there must be a reason for why you all decided to join Reddit to ask about college applications. Not necessarily college applications, but you get the gist.\n\n\nI personally did when one of my friends introduced me to it back in April - for memes obviously. I eventually understood how it works, and joined all these subreddits to ask questions on college applications - I've helped myself more through this sub than my counsellor has, without a doubt.\n\nI\u2019m listening! :)",

Sometime later, in a stormy night where college research had me done, I decided to try again, found it, spent lots of time on here talking and giving advice, making friends who then (some) ghosted me and now I don\u2019t have time to actually interact here because of college apps, but a fair 75% helpful platform, 25% procrastination devil",
