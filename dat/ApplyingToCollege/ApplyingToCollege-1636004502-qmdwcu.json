              "text": "Typically engineering majors don't have a minor.  So, in your case, you'd need to choose between those two.  A&M certainly has the better reputation of the two, and especially for Mechanical.  Does A&M even have Aerospace?  Will want to check; not every school has it.  Are you also black?  I ask only because you're considering Howard.  If so, then only you can weigh how important attending a HBCU is to you vs. whatever other reputational benefits A&M might provide.",
