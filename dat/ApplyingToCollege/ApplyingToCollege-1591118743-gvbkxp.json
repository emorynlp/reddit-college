It was sixth grade so we didn't focus too much on the college stuff but they did have us do a project where we had to find and research a school we might potentially be interested in going to.\n\nExcept sixth grade me had zero clue what she wanted and chose a private all girls school because it had equestrian studies and allowed you to have dogs on campus. A lot of other kids picked schools for similar (aka non-important) reasons or just chose ivy league for nothing but the name. Or the school with their favorite sports team. \n\nIt took me until 9th grade to realize I didn't hate STEM, 10th to realize I 100% wanted to go into engineering, 11th to realize I specifically loved electronics, and 12th to realize I wanted to do computer engineering instead of electrical.  And for each one of those steps I had said something like \"I mean I'll take the class but I don't want to do engineering\" or \"I've heard it's a fun class and I need it to take the one after it, but I really don't care about computers\". \n\nI'm pretty glad younger me didn't try to stress or plan out my pathway because I had no clue what I wanted back then. I had a much better time just picking classes based off my interests and letting some naturally lead into others. Meanwhile I know some people who missed out on that because they already had ideas of what they were supposed to take to get into college or didn't want to take any non-AP classes.",

Wasted my time and energy for perfection I don't need. I feel super bad for the kids who spent all that energy and never stop. Find moments of peace and enjoy hs. This is the time in your life when you have the most freedom and least responsibility. Get out of the college spiral. Have a good time. Also those schools that are gonna cost you your youth and take a rediculous amount of effort might not be worth it, for most professions that is. Just some food for thought.",

Make sure he keeps this attitude. It's definitely too early to worry about college. Don't get sucked into the rat race.\" He finally cracked a smile. \n\nIt's is WAY too early to start burdening your child with expectations of getting into a good college. Don't do this.

      "text": "I agree with the overall message, but disagree with the specifics.  In my opinion, as someone who took the SAT every year since 6th grade (and now is a senior at Brown), you SHOULD start thinking about it early.  Decisions early have a cascade as you grow up.\n\nFor example, I think it was in 5th grade that students had the chance to enroll in the \"special\" classes if you were doing well enough.  My mom sat me down, told me why that might be important, and we figured out how to prepare to get into those. I did. Those classes actually taught a lot of the math I'd need for the SAT (and a bunch of other math for the sake of learning), and a bunch of techniques that I would need for reading. The teacher of those classes let my mom know about early opportunities for the SAT, too (which led to me doing the opposite of this post).\n\nWhen I took my first SAT, I think I got [high honors as defined by the John Hopkins Talent Saerch](https://cty.jhu.edu/talent/testing/awards.html) (I could be wrong, I don't quite remember).  From then on, I just did a single SAT question a day (there was / is an app for it) from 7th grade to the final time I took it my junior year.  I also took the exam every year during that time.  When I prepared for the ACT, I grinded out 2 practice tests per weekend for 4 weekends before my test. I didn't take any classes on the SAT/ACT, I just studied one question per day, and then crammed at the end before each test.  **I didn't have to because I had been studying for so long and understood what the test looked like / felt like, and new how to pace for years.**\n\nThose special classes led me to keep taking them until 8th grade, at which the value of taking the hardest classes / taking these tests was instilled in me.  As such, I took 1/3/5/7 APs my freshman, sophomore, junior and senior years respectively, which was the most in the history of my school.  **Literally from my freshman year, nobody else could compete -- it was literally impossible if you didn't know what to do your freshman year.** I had valedictorian secured from the beginning, because I knew what to do, understood my school system, and had the privilege of guidance from someone who knew more than me as an incoming high school freshman.  **This is the biggest point: the way of thinking that I learned from considering the SAT/ACT and my college career so early allowed me to fully take advantage of my high school opportunities, and get into my dream school**; obviously I don't remember a random SAT question from 8th grade, but the way it changed my approach to academics was crucial.\n\nTL;DR: All in all, I never \"worried about this shit\" at all -- because I would just do a question in the 15 minutes before I got out of bed in the morning, because I'd take a test every year (sometimes with practice tests before hand) since 7th grade, and because I felt extremely prepared with no pressure.  I played video games all day after school, was a varsity swimmer, and had a good social balance.  It's possible to pay attention to your future, to plot out everything you need to do, and to keep it in mind since 7th grade (or earlier) AND play Minecraft all day.  Should you spend your entire time on /r/a2c?  No, I didn't know about it until my junior year. However, I also had guidance that allowed me to make the right choices as I went through school.  If you are not as privileged, this sub might be a great place to find those resources. But, beyond that, you don't need to read stress posts / rants constantly -- unless it doesn't add any stress to you, in which case do whatever you want lol.  If, however, reading these posts freak you out, find the resources and leave, don't engage in discussion.  The resources are invaluable, the stress is not.\n\n(Note: I'm obviously also speaking from a point of bias -- I am not an average student. I also was the kid that never studied for an AP test and would get a 5, going in only based on what I learned in class and from homework. I also am the type to never get stressed, even if my plate's completely full -- so maybe my statements about stress / pacing it out might not work for you, but would for me. I would argue, however, that if you're someone who's motivated to start thinking about this stuff now, just take it slow, appreciate why you're doing this now and the things you can do, and really habituate your studying.  15 minutes a day since 7th grade has an effect on your whole academic career over that timeframe. Just don't stress yourself out over it either -- you'll take your final test eventually, and you've got plenty of time. If you can handle it, do it; if it's messing you up, take it slower and find your balance.)",
