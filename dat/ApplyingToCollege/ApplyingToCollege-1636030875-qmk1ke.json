  "title:": "Do colleges have to uphold certain incentives they offer for specific programs?",
  "text": "Not sure who else to ask for this or if there any legal precedents that may exist, but this seemed like an appropriate forum.\n\nMy college advertised a tuition-free master's degree for qualified students who did their undergrad at the school. That offer was in place for three years, but surprisingly enough, was not advertised in this year's academic catalog. Is there anything in my power to have them uphold that offer? It was one of the main reasons why I originally applied and enrolled as a freshman.\n\nFor background, my institution is a small, private Catholic school. I am currently a senior and am contemplating enrolling in the fifth-year Master's program. The price of that program is about $35,000. I'm really upset that I may now have to borrow most of that through more loans as opposed to it being tuition-free.",
