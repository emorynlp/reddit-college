  "text": "This sub discourages me so much \ud83d\ude05 i just went down the rabbit hole and there are so many posts from people kind of putting down certain schools/people applying to college. I am a senior at a very urban underprivileged high school. Most people I know aren\u2019t even going to college!! I have 41 college credits that I have completed, with 10 more getting finished this week. Besides from this, i feel like i have not had many opportunities to stand out. No one in my class has. It is shocking to see some people talking about competing for valedictorian, or class rank. We dont even have a class rank lol. I got a 1210 on the SAT and i was in the top ten highest scores. Idk, i go to school to have fun and see my friends and just enjoy life and so many people on here are strictly business at school. Have my priorities been wrong all this time? \ud83e\udd23",
