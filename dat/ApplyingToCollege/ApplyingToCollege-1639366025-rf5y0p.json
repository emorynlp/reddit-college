  "text": "Is this happening to anyone else: parent tax returns + one of the W2s says \u201creceived, ready for review\u201d and the status date keeps *changing* to whatever TODAY\u2019s date is (I also checked a few days ago and it showed up as that day\u2019s date).\n\nEverything else says \u201creceived and satisfied\u201d and status date shows up as a day in November.\n\nI\u2019m probably overthinking this lol. Just wanted to leave this here so future generations can reference if this is an indication of rejection :(((",
