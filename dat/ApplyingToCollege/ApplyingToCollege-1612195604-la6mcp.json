  "title:": "UPDATE: my parents gave my college fund to my sister",
  "text": "I just want to say thank you so much for the support on the last one. Seriously, I tried talking to my friends about and they replied with \u201cLMAO\u201d.  Y\u2019all are amazing people and I hope you know that. \n\n[Link to the other post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/l575jz/i_hate_my_life_my_parents_gave_my_college_savings/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) \n\nAnyways here\u2019s the update: \n\nI accidentally found out my mom is fucking pregnant. Seriously what the fuck. She doesn\u2019t know I know. \n\nOn the other hand, one of my grandparents passed away a while back. They were kinda rich and left me 80k and I can cash that out and use it in my college fund.(They left another 80k for my younger sis). I\u2019d rather still have the person though; fuck cancer. \n\nSo because of these situations, I have a clear plan in life. I\u2019m going to go to any school that has a good CS program that is preferably at least 4 hours away from where I live. I will then get a high paying job and never see my parents or my sister again. Then by the age of 35 i\u2019m gonna retire, move to Switzerland and have a cottage core farm, and never see my parents or my sister again. \n\nIt all kind of worked out in the end so thank the universe for that. If any of you all are in a similar situations please try niche scholarships that relate to your situation. Additionally, community college was a great option, just not for me. I heard FAFSA or your schools fin aid would take into account your financial situations so always try appeals. \n\nHugs \ud83e\udec2\ud83d\udc97",

      "text": "I know your post is venting, and you're being more flippant about your future goals there than you likely are in actual fact, but if you don't mind an adult perspective from someone who has learned a lot about how individuals and family finance their education...\n\nIt's much, MUCH hard to self-finance your education than you would expect. The assets your parents have, and potentially the 529s, that exist for them but won't support you will hurt your financial aid options and hinder how colleges can help you in the future. Paying for food, housing, health insurance (which colleges will require), and a whole host of other expenses will demand more of your attention and resources than you expect as well.\n\nAll that is to say: simply earmarking your 80k for college tuition may not get you as far as you think. And if you spend all that money up front, to cover tuition for your first years for as long as you can, then you're more vulnerable to credit card debit and other structural mistakes that WILL pop up but will somehow also be unexpected, and those mistakes will cost you a TON in the long run.\n\nIt is very expensive to be poor. You need that money to make sure you aren't poor in college, because college is especially expensive when you're poor.\n\nWhile the little you've shared suggests your parents may be terrible... they have resources that can help you, if you can figure out how to pry those resources out of their judgmental hands. \n\nOne example: you strike a deal with them where you pay your way for the first semester or year. If you manage a 3.5 GPA taking that year, they commit to giving you back 50% of that 529, or they agree to cover your food and housing as long as you maintain that GPA. Maybe that arrangement isn't not possible given your relationship with your parents, but be careful before you go scorched earth with them. I mention this particularly since an unexpected accidental child can make people panic and do crazy things, and they may be more pliable 18 months from now than they are today. Then again, maybe not.\n\nEither way, you will need to completely rethink your college search. Being 4 hours away would be nice. Better is to be in a low-cost of living area (so you can afford to live away from home) and attending a school with manageable tuition. Honestly, good CS programs may not be as important as workable CS programs and cheap net-tuition. If you live on the east coast, maybe that's finding a middle-of-the-road LAC in Indiana or Iowa (for example) that is so hungry for east coast students they give you a fat scholarship. Or you suck it up and attend a CC for two years and then transfer into the program of your dreams. \n\nI hear you when you say \"it's not for me,\" but I also am *certain* you don't really understand the financial implications of trying to pay for tuition alone, without parental support. Hell, I worked as an AO for 8 years and still work in and around university admissions and I still don't fully understand it all. 80k just won't go that far unless you structure your college path around cost management. \n\nFinally... I can only imagine how hard this sucks for you. But your sister didn't do this, and she will need you as she gets older and starts to see what you're already seeing. Imagine how meaningful and helpful it would be to have an older sibling, out of college, who was in a position to help you figure all this out. Don't punish her for their mistakes.",

He had a mental illness, so I don't blame him, but I could not be around him, so for years before his death, I spoke to him maybe once every-other year.\n\nMy sister and I weren't at all close growing up.  But to my pleasant surprise, we get along reasonably well as adults, and talk to each other maybe once per month or so.\n\nOn the other hand, I adore my in laws.  I'd take a bullet for my MIL, FIL, and BIL without hesitation.\n\nDon't ever let anyone make you feel guilty about 'abandoning' your family.

Yes I'm scaring you because that's how every kid joining CS is and they regret it because of burnout or give up. You need to be a God to get a really good job and practice online and draft up a whole git page of programs/projects. Learn to navigate Linux and focus on stuff outside of programming as well. Learn kernels and security protocols. \n\nFafsa will be a fight so get your college advisor early and make a battle plan.
