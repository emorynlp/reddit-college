For example, Princeton had a 3.98% acceptance rate for the Class of 2025, accepting a total of 1,498 applicants whereas Harvard, with a lower 3.43% acceptance rate, accepted 1,968 applicants. Of course yield also comes into play here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI must add, this is truly sad that a difference of literally only 0.45% is considered a big gap this year, college admissions have truly been a shitshow for the Class of 2025, thank god we're done with this bullshit.",

There are thousands of colleges in the US. The low acceptance rates are important because they set the best of the best apart from the rest, and everybody else still has countless educational opportunities (much much cheaper ones, at that).",

      "text": "Honestly, acceptance rate ceases to be an issue. Let's say Stanford is currently accepting 2k students and receiving about 50k applications giving an acceptance rate of about 4%. If Stanford suddenly decided to listen to you and said they'll accept 4k students next year I can definitely say that the applications will become around double in number just because a lot more ppl will believe they can get in. A similar thing happened this year because of the test blind policy.\n\nCase in point, I think UCLA receives more applications than any other school which is >110k or something so 100k apps is definitely reachable for a lot of schools.\n\n It's a way more nuanced issue than the simplistic jargon you can see on here. Like I know for a fact that even if universities own the land they get into trouble with the municipal bodies if they want to construct more dorms and stuff.",

And this isn't even factoring in federal grants and external scholarships you would most likely qualify for, especially being in an Ivy.\n\nAnd while I know just because my circumstances are worse off than yours doesn't necessarily make your pain less bearable to you, but when you said 'middle class', I was honestly thinking 50-70k range. We all have different standards, but if my family of four can live comfortably with my father's salary of $30K in Texas, I'd say your family's minimum standard of living is much higher than others. And that's fine- nothing wrong with that. It's just that maybe you should put it into perspective before you complain about the 'semi-high cost' these colleges are asking you to pay..",

It's taking the opposite approach opposed to that of ivies. Now that's a real prestigious institution. You don't have to sacrifice selectivity for prestige.\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9b",

As the system is designed.\n\n> made as a temporary compromise \n\nNothing I can find says it was temporary. I'm not refuting this, just don't see it anywhere. Even if it is though, none of our early presidents or founding fathers desired to change it.\n\nAs for it being a compromise\u2014our Congress was founded on a compromise, the Connecticut Compromise, so I don't see how this is an issue.\n\n>in the 18th century for a frontier agriculture society\n\nAs was the rest of our government and founding documents; how is this an issue? Do you disagree with the Bill of Rights because it is also from the 18th century for a frontier agriculture society, or do you want to realize that the founding fathers designed the government to work in a long-lasting fashion?\n\n>instead of actually convincing the majority of people that they could do the job.\n\nOur government isn't a participatory democracy, so there's no reason to convince the majority. We're a representative republic built on the principle of **federalism**. Every president/governmental candidate understands this when they run, as did the states when they signed the constitution.\n\n>They \"won\" in the sense a friend of mine once \"won\" a hockey game because the other team's bus broke down.\n\nFalse equivalency. Your friend won because the other team didn't even get to play. Bush, and other similar candidates, won with the other player competing; they just didn't win under the terms they agreed upon.\n\nLastly, I'd also like to note how you didn't even address the second half of my response to your initial comment. How you said so much, yet so little in your response.\n\nEdited: forgot to address \"temporary compromise\" line",

It is totally absurd that they educate so few (often uber wealthy) students when they have the resources to advance so many peoples lives by providing them with an education. So wasteful tbh. Only about 12-15% of students at each ivy league are low income. At Penn and Princeton about 77% of the students are in the top 20% of the income distribution ladder. These schools aren't doing much to reach out to FGLI students. Harvard could have used that Martha's Vineyard money to increase their class size and provide social/economic mobility to more low income students but no, they chose vines.",

There's plenty of options to choose from, so the Ivies are under no reason to lower them just because people don't want to apply to their state or \"safety\" school. You aren't forced to apply, and they aren't entitled to provide a spot. If you get rejected, become a superstar at some other T20 school that accepts you, or at an LAC, or at a state school, even community college; the options are endless.\n\nAdditionally, one of the main issues with the article's argument is assuming the Ivies must undertake the responsibility of resolving low-income education disparities. They're **private** schools. Why are we assuming that they must be the one to do this when that is\u2014and should be\u2014the job of public universities\u2014you know, the ones actually funded by tax dollars.\n\nAnd while yes, the prime objective of an educational institution is to, well, educate people, it is up to that institution to determine who it educates. If it wants a small student body, you shouldn't force it to change. Once again, don't know why we're trying to interfere with **private** institutions.\n\nComplain about the public school system instead of trying to rely on private sources.",

I knew a mother of three kids, another person who was homeless, yet still fought tooth and nail to get to class every day, and many, many, veterans. Yet the one thing we all had in common was being given the opportunity to get a valuable education.\n\nCommunity colleges are literally doing god\u2019s work.

But I think in a sense there are terrific schools all over the country that offer tremendous educations;   small liberal arts colleges, great state schools.   This is not a new take at all.  Many have argued that the Ivy's should accept more students. Obviously, to do so they would need to expand and that is not necessarily going to result in the same exceptional quality institution.  There are physical limits, dollar limits, physical limits to a Universities size.  A school should be and can be proud that its standards of admission are very high and that they are desirable enough that more people want to go there than can possibly be accepted.  They should probably get rid of legacy (not in a meritocracy) and have need blind admissions;  but that is it.. let the most qualified go to a place like Harvard.  Will they have more qualified applicants than they can take?  Yes.  The acceptance rate will always be lower at the more desirable schools, period.",

There's a lot of value in concentrating smart, talented, driven people together and giving them a shit ton of resources, way more than would be available to the average person.

Elite opportunities like that will never be accessible to the public at large.\n\nThe issue is that the top schools in the US (for the most part; I think schools like UChicago, MIT, Caltech are a bit of an exception) don't even try to select for talent or drive. They select for things like legacy, which boarding school you went to, your race (which mostly just helps rich immigrants; these schools care more about having good diversity scores than actually uplifting communities), or how \"interesting\" a bunch of randos found your life story. Seriously, a college is in no position to judge someone's character off a few short essays. They should stick to judging objective measures of accomplishment.",

      "text": "I agree with you, I have been thinking about this for a while. It is important to have a place where we educate the next generation of trailblazing scientists, artists, and entrepreneurs. However, most ivy league students just turn out to be accountants, engineers, and financial analysts (not saying those are bad professions, far from it, but do you really need such a limited-edition education to do those things?)\n\nIt would be nice if these colleges took more time to broaden their impact, and prioritize the quantity of students they are educating. I think initiatives such as EdX, Harvard Extension School, etc are great initiatives and I am very pleased that these major universities are really trying to make a more broad impact.",

After attending a prestigious college, they spend their whole lives chasing prestige in whatever next stages of life. Once you get past the elitist tone of the book (one thing I hated about it btw) there are some really good points!",

Larger student bodies would stretch universities resources and opportunities thin. The fact that less people are getting in is not the fault of the university but the fault of all of us for making a big fuss about them.",
