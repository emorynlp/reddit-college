              "text": "CSS Profile is merely a form containing information that helps a college calculate a student's financial need.\n\nThe aid comes from the college itself, not from the CSS Profile. What is included in the package depends on what the college wants to offer you.\n\nI would guess that financial aid offered to internationals by colleges would typically be grants and scholarships, but that is not something I could possibly confirm. It will depend on the college. You should ask a college's financial aid office.",
