  "text": "Hey y'all this is gonna be kind of a long one but basically for freshman year of hs I didn't live in America and when I moved here for sophomore year many of the classes I took were to make up for a lot of my credits that didn't transfer. I didn't have too much room for AP courses so my weighted GPA and rank aren't too hot because of it. I'm still in the top 25% of my graduating class though and junior year(this year) I'm taking 5 AP's and i'm doing pretty decent in them and I plan on taking a few AP's senior year as well. I just wanted to know how that would effect the strength my overall college application and my chances of admission at say UT Dallas or UT Austin (i'm a texas resident) and i also come from an extremely competitive school district \ud83d\ude2d",
