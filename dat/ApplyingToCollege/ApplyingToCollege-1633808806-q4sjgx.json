              "text": "Yeah, you're thinking of the University of Michigan and Penn State (or maybe UPenn, which is an actual ivy, not a state school, but sounds like it could be a state school). Generally, top public schools are actually more expensive if you're not from the state than private schools, since public schools give almost all of their scholarships to in-state students. Also note that all but five universities (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, and Amherst, four of which are among the five best universities in the world and the fifth of which (Amherst) is still a very good university that's pretty difficult to get into) are need-blind for internationals, so that makes it even harder to get into Oxbridge/LSE/Imperial quality universities.\n\nGenerally, for top 50 schools in the US:\n\n\\-You want, at minimum, A\\* A\\* A predicted, and preferably A\\* A\\* A\\* A predicted, in addition to top GCSE's/AS's and a 1500+ SAT. If you're applying to a STEM course, take further maths (if offered) and at least one laboratory science course\n\n\\-For extracurriculars, do whatever you're passionate about, and then go very deep into it; do as many structured activities related to it as you can, create your own clubs/blogs/whatever about your passion, and try to get regional/national awards in your passion, if offered.",

The US practices holistic admissions, so I'm not sure what to tell you apart from \"do as well as you can,\" although at minimum you'd probably want at least 4 A's, with higher being better. Generally, you'll get an offer based off your A-level predicted, which will only get revoked if you don't sit the A2's/do *very* badly on the A2's (like, below BBB).\n2. Like I mentioned earlier, it's not how many you do rather than how far deep you go into them; a student who is the captain of their sports team, mentors younger students, and helps out with team logistics is vastly preferred to a student who is just a participant in two or three sports.",
