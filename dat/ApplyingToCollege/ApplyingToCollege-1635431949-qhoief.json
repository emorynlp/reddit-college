              "text": "Just because they rejected your appeal, that doesn't mean they won't allow appeals.  Most universities will allow financial aid appeals, especially if you can present a reason why your aid package does not accurately reflect your financial situation or if you can show a much stronger offer from a peer institution.  As an example, one of my students two years ago got WAY more aid from WashU than Columbia and wanted to go to Columbia.  He showed Columbia the offer and the reasons he thought it should be higher and they matched it, adding $10K a year to his grant.  \n\nAll of that said, some schools are less interested in negotiating than others (but you can always try - the worst that happens is they say no).  It also depends on how badly they want you to enroll and how much they think you really need/deserve the extra aid.  Finally, NYU has a reputation for being somewhat stingy with financial aid.",

It\u2019s ur job to prove why you are special and deserve to get admitted. So unless you have an exceptionally good reason why they made a mistake rejecting you - just don\u2019t waste your time appealing. It\u2019ll only get your hopes up",
