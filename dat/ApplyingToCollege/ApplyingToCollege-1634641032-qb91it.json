  "title:": "\"IU Bloomington, UofArizona or UofUtah\" Pls Help a Confused Fella",
  "text": "I am an international student who completed approximately 57 credit hours in Business Administration outside the U.S and looking forward to transferring into either IU Bloomington, University of Arizona, or the University of Utah. I have been told by many individuals your best bet is basically to look at their ranks and make your decision from there. However, I don't think [US.News](https://US.News) or [Niche.com](https://Niche.com) ranking is everything, and there are definitely things such as personal experiences that can provide more insights than just a number. That's why I am writing this post. \n\nFYI, I have received full offers from those institutions and approximately 50 credit hours have been transferred. \n\nDecision Criterias: \n\n1. The ability to find interns or jobs after graduation; it can get very difficult especially for us international fellows :(\n2. The ability to join student organizations or clubs for Business - Finance - Computer Science.\n3. The ability to apply for MBA after completing my bachelor's.\n4. The ability to declare a second major or a minor in CS. \n\nPlease help me in deciding which one can be my best option based on the criteria mentioned above. Also, tuitions aren't a big concern since I will be supported by my country's government. \n\nAny comments are appreciated and can help me significantly :) \n\nI apologize for any grammar errors, English isn't my first language.",

      "text": "Indiana has the strongest B school.  All three are AAU members, but Indiana's an OG member (1909 vs. 1985 for AZ and 2019 for UT).  No idea what the situation is with adding CS as a minor; you'll need to research how feasible that is at each school.\n\nArizona and Utah are marginally more well-respected specifically for CS, but the difference is negligible.\n\nFor MBA, you may want to go work somewhere first; seems to be what most/many people do before getting an MBA.\n\nStrongly suspect all three will have roughly the same clubs.",
