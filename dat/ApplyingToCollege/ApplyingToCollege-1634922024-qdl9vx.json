  "text": "***Edit:*** Thank you all!\n\nHello, lovely A2C. It's u/admissionsmom and u/mcneiladmissions here for our AMA. Ask us your questions about anything related to your applications, essays, or life!\n\nWe will be here from 10-11am PT answering questions rapid-fire. Then, for you late-comers, u/admissionsmom and I will be hanging around throughout the day to keep things going.\n\n**Who are we?** We are private admissions consultants who work with students at every phase of the application: school selection, narrative strategy, everything essays. If it's part of the process of applying to college, we do it.\n\nWe have worked with hundreds upon hundreds of students and read  thousands of essays. u/admissionsmom happens to be the all-time GOAT of this sub, if I do say so myself.\n\n**The reason for this AMA**: Well, November 1st is nigh - and for many of you that means spooky scary ED deadlines. So that's the most immediate reason. We are here to administer one-part critical / strategic information, one part therapy session?\n\nSome of the topics we can talk about\n\n* How does ED/EA/REA work? What are the differences between these options (and which should you choose, given your circumstances)?\n* Last minute essay questions - topic, tone, style, etc.\n* Late revisions to your school list. Need some school ideas? u/admissionsmom is somewhat of a guru here.\n\nHit us with anything you got.",

Every college has their own way of looking at your application. \n\nSome take your straight-up weighted gpa. \n\nSome use your straight-up unweighted gpa. \n\nSome only use your weighted grades for your academic classes. \n\nSome only use your unweighted grades for your academic classes. \n\nEdit to add \u2014 please see u/IntheSarlaccsBelly comment below to clarify what I said and correct my understanding:  \n\nSome colleges recalculate your gpa altogether \u2014 often using your unweighted gpa for your academic classes.  \n\nThat\u2019s why you can\u2019t sit and fret too much about your gpa \u2014 it is what it is. I usually recalculate my students gpa using only their unweighted academic courses to see where they are. \n\nBut other schools just use the gpa you\u2019re sending on your transcript. \n\nWow that\u2019s a long ass answer that probably didn\u2019t actually answer your question,  but in the case of college admissions, it\u2019s actually the most common answer:  it depends.",

But unless COVID forced a widespread change, the majority of highly selective private schools with which I am familiar do not recalculate a GPA, and have a strong preference to use a weighted GPA when a high school provides one.\n\nEdit: though, the most important part of this comment is absolutely correct. Your GPA is what it is and for 98% of students whatever a college is doing behind the scenes to recalculate (or not) your GPA is totally irrelevant. Worrying or thinking about it is a waste of emotional energy.",

In my view, essays should almost never \"go meta\" and reflect on the admissions process itself. Essays should also not subvert the prompt. \n\nGenerally, supplemental essays should answer the question asked directly (creative liberty in how you approach the question is allowed). In the case of a personal statement, really delve into something **personal** and avoid trappings of a quirky format or take. \n\nI see so many students writing essays that are funny, clever, full of allusions and references, that never provide an honest reflection about their life and who they are. \n\nPlease try to avoid excessive quirkiness.

With ED deadlines right around the corner (I swear I was just watching '21 apply ED yesterday), I have a few things I'm a bit worried about.\n\n1. Northwestern only requires one teacher LOR (instead of 2 like the other colleges on my list), but they do allow optional extra teacher LORs. Would it be a bad idea to just send both of mine since I have them? If I should choose one, what are your thoughts on a teacher who can speak to my work in a rigorous course close to my major vs. a basic level class teacher who's also been my coach in several activities (athletic + academic ones) and knows me personally a bit more? \n\n2. Cliche essay topics (especially sports) - are they bad because of the topic itself or because people always write the topic the same way? My drafts tend to circle back to football, but it's not the sports injury or state championship story (more tied to identity), so I was wondering if there's a way to write it well or if I should ditch the idea entirely.\n\nThanks again for doing this!",

A Harvard 1, from what I understand, is a pretty legendary / quixotic thing to achieve. It might involve a really crazy international-level achievement or working directly with a government organization on a project, for example. It sounds like you have some amazing ECs that you should be proud of. But there is a god-tier EC level that is what (I believe) is more aligned with a \"Harvard 1.\" Also I have no freakin idea because I'm not a member of the Harvard admissions committee. K! \n3. I don't know. I'm not too familiar with that detail of the IB system. \n4. PSAT awards are definitely bankable - a lot of schools will recruit PSAT award winners. It matters but isn't decisive.

          "text": "Here\u2019s the deal about the personal essay. It has to be just that \u2014 super, incredibly, deeply personal. The essay needs to be about inner you \u2014 the you they can\u2019t get to know anywhere else in your application. The mechanism you use to get that message across the page isn\u2019t that important. So before you try to figure out how you want to tell your story figure out what the reader needs to learn about you. What\u2019s the essence of youness that they need to understand to feel like the they\u2019ve been sitting and hanging out with you!? \n\nYour job is to build a connection between you and the reader. You do that by allowing them in to your head and showing some vulnerability. So, you have to peel off your onion layers, find your inner Shrek, dig in super deep, and get to know yourself like you\u2019ve never done before. It\u2019s not easy. Ask yourself some really personal questions like: \n\nWhat do I believe? \n\nWhat do I think?\n\nWhat do I value?\n\nWhat keeps me up at night?\n\nWhat do I get excited about?\n\nWhat comforts me?\n\nWhat worries me?\n\nWhat\u2019s important to me?\n\nWho are my super heroes?\n\nWhat\u2019s my super power?\n\nWhat\u2019s my special sauce?\n\nWhat reminds me of home?\n\nJust play with these.  And learn a lot. Become the expert on you because you are really the only person who can be the expert on you. Then, you\u2019ll be ready to teach the lesson about who you are and what you believe and value to the application readers.  The vehicle you use to get your message across really isn\u2019t as important as what you\u2019re saying about yourself. This doesn\u2019t have to be (and, in my opinion) shouldn\u2019t be a complete narrative. You want to worry more about sticking with the reader than standing out, so I think the essays need to be more reflection and analysis than story. Those are the essays that stick with me after reading a few thousand of them.  You want the reader to feel bonded with you so they\u2019ll want to go fight for you in the admissions committee. \n\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t use a story. Use one if that\u2019s what feels right for you. Just remember the story is only the vehicle for getting the message of who you are across the page. \n\nIf you\u2019d like to go into more depth, I  recently posted about the personal essay with my step by step guide and links to some of my fave resources: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ppetbb/hi_seniors_you_do_have_an_amazing_essay_inside/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",

I would say that new letters are a nice-to-have but not a need-to-have. If you're reapplying to a college that rejected you, you'll need to demonstrate what has changed since that first application round. New letters can help AO's get a picture of how you've grown since your first application, especially if they're from counselors. Teacher letters of rec might be more narrow (assessing your performance in a particular class), so their ability to address any personal change you've underwent is likely equally narrow.

Here\u2019s what I always say \u2014 if there\u2019s any potential you need aid and you can\u2019t attend without it \u2014 apply with aid. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see kids work their asses off, get accepted, and then not be able to attend because of aid issues. If you know there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll get any aid and you don\u2019t and won\u2019t need it to attend for all four years, then don\u2019t apply for aid. \n\n2. I usually get my kids to ask their teachers to add a little bit of an update.  Or different teachers who might have had a different experience with you by the end of senior year \n\nMake sure you have a balanced list. If things didn\u2019t go your way last year then really add updates about what you\u2019ve been doing with your time. With no major changes to your applications, things will more than likely stay the same unfortunately. So add those updates and make it clear what\u2019s changed.  \n\nGood luck!!",

I made a meme kind of gesturing toward this the other day. \n\nIt's the tendency of students to see the ED as a one-time opportunity to punch above their weight & have a chance at a school they could otherwise never get into. So students use their ED on Stanford, CMU, or wherever, knowing they have no chance in heck, but hoping nonetheless. \n\nI think EDs are better spent on reach-target schools - competitive schools where, RD, you are a strong contender. This seems like a better *strategic* move to me, as it maximizes your chances of being admitted to a strong program. So many students blow their ED on the same handful of schools. \n\nAnd yeah, in your case, if you need aid, it couldn't hurt.",

The poem is basically talking to him. It all ties together really well. Peers as well as professionals have told me they think it's really good.\n\nI'm wondering if I need to directly answer \"why has it been important to you\"  or if the essay shows that enough.

          "text": "1. Yeah, it sounds solid to me. I like most essays that focus on a genuine skill (art in this case) and use it to document a positive personal change. I would say that it probably belongs most under #1 or #5, but my vote would be for #1. \n2. Well, ummm, make sure to be honest with yourself when writing - try to be \"vulnerable,\" i.e., speak from a place of real personal meaning. The personal statement really should be personal, written on a topic close to your heart. So above all, make sure your topic-selection channels something important.  I tend to think of supplementals  as more of a strategic document where, yes, perhaps you're telling a bit of your story, but above all you are demonstrating interest and alignment with the academics, values, culture of the school. So keep the personal statement personal, the supplementals more strategic. \n3. They matter but most folks tend to rank them toward the bottom on the importance scale when considering all the different components - grades, ~~scores~~, essays, letters.",

For letters of recommendation, it really depends. If you go to a huge public school where the admissions readers know there's no way your teachers and counselors have time to write strong letters, your letters probably won't hurt if they're not strong.   If you go to a school that's known for strong letters of recommendation, and you get a weak one, it could definitely hurt.  Strong letters can benefit you no matter what.

Applying for a BA in sociology is going to be easier than a BS in CS at most programs. But this isn't generally that advisable or ethical. You're likely to have a harder time passing off a good application in philosophy if all your ECs are in CS. \n\nThat said, in your situation, if you're open to philosophy or sociology, you might want to look into those. They tend to be less highly impacted. I would only give this advice to someone who truly is undecided and could go a few different ways.",

      "text": "I\u2019m an international student and sadly, we don\u2019t have 12 years education system in my country (fyi, we only have to attend for 10 years). I think that\u2019s already a disadvantage to me. However, I have finished 2 years of university in my home country with a good GPA. [ I hope I could present that to them :( ]\n\nDue to some situations, my parents encouraged me to apply for universities in the US and I\u2019m now preparing for it. But honestly, I don\u2019t see my chance of getting in since I don\u2019t have SAT or AP. I only have the matriculation examination marks of my country, a few good ECs, and a TOEFL mark which exceeds the minimum requirement of most schools,100. Besides, we don\u2019t even have a counselor here and I see that most universities ask for a recommendation letter from a counselor and a teacher. I know I\u2019m aiming high but honestly speaking I want to try applying into UCs for CS.\n\nWould you recommend me to apply for direct admission or should I just go to CC first and then transfer? My parents are encouraging me to try and test my luck out for direct admission although I explain them I have a very low chance of getting accepted as I will have to compete with students from all over the world with stellar GPA and ECs.\n\n( I\u2019m sorry if my comment digresses from the topic, just tell me and I will remove it! I just want to let it all out and ask for an opinion because the deadline is looming and I don\u2019t have any one to discuss about this matter. )",

My school transferring situation is kind of complicated so let me explain:\n\nSo my dad is a teacher, so wherever he works, I follow him because as a teacher's kid I get free tuition. Without that, theres no way my family could pay for these admittedly snobby private schools. Live in the Philippines (i'm American-FIlipino), I went to a local private school for gr 9-10, with no AP classes, teaching the Filipino curriculum. Moved to a AP school abroad for gr 11, taking only 1 AP because I didn't really understand the importance of AP classes. Redid gr 11 again at an online school because of a dumb technicality (i'm not sending my transcripts from this online school). Then finally moved again abroad for gr 12, taking 3 APs. It's kinda hard to make real commitments to ECs when i've moved schools so many times, so i'm really worried about my admissions because of my weak ECs. Along with that, I can't take the SAT because testing keeps getting cancelled where I live. I feel as if the only that I have going for me is a good GPA and what I think is a good portfolio (most colleges require a portfolio for my major).\n\ntldr: I moved schools a lot, how does this affect admissions?",

Have you ever had an experience where a college called/tried to verify an extracurricular of an international student? I\u2019ve read on a couple of college websites that some schools might conduct audits, and I\u2019m worried that since some of my activities (esp. volunteering ones) are local, if they called the organizations they might not be able to understand/provide explanations in english and it might reflect negatively on my application\n2. If art/painting is a prominent theme in my common app essay + a significant activity in the activities section, but I choose not to submit a supplemental arts portfolio, would it by any means detract from the impact of the essay / look suspicious / undermine the value of the activity? I don\u2019t think my art is of an \u201cexceptional level\u201d as many schools recommend on their slideroom pages, and I don\u2019t really want it to be reviewed by faculty since I\u2019m applying to a number of top schools. I did however spend a tonnn of time on it during my high school years. Should I try to submit one anyways, change the theme of my application/essay, or leave things as they are in your opinion?",

This sport, though, is such an important part of me that it feels like a crime to write about something else about me. I feel like the application also weighs heavily on it, too, because this sport takes up so much time that I haven't been able to get an internship, job, or do school sports/band because of it, and my entire life denounced to a single slot in an EC list feels, as I said, criminal.

There are a lot of amazing schools that you could apply to where you would be competitive. \n\nBut first, for your own sanity, you need to try to let go of the fixation on getting into a \"good school.\" A good school by what metrics? Prestige? Belonging to the T20, 30, 50? If that is your measure of quality, you may be disappointed. \n\nYou should take a look at [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/p15eq4/7_true_safeties_with_higher_teaching_quality_than/) I wrote a couple months ago - it's about schools that have a really great reputation for teaching but that are actually fairly non-selective.  \n\nAlso take a look at [Colleges that Change Lives](https://ctcl.org/). I think lower-ranked liberal arts colleges are a godsend for students who want a great education but may not be in the top top of their HS class. \n\nGood luck. There are definitely great safeties out there for you and you have plenty of time to find them.",

I\u2019ve been hearing this a lot from peers, but I\u2019m unsure if it\u2019s accurate.\n\nFinally, for people with good but not great EC\u2019s, are elite (ie t10) schools a possibility? Assuming test scores and GPA are on par with the school\u2019s requirements, is it common for schools to look past their EC\u2019s and let them in on the basis of stellar essays?",

First-year grades are generally taken with a big grain of salt and much more emphasis falls on sophomore - junior - senior trends. \n\nAll things being equal, GPA would be less important due to Covid - or AOs might understand more variability in grade trends. But because scores are out the window entirely, I actually think that GPA is **more** important in assessing your application. So are essays and LORs, but GPA in particular imo. \n\nYou can get in on the basis of amazing essays, scores, and grades, sure.

I've been told that is the case and so I was wondering whether I should commit to doing some AP courses. \n\nAnd if it is a good idea to do these APs, how many APs should I realistically try to do as a current high school junior? I am interested in studying the biological sciences/biochemistry at university, so what kind of APs should I consider doing? I'm already taking Biology and Chemistry as an A level subject, as well as Physics and Maths, so if I need to pick up APs, is it better to do the same APs as my A level subjects or something else?",

As far as I'm aware, schools look at your cumulative grade, but in the small chance they check individual year grades, would my cumulative grade going from a 3.82 in sophmore year to a 3.799 in junior year (due to honors chem class) affect my admission due to there being a \"downward trend\"?\n3. Would it be able for me to schedule a private session to go over my supplements and common app essay next week , I procrastinated a bit too much and only just started my essays a week ago... even though I'm done writing it I really want to polish it and get another opinion.\n\nThanks!",
