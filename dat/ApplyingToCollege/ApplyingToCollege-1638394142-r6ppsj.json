You\u2019re telling me that a T10 would pass up on a classics and linguistics applicant in the favor of another run-of-the mill Computer Science application with very similar stats and EC\u2019s? T10s have whole departments with faculty, research, etc in these underrepresented majors. They can\u2019t just lay off the professors and faculty there because of a lack of interest. Admissions has to take an active role in recruiting applicants interested in these fields. I think u/ScholarGrade said something about this a while back too",

Like this: https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/index.php\n\nThere are plenty of highly qualified 3.9 students who are shocked to see the 3.5 students getting into a school they were rejected from - because social work has a much lower threshold than CS. \n\nIt still might be best to apply as CS to some schools where it\u2019s nearly impossible to switch into the major later (UW, Cal Poly, UCSD\u2026) but it adds enough difficulty to the process that you should research how each school admits and think hard about it.",
