  "title:": "Question about columbia application",
  "text": "hi! i applied to columbia university ed this year, and theres something im worried about on my app; in the \"which activities at columbia are you interested in\" part, i chose a sport that i don't have any experience in but want to learn later. but looking through the recruiting form for the team on columbia's athletics page, i realized that i would need experience to join the team, so it's most likely that i won't be able to play that sport even if i do get in. does this hurt my chances of admissions at all, or am i just being paranoid?",

Columbia has a ton of those, and they aren't the competitive intercollegiate athletic team. You can join those with basically no skills needed.",
