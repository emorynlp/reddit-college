  "title:": "Doing really bad in two classes first semester of senior year",
  "text": "I'm about to fail my art class elective and my math class first semester. My school does grades by yearly average so I can probably bring my art class grade up to a C or something by the end of the year. Will the at class grade hurt a lot when applying to RD schools? I suck at that type of stuff. For math I think my counselor messed up and signed me up for the wrong level class, it's at a local state university and I think he signed me up for a graduate level course or something because I have a 7% average right now and I have zero idea whats going on. It's online and everything seems like it's in a different language, I'm really screwed in that class and it's gonna be a failure for the year unless I can find a way to drop it. I contacted him to see if it was the right level course and to see if he could do something but I'm really worried right now.",
