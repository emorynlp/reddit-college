  "title:": "8 Months Later: \"Just got into a huge argument with my parents over not wanting to go to MIT\"",
  "text": "Hi. I'm the dude who last application cycle posted [the giant rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fw9eb7/just_got_into_a_huge_argument_with_my_parents/) about doubting whether or not to commit to MIT. It somehow blew up so much that my friends ended up recognizing it was me based on the circumstances I detailed in the post. Definitely wasn't the brightest stage of my life.\n\nI got comments on that post from all POVs, ranging from \"Don't listen to your parents! Commit to USC!\" all the way to \"Stop being stupid. Go to MIT it's such an easy choice.\" I even got a DM from u/peteymit telling me he figured out who I was (I still don't know if it was from my username or my ancient chance-me posts).\n\nPetey helped reassure me that my acceptance wasn't a total fluke and that I did have the potential to succeed at a place like MIT. Him reaching out to me was actually one of the two biggest factors that lead to me finally deciding to commit there 3 weeks later. I stopped following this sub after my college apps were done, but now that I'm almost done with my first semester, I decided I wanted to share a few reflections I've had over this whole experience.\n\nFirst of all, I encourage everyone reading this to figure out what your ***true*** **personal goals** are. Not those set by your parents, not those influenced by your culture or your friends -- the objectives in life that will make you the happiest and most fulfilled. I lived through so much of my life blindly following the path my parents had laid out for me that I barely knew how to make this decision after shutting out input from them. In all areas of life (yes, not just college applications), I've been forced to analyze my actual motivations and figure out how to live for myself for the first time, and it's a skill that I wish I had learned earlier because it would've made so many of my life choices easier.\n\nSecond, I wanted to address [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), aka when someone \"doubts their skills, talents or accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a 'fraud.'\" This frame of mind was a huge reason why I was doubting my own capabilities so much before I committed. Before I learned that this psychological pattern actually had a name and was relatively common (even normal), I had always chalked it up to general anxiety. But Imposter Syndrome seriously is something that affects almost every single MIT freshman I've talked to since I've started classes. You'd think that most of us would be \"geniuses\" that were super-confident in our abilities, but most of us feel just as vulnerable as I did/do. If you feel like you exhibit some traits of Imposter Syndrome, I just want you to know that you're not alone. These feelings truly are natural, and when they arise you should try as hard as you can to recognize them and shut them out because **you belong right where you are**. Don't let those thoughts take over your psyche.\n\nNow as for if I feel like I made the right decision... I have to go with a ***very*** **hesitant yes**. Yes, the rumors about the difficulty of MIT classes appear to be mostly true. Yes, I did spend a few too many late nights completing problem sets and trying not to fail my next Physics quiz (again). Yes, trying to assimilate myself into MIT's intense and nerdy culture was often overwhelming, but I do feel like I'm already better for it after only a few short months of learning here (well, via Zoom). This place is damn tough, but it's the first time in years I've felt excited to learn in school, and I'm so grateful for having that feeling again.\n\nOne last thing I want to end with -- **don't let** ***fear*** **dictate your actions**. I still remember to this day what my sister said to me only two days before the commitment deadline: \"If you genuinely think USC will make you happier, go there. But if you're making this decision because you're afraid, I suggest you take the other leap of faith instead.\" I really was only minutes away from confirming my enrollment at USC. But I ended up realizing that the *main* motivation for almost making that decision was because I was scared and intimidated by the rigor of MIT. Instead of looking at the boatloads of opportunities and the culture that I'd almost definitely fit in better with, I chose to focus on the negatives and my fear of failure. I might regret my final decision in the coming years, but I know I would've regretted that decision more if I chose to act in panic instead of confidence.\n\nThanks again to Petey for dragging me into this wonderful, horrible school (IHTFP), and I'm already looking forward to the moment I can actually step on campus as an MIT student in the spring :)",

I also want to say that I understand that your parents want to look out for you and want what's best for you, but sometimes you always have to stand up to them as well. But being honest, a lot of Asian parents calm down a bit once you're in college. You're gonna do great things, as you would've regardless of where you went to school. Good luck!",

Maybe it\u2019s being a little older, laid off, or at a different stage of my career/life bringing these feelings forward. \n\nIn short, this post helped define some of my thoughts and hold backs. It also shows those feelings can occur throughout life. \n\nCongratulations on MIT and I wish you the best in your studies.",
