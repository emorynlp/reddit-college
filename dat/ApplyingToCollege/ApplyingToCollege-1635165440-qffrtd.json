No screaming, no crying, literally \u201cmeh.\u201d\n\nIf you want the backstory:\n\nI put months of effort into West Point and had to get a medical waiver for a past knee surgery (you \u201ckneed\u201d one even if you\u2019re fully recovered). While waiting, I was accepted to Duke and eventually decided (mentally, no deposits or formal decisions) on Duke before my waiver was granted and I was accepted to West Point. When I got the letter in the mail, I kinda just went \u201cmeh.\u201d \n\nSo yeah, your \u201cdream\u201d school may just become another passing thought in the future. Don\u2019t base your entire life on a specific school because college is a scam (including the fiefdom called Duke).",
