  "text": "Maybe I'm being cynical about this but that's the way I see it. The ends justify the means. If your \"end\" doesn't justify the hours each day spent researching, studying and tryharding, you wasted your teen years. Keep in mind that I hate that this is a part of life but idk what we can do about it.\n\nEdit: For those saying that \"developing a work ethic\" is worth all these years of stress, I think burnout is a major issue for those who tryharded during high school and got nothing in return.",

So while you might major in something that the college excels in, most other people might be majoring in a program which is easy to get in.

The fact that we are seeing it in high school students is a disturbing trend.\n\nI guess the only thing I can say is try to pace yourself. Try to find joy in what you do everyday, instead of ticking off boxes in hopes of getting into \"X\" prestigious program. If its not getting you out of bed in the morning, eventually it's going to get painful and cause you distress.\n\nCollege/University/Ivys/Professional schools will not solve burnout related problems. They can make them much worse. Yes, you get a quick bump from acceptance and orientation week. Once the stress of succeeding/keeping your spot kicks in, your academic high will dissappear. You will be left with the same issues you were left dealing with in HS. A big assignment to conquer, a GPA goal that you must reach, or a huge entrance/certification exam that you must crush. It just keeps getting harder and the stakes get raised the higher you go.\n\nSo take care of yourselves. Stop and smell the roses. You only get to be young once, before life's responsibilities hit you full blast.\n\nTake care and good luck!",

I found myself doubting my abilities and even my self-worth a lot until I learned how to manage my time and study. *You* are already ahead of the game.\n\nWhen you coast through high school (and you can do this with pretty good grades when you are smart), you don\u2019t learn the very necessary skills that facilitate success. College is a whole new ballgame with the expectation that you will be able to handle things independently. It\u2019s very self-paced. There simply isn\u2019t room to *just* coast and party without repercussions. \n\nBasically, in hindsight I\u2019m saying that if I could do it over again, I would have tried harder in high school instead of partying, even if it landed me in a less selective college. I regret not applying myself. My values changed as I got older and learned why hard work matters. \n\nYOUR hard work matters. \n\nI have college aged kids and they have shared that their peers all seem agree - the kids who really worked hard in high school had a *much* easier transition, and therefore more success, in college (no matter what college).\n\nGood luck to you!",

By this logic, college is just going to be miserable for you if you think it's just some means to an end that will solve all issues. Like you do realize that college is essentially high school on mega steroids? Are you just going to cower over and cry about how college was meaningless if you don't get the most prestigious job, which happens to 99.9% of people? Do you just plan on being an autonomous robot in college who does \"learning or activities\" jus to \"go to a better job?\" If so you're going to have a miserable time. Sounds to me like your fundamental issue is that you're either just too stuck up, or you're too focused on your professional life, both of which will just cause catastrophe down the line.",

Even 75%ile isn't generous enough, to be honest, I should be drawing from a higher %ile point\u2014based on the selection bias research, there will be no difference in directly post-graduate success.\n\nI mean personally I'd probably be a mediocre to above average student at a T20, but most certainly in the top 90th percentile at my state schoo judging from the caliber of student there, on average. For example of course.",

Maybe consider being half happy and do what you like for that 30 years and then you might be able to retire early from doing what you love too. Maybe that can give life a little bit more meaning.

      "text": "At the end of the day, isn\u2019t learning the point of an education? Having taken hard classes and studied your butt off, you come out of HS a much more intelligent, well-informed person. Knowledge doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum, and learning\u2019s main purpose shouldn\u2019t be \u201cto get into a more prestigious college\u201d. Coming out of a rigorous HS education, I know how to write clearly and effectively. I understand the science and history that is necessary to fully appreciate the world around me. Even if I don\u2019t get into a top college, I\u2019m still a hell of a lot less ignorant than the people who chose to slack. I think you\u2018re not seeing the forest for the trees here: we work hard in high school, so we can learn what we need to be successful in college. The whole point of education is to come out more capable on the other side, not to rub your credentials in other people\u2019s faces. Once you\u2019re ten years into your career, no one cares if you went to a T20 school or Podunk State University. It\u2019s the skills you develop that employers want, and that starts in high school.\n\nPlus, there are clear tangible benefits to working hard in high school. Thanks to the course load I took, at a state school I\u2019d be starting way ahead in the curriculum compared to my classmates. My sister who slacked off in math started her freshman year of college taking Precalc. With my AP credit, I\u2019ll be starting in Calc III. That\u2019s three semesters worth of work I won\u2019t have to do in college, credit hours I can instead put towards higher level classes or electives that I enjoy, or even towards graduating early.\n\nNot to mention, the financial value of a state school is hard to ignore. Going on a full ride merit schools for schools schools that can save absurd amounts of cash. I\u2019m currently making my college list, and running numbers on where I might get in. I\u2019m a junior, so I\u2019ve got some time to decide. On a sheer cost/benefit analysis, I might not even take a T20 offer if it were given to me, because the money doesn\u2019t work out. My family is fortunate enough that we don\u2019t qualify for much aid, so we\u2019d be looking at a 300k price tag for tuition and living costs over four years. Compare that to say, the University of Alabama. A National Merit Scholar going to U of A gets 4 years of housing, a 3.5k annual discretionary stipend, books, a study-abroad/research fund, and five years of free tuition. With their accelerated Master\u2019s programs, you could get out with an MS or an MBA without paying a penny. Unless you\u2019re going into a very specific field like investment banking that requires prestige, it\u2019s really hard to justify dropping that much cash on a brand-name degree. Good grades and high test scores can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars if you\u2019re willing to drop a bit of prestige.\n\nI kinda went on a rant here, lol, but a top university is far from the only \u201cend\u201d that the means justify. By both financial and intellectual metrics, you haven\u2019t \u201cwasted\nyour teen years\u201d if you don\u2019t get into one. The way we\u2019ve turned these schools into the be-all end-all of academia makes for a really unhealthy environment for teenagers, and it\u2019s in no way reflective of reality for adults.",

I feel bad for those people who equate their worth to their college's ranking, because I can tell they'll be very disappointed later down at life because they should realize that they still won't get everything handed to them automatically just because they got accepted to UCLA or Berkeley. \n\nI say this to you as much as I do to myself because I got accepted to UCR and UCM and everyone from my school who got accepted to all the other UCs I got rejected from (UCD, UCB, UCI, UCLA, etc) keep telling me how bad/boring those schools are.\n\nUCSC accepted you for a reason, because they see your potential that the other schools didn't care enough to look at.

For example, if someone were to really grind out high school, then they will most likely have better study strategies, higher work ethic, etc, which will help them land a job in the future. If someone were to say, start a business, then they would learn the administration of business, how to market, etc etc, which are all valuable skills that will help anyone in the work force. If that experience doesn't get you accepted then you still have something tangible to show for your efforts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnecdotally, if I were to be rejected from every school I applied to except for my safety (which I got auto-admitted into) then I would be satisfied.

I do know a lot of people who took less rigorous courses in high school and did less extracurriculars and have better study habits and work ethic because they didn\u2019t burn themselves out.

I guess it comes down to either knowing that you did everything to achieve your dreams and failing vs regretting not going for your dreams and not knowing what you could have achieved. Of course, there is a balance, though; I think working hard in school while scheduling time to enjoy the experience is the best option, if possible",

The community? Is it for self-validation? Is it for the resources? The fact of the matter is, each person has different goals, it is up to themselves to determine whether they wasted their time or not. \n\nI got rejected from my dream college. I worked my ass off and only took college level courses (10 a year), and worked hard outside of class in my clubs. There were days where I had mental breakdowns inside my car because I was so stressed from the amount of work I was doing. But I learned way more than what I would have ever imagined than had I stayed home and played videogames like I used to. Does the fact that I got rejected invalidate that I grew as a person?  It doesn't. Does it hurt that I got rejected? Yes, it really does. \n\nWe have to remember that we go to college to learn and become a better person than we were the day before. You may have worked hard because you wanted to go somewhere with prestige, but all that experience and knowledge doesn't disappear when you go to a normal college. Yes, it is going to suck that you may not have needed to work as hard if you wanted to go that specific university. Yes, it is going to suck that you are going to have to prove that you are smart, instead of having it be a given because you went to xyz school. Yes, it really hurts, but we all have goals that we need to keep working towards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only way one can consider the time they spent working hard in high school to be a waste is if they gave up on your goals after going to college.

If that's all you care about, then sure, all that hard work wasn't worth it, but if that's not the only thing you value from studying and hobbies, then it could be worth it. If you care about learning and have pursuits you are genuinely passionate about, then putting time into that is certainly worth it, no matter if you don't get a reward from it. We're at a point where from the time we were 13,12, even 11, we were told to work hard to get good grades and get into a good university so we could get a good job, and as a result of that, the value of school and extracurricular activities was lost on many of us. We pursue the things that will give us the best chance of achieving those material goals, even if we don't really care for those pursuits themselves. Then in the long term, all that extrinsic motivation starts to lose its pull on people, and they start to lose motivation and hate their job and feel hopeless and bored in life - they burn out. Not necessarily because they worked really hard, but because they didn't care about the things they did, they cared about what those things provided for them. \n\nThere is my rant, but what I really want to say is that the way of thought that all that matters from an endeavor is a tangential reward is harmful, and we need to place more value on intrinsic motivation.",

Working hard during high school and not getting into your dream school sucks, but you need to know that every college is looking for something different. Especially this year, admission has been a crapshoot. While you may believe your stats are spectacular, to the AOs you're just another applicant in a sea of overachieving students. \n\nThe good thing is, now you have an excellent resume and a strong work ethic. This is going to attract all sorts of internships and research opportunities to you. You're going to perform much more better than your peers. Also, I believe what you do in college is far more important than what you do in high school. Going by this thought, you can assume that the time you spent working hard in high school is a waste but let's be optimistic. \n\nMoreover, the quality of education is more or less the same at a T10 and T100. The difference is mostly on the basis of prestige and alumni network. However, it's not like you'll not get the latter at your state school. You'll just have to try harder to develop strong connections and bag enough opportunities and thanks to your strong work ethic you have that in your hands!\n\nAnyways, good luck on your admissions and I hope everything works out for you!",

So while you might major in something that the university excels in, most other people might be majoring in a program which is easy to get in. A degree in engineering from a top arts school will not shine as bright as a degree from one of the top engineering school and vice versa.",

I actually got an excess in aid so i have thousands that will just go into my bank account for me to use for whatever i want, which is pretty cool! I\u2019m going to graduate debt free. Essentially getting paid to be a student! Your hard work is never in vain; keep your head up",
