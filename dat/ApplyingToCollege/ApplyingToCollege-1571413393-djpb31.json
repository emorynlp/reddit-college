  "title:": "Stuck on your essay? Here's a psychological trick",
  "text": "Early Decision deadlines are coming up and I've started to see people talking about being stuck on their essays.  In the next two weeks this will reach epidemic proportions.\n\nI get it. This is important and you want it to be perfect.  Some of you haven't even started, or have a hundred false starts and they all seem to suck.  You stare at the blank page and nothing seems like it is going to work.  You've done your homework and read a lot about the things that you shouldn't say in your essay and every time you write something it seems like a cliche, or pretentious, or unappealing.  Your parents and teachers are nagging but you just can't find the words.\n\nOne trick that I have seen working is to set out to deliberately write the world's worst essay.  Go ahead!  Swear, use jargon, brag, be stupid, be silly, be trite, be a stereotype, be pretentious, be obnoxious, be mean, be petty.  Just sit down and get it all out of your system.  \n\nOnce you start keep on writing until you run out of momentum.  Then put that aside and do something physical for 20 minutes to an hour.  Dance, go for a walk, rake the leaves, clean your room, do yoga, whatever.  Just do something that gets your blood moving and doesn't need your brain.  Once that's done, pick your joke essay back up and read it out loud.  Do funny voices if they fit.  \n\nYou could find that once you've gotten the bad writing out of your system, the good writing is hiding right behind it.  Or you could find a phrase or sentence in the terrible essay that sparks a thought and leads to a really great essay.\n\nFor extra bonus points, when your parents nag you about your essay progress give them the terrible essay and pretend you think that it's good.",

          "text": "It's okay for a first draft to be terrible. In fact, it's helpful to write a first draft secure in the knowledge that no one ever has to read it if you don't want them to. \n\nIf you're having trouble coming up with ideas, here's a list of questions I came up with to help my students brainstorm essay material. I recommend reading each prompt and jotting down whatever comes to mind, then choosing one or two ideas to develop for 15 minutes or so. It's especially helpful to work on these questions by hand. \n\nThe whole exercise can take anywhere from 1-30+ min per prompt and result in some excellent ideas to use in your short and long application responses. I've designed these questions to be helpful to personal development and self-awareness, too, so writing about them can have a cathartic, journal-like feel that eases some of the stress and anxiety of applications. \n\nWhen do you feel happiest? Why do you think that is? \n\nWhat are the biggest obstacles in your path to your ideal future? \n\nHow would your closest friend describe you? \n\nHow do you deal with frustration? (*It's often helpful to keep in mind that frustration is just thinking something different should be happening.) \n\nWhich intellectual areas can you benefit from developing? \n\nDescribe a strong childhood memory. Why do you think it's so vivid? \n\nHow do you respond to change? \n\nWhat's one specific way you've grown as a person in the past year? \n\nWhat do you bring to your community? \n\nWhat physical place has importance to you? Why? \n\nWhat is your favorite (kind of) game? What specifically do you appreciate? \n\nWhat person close to you has had a significant, positive impact on who you are today. Why? \n\nWhat is one of your best qualities? How do you use and/or develop it? \n\nWho is someone that you have helped or would like to help someday? How did/would you assist them? \n\nWhat item in your room catches your eye? What meaning does it hold for you? \n\nWhat's a topic you could talk about for hours? It could be political, nerdy, personal, etc. Why do you think you could talk so easily at length about it? \n\nWhen you think of the word \"punchable,\" what or who comes to mind? Why do you think that is? \n\nWhat\u2019s something that\u2019s true that very few people agree with you on? \n\nWhat\u2019s something that makes you feel proud? \n\nWhat are you afraid of? Is your fear blocking you from doing what you want? What do you think your fear(s) could be trying to signal you to learn?\n\nWhen you get ready to write a full draft, keep these tips in mind: \n\nDo: \n- get to the point without being flowery \n- write something you'd be interested in reading \n- stay focused and relate everything you say to your thesis \n- include precise, related references/examples & analyze each carefully \n- use active voice and proper punctuation \n- be as clear and concise as possible \n- match your formality level to the nature of your writing \n- draw the reader into your world and way of seeing things \n- ask many peers / available adults to be your readers/editors \n\nDon't: \n- use jargon without clearly explaining it \n- generalize or forget to include specific examples \n- just list your extracurriculars or other information available elsewhere in your application \n- use passive voice or inconsistent tenses \n- include unnecessary / pretentious / unrelated references \n\nGood luck, y'all ~ dm me your responses or questions if you want :)",
