  "text": "Hey Guys!\nSo pretty much, I want to start a research project in math where my goal is to get published, as I want to contribute to the mathematics community especially where I live . I have the names of professors, universities, a well-made cv, the whole 9 yards. My only problem is that I still don\u2019t have a specific research question. \n\nHow exactly can I go about finding exactly what I want to form a research on? Thank you",
