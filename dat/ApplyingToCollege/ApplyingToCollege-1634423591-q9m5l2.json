  "text": "Over the last year I\u2019ve worked with a post doc researcher on a pretty cool project. The thing is the project is the focus of my common app. I frame it in more of a way that draws more connections to who I am, how I think, and what I like to do / want to continue doing, and don\u2019t spend much time on the details of the project itself. Could a letter from this person help? Or would admissions officers potentially penalize me for sending in an extra letter that\u2019s not on a totally new subject?",

      "text": "It\u2019s definitely fine to use them as a recommender, but if I were an AO and the main focus of your application was already this project, I\u2019d prefer to hear about another side of you. However, if you feel like their letter will provide some personal aspects or something new and won\u2019t regurgitate what you\u2019ve already stated in your application, then by all means ask them.",
