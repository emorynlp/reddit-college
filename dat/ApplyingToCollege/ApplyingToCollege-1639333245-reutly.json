You don't just want to impress the AO, you want to get them to like you and get them to advocate for a spot for you. Simply listing extracurriculars isn't going to do that.\n\nIf you get an interview, take it. They don't have much of an effect but it's a great opportunity to learn about WashU and they can help you confirm whether you should ED2 or RD (deadline to switch is 1/15)\n\nOther than that try and show some interest in WashU. They don't officially track demonstrated interest anymore, but who knows! Either way, it's a great opportunity to connect with the school",
