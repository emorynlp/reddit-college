  "text": "Hey guys, Rick here. I am the head college consultant of The Edge College & Career Network and the Key Worldwide Foundation, and I need some advice. \n\nSo I run a business meant to help students \"side-door\" their college applications \u2014\u00a0the \"front door,\" which involves actual talent and skill, is too hard for many of my students. The \"back door\" (buying a building) is also far too expensive. \n\nThe problem is that the FBI is now **(!)** ***investigating me*** **(!)** because I allegedly \"organized a scheme to fraudulently inflate entrance exam test scores and bribe college officials.\" Some of my clients are especially worried that their public images will also be damaged as a result of this supposed \"scandal.\" WTF do I do?\n\nMaybe the FBI is jealous that my students have higher acceptance rates than their kids?\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: I helped rich parents cheat their kids into top schools and am now potentially facing the american justice system",
