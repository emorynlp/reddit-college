If I get accepted into the following schools:\n- University of Toronto\n- Western (Ivey)\n- NYU (Stern)\n- McGill (Desautels)\n\nWhich should I pick? I know Stern is way above the others, but is it really worth going to Stern if the Canadian unis are 5x cheaper?",

If you were American, going to a top Canadian school wouldn't hurt because companies in the US won't have to sponsor you. If you are not American, but want to work in the US, you will have a much easier time finding opportunities if you study in the US (especially in NYC).",

I know that Stern is my ideal school as it\u2019s a feeder for Wall Street (I want a few years in IB \ud83d\ude13), but yeah it\u2019s going to be really expensive and competitive, especially for an intl student.\n\nI\u2019m fine with working in Canada & seemingly have higher chances of ending up there. It\u2019s decent, and the only thing that\u2019s making me hesitate is my overachiever side oops",

      "text": "Stern >>> Ivey > Desautels ~ Rottman \n\nif you want to do American IB. Also why is Queens not on your list if you're interested in Canadian targets?\n\nAlso, idk who told you that Stern would be 5x cheaper. \n\n[Here's tuition for Ivey](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/hba/admissions/tuition-finances/tuition-fees/). Ivey is $36k, $34k, $51k, and $50k for 4 years. CAD:USD is 0.8 rn so that's $28k, $27k, $41k, $40k for 4 years. \n\n[Stern is more expensive](https://www.nyu.edu/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/applying-and-planning-for-undergraduate-aid/tuition-and-other-costs/cost-of-attendance.html#stern). At $58k (they don't run on the weird ass system Ivey has), it's going to be more expensive regardless and you have to think about total CoA due to other factors like room and board and such but 5x more expensive it is not. \n\nAnd the simple answer is if you're okay working in Canada and doing Canadian IB, then Canada is fine. But Stern will offer you more opportunities for NYC IB. People will say that it's possible to go to Ivey and still end up in IB in NYC but the vast majority stay in Canada and it's certainly going to be harder than if you came from Stern.",
