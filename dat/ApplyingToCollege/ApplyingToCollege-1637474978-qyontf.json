  "text": "Hey all! I was wondering what I should be doing to prepare for research in the future as a high school student. For example, should I do research programs or camps that expose me to working in a lab or assisting professors? Or should I contact potential professors and mentors to assist them in their work? \n\nIf anyone has any resources for programs or preparation that would be great! Thanks in advance :)\n\nNote: I\u2019m not looking to write a research paper and get it published since I know that is usually only done in college.",

If you email enough professors, one will probably be able to give you an opportunity, either with them or through their graduate students. Make sure to compose a nice cover letter and resume, best of luck!",
