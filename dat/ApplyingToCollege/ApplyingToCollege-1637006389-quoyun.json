      "text": "What about Haverford? Beautiful area, easy access for you to get from the airport to campus via the Main Line (train). Small, with good political science and it is in the tri-co with nearby Bryn Mawr and Swarthmore if you wanted more class options.  It is highly selective so I guess it is a reach, but if you fit I'd say more target.",
