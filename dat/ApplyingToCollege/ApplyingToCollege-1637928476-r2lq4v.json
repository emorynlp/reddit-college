      "text": "I try breaking my stuff in pieces. I try to do 2-3 outlines every night (and by outlines I mean literally just bullet points answering the question posed by the essay without regard for style or coherence), just so that I know what I want to say for that essay. Then after the outlines/bullet points, I try to make a very bad essay out of it. It won't be any better than the bullet points, but at least it'll be in paragraph form and I have a good idea of how to structure my essay. I'll do one or two of these a night. Then comes the actual essay writing, where I clean up the rest of the essay and try to have a submittable draft by the night. I can only really do one of these a night, unless it's like super short. This process has helped me a whole lot!",
