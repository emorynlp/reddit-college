I\u2019m ok with that because I worry that they\u2019re not going to see it as a PDF file but as some sort of streaming text on their monitor and if I leave no spaces, it could come up looking like one giant paragraph.\n\nI tried getting rid of the extra line in between paragraphs and using tabs instead but it doesn\u2019t take tabs. So I just kept my extra line. \n\nIn any case, I imagine most of the essays they get will be formatted like mine so I\u2019ll be fine.",
