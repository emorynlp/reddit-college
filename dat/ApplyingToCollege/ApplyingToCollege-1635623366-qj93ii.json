(Aka no A+ - 90% and up is considered an A.\n2. \"Final\" Grades (As in when it says S1 grade, S2 grade, and Final Grade) if my school doesn't have final grades, just semester grades.\n3. The class was only taken for one semester (as it has required sections for both semesters?) \n\n\\- Sincerely, struggling student with unhelpful counselor.",
