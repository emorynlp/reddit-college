The thing she put is is related to one of my school clubs and I even put it down in the activities section. I even wrote a supplement discussing about the things I did in the club and what impact it made to me and that I would continue this in college/future. Obviously, it is not the only thing she wrote about me but just linked it with me taking initiative and talked about my activism etc.\n\nDon't make me cry please.",
