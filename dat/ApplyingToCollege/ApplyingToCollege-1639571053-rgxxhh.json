There are indeed  A LOT of students here applying to Cornell, but no more than 30. As well, for those who applied to Cornell, only 1/4 to 1/5 of them are competitive enough ( I mean with a strong profile, top-ranked, TOEFL 110+, ACT34+/SAT1500+...), nearly 1/2 to 1/3 of them are not that compelling (intermediate in RDFZ, TOEFL 110+, test-optional, not heavily awarded), and a small amount of them are simply applying for fun... when selecting RDFZ students, ao is tired of high scores and gold medals, so this year they choose a student not that strong in standardized tests and awards (somehow a distinct person in RDFZ?). worthy to mention, this student is applying to major in computer science..",
