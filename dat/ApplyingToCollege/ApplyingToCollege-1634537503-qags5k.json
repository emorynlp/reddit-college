  "text": "I can\u2019t decide where I have the best chance with my early application. I really like brown, Harvard, and Yale. My mom went to Harvard and dad went to Yale and my grandfather taught at Yale decades ago so I have legacy there but brown has a higher acceptance rate. I want to apply early to Yale but the acceptance rate is still only 10% and I feel like I\u2019ll never get in. Do you think I have a shot? This year everything looks so impossibly competitive it\u2019s so scary.",

              "text": "Not for legacies. The legacy acceptance rate atboth Harvard and Yale is way higher than the regular acceptance rate at Brown. Also, if you ED to Harvard or Yale, you have a really high chance of getting in (Legacy + ED is like the biggest advantage you can get).\n\nEDIT: Harvard and Yale have SCEA instead of ED. Tbh, I wouldn't recommend it b/c it doesn't increase your chances.",
