  "text": "I've been offered an audition to a place I really want to get into, I sent in my application and they've thankfully offered me an audition off of that, but in the application form for accepting the audition space, they've asked, 'Why do you want to study Musical Theatre?'\n\nI feel like I've really already covered the heck out of that in my initial Personal Statement and I've been putting off the answer because I don't want to turn in the most cliche, boring answer and I don't want to just repeat what I have already said. I just don't know how to do it in a unique, appealing way.\n\nAnybody who knows stuff about applying have any sage wisdom to share with me?",

      "text": "I totally get this feeling. I\u2019m an intended film major and had to make sure none of my supplements were identical to my PS that was about film. My advice is to think of a specific element of MT that you can then flesh out further. Maybe think of the first show that you really loved? For me, I fell in love with Falsettos in 7th grade and wanted to be an actress for years afterwards. That\u2019s just one idea but you can also talk about the sense of community you get from theatre if that\u2019s true for you the way it is for me!",

Definitely a true thing for me too though it slipped my mind, considering how isolated everything obviously is nowadays. Made me focus on my experiences in a more isolated way too.\n\nGeez, haven't been in a show with a full-blown cast in years and oh boy, do I miss it.\n\nSorta drafting it and now I'm just worried I'm going too authentic/informal.",
