  "text": "With so many qualified applicants getting rejected left and right, I\u2019ve been thinking the college admissions process over and have come to the conclusion there are no real group of admissions. There are so many qualified applicants in the majority of T20 ED/REA pools that colleges could pull 3 equally good classes. So I questioned myself how do colleges filter their applicants to make up their class? One of my theory\u2019s is that after filtering out the YOLO applicants with low GPAs, low test scores, etc., they let the computer do the MEGA filtering. Leaving the only the qualified students left, the computer randomizes the process, making the portal do it\u2019s dirty work. Every 10th person that clicks on their update will be accepted and the rest rejected or deferred. So while you may think your decision was made days to weeks prior, every second you were staring at the view update page was actually just a slot machine that determined your next 4 years of life.",
