  "text": "I\u2019m not exactly sure why, but I\u2019m feeling pretty bad about my applications and doubting *everything*, from my grades to SATS to my recommendations to my essays. Everyone I know tells me I\u2019ll get into the colleges I apply to, but I\u2019m not confident. At all. I kind of feel like throwing in the towel before I even submit my applications, to be honest. Does anyone have any advice or thoughts?",

Even if you strike out on all your reaches and targets, you have a safety you'd actually be okay attending.  The \"worst case\" isn't bad at all.",
