      "text": "If you are going to pay that money to send it in, find an online visual arts class and add it to your application as planned. You can try to find something different but here\u2019s a way to fulfill that requirement: take a UC approved online class (2 semesters) at your own pace through BYU.  https://hs-articulation.ucop.edu/agcourselist/institution/4241\n\nI am not sure but you can also maybe do one through a community college in California or near you. Or you can go through this list of online classes and search visual and performing arts classes. https://hs-articulation.ucop.edu/agcourselist/results;searchType=1;query=Visual%20and%20performing%20arts\n\nIf you are going to pay to apply it\u2019s best to make sure you don\u2019t get auto rejected for missing courses. The UCs are going to be reducing international admission this year and missing a requirement is a way to get cut - or beat out other international applicants missing that. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry so much about AP or IB because they\u2019ll have an international admissions specialist familiar with education in your country evaluate your grades. \n\nBut you did see the ridiculously high international tuition and know they don\u2019t offer financial aid or scholarships right? If you are rich, what the heck, apply. If money is an issue, maybe look into more cost effective options for undergrad. It\u2019s easier to get financial help attending a UC as a grad student.",
