  "text": "The title means exactly what it says lol\n\n**(disclaimer: ik my punctuations and grammar aren\u2019t a1, so plz ignore that x)**\n\nI\u2019m an international student looking for good engineering school options. I have a 3.5 unweighted GPA & 1110 SAT score and though ik that they aren\u2019t the worst, in my head no school will accept me.\n\nEvery time I google engineering schools in the US, I get the same ivy and T-10 schools. While I am happy for all of you who strive and (supposedly) achieve these goals, that\u2019s not me.\n \nSo, does anybody have any other recommendations? Any state school that I may be unaware of? \n\nThank you in advance",

UIUC\u2019s engineering is competitive. UIUC\u2019s engineering acceptance rate is 37% (keep in mind that each distinct engineering major in UIUC also has its own competitiveness - for example, UIUC computer science is more competitive than the other engineering major UIUC offers).",
