      "text": "Not that is consistent.\n\nThere can certainly be differences between schools - some engineering programs have better research funding, or have more industry ties to help with co-op and internships, or have faculty that emphasize undergrad instruction.  They can be stronger in some fields than others of course too - especially in fields like aerospace, petroleum, mining, maritime, etc. where the jobs are concentrated in smaller areas or across fewer companies.\n\nBut none of that is really a public/private split - lots of public schools show up near the top of pretty much any engineering program ranking.  I think Missouri S&T is a really solid engineering school, and in a lot of engineering fields the difference in starting pay between the best schools and the good schools is maybe 10% more - not really enough to justify paying a much higher tuition for.",
