  "text": "\"NO!\" Stop mulling over the fact that you missed EA deadlines. It does NOT boost chances. You have an equal chance of getting in RD than EA. But if you're talking about ED/REA then it's different.\nDon't think that you absolutely need to apply EA( do your research on it though, because some unis have a priority deadline for maximum scholarship consideration, which is usually Nov15)",

      "text": "Sorry but this isn't true. EA *does* boost chances because it's a sign of demonstrated interest and shows a higher level of responsibility and commitment on behalf of the student for getting their shit together sooner. \n\nIt's also extremely important for scholarship offers.\n\nNot saying it makes a massive difference in terms of your acceptance chances. You can still get in regular, but if you're serious about a school you should try to apply early whenever possible.",
