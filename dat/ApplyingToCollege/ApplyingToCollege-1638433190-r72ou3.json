      "text": "1. ECs that aren't necessarily related to your intended major can be great extracurriculars, since Admission Officers (AOs) can see another part/dimension of you that isn't necessarily academic focused. I'm a STEM major and I also included my digital art as an EC!\n2. Learning languages is considered an extracurricular yes!\n3. Internships and work experience are important yes but not *necessarily* better than other types of ECs, unless it's like an internship in a top-tier company or whatever\n4. Absolutely, those are great ECs, especially if you have the numbers to back them up!\n5. Unfortunately, I don't know the answer to this - but I think you should be able to include this as an EC\n\nYou don't need to show proof (AOs rarely ever check) but just be truthful, and you'll be fine.",

      "text": "Please know that only the US heavily weighs extracurriculars. If you're applying to say, Australia, UK, or Canada, extracurriculars won't be considered most of the time, even for their top colleges, with the possible exception of scholarships.\n\n1. Yes. Extracurriculars outside your intended field of study show that you are a well-rounded applicant.\n\n 2. Yes\n\n 3. They're not necessary, but they help an application\n\n 4. Yes\n\n 5 . I'm not sure but I believe so?",

      "text": "1) Depends on how important and hood you are at it but it will be considered. Colleges just like to see extracurriculars that are similar to your major, but ones that aren\u2019t won\u2019t hurt you.\n2) Depends on this school I think, it might not be necessarily an extracurricular but you can put it in the personal information sections of applications probably\n3) Yes, very much\n4) Yes \n5) Not sure, maybe not if it\u2019s just personal trading but if you started a club or organization then it would be I think.\n\nNot really sure what proof you would need for your resume because I don\u2019t know what you did, but you can link any media you created and send a link to your blogs",
