  "text": "Just out of curiosity cause tbh I am not very interested in them either. Despite knowing that they are great schools and a great deal (you go to college for free and then get professional experience guaranteed), I still am just not interested in them and neither are any of my peers at school lol. Wondering why this is and if you are/aren't interested in these schools, can you say why?",

      "text": "Because you lose your ENTIRE college experience. You're also fucked on internships because you literally spend your summers at training camps for cadets. It also makes no sense for free college because you can go to a normal elite uni, attend their ROTC program, still commission in the military, and get the ROTC scholarship to pay all of your tuition as well.\n\nAlso, as someone in the military, military professional experience is big, but not so big I would recommend someone join the military purely for professional development unless they knew how directly applicable it would be. Like say, you're shooting for a competitive fire dept and need the veteran tag to make it through recruitment. Even then, Reserve/Guard service is good enough. Civilian employers hardly care as long as you're a vet, even if active-duty works much more(though 99% of active duty is bullshit work).",

You have to want that near-certain chance for pilot selection at USAFA, for example.\n\nIf you're gunning for the prestige of Stanford or MIT or whatever, you'd go ROTC to get your tuition paid (there are often crosstown agreements for schools with no unit -- Stanford kids go to Berkeley NROTC).",
