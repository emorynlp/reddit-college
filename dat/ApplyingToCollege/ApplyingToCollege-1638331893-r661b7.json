  "text": ">How much does u/Economy-Schedule-691 expect to receive from the following sources to pay for educational expenses for the 2022-23 academic year? Their parents?\n\nUnder the Student Resources section which is under the Student Income section of the CSS Profile, it asks how much I expect to receive from parents for the 2022-23 academic year. I'm an Asian from an upper middle class family and I know my family will fund my education as much as possible. I don't know what to put here, though, because too low and I won't get accepted because they don't think I'll pay, and too high and I won't get financial aid. How should I figure out a good number?",
