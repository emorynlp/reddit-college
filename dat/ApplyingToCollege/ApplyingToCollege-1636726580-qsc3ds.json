  "title:": "Carnegie Mellon Application Financial Aid International Students",
  "text": "I have been through the CMU website for undergrad, and they clearly state that they don't give aid or scholarships to international students.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut then they say this in the common app\n\n Carnegie  Mellon isn\u2019t able to provide any need- or merit-based financial assistance to international students. Financial need is considered when making admission decisions for international candidates.  \n\n\nIf you\u2019re an international student (not a U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent  resident) and need financial assistance in order to attend, it may  affect your admission decision. Would you require financial assistance  in order to attend? \n\nIf you answer yes to that question\n\nIf Carnegie Mellon is not able offer you financial assistance, how would you intend to finance your Carnegie Mellon education?\\* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am so confused rn, and any clarification on whether aid or scholarships are a possibility would be greatly appreciated.",

Then ask if you need aid (bc theyre need-aware) and what you'll do if you get in to pay (since they won't give you aid)",
