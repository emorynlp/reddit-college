  "text": "So I\u2019m entering grades on the academics part of the CSU application and when I go to add my summer school grades it says this: \n\nIMPORTANT-If you took a summer class between 9th grade and\n10th grade, the summer grade level should be set to 10th grade.\n\nDoes this mean the summer classes I took between 10th and 11th grade are on 11th grade summer and so on? This has me very confused.",
