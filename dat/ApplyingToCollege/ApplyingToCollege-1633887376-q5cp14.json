  "title:": "Should I do Harvard REA?",
  "text": "I've been struggling with finishing/polishing all the essays and supplementals that Harvard asks for in their REA program. I'm sure I can get it done if I grind through it for the next 20 days, but it will take a lot of effort and require a lot of sacrifice. Is this effort worth it? Or should I just wait for the regular application process to give me more time to work on my application.\n\nMy main question is if there is a significant boost (or any boost at all) in your chances of getting in at Harvard through REA.",

I know you said Harvard says that there's no boost on the website. But if you were Harvard, wouldn't you want to say that so you wouldn't deter people from applying RD--increasing the total applicant pool and keeping acceptance rates down? Almost like a reverse marketing strategy. Idk if that's right, just my thoughts",
