  "text": "So basically I didn\u2019t really know what ap classes were like and signed up for 6 in junior year (lol). \n\nafter half a year i have 3 as and 3 bs which is good enough for me cause all the classes are hard as shit.\n\nsince i got straight as freshamn and sophomore year it averages out to a really good gpa\n\nanyways the actual question is whether colleges will see my gpa as worse than someone who has an upward or consistent trend\n\nthanks for reading",
