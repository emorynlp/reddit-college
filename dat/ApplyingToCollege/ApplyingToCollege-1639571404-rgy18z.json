  "title:": "NO! Deferrals aren\u2019t worse than rejections.",
  "text": "Okay so now that many people are receiving their early decisions, a lot of bright applicants are being deferred and yes, having to write a LOCI sucks, having to even see the mascot of a university that heartlessly postponed an outcome on your application sucks, BUT try to look on the positive side. If you were deferred from a university that rejects quite a lot (like Columbia, Cornell and not Princeton), you should be assured of the fact that a group of professional AOs read every component of your application and deemed you to be in the top 20-35% of the ED applicants pool (depending on the university). You legit don\u2019t get a more accurate, realistic \u201cchanceme\u201d than that. People I know who were deferred early at some of these universities ended up getting HYPSM + those unis in RD. So just know that a deferral stings to you so much in the first place because you were very close to being admitted (which is a good thing)",
