This is due to classes being extremely hard (lots of work, maybe busy work, idk), a culture that emphasizes academic success over having a personal balance which leads to those struggling academically to put themselves under even more pressure, and a funky male to female ratio prolly messing up the psyches of the guys even moreso than being engineering students does. Also the fact that almost everyone is studying engineering which is known to be hard on the conscience regardless of your school.\n\nI\u2019m also told there\u2019s not many mental health resources, although the school insists that will no longer be true in the near future. \n\nAlso apparently altitude is correlated with how suicidal you are, and the school is at 6,000 feet (which isn\u2019t extremely high, but most people live near sea level so it can be a bit of a difference)",

From what I\u2019ve read, I\u2019m sure the school is more intense than mine, but intense is the environment I thrive in, and time management + prioritization + efficient Studying all all skills I\u2019m pretty decent at, so by my judgement I\u2019d do better at a school like mines where you don\u2019t have to be perfect to get in but have to suffer to get out than a school like Harvard where you have to suffer to get in but can relax through.\n\nRegular intensity courses/schools seem good for me on the surface cuz school-life balance and whatnot, but ime being given any significant leeway leads me into the procrastination loop. \n\nAll this to say, you\u2019re not wrong but I\u2019ve done my research.",

                      "text": "Getting into UIUC CS is EXTREMELY COMPETITVE. I don't mean that lightly ever. \n\nEven the 15 percent acceptance rate is EXTREMELY deceiving.\n\nYou have to understand most applicants are very very very well qualified to even get into MIT. \n\nFor instance, a friend of mine took 15 AP classes which he got All 5s. This includes difficult ones like AP Physics C mechanics and EM, AP CompSci A, AP Calc BC, AP chemistry, AP English etc\n\nHe had a perfect GPA and was ranked 1st out of 280 students in his graudating class. Plus, he scored perfect 36 on the ACT. \n\nHe is also very very math smart that he was qualified for USAMO (near perfect score on AMC 12 and very good score on AIME). Disqualified for IMO however. But even getting into USAMO is super super competitive (less than 1000 people in the entire nation can qualify for USAMO). He took AP Calc BC in middle school and while in high school these are the courses that he took at UIUC (THE SCHOOL HE WAS APPLYING TO): Abstract Linear Algebra, Honors Real Anlysis 1 & 2 + Honors Abstract Algebra 1 & 2 + Differential Geometry + Graduate level topology (yes, you read that right. A graduate fuxking level topology that math grad students take). Not only that he took Honors algorithm at UIUC while in high school and even wrote an undergrad level thesis on randomized algorithm while in HS!!\n\nOn top of that, he worked as a programming intern (Paid) in his senior year.\n\nHowever, he did not get in.\n\nThe thing is most UIUC CS applicants have already qualified for IMO or USAMO. And have already taken graduate level cs or math courses while in HS. So UIUC CS is almost on par with MIT CS in terms of quality of applicants. \n\nMost UIUC CS freshmans do not even take upper level math courses since they have already taken them in high school.\n\nIt's honestly insane how competitive it has gotten to get into UIUC cs.",

Don\u2019t let this discourage us too much though, the rest of the dorm options are GORGEOUS and some frosh dorms are singles so that\u2019s a plus for me.
