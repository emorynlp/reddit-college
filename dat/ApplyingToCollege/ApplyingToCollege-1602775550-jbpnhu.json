  "text": "Seen a post where somebody submitted their application and the title said \u201cnot an ivy, but...\u201d and it was university of Florida ...!! Like that\u2019s a Top public and well within the top 50 schools in the country. (Btw this is not attacking him/her it was just the most recent example I\u2019ve seen)\n\nAdding the \u201cnot the best\u201d type stuff just feeds into the toxic mindset that people have to go to ivies or T20\u2019s. Imagine someone joining the sub and the first thing they see is a \u201cnot the best school but...\u201d type of post for their dream/top school... yeah",

Beyond the first job or two, your school is much less relevant than the skills you have to offer on the job, and a better department is going to teach you better skills.",

If your mom works at Tesla she should know that the co-founder of Tesla is a UIUC alumnus! Netscape, Oracle, PayPal, YouTube, Yelp, Mozilla, and AMD are also notable companies which where either founded or co-founded by UIUC engineering alumni.\n\nI can promise you that UIUC engineering grads (in particular ECE and CS) have very little trouble ever getting jobs. The network is there and the school's right to be a top engineering program shows in its alumni. The college also gets more money than any other public engineering program in the country (maybe less than Michigan, but that's the only one who'd I'd bet gets more). Most new buildings and projects are sponsored by top companies these days (TI, Microsoft, QCOM, Intel, Samsung, etc.).\n\nI can personally vouch that my friend at Cornell who is in the same major as me is learning stuff that UIUC engineering won't bother teach because it's \"too basic\" and doesn't need to be taught in a class. Granted, though, he has a great network and his non-engineering classes are taught by way more notable teachers than mine. He is definitely taking way better liberal arts classes than I am and if he wants to switch into a business major or something more liberal arts oriented, he doesn't have to worry about losing prestige. If I switched into the college of liberal arts and science I would be losing a lot of prestige and switching into a less ranked program for sure. \n\nLike don't get me wrong, I guess it is fair to say that schools like Cornell and Princeton are \"better\" than state schools because they are in a lot of ways. More money, on average probably better faculty, better overall alumni network (there's probably more I just can't think of them). However I've found when looking at state schools it's smarter to look at colleges and majors rather than the overall school. It reveals a lot more. UIUC engineering blows every Ivy engineering program out of the water.\n\nHope this clears things up!",

If you're in California, which like half this subreddit is, there's always the community college system and transfer admissions guarantees if you didn't tryhard in HS (one of my brother's friends in college barely graduated from Lynbrook --as in like, straight Ds and Cs-- and got into Berkeley through the community college system) and even then most of the UCLA and Berkeley CS grads I know work in the same office as Sacramento State or SJSU grads...or bootcamp graduates. UIUC engineering grads work in the same room as SDSU grads, etc.\n\nMost of this sub is interested in engineering and your alma mater doesn't make a huge difference when hiring for BS degree-level jobs.\n\nThis isn't a dig at people on this subreddit telling them to stop trying -- obviously strive for the best-- but it's not a massive deal to not get into Berkeley or Stanford or Harvard or Yale or wherever because there's all kinds of opportunities to get to the top (and I'll be honest when I say I didn't know about many of said opportunities when I was in HS). I read a post a couple months back when ED decisions rolled out for last cycle and this one girl claimed she ran red lights on her way to school because of how upset she was to get rejected by a T20 ED...like, it's okay.

I see where you\u2019re coming from, and I agree that UF takes less effort to submit than other schools where you do need a supplemental. However, the way the post was titled with a specification of the word \u201civy\u201d made it seem as if that was the clinch factor for you. Ivies don\u2019t really require that many supplements from what I can remember, whereas many other schools that are deemed less prestigious have way more (and longer!) supplements. There is nothing wrong with recognizing prestige of course, but I have a suspicion that if your concern really was with the \u201cno supplements\u201d it would have been titled as such. I promise I\u2019m not trying to attack you, just trying to help out. Let me know if you have any questions and I hope you feel a little less lost now. Congrats on submitting your first app :D",

I was gonna say it but didn't want to stir the pot. \n\nI guess being older and having gone through college and grad school makes me see the world through another lens, but holy s\\*, how can you submit an application to a T30 and treat it like it was the worst community college in the entire galaxy? \n\nY'all quickly realize that, so long as the quality of the Institution you end up in is reputable, and by \"reputable\" I mean anything within the top 1% Unis in the world, you'll gonna be f i n e. And if your goal is being in Academia, you'll soon come to terms with the reality, which is: there's NOT a 1:1 correlation between a top of the toppity toppest uni and the grad admissions. Plus, you'll have to compete with people from foreign countries which hold reputable titles also (hello, autobiographic note here). What you may want to work on is *knowledge&skills*, because an unsuccessful application at 17 is not the end of the world, but a lack of kn&skills after college... is a goddamn problem. \n\nAnd, as far as a future potential job is concerned, the name of the uni or the grades are possibly even less important. That said, it's obvious that we all tend to have great admiration for a, say, Yale graduate, but I assure you NOBODY's gonna look down on you just because your resum\u00e9 says: \"Rice\", \"Emory\", \"Ohio State\", or \"Any Reputable Institution In The Country Frowned Upon Just Because It Ain't An Ivy\". \n\nJust beware of obvious diploma mills or tiny colleges nobody's ever heard of (they're more likely to have less resources spent on education, teaching, buildings, facilities, bursaries, aids, services).",

I\u2019m old and not the best at detecting rhetoric or sarcasm haha \ud83d\ude48.\n\nAnd to your point, honestly I bet we\u2019d be surprised at the number of people who stay in-state simply because they prefer to stay close to home near the comfort of family, friends or boyfriends/girlfriends, because they want to continue to live in a (warmer) climate, or just because want to save money for future schooling or other costs down the line, even if they could attend an Ivy! Also a lot of technical and niche career fields and majors just don\u2019t really exist or aren\u2019t that well established in Ivys/private schools as much as they are in public schools (especially land grants). \n\nLike this girl for instance studying Animal Science: https://thechoice.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/21/the-envelope-please-abigail-hansen/\n\nPersonally I wanted to go to college to study graphic design and journalism. A lot of private schools only have majors in something related, like Art or English/communications. Why would o go to a school like that when state schools offer excellent, hands on, career-oriented majors specifically called Graphic Design or Journalism? I wasn\u2019t the type that wanted a super liberal arts oriented education. Some interesting elective classes yes, but I wanted my core major(s) to be technical, practical, and real-world driven that would help set me up for a career directly in that field. The private schools might have had better networking and resources for sure, but seemed lacking in the exact curriculum I wanted. To this day I don\u2019t really see how people go to Duke or whatever and study English and want to be journalists when they could just find an excellent professional Journalism program at Mizzou or countless other public schools that offer majors specially in journalism. Yes I know you can get that experience by working on a student newspaper staff, but you can do that at a public school too - why wouldn\u2019t you want both curriculum and extracurriculars (exception - the people that really want that true liberal arts experience)?\n\nNot to mention that some lesser known schools offer a lot of merit scholarships to attract talent so if you have that opportunity, you can save soooooo much money (if you don\u2019t qualify for need based aid at Ivys) and use that money saved to pay for a graduate or professional degree, or a house, or a wedding, or whatever you want down the line.",

I go to a school where 3/4 will apply to an ivy.Their whole lives' dreams and their parents aspirations for them are the ivy league. If they don't get into it, of course, they are going to feel bad. I do think they are being wimpy for complaining that they don't go to ivies but try to see it from their shoes. It's really not easy for them to not go to ivies and admit that they weren't allowed a chance to study at the place they always wanted. Especially the asian kids, im not even joking, the first question from my friend's mom when my friend got a PG 41 out of 42 was, \"Why didn't you get a 42?\". The peer pressure and the pressure they put on themselves is immense. They probably don't want you all to feel bad and diminish you by saying \"they didn't go to the best school\". Even tho the school's great for y'all, it's not good enough for them. Simple as that. Let people say their minds.",

Hearing something like this would have likely helped me back then, because it would have reminded me that I did still have a future ahead of me without the specific school name on my diploma that I had originally imagined. I'm now a senior in college and love my non-ivy school. There are all sorts of different perspectives people have here -- just because pressure is on kids to go to ivies and they've internalized that and convinced themselves that they need it, doesn't mean that it's healthy or should be constantly validated.",
