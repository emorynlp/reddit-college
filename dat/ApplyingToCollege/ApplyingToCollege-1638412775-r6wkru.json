  "text": "I am applying for a CS major and won't know if I'm admitted until February at the earliest. In the UT MyStatus portal, I ended up accepting admission as it was on the \"to-do\" list. However, I don't want to go to this school if I don't get into my desired major.\n\nWas this accept button binding in any way? I haven't paid anything yet.",

      "text": "At least last year, when you officially accept admission you also had to put down a large deposit for housing and/or tuition and virtually sign a document that stated that you will be attending that university. If you did not put down any money, didn\u2019t sign a contract that stated you were going to attend that school and all you did was press that one button I think you should be fine. I went through the college admissions process last year and am now attending Syracuse University.",

You might lose a deposit that you make, but a school can never force you to attend.\n\nBut why did you decide to do this? If I was an AO evaluating your application, I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d make of it.",
