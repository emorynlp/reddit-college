              "text": "Not studying yet haha but last year I only got accepted to one out of seven schools which gave me 40k per year from merit scholarships but I still had to pay 35k for the rest. Earlier this month I got in another school with 36k from merit scholarships but I still have to pay 26k. I have near-full need, and I'm aware that severely disadvantages me in all need-aware institutions, as colleges have very limited budget to give to international students",
