You can't beat walking downstairs and getting access to a library, dining hall, recording studio, snack shop, game room, gym, art studio, theater and more.\n\n> lack of diversity\n\nI was actually surprised by how diverse it is. The largest minority group is by far AAPI, followed by Hispanics/Latinos. There aren't that many Black people, though, which is problematic.\n\n>i dont think they offer minors\n\nNope :(\n\n> super expensive\n\nThe university has great financial aid, but if you're stuck paying full freight, it's not exactly cheap",

I would argue it has the worst locations of the Ivies and it's mostly because they don't contribute to the local economy and environment the way other elite schools do. Connecticut winters are also brutal and you will not be going to New York or Boston no matter how much they market it",
