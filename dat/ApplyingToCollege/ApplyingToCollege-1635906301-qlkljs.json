  "text": "So I am worried because my ecs and awards are basically all music related (international recognition and very high level), but I am applying as an econ major to unis instead of consevatories. Will this negatively impact me much? I founded an econ club at my school and was financial manager for an organization but thats about it (also got 4s on the ap econ exams).",

      "text": "Tbh I\u2019m not the best to give out advice on this, specially since I\u2019m an international. HOWEVER, IMO you should be more than fine. EC\u2019s are what you do outside of class and the curriculum itself. Yes, it\u2019s good to have \u201cdemonstrated interest\u201d, but at the end of the day, you\u2019re not just one thing, or in this case \u201cyour major\u201d. You\u2019re the whole of all those little details and being very music oriented will never be a bad thing. In fact, it could showcase how you can balance both. Breathe and trust, mainly bc they\u2019re _your_ EC\u2019s, which you ENJOY",
