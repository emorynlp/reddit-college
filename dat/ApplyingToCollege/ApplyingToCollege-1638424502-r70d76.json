              "text": "It works well for foreign students too, if they want to come to Cali and do ESL classes/integrate into the education system with cheaper, smaller classes before going into the UC. And there\u2019s an American expat on the transfer sub who is doing this from overseas, taking all online classes at California community colleges from Asia and applying through TAG/CCC transfer programs. CCC for non Californians isn\u2019t free/dirt cheap, it\u2019s more like $10k a year in tuition. But that\u2019s a lot less than outsiders would have to pay for those last 2 years if they go to a UC.\n\nThe real restriction is on high demand majors. Starting this year, you can only TAG CS at Riverside and Merced, and combined UCLA and Irvine only accept maybe 25 nursing transfers. Admission stats for most programs are a lot better for transfers than freshmen though. https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/transfers-major",
