  "title:": "Question about courses and grades section on my Common App",
  "text": "Hey everyone. My question is as the title says.\n\nThe walkthrough for the courses and grades section on Common App states that I should \"Enter the course name **exactly** as it appears on your transcript.\"\n\nHowever, my school decides to abbreviate *a lot* of course names on the transcript, even to ones that don't make sense. For example, the course \"Texas Government Dual\" is listed as \"Sptss2 Gov2 Hdc\". I assume the schools would want to know what the course is, so listing this would likely make zero sense to them.\n\nWhat do you suggest I do in this case? Should I list how it shows on the transcript with parentheses next to it telling them what the course actually is?\n\nThanks!",
