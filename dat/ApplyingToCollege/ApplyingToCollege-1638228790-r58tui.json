  "text": "Hi everyone: \nI am a student from Colombia who thought she was a decent student, so I applied for hunter college at NYC, I send my transcript to translate to the American metric score and I got back a terrible 2.8, I got a 1520 on the SAT however Hunter isn\u2019t accepting SAT scores due to the pandemic and the average GPA is 3.4 basically I am out of the race, I am oblivious about college admissions in USA, what should I do? How do I get a new GPA? Some people on internet told me to get into a 2 year community college in order to get a new GPA, but even community college asks me for a GPA higher than 3.0, I mean that what I was trying to do with applying to hunter since my first choice was NYU or Columbia.",

I'm from a country in Latin America as well, and the first time I sent in my transcript for review, they returned me with a 3.3 GPA. I knew that wasn't right, so I called and asked how they converted my grades. They had used the wrong system.\n\nAfter everything was corrected, I ended up with a \\~3.7+ GPA.\n\nI'd recommend you double-check with whoever converted your GPA, just in case.",

I'm actually applying to Columbia U from here with a 3.3 UW kinda thing, but from what I've read GPA is always a tricky thing cause there is no such thing as an American score translation, like they know every GPA is calculated differently.

              "text": "Hmmm. I see. I am very confused about the conversion, I thought straight Bs warranted at least a 3.0. Especially because you got a 1520 on the SAT. I am also international, and while we speak English in Canada I have never been asked to convert my grades from the Canadian scale to the American ones. But if the school told you to do it then they're probably right. \n\nDisclaimer: I'm not an admissions officer. The only way you can truly find out if you'll get into a school is by applying and having them make the choice of whether to admit you or not.\n\nAre you still taking courses? If you are, you could try aiming for A's, but it might not make as big of an impact as you want. \n\nOtherwise, you should apply to universities in your country and check the transfer policies at the US schools you are interested in. You could try to transfer into them after a year or two, just aim for the highest grades and have good extracurriculars. Transfer admissions are brutal though, even more so than first year admissions, so be careful. \n\nYou could also take a gap year, though. Up to you. I wish you the best of luck tho, hopefully somebody with more experience can give you a better answer than I can.\n\nEdit: I'm still confused about that GPA though \ud83e\udd28 afaik schools do those conversions internally",
