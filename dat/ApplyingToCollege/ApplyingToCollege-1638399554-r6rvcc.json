  "text": "I'm currently going to a college where due to mental health issues and general bad experiences with the college I've not shown up for a majority of the semester. I applied to another college and got accepted but they require a 2.0 GPA at this college  and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get that. I have previous college experience, as I graduated from a local community college while still in highschool, so I am able to do the work, I just ended up in terrible circumstances this time. I'm currently working on getting an appointment with someone about my mental health issues, but I believe I have a disorder that affects my general ability to function and had been the main cause of my problems.\n\nHow likely is it for me to be able to get into the other college if my GPA is below their standard but I am able to talk to someone and explain my situation?",

      "text": "Get a doctor\u2019s note and withdraw from your current school or negotiate with counselors and professors for incompletes if you can\u2019t pull off at least a 2.0. Do not handicap yourself with that kind of grade track record. You would be better off to take some time out of school and start over - new school, new classes. You can see if they\u2019ll let you transfer later. Worst case go do some fun classes at the CC and reapply. \n\nI\u2019m a retired professor. If you have a doctor saying you are experiencing a mental health crisis and it would be best for you to take a break from school immediately your school must give you accommodations the same as if you were in a car accident or had a disability. You can ask for either a withdrawal or incompletes with a deadline of 3-12 months from now. Your best bet is to get documentation of your health issues and go straight to someone in your school who can help. If you have an understanding professor you could start there and ask that person who to talk to. A counselor would be the right person to start with at many schools; a department chair if all classes are in the same major. The Associate Dean over students for the college your major is in is the one with the real power to sign off. Honestly for a late drop/withdrawal or incomplete all those people (except the counselor) will probably need to sign the paperwork. This late in the semester you\u2019ll need to pull yourself together and/or go really get someone to help you push this through, whether that\u2019s a counselor or university therapist or a parent/guardian. \n\nNegotiating accommodations won\u2019t be easy but if you don\u2019t think you can turn things around at this point, it\u2019s your best option. I\u2019m rooting for you and will talk you through the bureaucracy if you want although every university is a bit different. Good luck! Take care of yourself.\n\nIt will all be ok. In 5 years you\u2019ll barely remember this and it won\u2019t hurt your career one bit.",

          "text": "I've been trying to take some of my classes off if not completely withdraw from the college but I can't. My family kept pushing me to just deal with it and now I'm stuck with classes that i can't pass. I submitted a late drop form for one class and just removing this one should give me a passing GPA but I doubt it'll go through. \n\nI can't get a doctor's note for this because I haven't been able to get into anywhere. I went to my colleges disabilities office and they told me that they can't do anything even if I get a diagnosis other than extra time on tests. \n\nI talked to someone in the student success services area and they suggested incompletes but only one of my professors would be willing to let me do that and it's the one class I have a high grade in because he has been understanding and allowed me to make up work. \n\nI'm worried that even if i can get something worked out such as a doctor's note it won't matter because it's so close to the end of the semester and recently learned that the college has had a history of ignoring disability issues.",
