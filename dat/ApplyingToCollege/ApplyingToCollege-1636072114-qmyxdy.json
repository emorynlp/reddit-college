  "text": "Basically I submitted 3 apps early. Out of those 3, 2 were fine. But.. one of my supplements for the third one got messed up. I don\u2019t know what happened (because when I checked the issue wasn\u2019t there.) I was looking at the pdf and all the punctuation marks got changed into question marks, you can obviously tell it was a mistake but I don\u2019t know if I can fix it. What should I do? Is it too late to fix it? I already emailed them but their email sounded too much like an automatic response",
