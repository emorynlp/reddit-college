  "text": "Why do I mention that? Because Columbia is one of my dream schools and I would love to ED there, problem is, their supplemental essay requires me to mention a list of books or essays I enjoyed reading in my free time, and of websites I frequent (people usually put in NYT or some science stuff there).\nI don\u2019t read books, this doesn\u2019t mean I am not smart or worthy of Columbia , this just is not a hobby of mine.\n\nShould I even bother ED to Columbia when one and a half of their supplemental lists are close to irrelevant for me and will be very dull and empty? \n\nIt\u2019s so frustrating please help me out guys ..\n\nEDIT: Guys, I don\u2019t hate reading as in I can\u2019t read anything. I know I will have to read in Columbia and that\u2019s obviously perfectly fine. I am completely fine with reading academically and will do so as best as I can. The problem is that they are asking for books I read in my free time during the past few years, but I just can\u2019t write any because I simply don\u2019t read in my free time as it isn\u2019t a hobby of mine.",

You mentioned you like CS - you've never picked up a \"How to Program in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" textbook or anything like that? I imagine (or at least hope) that there's gotta be *something* you have that you're just not thinking of\n\nUnpopular opinion but if you've done extensive research on Columbia and you think you'd be a good fit, don't let one supplemental deter you (esp. when the lists total 275 words max COMBINED). If you don't read books *because you hate reading*, then yeah, I defer to the other commenters, but I interpreted your post to just mean \"you don't read outside of school.\" If you'd be willing to engage in Columbia's LA focus, then shoot your shot",

      "text": "Reading really isn't for everyone, but if you need to seem like you read, here's a start:\n\n- look for books from shows or movies you liked, then, look online for video essays on YouTube or similar websites to see if the series/movie matched the books, then talk about what you loved in the show and touch upon some points of contrast or similarities with the book.\n\n- find a genre you enjoy and check the bestsellers for that genre, then, look for summaries of those books or analysis online that will make you seen like you have a lot of hard opinions on the book.\n\n- find some academic-sounding short stories (Steinbeck has some bangers under 100 pages) and read those, set aside time to read them and plan for breaks.\n\n- try getting into children's books. They are how I rediscovered my love of reading after I got depressed and they are super heartfelt things to put on a resume, they are also usually quick reads with little to no brainpower required so they're easy picks. A good one that makes it seem like you love reading is Mr. Lemoncello's library. It's all about books and kids who love to read, and the main character is faking his love of books to get prize money (same lmao)\n\n- half the comments probably already say this, but audiobooks are an option.\n\nAnd no matter what you settle on doing, just remember to make it personal and make it resonate with a shared human experience and the admissions people will eat it up like kids at an all-you-can-eat ice cream buffet.",

At best any positive information is weakly correlated imo and mostly just tells me they know some specific information. i just think it's a bad question that offers almost no information. if the rest of your app gives the impression of intellectually curious with good character they may overlook the dumb reading list question",
