      "text": "Not too many high schools have classes in civil engineering or architecture\u2026 and in fact a lot of what people study in college is different from high school. Colleges don\u2019t expect LORs to come from exactly what you will study. It\u2019s generally suggested to have LORs from different subject areas (STEM + something else), so your chem & psych should be fine. What\u2019s more important than even different subjects are LORs from teachers who know you well and think highly of your work ethic & potential.",
