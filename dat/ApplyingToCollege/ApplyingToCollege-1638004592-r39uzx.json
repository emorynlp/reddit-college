  "text": "I checked the box off because I thought that it would be nice to learn about colleges. However,\u2026\n\n#PLEASE STOP SENDING ME SO MANY FUCKING EMAILS!!! IT\u2019S DRIVING ME NUTS!!! PLEASE STOP SENDING ME SO MUCH PHYSICAL MAIL!!! MY PARENTS ARE QUESTIONING WHAT ALL THIS IS, AND THEY WANT ME TO READ ALL OF IT!!! I DON\u2019T HAVE TIME AND THE PATIENCE TO READ ALL YOUR EMAILS AND MAIL!!!\n\n\u201cDear XXX, I\u2019m very impressed with blah blah blah. You seem like the perfect student. Please take our personality quiz.\u201d\n\nThe first time I saw that, I was excited. After seeing it 242 times, it seems very generic. I feel like all of these colleges use the same template for these emails.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I have your correct information. Please confirm it by clicking on this link. We want to ~~bombard your email and home mailbox with our college stuff~~ connect with you.\u201d\n\nWell, no shit I\u2019m not responding. I sure as heck ain\u2019t gonna confirm any personal information because you\u2019re going to send me even more spam.\n\nEdit: These emails are kinda creepy. I feel like they have some sort of tracker on me that knows when I\u2019m awake and using my device. One day I\u2019m up until 3 am doing homework and I keep getting college emails every hour. However, I go to sleep at 11 pm the next day and no college emails are sent to me from 11 - 3.",
