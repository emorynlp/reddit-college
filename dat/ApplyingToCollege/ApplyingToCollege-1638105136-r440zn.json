      "text": "Honestly maybe unpopular opinion but fir the most part she\u2019s right. \n\nManga has a certain type of person associated with that genre (cough cough weebs). Unless done write in an essay, it might portray you as anti social or creepy. Also keep in mind AO are often boomers. \n\nIn terms of the politics stuff, yeah she\u2019s also right. You never know if you\u2019ll say something that might piss off a white wing AO. For example i never talked about defunding the police in my essays (even tho that\u2019s what i did in hs). Instead i talked about \u201credesigning community safety\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s just better to avoid jargon/topics that *may* piss off a certain type of AO",
