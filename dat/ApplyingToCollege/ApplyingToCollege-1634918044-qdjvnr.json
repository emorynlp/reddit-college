  "text": "A few schools I'm applying to give you the option of choosing between an alumni interview or an interview with someone from the admissions team. \n\nI think the AO one will be more impactful as I speak directly to someone from the admissions office but IDK maybe the conversation with alumni will be better and a smaller chance to mess up I guess. \n\nWhat should I do? Any advice is appreciated.",
