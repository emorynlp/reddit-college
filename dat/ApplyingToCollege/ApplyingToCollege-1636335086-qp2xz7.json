  "text": "I know r/TransferStudents and r/TransferToTop25 exists but they don't have a lot of resources and a lot of the information is conflicting since it's mainly based on personal experiences/opinions. \n\nI can't apply to Columbia because they cc hate students, don't worry though Stanford loves cc students but wait only if you're from cali?? Your high school record impacts your transfer chances, but this other comments says it doesn't? The SAT doesn't matter much after high school, but this other opinion says it does?? Also how do I address the transfer essay?  And where are UPenn's transfer course requirements on their website?? Why is brown need-aware for transfers \ud83d\ude2d  \ud83d\ude2d \n\nMy college advisors are super inaccessible so I feel really lost. Even when they are available they are only useful for instate universities. I wish there were megathreads, resource link compilations, timelines and in general more expert insight and support throughout the transfer process like for first year applicants.",

      "text": "All of the colleges you mentioned reject 85%+ of applicants so you need to expand your list.\n\nAs for whether high school grades and SATs matter for transfer students, that varies college to college. I would expect SATs wouldn\u2019t matter much if you\u2019re applying for 2022 admission since so many colleges are test optional. \n\nA lot of colleges have transfer admissions counselor(s) who would be glad to help you if you reach out to them. They could also give you a sense of which courses that you\u2019ve taken (or will take) at the CC will transfer to your intended major at the 4-year colleges.",

But like most cc\u2019s my school has a lot of agreements with in state universities so I\u2019m set for safeties and matches. I think I should be able to have a chance to shoot for my reach schools!\n\nAlso as mentioned in the post my college advisors are super inaccessible (I\u2019ve been sending emails for the past two months with no response and everyone I know has have had similar experiences). They\u2019re also not very familiar with private school transfer admissions",

Transferring is definitely a tough process, and there definitely isn't as much info readily available about it, so I want to say that I hope you know your feelings of frustration or uncertainty are really valid.  I'm so sorry to hear you're feeling really lost, and if you ever want to talk about transferring with someone, feel free to let me know, and I'd be happy to try to help in any way I can.\n\nI'm rooting for you and wishing you good luck!\n\nHave a nice day!",
