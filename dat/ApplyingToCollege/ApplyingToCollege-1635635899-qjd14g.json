      "text": "I submitted mine recently. I just read 1-3 online and watched a video regarding how to construct one. There really isn't much of a method to it. I believe writing without personal pronouns makes it more professional, for example, instead of writing, \"I performed at various venues,\" you could write, \"Performed at various venues.\"   \nThey should give you some info as to what you should address in the resume, but I suppose standard stuff would be a brief introduction, musical education, recent repertoire studied, ensemble experience, festival experience, additional instruments (if any), and you could come up with more.",
