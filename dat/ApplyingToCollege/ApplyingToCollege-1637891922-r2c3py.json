  "text": "I applied to Wisconsin madison as an early applicant, and today I got an email from them stating that I need to submit my IGCSE external(board) results with an official stamp. Nowhere they specified that how I should send it, they only said, \"All missing items should be sent immediately to ensure that they arrive within 7 business days, in order to be considered for the fall term.\" On their to-do list section, it showed, any material sent over email is not acceptable. Their admission office is closed for 3 days, and I am apprehensive now. If they expect me to send my results physically to them, it will take over 6-7 days from my location(international applicant). I don't know what I should do, and if it's physical sending, I need to send it today asap(to make sure it reaches within 7 days)\u2014just looking out for some opinions; thanks in advance!",
