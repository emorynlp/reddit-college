  "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nDid you know there was a limit on the number of colleges one can apply to on the common app? \n\nI was adding schools, and this message came up-**You cannot have more than 20 colleges. You may remove a college using your** **dashboard****.** Any thoughts? Could it be worth doing another app process like coalition?  It probably will not matter for me; there are a few on that list that I'm not going to apply to. Definitely something to keep in mind if you're applying to a lot of schools.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for your help during the application process!",
