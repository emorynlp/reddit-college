  "title:": "Do I notify AO if one of my recommenders passed away?",
  "text": "Hi! As the title suggests, my recommender passed away some days ago, only yesterday that I learn of the news. My EA decisions are coming out in two weeks and I wonder if I should email the AO about this, as I assume the decision has already been made. Also, I\u2019m unsure if I can still use their recommendation letter for my RD apps, though I really want to. This person witnessed a large part of my growth and I believe their words towards me could really help with my apps. \n\nI\u2019d really appreciate any advice or insights on this. I just don\u2019t know what to do :(",
