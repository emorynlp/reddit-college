  "text": "I MADE THE WORST MOST IDIOTIC MISTAKE EVER. On my activities list I said I am doing brain research on neurodegenerative disorders in but i actually changed my topic in the beginning to psychiatric disorders. I forgot to change the wording on my activities list and in my supplemental essay i said it was on psychiatric disorders so it is inconsistent and now the admission officers are going to think i am lying and reject me.\n\nPLS HELP. what should i do??? should I email the admissions officers explaining the situation?",
