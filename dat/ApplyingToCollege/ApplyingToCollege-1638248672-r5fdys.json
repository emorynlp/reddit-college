  "text": "My counselor today told me that in the \"School Report\" section, she uploaded 4 transcripts: 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th Mid-term. She uploaded and submitted.   \nShe, then, moved forward and saw the \"Mid-year report\" section, but she had already submitted it in the School report section. Now she can't edit it.  \nWhat do we do? Like, is it ok to submit the Mid-Year report in the \"Transcript\" section of School report because it asked for the current or most recent Transcript.  \nIf that's how it's supposed to be, then why is there a mid-year section?",
