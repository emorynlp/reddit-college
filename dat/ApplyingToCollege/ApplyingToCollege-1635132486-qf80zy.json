I didn\u2019t even need to think too hard as the essays resonated with me\n2. Stanford\n- Roomate Essay very quirky, get to show off my personality like I\u2019m talking to anyone else\n3. SMU\nNot even a bad prompt honestly \n4. Rice\nWho doesn\u2019t love Rice? I mean Hogwarts of  the South, I was literally thinking of Sitting in a kiddie pool of rice naked for the rice box\n5. Yale\nRice Jr, had good essays honestly. I felt like I epitomized a person who has a great fit at Yale, but you made me stay up till 3, for 3 days straight \ud83d\ude1e\n6. UT Austin\nAll I gotta say is that the committee making these essays share one brain cell with each other because they are literally the same prompt paraphrased. Fuck You. I feel like I have a better chance at Stanford/ Brown CS anyways\n7. Princeton\nAlways wanna be different.\nFuck You\nFUck you\nFUCK YOUUU\nI HAVE 7 PROMPTS TO DO BY SATURDAY BECAUSE OF YOU GODDAMNN IT\n8. USC\n\nFuck you, I withdrew my application anyways, imagine making me fill out the QUESTBRIDGE app and the Common App like I don\u2019t have time for other colleges anyways. Get the fuck out of here\n\n9. Duke\nHaven\u2019t done duke yet. You seem pretty chill tbh rate 6\n\n10. Tufts\n\nIf Brown didn\u2019t exist I would\u2019ve picked you\ud83d\ude15.
