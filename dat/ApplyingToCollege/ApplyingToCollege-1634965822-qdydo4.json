  "text": "Obligatory good luck to those finishing up their ED/EA/REA apps. Good luck to those in the process of RD apps. To those who haven't started, you still have plenty of time. To those who are finished, congrats but don't slack off just yet. We're all in this together (\u266a). Let's go Co26 (Co22)! \n\n\\~\n\nSeeing all the posts and comments regarding the stress and horror stories dealing with counselors as well as people's indifference towards private counselors due to the absurd costs, I was wondering how the average applicant manages college applications.\n\nI had previously attended a non-competitive US high school but I moved away right before the thinking about college unofficially started (\\~summer before 11th). As you can tell from my flair I am currently not in the US, where I attend an international school. I don't want to sound like bragging, but lower student population combined with expensive tuition yields very very good support. Think things like frequent college AO representative visits, multiple workshops, individual guidance, feedback for essays, mandatory teacher lors, clearly defined internal deadlines and extra help for those behind, and not to forget the connections with alumni at top tier institutions, some being faculty. I would assume such support is the norm at private schools, which brings me to my question.\n\nDespite all the help I get from my school, my parents are always on my ass asking where I'm at with essays or if I'm going to add school X onto my list, etc. If not for the support, I would have probably had at least 10 breakdowns. I was just wondering what it's like for those attending public high schools, where I assume such support is non-existent, or at least much less due to the large class size.",

      "text": "Wow, that sounds incredible. Does practically everyone at your school end up at Top20's? Also, are you applying internationally or as an US resident?\n\nI go to a mediocre non-competitive public school in a small town and the lack of guidance is indeed an aimless hell. The guidance counselor department spoke about college with us for the *very first time* senior year. Our guidance counselors are supposed to meet with each of us individually to discuss college plans for the first time but it's October and that hasn't happened nor do I forsee it happening, even though our class size isn't huge - 180 people. The department actually strongly recommended us NOT to take the SAT because they claimed it wouldn't boost our application whatsoever unless we absolutely want to. We don't do class rank and there's no valedictorian/salutatorian. We have about 12 APs (3 of which are languages.) There's very little student involvement and only about 5 clubs in the whole school, most of which meet bi-monthly. About 80% of people go to our local state school.",

          "text": "Thanks for your response. I've noticed that the expectations of the counselors correlate with the amount of effort they put in. Perhaps the mindset of \"most of our students go to the local state school\" is what causes the little to no guidance. Well, at least you have the great resources A2C has to offer. \n\nI should've mentioned I'm a non-US citizen/resident, as are most of my peers. The majority of students that apply to US get into schools in the t30 range (a few t10s) as well as t10 LACs. A lot of students however choose to apply to (and attend) t10s in their respective countries (UK, France, Switzerland, Canada, China, S. Korea, etc).",

      "text": "I go to a pretty competitive public high school with a graduating class of \\~500. A large minority of students take 10+ APs, have great GPAs and test scores, and crazy ECs. Our school has a high ranking, not because of the staff, but because the students are highly competitive and work their butts off.   \n\n\nThat being said, we barely send any students to T20s (I believe only two last year) because our counselors (and staff in general) are *abysmal*. And by that, I mean my counselor *literally left* two weeks ago, and now I have no one to get help from.    \nDespite so many students taking tons of APs, they don't weight our GPAs (out of what I assume is) just laziness. I will have taken 12 APs by the end of this year, so my weighted GPA is pretty high, but since they refuse to weight it, the GPA colleges see is low. It feels like we are punished for taking challenging courses.   \nInstead of class rank, we get deciles which aren't actually based on the GPAs of students. They just choose unweighted GPA brackets for each decile and shove each student into one.   \nWe had a \"college week\" this week. The week before early action. The most guidance we get from the school are announcements on Canvas about deadlines.   \n\n\nIt's really unfortunate because I have so many brilliant classmates who totally could get into a T20 if they were given the right support.",
