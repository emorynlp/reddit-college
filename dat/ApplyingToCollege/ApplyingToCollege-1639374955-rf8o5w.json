  "text": "So basically the college I want to get into requires a 500 in both sections, but I got a 490 in math. I have a cumulative gpa of about 3.7 and a 630 in reading and a few other things. The degree I want has nothing to do with math (clearly). Do application reviewers really care about the 10 points?",
