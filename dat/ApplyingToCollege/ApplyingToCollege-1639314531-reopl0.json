  "text": "So I'm newly elected as the President of NHS at our school and I want to stay true to my word in my potential officer interview to make our school's NHS run better. If you're in NHS, what are parts of your chapter of NHS that you really enjoy/enjoyed that could be implemented at other schools? In addition, what are some things about your NHS right now you bitterly despise or are not as fond of? Thank you good people of Reddit <3",

Also I\u2019m on event board of the NHS and we are doing a tutoring party for finals so that\u2019s something to consider for next semester",

      "text": "Due dates: make it VERY VERY VERY clear and obvious when things are due, make the due dates/times as consistent as possible, and send at least a few reminders each time.\n\nMy NHS would sometimes have things due at 3:00 pm, sometimes at 11:59 pm, sometimes at 7:00 am, and would never really send a notification or reminder about them. Extremely annoying and infuriating to then get dinged points when you miss a deadline that you didn't realize was earlier in the day.",

Community service opportunities that involve doing/making something while you can talk to others preferably. \nAlso fun fundraising too",
