It was happening long before all this stuff about gender equality came about, so it probably originated back in the 1920's or earlier.\n\nYou call every woman a Ms., unless they're a Ma'am. You can tell after a while lol. If you're in trouble, it's Ma'am. If it's an older lady working at a store, it's Ma'am. If she's a teacher, it's Ms. If she's the parent of a friend, it's Ms.\n\nI've always heard it's because typically Ms. is reserved for younger ladies, and when someone 40+ hears it, they take it as a compliment about how young they look. (was told this by a 60+ year old lady and I'm inclined to believe it)",

If the person doesn\u2019t and you can determine with a high degree of confidence they are Mr or Ms, use Mr or Ms. if you\u2019re not sure, feel free to use Mx. Above all else, if someone\u2019s name is Alex, you use Mr and it turns out Mr is a Ms, 99% chance that person will not think anything if it. It happens to that person all the time.",

They're just alumni who agreed to do interviews. I don't know that they'll be very in touch with the student body.\n\n>if you\u2019re given a name, do a quick internet/social media search\n\nThis is definitely true.

They\u2019re generally fairly open to experience. Which is why they find themselves volunteering for alumni interviews. They also skew relatively young.
