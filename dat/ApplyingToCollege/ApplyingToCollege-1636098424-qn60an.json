  "text": "Hey guys,   \n\n\nSo I have seen that a lot of the kids that get into MIT have done a ton of research/won science fairs etc. So a lot of academic stuff. My concern is whether MIT cares about entrepreneurship? Like does a tech entrepreneur have a smaller chance than say a student who has done research/CS competitions?    \n\n\nWould appreciate your thoughts",
