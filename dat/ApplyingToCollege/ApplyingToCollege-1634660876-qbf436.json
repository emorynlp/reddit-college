  "text": "Hi all, \n\nI\u2019m seeking advice on how to start my college career over as an adult (29). \n\nI have around 8 semesters worth of transcripts from three different schools with a cumulative GPA of 0 and very few transferable credits. \n\nThe truth is that I loved college and desperately wanted to be successful, but struggled with major mental health problems after a lifetime of abuse. In my second year, I was diagnosed with major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and a panic disorder with agoraphobia. Medication helped, but I was not able to break free from my parents or their religious cult until my mid twenties, and did not see the reality or severity of my situation. I wanted to be there so badly that I kept trying and failing.\n\nI\u2019ve since been diagnosed with CPTSD, depression, anxiety disorder, and inattentive type ADHD. It\u2019s been a long road but with therapy and medication I am functional and hopeful again. \n\nDoes anyone know what options are available for someone in my circumstances? Is a degree still a possibility? Is academic bankruptcy an option? How should I approach applying to schools again? My embarrassment when I think about re-applying is extreme. \n\nI\u2019m not ready to start a full degree program as I have three children at home, but I would like to audit a class or two and start investing in myself again. Eventually I\u2019d like to return full time to study psychology and comparative literature. I miss it and am not ready to give up on myself or my dreams. \n\nThanks xxx",

Don't move too quickly and take things at a pace you are comfortable with.\n\nI went to an open enrollment university that literally was built for those that are in positions like yours. It was a great experience, the classes could work around my schedule most of the time, and I could do things at my own pace (1 course at a time or 7 all at once if I felt so inclined).\n\nCommunity colleges, open enrollment universities, are a good resource for getting back into courses and figuring out what interests you.",

      "text": "Community college. You can skip the application process for now and focus on easing yourself back into school while building good study habits and a positive transcript. It's a more supportive environment than university, the average age hovers around 26, and it's cheaper, too. They'll also have resources to help you transfer once you finish your generals or an associate's degree.\n\nUnfortunately, academic bankruptcy is not an option, but a degree is still very possible if you're able to turn your grades around. Universities care more about what you're doing now than what you did in the past, so if you can establish a positive academic track record, there will be universities that want to admit you.",

          "text": "This is a good answer. Start at CC. You need to establish good patterns with studying and going to class. Start small, 1 class, see how that goes, and then ease into a full load. Access and utilize ALL the resources the CC has to offer: tutoring, advising, and don't forget to apply for disability accommodations! Based on your disabilities above, you would qualify for things like extended exam time, distraction-reduced testing environment, assistive note taking devices, written feedback from professors, and perhaps even flexibility with due dates. This is no guarantee, but definitely check with your CC's disability office.\n\nProve yourself for two years at a CC, and then you can transfer to a 4 year to get your bachelor's. Some schools will have academic amnesty policies, but those generally only apply to your first semester. 8 semesters won't ever get wiped out. You mentioned 3 different schools - but you only have to attend/graduate from one! Decide where you will be completing your degree, and only focus on repairing your GPA at that school. You will probably need to write an appeal for admission/re-admission. Your CC advisor can help you with this, and you'll probably also need documentation from your therapist/doctor.\n\nI know that schools will say \"include ALL colleges you've attended\" when you are applying for a transfer, but here's a secret - they don't check. If you won't be attending any of the previous 3 that you flunked out of, then leave them off completely. You won't have any transferrable credits anyway, so they won't care. If you are applying to one of the schools you attended before, only include that school. \n\nGood luck!",

              "text": "Hi! Thanks so much for your response. You mentioned some thing, like the disability accommodations, that I did not know existed. If my university had offered them or if I had known about them when I was struggling I likely would have been able to stay in and scrape through. \n\nWhen you say that I don\u2019t have to include past colleges, does that mean that I could start at a community college and then transfer to a university without mentioning my previous academic history? I\u2019ve always just assumed it was connected to my social and that I\u2019d have to disclose.",

                  "text": "You don't have to disclose anything to your community college. Just sign up and start taking classes. Generally they don't care if you went somewhere else previously unless you're trying to transfer credits in (like military credits, dual enrollment gen eds, etc) When you say \"social\" do you mean social media? If so, sanitize the hell out of your SM. Plus, you don't want to list schools you flunked out of anyway. Also, it might be worth getting a new gmail account just for college so you have completely new and separate contact info for your college adventure.\n\nFor the 4-year schools, I'm going to give you two answers: what you are \"supposed to do\" and what you can \"actually do.\" Colleges are going to ask for all the transcripts from all the colleges you've ever attended. So that is what you are supposed to do. However, if your 4-year transfer school is one you've never attended before, then you can get away with only submitting your CC credits when you transfer. I assume you will be finishing your degree at a state school or a private college that is not terribly selective. A non-selective school isn't going to dig too deeply into a CC transfer applicant. As long as you have the appropriate courses and grades from the CC, then you should be good to go. If you're unsure about doing this, or if you think it's frowned on at your school, make a \\*67 anonymous call to the admissions office and ask. (Yes, the do have caller ID on campus, so cover yourself to be sure.)\n\nI will share my story, which is very much like yours. Went to a semi-prestigious university right out of high school, didn't do well. Enrolled a few years later at a different university, didn't do well. Went to CC and got my associates/satisfied all my gen eds. Nailed it. Applied to school #3 and completed my bachelor's degree there (finally with the disability accommodations I needed! Hello!) When I transferred to school #3, I did not submit grades from or even mention the first two schools. What's really funny is that school #2 and school #3 are in the same state university system, just different campuses. No one checked, and tbh I don't think they cared. I wasn't vying for honors program or internships or anything competitive. I was an adult with a full time job and kids and a mortgage. I just grinded out my classes and got my piece of paper and that was it.\n\nEdited to add: as the posted below mentioned, your mileage may vary. Make the call to ask the admissions department.",

                      "text": "This is really dangerous advice. Yeah, there's a good chance the college won't find out you withheld required information, but if they do, it can absolutely destroy you. Not only can you get your admission rescinded, but even if you've already graduated and discover it, they can cancel any degrees you earned and put you on the hook for any grant aid you received during your time there. That can mean tens of thousands of dollars in extra debt, and a disciplinary record that would essentially blacklist you in academia.\n\nI also went through a long rough period the first time I went to college. I left with about 65 credits and a 1.7 gpa. I dropped out and got the mental health help I needed, then went to community college for another major and earned a 4.0 for 2 years straight, which still only worked out to a flat 3.0 cumulative. I applied to universities with *all* my transcripts, and I got in everywhere I applied, including a full ride to USC.\n\nLying by omission is not necessary, and it can seriously backfire if you are unlucky. Please don't risk it.",
