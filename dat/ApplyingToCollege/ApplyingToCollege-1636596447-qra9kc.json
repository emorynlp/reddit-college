  "text": "Hey sorry I know these types of posts can be annoying, but I\u2019m just stressed and a bit worried. \n\nSo my school \u201cdoesn\u2019t rank,\u201d but they do sorta just throw around your percentile. I knew I was in top 10% so that\u2019s what I put as that was the lowest one available on the common app.\n\nMy school recently released a list of the number of students with gpa above x, and I know I\u2019m at least top 5% now. I applied REA to Princeton - should I send them an email? If I don\u2019t will they assume I\u2019m only top 10%?",
