  "text": "I'm lowkey panicking bc I think I messed up by not taking physics at all in high school.  I've been looking on school websites and they all say they recommend/require biology, chemistry, and physics, but I've only taken honors physical science, regular biology, pre-AP chem, AP chem, and taking AP bio this year.  I plan on going the pre-med route.  Are my chances lower now or will I be okay?",

      "text": "I literally skipped a science junior year because I had my credits by sophomore year. Am just doing an easy science offered by my school to get me through (I very much don't like science). Don't worry about it; unless you're trying to major in physics or some other important major it would be relevant they will definitely not make that the deciding factor between admitting you or not.",
