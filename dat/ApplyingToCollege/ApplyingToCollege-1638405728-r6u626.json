  "text": "For USC, you have to have your application materials in by December 1st. Unfortunately, my SAT score has not sent yet but I have self reported it. The rest of my application has gone through but I\u2019m worried that since the SAT takes time to send, I won\u2019t be considered. Should I spend extra money to get the score to the school quicker?",

My counselor also told me not to worry if my scores get there later. All they need is the common app and supplements by the 1st.",

As long as your app was submitted by the December 1st deadline (with the unofficial score report), the SAT official report can be sent via normally and your app will definitely be reviewed my admissions / not impacted.",

If it is still stressing you a lot, then definitely spend the little extra more to alleviate stress (but if your budget is tight, I would recommend just doing the 2 week speed).",
