  "title:": "Questions regarding how I should report courses on Common App and whether to use the additional info section or not",
  "text": "To put things simply, my school's system for GPA and class reporting is weird. Here are the basics:\n\n\\- We do not have AP or IB courses\n\n\\- We do have weighted courses, all of which are weighted at 5.0, whereas unweighted courses are 4.0\n\n\\- Some of these weighted courses are listed as \"advanced,\" while others are not, but they are all weighted the same. All of them are just as rigorous as each other, in spite of the name difference. Whether or not a class is weighted is the true indicator of rigor/difficulty, not whether it has the \"advanced\" moniker\n\n\\- My school caps the number of weighted courses that are actually weighted at ten. You can take more weighted courses (I've taken all but one, as far as I can tell), but they are (from a GPA perspective), treated just like a 4.0 course. As such, the maximum GPA is not 5.0 or 4.0, but some Frankenstein-ish thing like 4.42. \n\n\\- As far as I can tell, the reason for the lack of the \"advanced\" title on some of the weighted courses is that there is no unweighted alternative. For example, there is an advanced English 10 course and an unweighted English 10 course, but there is no unweighted version of anatomy, so anatomy is not called \"advanced anatomy.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow that you've conquered my wall of text (sorry!), I was wondering if anyone could answer a few questions about this situation. Should I report these weighted courses that technically aren't listed as \"advanced\" by my school on the Common App as \"college prep\" or \"advanced\"? Also, should I try to clarify this situation and the cap of ten advanced courses in the additional info section, or just leave it alone? I know this is a lot, so thank you for any explanations you're able to offer.",
