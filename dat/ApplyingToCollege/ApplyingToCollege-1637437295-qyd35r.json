      "text": "Do you want my honest advice based on your interests? You want to be a pilot and save lives? Join the military as a reservist or guardsman using the street to seat program, become a warrant officer, go through helicopter pilot school, and then you\u2019ll end up as a part-time helo pilot in the reserve/guard. If you want to really help people, join the California Army National Guard so you can be called up to help out when natural disasters happen. In your civilian life, use the helicopter pilot license, military training, and flight hours to use and join a government agency as a helo pilot. So many things to do. Search and rescue, airborne firefighting, tracking down criminals, natural disaster response, you name it. \n\nReally cool path. Think about it.\n\nAlternatively, take the chiller path of getting a BSN to become a nurse. In terms of firefighting, any degree really works. Doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be fire science if you have a good candidate profile as it is. It\u2019s super hard to be a firefighter though. Military service members get a huge preference.",
