      "text": "From reading this post, I think you are thinking too highly of yourself and too lowly for your friends. Why would you think that your friends can\u2019t deal with this fact? Most students coming into this college application game with the mindset that they may get rejected by the college and that\u2019s not the end of the world. Just focus on how to be a good friend and enjoy the high school life than worrying about something that has not happened, may not happened at all.",

Like that\u2019s such a weird thing to specifically prepare yourself for.\n\nI\u2019m sure if they\u2019re your friends they\u2019ll feel happy for you just don\u2019t like rub it in their face or anything",
