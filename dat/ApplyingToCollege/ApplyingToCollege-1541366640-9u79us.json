Besides that, it's not like they're just sitting around 9-5 observing \"real\" doctors for that residency - in inpatient/surgery specialties, they often have to work 100 hours a week and do many of the things a full attending physician does.  Basically, it's still worth it to many people and you'd hopefully make enough to make up for those years, but it just seems shitty to work people to the bone for next to no take home pay because \"that's the way it works, and we can\".  My brother's wrapping up medical school in a big city and his fiance is a teacher, and I know they're really stressed about finances in the coming years and the fact they won't be able to consider affording to have children until he's in his mid thirties \n\nEdit: just to be clear, I'm not saying its not worth it in the long term, just that it truly does suck for what ends up being up to 20% of your career ",

              "text": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9tydzv/for_the_folks_who_didnt_break_1000_sat/\n\nMost people commenting weren't putting people with a 980 down. Some comments were a little harsh imo though. Like this one (and it has like 4 upvotes)-\n\n>For those folks please consider not going to college (unless you had a **really** bad day when taking it)\n\n>True, the SAT isn\u2019t an exact predictor by any means, but it is still of some value. What does it mean if you scored less than 600 out of 1200 available points? (Minimum score is 400)\n\n>It\u2019s highly likely these people will drop out and have nothing to show having spent a lot of money.\n\nYou can definitely get into some colleges with a 980. The ones you can get into just won't have as many opportunities, which isn't the worst thing in the world. If you put in the work, you'll still get places in life just fine. I would just say that if you get an SAT score like 980, just consider whether college is right for you. The reason I say that is not because I view those with below average scores as an inferior race or something like that, it is because  there is a slightly higher chance  for  someone with a lower test score to not do as well in college. Standardized test scores aren't a hardset and full proof way of determining readiness, but there is some merit to it. That is why it is worth taking that into consideration when considering whether college is right for you. However, the thought process shouldn't be \"I have a 980, therefore college isn't for me\" it should be \"I have a 980. Looking at the statistics, this statistically means that I am predisposed to not doing as well in college. Let me think about whether this is true for me or not, as I know that statistics cannot be applied in a blanket fashion to everyone\". Then you simply proceed to think through the whole decision. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the vast vast majority of those with a 980 go off and do great things. But that doesn't change the fact that they are still more likely to not do as well in college. The most important thing is that you make an informed decision based off what you think you can achieve. Don't let anyone discourage you. If you want to go and you think you can do it, do it. If you think you have the discipline and can put in the work, do it. If you don't think you can do it, that's okay. Just make that decision an informed and thought out one, not one hastily made because someone told you you would probably end up dropping out.\n",

I was just saying that you should make an informed decision based on what you think you can do. That's why I said it very well could be right for you, or might not be. \n\nI think it's pretty hard to dispute the fact that those with lower standardized test scores are less likely to succeed in college. Most will still succeed. But a larger percent who have lower scores will not succeed than those with higher scores. I was not putting anyone down. I was just being realistic in that you should reflect and think about what you can and can't achieve. I think that we just have different perspectives on giving advice. To me, it is clear that those who have lower than average test scores have a higher chance of not doing well in college. Standardized test scores aren't the magnum opus of ways to figure out if you're  ready for college, but they can be an indicator. It's not always accurate, but there is merit behind it. If there wasn't, colleges wouldn't  use it. Does that mean they shouldn't still heavily consider college? No. Does that mean that they should lose all hope of doing well in college? No. Not at all. It does mean that they are slightly more likely to not do well, and that is why I mentioned what I mentioned. It's also why I mentioned that you shouldn't let anyone discourage you. You may be more likely to not do as well, but you know what, if you think you can do it, do it. It's all about determination. Just make an informed and smart decision. \n\nId read my original comment. I edited it to clarify what I was trying to say. Sorry for any misunderstanding",

However, those with a 1500 would not have this question prompted for the same reason. They would have this question prompted due to GPA, course rigor, money, etc. Everyone should consider whether college is right for them. It's just that people with a lower test score have a different reason, or another reason to consider it. I didn't mentioned the fact that others should consider not going to college as well because I was trying to keep my comment focused on those with a 980. \n\nI think it's important to look at the statistics and know that getting a lower score means you have a higher chance of failure. Therefore, to me, it would be logical to assume that getting a lower score should prompt the \"in light of this research and my score, should I go to college question\". Im not saying that low score = no college. I'm just saying that low score = statistically not as likely to succeed in college, therefore, they should take this into consideration.\n\nI get that it's discouraging. But it is the truth. I think it's better to tell those with a 980 to carefully and thoughtfully make the decision rather than simply apply without considering it though. \n\nI do see your point though. I just think that what in saying has enough merit to supersede the fact that it may discourage some people. It's kind of like a hard truth to me (you get low test score, then maybe you should consider the statistics and see if they pertain to you). I think that's fair. I understand why others would disagree though. I'm just a very logic oriented person. However, I also am not someone who received a low test score, so I cannot personally relate. ",

I dropped out of a Mech engineering degree on a later attemot at going back to college in my mid to late 20s, and just started working full time and eventually taking an apprenticeship instead. Only complaint is I didnt do this sooner, otherwise the intro starting wages wouldnt hurt so much.

I'm currently less financially successful than many of my friends who got 500-600 points lower than me. \n\nNobody gives one piece of poop if you scored a 1600 on the SAT or if you scored a 800 on the SAT. All that matters is you can ace that midterm or final coming up or if you snagged that internship. Your SAT knowledge won't serve you for anything in college. The SAT is a test that tests itself. Nothing more. Same goes for GRE btw. It's such a dumb, meaningless test. But those testing companies need to make money so they milk the students with this arbritrary exam. \n",

If you are struggling in high school then there is a real possibility that you will struggle when actually in that college. It's the reason why colleges take academics into account. The drop out comment was not needed, but the general idea of what he was trying to convey was reasonable. College isn't the right path for everyone, and just because most kids here are applying to T20s doesn't mean that we need to encourage everyone to.\n\nI know people here have the opinion that the SAT and ACT are useless since they went from a 27 to a 34, but I trust the opinions of most top institutions when they say that these tests do correlate to success in college. The comments like \"The SAT literally says nothing xd I cured cancer with a 400 SAT\" are just plain stupid. People are missing the point that your ability to study/take a test is pretty much the most important skill for college. \n\nIf you are motivated to attend a 4year college then there should be no reason why you wouldn't retake a 980.",

Not trying to be mean, but if English is your first language, getting a 980 generally means you just aren't very good at school. Generally studying for something like the SAT, which uses math, reading, and writing skills that you should have built up through years of school is a good indicator of how well you are doing in school combined with how good you are at preparing and taking tests. These are the most useful skills in college. It's not an IQ or knowledge test, but I would question whether I should go into certain fields if my accumulated knowledge after 12 years in school got me a 980. It's misleading to tell people that they can do whatever they want with a 980. For many people the debt they will receive from going to college is not worth it at the low ranked college they will be going to. Salaries for most students coming out of very low ranked schools isn't a huge upgrade from going to a trade school or community college.  ",

There are a lot of people who have test anxiety or otherwise just don\u2019t do very well on tests, but excel academically. In addition, sat/act scores strongly correlate with income, so it\u2019s unfair to just say that people with lower test scores aren\u2019t good at school.\nI do agree with you that sat scores do represent academic ability relatively well, but there are so many factors that affect test scores that a test score should not be what bars you from seeking education, especially if they have a high gpa (which is a better measurement of ability, motivation, and drive). Someone with a 980 can go to college and succeed because college is about so much more than just preparing and taking tests.",
