  "text": "Hello ApplyingToCollege! I am currently active duty in the Navy and am applying for college for next year. The main university I wish to attend requires a personal statement and I sadly don't have much in the way of High school to talk about. I was thinking about making it about what I have done in the Navy, but don't know if that would be too cheesy for a college. Do you have any recommendations of what I could do besides the Navy stuff?",
