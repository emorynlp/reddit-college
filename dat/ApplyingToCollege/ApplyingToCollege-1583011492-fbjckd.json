  "title:": "With RD season coming up: When you decline admission or withdraw your app to a college, they\u2019ll ask you for a reason, and you should say it was for financial reasons.",
  "text": "Colleges use the questionnaire as data to help them know who\u2019s accepting, who\u2019s declining, and it\u2019s not a stretch to think it\u2019ll be used to benefit the school especially in increasing their yield in the future.\n\nSo if you put down that you\u2019re going to another school and put the reason as they have a better program or something else, they\u2019ll make a note of your stats and may use it to make a more informed decision in whether to accept or decline a similar student in the future. You\u2019ll be required to give a reason in the questionnaire too, and sometimes they require you to put down the school you\u2019ve accepted instead too so you can\u2019t leave it blank.\n\nIn order not to let your data be used in this way and to put pressure on colleges to give more aid or decrease tuition, put down financial aid as the main reason. There are no downsides to this. You won\u2019t screw future classes over, and if enough people do it, it\u2019ll make a statement. College is too fucking expensive.\n\nEDIT: Not condoning lying, but if you\u2019re choosing another school for multiple reasons with financial aid being one of them, put financial aid down as the reason since they\u2019re usually only asking for one.\n\nEDIT 2: Hey everyone, wow I wasn\u2019t expecting this post to blow up like this. I\u2019ve wrote a few loooong comments as replies to people who think colleges using data like this is a ludicrous idea, but I figured a lot of people won\u2019t see them, so putting some info here. More links in the comments.\n\nHow are colleges using your data? Well, already pretty unethically. At the University of Wisconsin-Stout and over 43 other colleges (at least the ones The Washington Post found), [they](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/14/colleges-quietly-rank-prospective-students-based-their-personal-data/) collect your data and use it in such a way without feeling the need to tell you because to quote Buff State: \u201cYou have a choice of not interacting at all\u201d referring to the fact that people make a choice to visit the website and they can get their info through phone calls or social media posts instead. Ludicrous, right? They\u2019re saying you\u2019re agreeing to colleges using your data to score you when you\u2019re looking up information and need to make a choice between a detailed database with answers to most of your questions and an Instagram post. I think you need to access the website to find the phone number too.\n\nAt UW-Stout, they use an algorithm to assign you a score out of 100 to determine what\u2019s the likelihood you\u2019d accept an offer if given and use it to make decisions. It\u2019s also not said (hmm) where they got the data for the algorithm. I\u2019m a CS/Philosophy major, so the role of trust in an online relationship is super interesting, but to me, I think these events have diminished, perhaps obliterated, any trust in the relationship between you and colleges. Perhaps better advice would have been to not answer the questionnaires at all and forgo making a statement. Your data is valuable, so protect it. This is another way colleges obscure the admissions process to increase the power imbalance in their favor, and transparency and organizing as a collective is how we get the power back.",

For example, for Stanford, if you REA, you cannot apply early to any other private university (either EA, REA, ED, or early notification), cannot apply ED to any public university, but you can ED2 to any college if you get deferred. I disagree with REA and really think it\u2019s another way to keep the power with the colleges since being able to apply early to multiple places is really a boon for students.",

It contradicts everything I know, both from my time as an application evaluator and as a college admission consultant. That said, I don't want to discount that there are multiple sources of info out there and perhaps you're hearing differently from someone who works in Admissions or Enrollment. If so, this questionnaire has huge ramifications as you've pointed out that admitted student responses can be used to penalize future applicants. Thanks!",

          "text": "Hey, so glad you reached out! Did you work as a AO in your career? If so, do you mind saying if your school practiced yield protection and what they did with the questionnaire data? In my post, I didn\u2019t accuse any school of using the data for yield protection, and I think I made it explicit it was an easy to imagine scenario that could occur with the very specific set of data schools receive from the questionnaire. If you construed it as a confirmation of such practices happening, I apologize as that wasn\u2019t my intent.\n\nHowever, I think my fear of schools misusing the data in such a way isn\u2019t without basis as the application process is completely opaque. No school will confirm they yield protect, and yet the term has been around since the 1980s and there\u2019s been some [data analysis](https://blog.powerscore.com/lsat/what-is-yield-protection-in-law-school-admissions/)  (although since the process is so opaque, it relies on user submitted data). There\u2019s no trust in this relationship (which admittedly may go both ways), meaning there\u2019s no incentive in believing the college has good intentions. I believe there needs to be a systemic shift towards transparency, but that\u2019s another topic.\n\nWhat would colleges gain from including such a question? Their goal is to maximize yield and increase acceptances. In your experience, what do colleges do with such data? Obviously it doesn\u2019t sit there unused if they\u2019re asking it for a purpose. There\u2019s a real chance this is happening, and I\u2019d rather, and I think many people agree with me, prepare for the worst. In any case, I don\u2019t believe in giving my data to them for free, and answering financial aid as a reason has no downsides.\n\n(As an added note, the use of data by colleges is already sketchy. Note [here](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/the-data-colleges-collect-on-applicants-11548507602) and [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/14/colleges-quietly-rank-prospective-students-based-their-personal-data/).)",

              "text": "Thanks for the clarification! I think the title may be a bit misleading - \"When you decline admission or withdraw  your app to a college, they\u2019ll ask you for a reason, and you should say  it was for financial reasons.\" It reads as a set of instructions, not necessarily as a suggestion in response to a hypothesis, which is what prompted me to click on it and read further.\n\nI won't disagree! The practice of gathering data on applicants without their knowledge - via opening emails sent by the college, time spent on the website, # of clicks - is inexcusable, and there is a definite need for transparency around this. Some colleges lean on this data, deemed indicative of a student's \"demonstrated interest\" yet it is the one category you don't often see listed on these same college's undergraduate admissions page under \"admissions criteria.\" To be fair, there are still many schools who do not engage in tracking demonstrated interest, whether via data mining or otherwise, some of which spell that out right on their websites.\n\nAs I understand it, the argument *for* the questionnaire is for colleges to identify trends in why they are losing students they admitted to other schools (perhaps the financial aid packages are more competitive elsewhere, as you suggested), including IDing who they \"cross apps\" with (in other words, who their biggest competition is, so they can consider what their competitors offer that they do not). Based on data from the questionnaires, some colleges have elected to add an ED II program, adjust the percentages of students they plan to admit EA/ED/RD in the upcoming cycle, reevaluate their offerings in a specific academic department, or double down on efforts to recruit in certain geographies. All in all, this data gathering is intended to help the college market itself more effectively in the upcoming admissions cycle though, again, I agree transparency with those supplying the data is essential.\n\nI have never heard a college say it was keeping this data long-term to cross reference with future, grad school applications. Predicting yield at the graduate level is not nearly as exhaustive a process as it is at undergrad, mostly because you have far fewer applicants for - and less interest in - grad programs compared to undergrad. Ex) in fall 2017, 16.8 million students enrolled in degree-granting postsecondary (undergraduate) programs vs. the \\~3.0 million students who were enrolled in postbaccalaureate (graduate) degree programs.\n\nNot all colleges wants to increase acceptances - some unintentionally overenrolled in the past and need to underenroll the following cycle to ensure there are enough beds and classroom seats. Some colleges also take pride in their low acceptance rate, going so far as to solicit as many applications as possible in order to turn down as many students as possible. They aim to keep their # of acceptances exactly the same while increasing their overall # of applicants - so they can admit a lower percentage of applicants, appear more selective, and hence appear higher in the US News rankings. And that is a whole other conversation about lack of ethics and little to no transparency.\n\nThank you for weighing the ethics of these practices. Accountability is essential when students are handing off personal data to larger institutions.",

                  "text": "Thank you for replying! You bring up some good points that I agree with, but I think you misunderstood what I meant by yield protection. I don\u2019t believe the data is being used to influence grad school admissions like you said (since they\u2019d be two different offices and grad school really plays by a different set of rules), but rather to inform the colleges on future undergrad applicants who have similar stats and applications as you and make an inference on whether they would accept if given an offer. I think many people underestimate the power of data and how it\u2019s used which really leans the imbalance of power in favor of the colleges. Like you said, colleges use the data to inform them on how to increase yield, and perhaps a statement can be made if a majority of the applicants who decline say it was for financial reasons.",

Can you speak on behalf of your school saying if your school practiced yield protection and what they did with the questionnaire data? This process is designed to be so opaque so that the power imbalance heavily lies with the colleges so that students are practically powerless to speak out when colleges are doing unethical practices.\n\nYou say that this data isn\u2019t being used to weed our future classes, but colleges such as the [University of Wisconsin](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/14/colleges-quietly-rank-prospective-students-based-their-personal-data/) used confidential algorithms and online tracking to give students scores that predicted how likely they would accept an offer. Algorithms are trained by large data sets, and one must wonder where they get the data from if not the questionnaires. That same article describes at least 44 universities that do so, with only 3 with disclaimers that their data is being used in such a way.\n\nThe practices used [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/04/how-colleges-find-their-students/522516/) also show the ways colleges exploit student data, and just searching up \u201ccollege admissions data\u201d on Google brings up multitudes of articles on the subject. I think we can agree on the fact that schools are trying to increase yield, and one major way they\u2019re doing it is through unethically using student data. Therefore, I\u2019m skeptical of your claim that \u201cit\u2019s hard to imagine even a single school that even uses the alleged method to weed our future classes\u201d as it\u2019s going on right now.

Maybe some are, but you\u2019ll find a majority\u2019s goal is genuinely to find a good class of students and admit them.\n\nAs in what do they do with the data, my school sat down after admissions season and we brainstormed what we wanted to do better, and we gave a report to the board about what we found. Among that was those survey results. Those results were critical in my university establishing greater study abroad programs, increasing its international student population, and more.

It\u2019s very uncertain if we can trust colleges with our data which is troubling as we\u2019ll be spending the next 4 years learning and growing in these institutions. There\u2019s certainly no trust in the relationship, so colleges don\u2019t deserve the benefit of the doubt.\n\nYield is a priority for many colleges, as shown in the articles linked and [here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/college/2015/02/07/as-yield-rates-fluctuate-colleges-work-to-protect-reputations/37400469/), [here](https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-to-Persuade-Admitted/230007/?key=G2t2KgFtYSQSYntkZzdBMmoEOiA7YU91YSJAOilzbltQGQ%253D%253D), and so many other articles.
