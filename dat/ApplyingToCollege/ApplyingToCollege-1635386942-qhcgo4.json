  "text": "im almost done applying ED, and i\u2019m very happy with my personal statement. I am currently happy and safe. However, this dives into major abuse(having a parent knock a tooth out of my mouth), and I\u2019m worried that this will cause police or something like that, and i\u2019m worried it\u2019ll result in the arrest of someone who is now in a much better place and does not abuse anymore. This was many years ago and has been resolved, but i would really appreciate any advice. should i scratch this personal statement? will they report me?",

      "text": "Admissions officers in most/all states are mandatory reporters, just like teachers and high school administrators. We would need to report abuse, especially if a legal resolution or prior reporting isn\u2019t clear. I\u2019d recommend not writing about this unless you are okay with your school/police/child protective services getting involved and following up.",

I was mostly just speaking from my own institution\u2019s experience, so I don\u2019t think I can give you advice on how to phrase this to avoid involvement. Sorry.",
