  "text": "I got accepted into my first reach school in late March and was filled with unbridled hype \n\nFor like 3 seconds \n\nThen I pressed the financial aid button and they were charging me 70% of my parents' income. The hype? Slaughtered. I couldn't believe I got into one of these schools only for the financial aid office to take it away like a thief in the night. My first thought after 5 minutes of sulking was to appeal.\n\n And after a week of calling I figured out that the reason my cost was so high was because one of my real estate values was being estimated at 7x the actual worth because the university was using ZILLOW. ZILLOW. I wouldn't trust Zillow to estimate how many dollars something at the dollar-store cost but apparently this university did.\n\nSo I submitted the appeal with the official government value appraisal and thought everything was all good. \n\nThen Bam! \"We cannot appeal your aid\". After all that, they ignored the government value and went the way of the zillow.\n\nBut I didn't have much time to sulk on it because 1 hr later, ivy day got in and I got into...let's just say the best stem ivy. I was popping off hard but I realized there wasn't an aid letter attached to my letter. Turns out said school did rolling financial aid after admissions and I was chilling. But then I got an email from the financial aid office, not telling me my package but instead telling me something was missing from my aid application....which no other college called to ask me about.\n\nNo biggie I thought, Ill just submit it real quick and maybe get my aid late. Ngl, was getting kinda spooked. And then, I kept calling to ask when my aid would come out and if everything was received and well for 2 weeks and each time I received a message that said Yes.\n\nTWO WEEKS LATER I GOT AN EMAIL SAYING I WAS MISSING THE SAME DOCUMENT.\n\nAt this point I just thought they didn't wanna give me money. It was riding close to a date where I probably wouldn't get my aid before commiting and I was absolutely terrified. I thought I was gonna go into financial destitution or give up a spot at a college I worked my ass for and really wanted to go to.\n\nBut luck finally came, 3 days later I got my aid after submitting the document AGAIN and I actually got more aid than the NPC told me.\n\nNothing can scare me anymore. I have looked the god of death and capitalism in the face and survived\n\nTL:DR got big finaid spooks\n\nEdit: It was Cornell. Better not see any clownery in these comments \ud83d\udc7a. Princeton? Best stem? \ud83d\udca4\ud83d\udca4\ud83d\udca4\n\nBut thanks for all the upvotes and congratulations!!\n\nEdit 2: Also, the school that wants zillow info is Rice so good luck if you're applying there and like own a mansion on the side lol",

Stanford was the Cornell of the west -LOL.  As an institution, it' takes  \"any person, any study\" seriously...and that's a good thing.   Yale for instance did not admit women until 1969.  The first black greek organization was founded at Cornell in 1906 (they couldn't live on campus, but...) while Duke didn't have black students until  the 60s  (the architect who designed a lot of the campus couldn't go there).  Beyond that, it is an empirically excellent school in so many fields.\n\nfor me, the biggest downside is the location but the school is pretty young, and the real estate was probably a bargain at that point LOL",

With Cornell tho we all know it\u2019s a top school, an Ivy that\u2019s difficult to get into. So the jokes are less true than they would be for jokes against Podunk State, so making fun of it would be less hurtful. It\u2019s the difference between punching down and punching up.",
