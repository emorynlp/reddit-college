Is there anyone else who has experienced this and give me some advice?",

              "text": "Ohh gotcha. Those scholarship programs aren't super common so I didn't expect that! :) I will say that I have two pieces of advice:\n\n1. Find your community at your college. Especially if you're culturally connected to your heritage, be sure to join a club/student group related to it, like the Black Student Union or the Korean Students Association. You'll probably meet other students in similar positions as you.\n2. Facetime/Zoom with your family, and set up slots every week so you have it on a schedule with them, if possible. This structure provides something to look forward to, and if you have as crazy a family as I do, then having some sort of pre-agreed-upon schedule is really useful.",

Also, yes you will miss them, but you will be SO busy and challenged and loving your new place in life (at least most of the time!). After the first year or so, you will likely get decent summer jobs and internships, and be able to afford a couple tickets home, especially if you end up in a city.  It'll be better than okay, and you will end up with options that include deciding to come home for your career.",

Your dorm RA, even the housing office can give you great advice about things like shopping trips for toiletries, transportation issues, etc. I know at Brown, they have a program for minority students to arrive earlier than move-in day, to get acclimated. \nMost important thing is to reach out if you need anything. You can do this, and it'll be a great experience!",
