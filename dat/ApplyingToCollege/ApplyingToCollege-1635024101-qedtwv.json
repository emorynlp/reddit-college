      "text": "Advantages vary by school and by program for schools that have multiple different honors programs.   Usually it's some set of:\n\n* Priority registration for classes.\n* Special honors residence hall.\n* Special field trips or guest speakers.\n* Special honors-only sections of certain classes.\n* Special advising.\n* Opportunities to connect with faculty in informal settings (great if you're looking to glom onto someone's research group).\n* Some sort of designation on your diploma.\n\nPossible down sides:\n\n* Some programs require you to take some honors classes that aren't a requirement for your degree and that you might otherwise have been able to skip.\n* Some programs require you to do an undergraduate thesis or project.",

      "text": "There are three usual, general benefits provided by most schools.  \nYou will need to confirm these exist at your school:  \n\n* Early Access to Class Registration.  \n - DO NOT underestimate the value of this, especially at impacted/over-crowded schools where critical classes that everyone wants or needs fill up in the first 90 minutes of the registration period.  \n* Dedicated, experienced student advisors.  \n - Honors college students often push the limits of what can be done administratively to help them achieve their often aggressive academic goals. So this forces their advisors to really understand the policies for the school, and each college/degree track.  \n* Dedicated resources to assist you in the pursuit of additional scholarships / grants / exchange programs / research opportunities and so on.",
