  "text": "hi, im a highschool freshmen living in an extremely competitive area.  i want to major in something CS related (not sure what i want to do though). I am decent at most subjects, and I do lots of extracurriculars (plan to be officer of at least 2 major clubs). The problem is, math isnt my strongest subject. It's next to impossible for me to get an A in math (alg 2 trig) this semester... the first semester of highschool. I don't know what to do. What GPA do I need to get to get into a good college? How can I improve my work ethic? I fear that if I don't do well in math, my GPA will drop (my goal is a 3.95+ gpa) and it'll look especially bad considering I'm looking to do something in CS.",
