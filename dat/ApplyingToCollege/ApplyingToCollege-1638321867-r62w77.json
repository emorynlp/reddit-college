Their study abroad facilities are AMAZING.. I once talked to an international kid on full aid who had studied abroad 3 times!! Great research and internship opportunities.",

Objectively, Evanston does not have \"a lot of crime,\" and is almost universally considered to be safe.\n\nYou might as well argue that Stanford is not in a safe area because of the shootings/killings that occasionally happen in Palo Alto - one just a couple of months ago. Anyone who's been to either campus would tell you that's just not an accurate portrayl.\n\nIt's a terrible situation, and the larger issue of gun violence has a *lot* of nuance, but it's an America problem, not an Evanston problem.",
