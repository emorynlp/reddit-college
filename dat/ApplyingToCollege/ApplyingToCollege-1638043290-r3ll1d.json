  "text": "Hi,I'm in 12th grade this year and it finishes in July 2022. I want to study computer science in a good university but the cost for international students is expensive. I am not a very good student but average as I am sure I can get about 50 to 55% marks. I want a good university which has average ranking and in a good country(If not Europe then Canada or countries expect USA).     \n\n\nAny and All advice will be appreciated.\nThank you for your time",

      "text": "Your grades and course rigor are the most important factors when it comes to US admissions, so that'll be an issue when you look at the topmost universities, specially for CS which is highly competitive. That being said, there would be many other universities which would still accept you if you would be willing to pay the full price as an international student.",
