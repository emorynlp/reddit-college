  "text": "I got into my top choice yesterday and I am filled with this impulsive desire to share the good news with everyone, but I feel like if I was someone that got rejected, the last thing I want to see is one of my friends celebrating because she got in. So is it better to just keep it quiet for now and not tell anyone at school until someone asks me? I saw this post on Reddit ([https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/qqj01n/lpt\\_sometimes\\_its\\_best\\_to\\_keep\\_good\\_news\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/qqj01n/lpt_sometimes_its_best_to_keep_good_news_to/)) and I'm wondering if I should be telling any of my friends about my acceptance.",

      "text": "Congratulations on your acceptance!!!!!!!! \n\nHonestly, this application season has been hard for all of us. I was accepted in Ohio State last week and told my friend group about this. Most of my friends are genuinely happy for me. Some other girl who's not even remotely close to me even bought me boba drinks (sidenote: she also applied to ohio state but hasn't heard back from them). However, one of my friends whom I thought of as my bf for the past three years was actually upset. She told my other friend that I'm bringing pressure on her. In reality, she doesn't even like ohio state and did not even apply to ohio state either. \n\nMy suggestion is to do the things you want to do. Life is too short for us to care about everyone else's opinions. Anyone who's genuinely nice and decent would be happy for the good things that happened to their friends. Of course, I understand we are all just overwhelmed a little bit by this season and the difficult choices we have to make. However, this is what friends are for. \n\nAnyway, if you can't celebrate it with your friends in real life, come back to reddit and celebrate with us online folks!!",

It's good news.\n\nI would probably avoid volunteering the information to acquaintances and classmates with whom you are not close.  Then it just seems like bragging.\n\nIf asked, I would be honest about having been accepted.",

(Something my mom used to say is that the true friends aren\u2019t people who will only sympathize with you when you\u2019re down, but those who will truly also be happy when you succeed.) But I didn\u2019t post it on insta or talk to my classmates about it (and nobody asked), especially given my high school\u2019s environment. But if somebody explicitly asks, you may as well be honest because it could be awkward later if they find out you intentionally lied.",

If it\u2019s a friend you\u2019re worried about, wouldn\u2019t it be weirder to keep it a secret for a while?",
