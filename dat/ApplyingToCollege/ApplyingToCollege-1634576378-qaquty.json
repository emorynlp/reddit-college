          "text": "This is the answer. Need blind =/= they'll meet your full demonstrated need. A school can be need blind but won't meet all of your need if they admit you (Georgetown sounds like it does this). Conversely, a school can be need aware but meet the full need of every international student it admits (at least one top private school does this but I'm blanking on which). \n\nAs is stated often on here, there are only five schools that will do both if you're an international student.",
