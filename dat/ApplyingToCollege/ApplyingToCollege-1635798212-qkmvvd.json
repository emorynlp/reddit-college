  "text": "Sorry this is confusing but I wanted to list \"raised x amount of money for \\[enter organization\\] and \\[enter separate organization\\] \" in an activity description but I don't have enough characters. Can I shorten it to \"raised x amount of money for charities\" or do I need to name the charities specifically?? I'm not sure how I could fit the names in",
