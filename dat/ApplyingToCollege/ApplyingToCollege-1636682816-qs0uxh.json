  "title:": "Should I go to community college?",
  "text": "I apologize in advance if the organization of this post is a little messy or if I come across as overly anxious here. :)\n\nOriginally, I wasn\u2019t planning to apply to college at all this year but my father suggested that I do so.  I didn\u2019t want to apply since I haven\u2019t researched colleges at all before and I was worried COVID-19 messed up my work ethic. I then said that I might go to a community college to save money but then he said that I\u2019d be wasting all the hard work I\u2019ve done over my high school career and that it\u2019s better to apply for scholarships.\n\nMy UW GPA is a 3.7 and my weighted GPA is a 4.1, I\u2019ve taken (including classes I\u2019m taking this and next semester) 7 APs and 14 honors classes. The reason I bring this up is because I reallly don\u2019t want to feel like I did all this hard work for no reason. But at the same time, I don\u2019t want to apply to a college I did minimal research on and end up unhappy. I was thinking of applying to community college in Maryland and transferring to UMCP. I\u2019m just curious if this is the right decision, or if I should continue looking for a university to apply to. Thanks!\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention something very important! Since I live with my single mother in Maryland who makes less than $100,000, I qualify for free community college! While it\u2019s not guaranteed I\u2019ll get free CC due to limited seats, it\u2019s still a possibility!",

Actually, it's a great idea for someone looking to save money or stay close to home while still receiving a higher education. There are plenty of very smart and accomplished people at CCs all around the country for this very reason.\n\nNow, from the sound of it, you have accomplishments that may make you a competitive applicant at some more selective schools, perhaps such as UMCP. If you're interested in applying to a place like this, I think you should go ahead! It can never hurt to apply, and you may be pleasantly surprised by how things turn out.\n\nNo matter what, there's no such thing as a wrong decision, as long as you have a plan. If you have a way that you can make a career without having to even go to college at all, then that could even be an option! Best of luck to you, and I'm sure you'll thrive wherever you end up!",

      "text": "You sound like you worked really hard, so if it's a good option for you, then I think you should still apply to colleges! You can apply to community college as a backup plan and then research a few schools you really love that offer good scholarships as well. You never know the potential outcomes unless you try, and you can always decide later on that you don't want to matriculate. \n\nOf course, no pressure and if you decide that not applying this year is in your best interest, that's totally valid.",

      "text": "As u/Honest-Negotiation68 has said, CC is a very legitimate option and can help you save a lot of money. \n\nHowever, you mention that you're from Maryland and would be interested in transferring to UMD after 2 years of CC, so I'm assuming you've done some research into UMD and would want to go to there. Consider applying to UMD right now as a first year\u2014since you're in state, the tuition hopefully shouldn't be an enormous financial burden considering the income you listed.\n\nI would suggest looking into UMBC, too, and seeing if you might be interested in going there. If so, shoot an application to them.\n\nYou also still have over a month and a half until most application deadlines. That's plenty of time to research schools and complete applications. My suggestion would be to look into some more universities (especially the ones that meet 100% of demonstrated need-based financial aid, like the ones mentioned [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/colleges-that-offer-complete-financial-aid)) and apply to the ones you're interested in. If you don't get in anywhere that you want to go to, or that you can afford, then you can go to CC and transfer.",
