  "title:": "Question about how AO's view essay",
  "text": "So, I have a high gpa (4.8 weighted) and a decent amount of EC's compared to other applicants to UCLA and UCB. My essays are only decent however as my family can't afford professional editors and we have no college connections. My friend thinks that because of my high GPA, the AO's will expect more from me and cut me less slack, which will harm my chances. I, on the other hand, believe that they will cut me more slack due to my GPA and decent EC's, which will improve my chances. Does anyone have any idea on which could possibly be right?",

      "text": "Your essay is being compared (not directly) with folks with similar GPA ranges. So it should stand on its own. Secondly, UC uses UC GPA which does not go more than 4.45. Competitive UCs are more focused on how good your major preparation is and how rigorous the courses were. Third, college consultants usually make it worse - your raw authenticity is pretty much gone.",

      "text": "Almost all high tier schools quantify all aspects of the app. If your academics hit a threshold and maxed out,your essay among the rest of the sections will either help or hurt you depending on the numerical value you receive on them. It\u2019s why every single aspect is important. Generally however academics are weighted highest since its 4 years of work,so they need to be stellar",

It helps push a narrative of why you\u2019d be a good addition to campus.\n\nIt\u2019s not a creative writing competition, especially for the UC schools so don\u2019t feel like it should look like the flowery stuff that\u2019s sold online.",
