I just wrapped up an internship last summer with a Big 4 accounting firm, and I\u2019ll be returning with them next summer. And many of my friends have internships set up as well.\n\nI used to be a Math major, and I went to a lot of more technical recruiting events freshman year geared towards engineering majors and the like. Lockheed Martin has a huge recruiting presence among our engineering department, even big names like Google and Amazon drop by from time to time. \n\nOn the topic of big names, Goldman Sachs wasn\u2019t one I expected to see here on campus, but they\u2019re actually here every year (a small presence, but one nonetheless), and usually pick up a handful or two of students for internships/full time offers\n\nI\u2019ve never felt like anything I wanted to do was limited by having UA on my resume",

Usually there\u2019d be popcorn or drinks supplied (or you can bring your own snacks). They\u2019d always play fairly recent movies\u2014stuff that had released in theaters just a month or so prior. I\u2019m not sure if this is going on currently due to COVID\n\n- If you\u2019re at all interested in research, the [Undergrad Research Database](https://ua-app01.ua.edu/undergradresearch/public/). Profs who are looking for students to assist in their work sometimes put up postings here. If there\u2019s a specific prof/project you\u2019re looking to join it\u2019s still probably better to just email them, but I\u2019ve had a 100% response rate with applications through the URD\n\n- Burke Dining Hall \u2014 gets overlooked a lot b/c Fresh Foods is the \u201cbest\u201d dining hall and Lakeside is the big popular one right next to the dorms, but it\u2019s easily the most-consistent dining hall. You know the food\u2019s gonna be solid. Plus Steak Thursdays were always a treat. It\u2019s different right now cause of COVID, of course\n\n- Blount Scholars Program \u2014 it\u2019s a neat, quirky program where you take seminar classes. Topics range from CIA espionage tactics to creatures like Bigfoot. I interviewed with them but never ended up joining. The people I know that are in it have plenty of good things to say about it, and the application questions are fun\n\n- @uabathroomrates on Insta. Exactly what the name suggests; I find it amusing \n\n- There\u2019s a rock climbing wall in the rec",

After that it\u2019s mostly random pop ups here and there.\n\nOne of the big events is Get On Board Day where every club/org at UA sets up shop for potential new members. I signed up for anything that looked interesting and whittled my list down from there.\n\nSounds cliche, but a lot of friends I made freshman year were randoms who\u2019d come up to me in the dining hall or in the dorms.
