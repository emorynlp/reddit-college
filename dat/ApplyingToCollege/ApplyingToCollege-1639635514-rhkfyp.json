  "text": "Hi y\u2019all! So I am a HS senior with 26 college credits as of now, and I have took Chem 1 and Bio 1 both with lab. I plan on taking anatomy 1 with lab next semester and plan to major in biology on the pre-med track. Would it be a good idea to go into college with having to take 3 different sciences part 2(Chem 2, bio2, and anatomy 2)? I can\u2019t take chem 2 next semester since they\u2019re not offering it, and bio2 is through my high school.",

      "text": "hi! i\u2019m a HS junior also with 26 college credits (through DE and AICE) and on the pre-med track (bio major). when i got my degree audit my advisor didn\u2019t recommend anatomy after taking chm 1 and bio 1. she wanted me to do chem 2 and bio 1 in the semester following chem 1. then up the ante to organic chem 1 with bio 2 in the semester after that. i think she\u2019s smoking dick and therefore i\u2019m gonna take anatomy in the place of organic chem. so i think you should take bio 2 if your school offers it. it takes off a bit of the workload with taking all level 2s of those 3 sciences in college. \n\nfor me personally, i don\u2019t think it matters whether or not you go into college having to take the part twos of different sciences. depending on the college you go to, they might not even take those credits anyway so i think you should just do whatever makes you comfortable. if you know you can handle taking 3 different sciences\u2019 part 2 then go for it. if not, then that\u2019s okay and you should work at your own pace. \n\ni\u2019m kinda rambling here but my main point is, i recommend taking bio 2 while bio 1 is still fresh in ur mind. but chem 2 might be a little difficult in college because of the time gap between then and when you took chem 1. am i making sense or is this reply wack ?",
