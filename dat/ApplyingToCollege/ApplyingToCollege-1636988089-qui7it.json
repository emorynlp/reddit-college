  "text": "For biology major, there are two tracks. One is general and the other is pre-health track. I am more interested in human biology so should I go with the pre-health one? I am not sure I will attend med school after graduation. Can this work and match me with decent jobs if I decide not to study medicine? \nI tried searching in the college website, but didn't find what I am asking for and I can't email them as the deadline is today and I need urgent answers.",
