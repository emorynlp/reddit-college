  "text": "If I want to send updates of awards I got after I submitted my ED application, who do I send it to? Do I email regional AO's, the general undergrad admissions department, anybody else? I'm confused. For reference, this is for Georgia Tech, UMiami, and possibly Emory. \n\nAlso, is there a source of what I can say when I email them is it just \"hey I submitted my ED application but I wanted to notify you about this honor I received\"?",
