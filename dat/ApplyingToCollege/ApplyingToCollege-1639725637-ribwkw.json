  "text": "I got my Harvard REA result around seven hours ago, and everyone I've met since says they got deferred. I met a couple of guys who got in, probably because they attended prestigious STEM programs like RSI, SSP, etc. But I've yet not met anyone who was rejected.\n\nI know this may sound rude, but could someone who got rejected comment?",
