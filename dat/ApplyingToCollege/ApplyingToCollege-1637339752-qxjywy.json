  "text": "I somehow graduated a year early from high school and my mom wants me to go to prestigious unis out of the US for finance and economics, but all the good colleges want AB Cal and now I am forced to do the course over my gap year. It's a self study program and I am crap at it. I understand the basics but I am struggling with the more complex concepts without an instructor. Please drop some places I could find more resources that could help me understand concepts better. (I have given up on Khan Academy cuz my precal foundation is weak af cuz of the pandemic)",
