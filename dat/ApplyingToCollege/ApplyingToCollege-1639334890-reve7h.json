  "text": "While applying to Brown, I came across this question that asks me to report scores for subject-based national or international examinations that I have taken. However, other than the examples explicitly mentioned by Brown University, I am not exactly sure what is meant by subject-based national or international examinations. Should I include SAT Subject Tests', SAT Reasoning tests', and AP tests' scores as well, or should I only stick to the examples mentioned? Any help would be greatly appreciated!",
