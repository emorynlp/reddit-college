  "text": "So basically I didn't list 3 gold medals that I earned on the NLE on my Yale app, im applying as a molecular biology major so its not super connected but i did list some other latin stuff on there. Is it worth sending them an update that I earned these medals? If so how should I go about it?",

To do so,  go to your portal and there'll be a button where update application or sthg like that is written on it, just click it and check \"Extracurricular achievement\" and simply say that you forgot to mention that you have won 3 gold medals.",
