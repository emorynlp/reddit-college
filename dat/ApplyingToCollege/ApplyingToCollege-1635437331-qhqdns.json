You can typically get more financial aid this way, and you might even dodge some quotas that could make it harder for you to get in. \n\nI work with a lot of dual citizens here in Peru. Many have Italian passports, for example, and can pay less in Europe as a result. When they apply to Italy, they can avoid the limits on foreigners that apply to some programs in public universities. \n\nSimilarly, we've helped Peruvian-Americans apply to the US, and we always use their US passport. They can use the FAFSA that way and since their family earns a Peruvian wage, they tend to get a lot more in the way of financial aid.",
