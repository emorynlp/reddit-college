      "text": "Seasonal depression is a thing for some people and it gets pretty damn cold and dark here (sun sets around 4:30 nowadays) \n\nProximity to the city is overstated imo. Maybe I have different standards for proximity and public transit coming from Asia, but it takes so damn long to get to actual downtown and the cta is unreliable as hell sometimes (and it\u2019s somehow apparently one of the best in the US???) \n\nThis is a general issue at all top colleges, but there\u2019s a lot of rich people and the gap shows. It\u2019s only November and campus is chock full of people walking around in their Canada goose coats already. I came from a rich ass high school, but it\u2019s very noticeable, even for me. \n\nAdmin cares too much about trying to make UChicago like the ivies. I wish they would stop giving a crap about increasing prestige and decreasing acceptance rates. This also leads to UChicago pretty much only accepting ED1 and ED2 kids which sucks for most people, especially people with complicated financial situations \n\nSome dorms are really old and don\u2019t have elevators, which makes move-in super annoying if you\u2019re not on the first floor. The new dorm, Woodlawn, has some structural issues with gaps in walls and super thin walls and whatnot. \n\nIdk I could probably find more issues tbh if I kept going \n\n- a current UChicago student who loves it here but also recognizes it has lots of issues",

I was rejected UChicago ED last year. I was so crushed I couldn't get out of bed the whole day (mostly from the prospect of having to write a ton more essays for RD lol), but by spring when acceptances started coming in I had forgotten all about it. And now come to think of it, I think that rejection might have been divine intervention. I come from a very peaceful area so I would definitely not survive Chicago haha \n\nYou'll be fine even if you don't get in. You just gotta go where life takes you and enjoy the view along the way. I know how soul crushing admissions season feels, but once this passes you'll be able to look back on it with a chuckle.",
