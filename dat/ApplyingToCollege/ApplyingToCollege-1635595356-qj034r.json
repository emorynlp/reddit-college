  "title:": "This subreddit was one of the worst things to ever happen to me this app season.",
  "text": "Let me start off by saying that I absolutely believe in the goal of having a free and active space to ask questions about the admissions process. Many students don't have access to college advisors or have terrible school counselors or limited time to do deep research into different schools or all of the above, and this subreddit can be a great place for that.\n\nBut 99 percent of the time it's not.\n\nThere's a reason that the top posts of this subreddit and r/chanceme are sarcastic and mock its users. I know that everybody knows that there's a lot of self-congratulating and narcissism here, but to many of us those kinds of posts are more than just annoying. I've had panic attacks scrolling through this subreddit, internalizing my future rejections and the failure that I will become after high school. Objectively I know that college is not nearly that important but the people on this subreddit damn well make it feel like that. And I think that that's something inherent to the nature of this kind of platform (the discord is no better), which is terrible because this community has the potential to do so good.\n\nThe only thing I can think of to fix this without nuking the whole place is to place strict limits on what kind of posts and comments you can make to prevent the kind of circle-jerking that's so prevalent here. If you want to vent please feel free to comment your negative experiences with this subreddit and I hope that they can be addressed in the future. This subreddit attracts a particularly vulnerable group of stressed and anxious teenagers and I honestly feel like its doing much more harm than good. Feel free to disagree to if your experiences differ.",

          "text": "So I've always been curious, when people say they've never met any T20 people at their companies: is this because the company recruits overwhelmingly from a few schools/programs (either due to geographical proximity to offices, the presence of certain specialized programs that are absent at T20 schools, or because an executive went there), or does it actively select against T20 students?\n\nI thought maybe it was a numbers game at first--there's not as many people from T20 schools as there are from state schools--but 0 out of thousands seems really low if chance alone were involved. (Since your company's a leader in the industry and sounds decently big, I assume T20 graduates are applying.) If you meant just Ivy+ schools, as opposed to T20 schools, this would make more sense. But there are massive state schools like UCLA, UC Berkeley, UVA, and UMich Ann Arbor in the T20-T30 rankings, and so, so many more in the T50s.\n\nAnd of the people you've met, how many are from not-so-top state schools with highly competitive nationally renowned programs? For instance, if a company doesn't recruit from T20s, but they recruit overwhelmingly from UIUC CS, that's not really saying much given how competitive and highly ranked that program is.\n\nI really appreciate your input, and I'm not trying to undermine your point, but \"non-T20s\" and even \"state schools\" are such wide nets that they don't mean that much.\n\n>Lots of kids here in this subreddit are those annoying smart kids in class who know they got a 100 on the test but love to pout and say how hard the test was.\n\nQuite frankly, a lot of the kids in this sub don't get into T20s. This sub wasn't a big thing when I was applying to college, but it gives me pretty big College Confidential vibes. Though people did post about getting into Harvard or whatever, those people were often not regulars, and that big \"I got into xyz\" post was the only one they made. On the other hand, the people who posted constantly and were the \"annoying smart kid\" would fall short of those schools and end up going to their local state school more often than not.",

So less than 1% in ivy\u2019s obviously t20 is more but I\u2019m not about to go look at all those and get enrollment  numbers for each one individually. So numbers is some of it for sure. \n\nI also suspect in my company, there are probably a couple from T20 in the legal department but I just don\u2019t know them. \n\nI do think t20 would tend to skew heavily towards legal as a lot of those kids go to graduate and law schools. \n\nI work in the IT department and I know none of the directors and upper mgmt in IT went t20. \n\nLocation also has a lot to do with it. Our metro area doesn\u2019t have a t20 school in it or nearby either.\n\nIndustry as well. I live in Texas where oil and gas is king.

Because logically that shouldn't bother somebody, but many of us can misconstrue those comments, whether they were compliment baiting or actually honest, and develop inklings of impostor syndrome and general heightened anxiety. I do think the minority of people are actually trying to just \"flex\" but to a very stressed out group of young people, a lot on this sub can be very anxiety inducing.",

One forum for people targeting highly selective schools; another for people not targeting those schools.  The former would center around topics specific to selective admissions.  The latter would be a forum for general \"mechanical\" questions that are relevant to anyone applying to college anywhere.  I'd also moderate much more liberally.  You guys post some dumb shit sometimes.\n\nThe other issue with A2C is people repeatedly asking questions that are either:\n\n1. Unanswerable,\n2. Easily googled, or\n3.

Then again we do have flairs. \n\nI think the solution would be to just sticky a post that refers people to the wiki and to take everything you read here with a grain of salt. \n\nI mean tbf though, most people that stay on here (I always see the same \\~15 people on nearly every post) are here for the memes and shitpost wednesdays. If you're for genuine advice, then search your question, if it's subjective ask away, then leave. Advice is limited, memes are not.",

Initially, when I joined this subreddit, I came here thinking I would be able to clarify my doubts, since being from a lower income middle class family in a third world country, I did not have access to resources or opportunities others might have had. It took me a long time to get over the feeling of dejection for aiming for good schools with my comparatively weak stats. While I have no doubt gained extremely helpful tips from here, I have had also developed intense case of impostor syndrome, to the point where even if I do something fulfilling, I feel it is not enough.",

Something nobody tells you is that the mentality you see on here doesn\u2019t really go away after you get accepted somewhere. People have these idealized versions of colleges, especially elite institutions, and get very disappointed when they do not pan out. I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t be excited if you get accepted, or that people don\u2019t enjoy their experiences, but I do want people to take a minute to step away from the blinding lights of prestige.",

Nobody asks except the rare patient; they don't really care either but just are making small talk or are themselves interested in pursuing a degree in my field. \n\n-Before I got my advanced degree, I started my first job out of college with a few Ivy league grads. After introductions, nobody really talked about what school they went to unless it was a college-related topic of conversation.  Oh, and I ended up getting promoted along with one of them and we made the same amount (we were buddies so she flat out told me before I even asked). \n\nSo, as so many are noting, it's WAY less about the college you go to and WAY more about your experience, abilities (e.g. writing, interpersonal skills, your network, etc), work ethic and just plain luck!",

I don't think I'd be wrong in saying many people on this reddit come here for any sort of validation because of this. \n\nThis sub has also brought me down to earth. I know that I have strong stats and good essays but I've been reminded that there are thousands of other applicants out there and there isn't enough room for us all at a single top school. I am fine with that, because I know that my fellow A2Cers have also tried their best and I wish them success.\n\nJust piling restrictions on would ruin all of that. Saying that you can't post about your SAT score if it's above a 1550 takes away the ability of hundreds of redditors to share their excitement. Once again, this place may be the only one certain posters can actually vent to - I myself felt uncomfortable telling anyone at school and my parents' first reaction to mine was \"Not an 800 on the math score?\"\n\nSo in the end, there could probably be some mild rules to maybe guide the real narcissistic behavior more, but there really isn't much you can change without killing the true spirit of this subreddit.

Of course, I started this process knowing next to nothing, so for me, the reward far outweighed any negativity. \n\nI totally understand feeling anxious / panicky, but when I feel that way I don't check A2C. And if I encounter posts from people with way better stats that aim for way better colleges than me, I don't assign value or thought to those posts. I'm realistic about where I'm at and proud of what I've managed to do, so people who are on a different (higher) tier kind of. aren't important to me.

You have all these people who are like \u201cIvy or bust!\u201d without taking a second to really, *really* consider what going to an ivy (or any school of equivalent prestige, i.e. Stanford, MIT, etc) really entails. Sure, you might have great test scores, stellar GPA, and you might very well get into Harvard; but chances are you\u2019re not going to get a full ride, or much of a scholarship. Let\u2019s be realistic, maybe 5% of applicants will ever get that, and if you do get any aid at all you\u2019d be one lucky son of a bitch. Facts are 90% of people coming from out of state to these colleges are gonna end up paying full-price. Sure, you might have the bragging rights of being a Harvard grad, *but will it be worth it?* When you\u2019re $100,000+ in debt, will your degree in whatever the hell be worth it? So many people here are caught up in that American \u201ccollege culture,\u201d where the more name a school has the more they have to get into it, no alternatives. In doing this, they ignore far more economical options (or even ignore that college itself is not the only option, but that\u2019s another can of worms in and of itself) which *would* give them a path to still attend their dream colleges without having to sell and arm and a leg. This sub promulgates this ignorant sentiment to no end, and frankly it pisses me the hell off. How many people now, who will end up getting into Yale, Brown, Dartmouth, UPenn, or wherever, will get out of school in four years with their nigh useless \u201civy degree\u201d and be kicking themselves for putting themselves in insurmountable debt because they got it into their heads through this place that in order to succeed in this world is to get into the most prestigious school possible? The mindset of overachievement and \u201ccollege is the only way\u201d needs to be dispelled from this place, but frankly I don\u2019t think it ever will. This place could be a place to share resources to help us all achieve, but it ends up being a dick-measuring contest that does more harm to its regular users than good. /rant",

      "text": "My son refused to visit it or A2C when he was a junior/senior. I\u2019ve followed both over the last few years now anyway, as my other son is a hs junior.  I quickly figured out why older son would only get anxiety (his grades were rough 9th/10th grades while our family was dealing with some stuff-obviously affecting his overall gpa despite <3.5+ uw gpas in 11th/12th).  These subs have *me* anxiety.\n\nHis younger brother is an outstanding (nationally-ranked) athlete, and has worked hard for his 3.25 uw gpa.  These are still not subs for him.  They help to keep me, as a parent, on top of things he can be doing (SAT prep/score goals, ECs, awareness of the coming need for letters of rec, etc.) to help build his app and spend this time wisely.  But sending him here for motivation is not happening.  I do wish it were a more realistic community, but not every kid is motivated to post on Reddit about these subjects, so I kinda understand.",

      "text": "Hi! Sorry I\u2019m just seeing this. I\u2019ve been out camping this weekend and only had a couple brief chances to get some signal. I\u2019d like to go over a few of the points you brought up.\n\nI feel like perspective is important when discussing  this. While your post only vaguely touches on it, the comments here seem to have a focus on top students. So for reference, I\u2019ll give a quick background about where I am: I\u2019m a college student with first year standing at a community college. I\u2019m supposed to be a third year student, but I dropped out of a 4 year school after doing 3/4 of a year once covid hit and then took a year off before starting CC.\n\nTL;DR: I\u2019m nowhere near the level of the vocal people you tend to see on this subreddit.\n\nNow for some of the points you mentioned:\n\n> Many students don't have access to college advisors or have terrible school counselors or limited time to do deep research into different schools or all of the above, and this subreddit can be a great place for that.\n\nI\u2019m in agreement. I mainly applied to UCs and Cal States and never actually talked to my counselor. I also never really researched those schools and only applied for in state tuition. Knowing about my counselor as a resource would\u2019ve been helpful. \n\n> There's a reason that the top posts of this subreddit and r/chanceme are sarcastic and mock its users.\n\nI see the sarcasm, yes. Can\u2019t speak for r/chanceme as I don\u2019t really go on there, but I\u2019d say the userbase mocking is debatable for here. Sure, we do get a lot of fluff posts, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say a lot of them are targeted (or if they are, they typically aren\u2019t malicious).\n\n> I know that everybody knows that there's a lot of self-congratulating and narcissism here, but to many of us those kinds of posts are more than just annoying.\n\nI get the self-congratulating. That\u2019s part of why I personally push the results megathreads so hard. For both of the points you mentioned, our current ruling is that we allow it provided it isn\u2019t something that\u2019s putting someone else down\u2014although we do remove results posts in favor of them going in the aforementioned megathreads. If you do see a post that\u2019s putting someone down, feel free to report it under rule 1. The reason we allow these is because we group them in with fluff, which is typically defined as anything not directly related to college admissions questions. \n\n> And I think that that's something inherent to the nature of this kind of platform (the discord is no better)\n\nTo a degree, yes. For the most part, people looking to apply to non-top schools aren\u2019t as likely to frequent communities like A2C (although we welcome them if they choose to). There\u2019s also more competition for spots at top schools, so people feel the need to one up each other more. When it comes to the Discord server, I\u2019m the \u201cofficial owner\u201d of it, so if you have any suggestions that are more specific to there, feel free to let me know.\n\n> The only thing I can think of to fix this without nuking the whole place is to place strict limits on what kind of posts and comments you can make to prevent the kind of circle-jerking that's so prevalent here.\n\nMind elaborating on the circlejerking? Is it just the self-congratulating or anything else?",
