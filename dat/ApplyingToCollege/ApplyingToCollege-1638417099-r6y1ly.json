  "text": "I've seen [Qubit x Qubit](https://www.qubitbyqubit.org/programs) by the Coding School and [Quantum 101](https://www.qmunity.tech/quantum-101) by Q-munity. Are there any other courses and do colleges care if I take this course?\n\nI'm thinking of signing up for the Q-munity one since Qubit x Qubit apps are closed. Does anybody have experience with this one?",
