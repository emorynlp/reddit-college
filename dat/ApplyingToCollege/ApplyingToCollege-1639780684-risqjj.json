  "text": "I\u2019m applying as a CS major. Should I apply to Rice or Brown? I\u2019m mainly concerned with academics as rice is mostly medical focused. I like the intersection of computer science and biology so I like that aspect, though does Brown have a better CS department? I don\u2019t really like Providence but I don\u2019t plan to stay in Texas after undergrad. I want to move to Boston or the Bay Area for a job I\u2019m biotech, any suggestions?\n\nDisregard college life/fit/other stuff. I\u2019m fine with going to Providence or Houston, but I figured maybe it would be smarter to stay in Providence as it\u2019s closer to Boston. However I like that Rice has some applications of computer science in medicine which is one of the reasons I want to go.\n\nAny suggestions? I can only apply to one due to time restraints.",
