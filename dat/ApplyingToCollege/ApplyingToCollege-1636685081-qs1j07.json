  "text": "Specifically focused on schools with good engineering programs. No LACs please.\n\nI'm curious to hear from college students and college graduates who can speak to their experiences with accessing mental health services on campus, housing problem resolution/roommate mediation, tutoring and academic collaboration, disability support services, non-disability temporary issues (bereavement, parent in hospital, other family problems, etc.)\n\nWhich schools were really student-focused and the total package, and which schools were more focused on $$ and stats and talking a good game vs actually caring for students?",

Just assumed it was an impossibility.\n\n\"Favorite\" story:  it's around midnight and he's sitting on his bed studying...\n\nMe: \"Hey, could you move to the study room downstairs?  I'd like to go to sleep.\"\n\nHim: \"Nah.  If you're sleepy enough you can go to sleep with the lights on.\"\n\nMe: \"Uh...\"\n\nHe was right, though.  I went to sleep with the lights on.",
