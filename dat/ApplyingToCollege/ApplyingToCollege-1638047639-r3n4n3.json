                      "text": "Some clarifying points:\n\n> It's a misconception that all these business/finance majors go on to become high-powered Wall Street bankers. The reality is that the vast majority of people who get these jobs come from only the most prestigious colleges like Wharton at UPenn or Stern at NYU. \n\nNot only this, most people at these schools don't go into finance. While there's certainly some self selection going on (over half do go into finance/consulting IIRC), it's important to remember that there are people even at Wharton who do not break into banking who wanted to. But yes, target school status matters *a lot*. \n\n> For example, companies like Goldman Sachs or McKinsey & Company would take someone with a 3.0 from UPenn over someone with a 4.0 from ASU any day.\n\nMcKinsey is not finance. McKinsey is consulting. Consulting cares *way more* about GPA than ASU does. Without connections, that 3.0 from Penn has practically no chance of getting into McKinsey (at least for the NYC office.) One thing people miss is that spots are typically siloed out. McKinsey is not going to take 20 analysts from Wharton. When you apply as a student to a company that does OCR or considers you a target school, you're not competing against the general pool, you're competing against other students from your school. Also, on an individual company basis, the ratios for hiring are *insanely* low. [This is an anecdote for McKinsey](https://mipt.ru/upload/medialibrary/644/consulting-resume-cl-tips-by-victor-cheng.pdf) for example where the recruiting ratio was 6:400 for offers extended vs. applications, and this is @ Stanford, a target. Any individual company would boast similar rates of selectivity. I'm at Stern and we might be an IB powerhouse but you're only going to get like 5 or so IB analysts out of the hundreds that applied out of NYU. And that's normal. And then as mentioned in the link, the soft cut-off for Stanford students is roughly 3.5+. \n\nAlso, the second factor people miss here is that school name is the starting point. There are thousands of kids who come from target schools each year, far more than there are seats in any of these industries. Nobody is going to vouch for you on the basis of school name alone. The power of school name is it gives you an in with a large network of alumni that you can *reach out to* and *network with*. While school name can help a bit, it's this alumni network that is the real reason you go to these schools and the real reason why certain schools are targets. \n\n****\n\nLastly, the issue with IB/PE as a career comparison to SWE is it's a false comparison. The size of IB/PE is way smaller and it's a subset of finance. I've talked about it before, but someone who recruits mediocrely for IB ends up not being in IB. They typically take a related role such as Big 4 M&A Advisory, FP&A elsewhere, etc. and either break into IB later or don't break in at all (or get an MBA, retool, and break in). However, the same \"mediocre\" recruit for CS ends up at a less prestigious CS firm. Still doing CS, still making more money, etc. IB vs. other business careers is very bimodal, if you break into IB now, you can expect to make $150k+ starting TC. However, if you fail, you will be very unlikely to even break 6 figures starting. In comparison, CS starting salaries are on a gradient and someone who fails to get a Big N/FAANG offer doesn't suddenly make less than $100k. There are plenty of companies that will pay just a bit under (such as all the big banks for example.)",

Along with the fact that they are not making the \u201cdoctor\u201d salary until they actually get the legit doctor job which is many years after undergrad, and many lawyers don\u2019t see the stereotypical lawyer salary for a few years even after landing a job as an entry-level attorney.

Therefore having much much less debt. An engineer will usually be able to start at a decent pay-rate and pay off their debt before it accumulates too much interest. Many engineers will see six figures and financial stability before their 30s.

In medicine/law you have to finish undergrad, go to law/med school, do a grueling clerkship/residency, and then you can finally start making 200-300K/year. And both during your clerkship/residency and the beginning of your career, you're working 80+ hours a week and you have absolutely no life outside of that.\n\nOn the other hand, in CS you can easily start off at 200-300K/year straight out of undergrad, with decent hours and work-life balance too (and if you're good at math you can go into quantitative finance and start at 400K+). Not to mention the upside is much higher in CS- you can always start your own company potentially make millions overnight (and if you fail you can always try again), while starting your own medical practice or law firm has much more limited potential.\n\n>CS has this issue as well, fwiw. Lots of folks in tech wondering, \"What the point?\" I'm not convinced lawyers and doctors are significantly less happy than your average code monkey or eng manager.\n\nThe main thing is that working hours in law/medicine are much more intense. Someone who works 80 hours a week in a job they aren't passionate about is probably a lot more miserable than someone who works 40 hours a week.",

Is it *possible* to start out at that level?  Sure.  For a relatively small % of all grads.  Median is way, way less.\n\n>The main thing is that working hours in law/medicine are much more intense.\n\nIt depends.  For medicine, yes, during residency, then it becomes more reasonable.  For certain specialties potentially less than 40 hr/wk.  For law, yes, until you make partner, but there are paths that don't require that.  In house counsel, e.g.  Also worth considering the hours software guys put in working at bay area startups.",

But experience definitely trumps the advanced degree in engineering, so it\u2019s really not as justified to go through the debt and years without pay for an advanced degree in CS\u2014as opposed to law, med, academics, MBA, etc.\n\nIt can still obviously strengthen your application to have the title of a PhD, but in the engineering world a bachelors with 4 years of experience at a reputable company is going to be better for hiring (in a typical non R&D company\u2019s eyes) than a fresh PhD.",

                      "text": "I don\u2019t know why anybody would think that a doctor or lawyer is a much more straightforward path to a lucrative career than an engineer, unless they are only looking at this from a \u201cwhoever\u2019s average salary is greater\u201dperspective. Maybe you could explain your point of view?\n\nI\u2019ve already said this a few times and don\u2019t mean to annoy you by saying it again, but: doctors and lawyers go through much more school, and therefore they accumulate significantly more debt and have less overall years worked in their career. Even though the doctor\u2019s BLS salary numbers are higher they will have less lifetime earnings than an engineer until their mid 40s. Even then, it depends on the medical specialty, amount of debt, longevity of education and age of completion, etc. I have family members who are doctors. I used to idolize becoming a doctor and they all told me (somewhat jokingly though) to never go into medicine because of the debt and crippling stress.\n\nSure, an honors student can get a full ride at undergrad. But the med/law school debt still stacks up a lot.\n\nThere\u2019s also the mental health factor: even though they will likely end up retiring with considerably more, it\u2019s really not advised to go into medicine unless you have the passion to push through its obstacles. It\u2019s a gross, stressful, job where you will be working long hours with few days off. The money can\u2019t justify most of these negatives. Being a lawyer is also a stressful job, with notoriously narcissistic and miserable coworkers and bosses. Engineering has its bad people and places, but I don\u2019t hear about as many suicides and addictive drug and alcohol use among top tech companies when compared to big law and specialized doctors (maybe it exists more though? idk)\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019d say to someone who only wants to think from the monetary perspective:\n\nIf you want to live your 20s and 30s(which is usually when money is most idealized) with good money and retire with a very good amount, then become an engineer.\n\nIf you want to live a more stressful life with debt until your 30s, and then retire later with more money than the engineer, then become a doctor or lawyer.",
