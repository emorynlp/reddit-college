Everyone is saying berkeley in state (where you pay 10-20k a year), but I am considering why I myself am trying to make overpowered extracurriculars if I am not getting into HYPSM in the first place (since i am an asian male in the bay area)? Why should I settle for vandy or NU and pay HYPSM tuition there? Berkeley is good, im probably in there or LA for L&S. I wanted the rationale from other people. Why and in what way is NW worth significantly more than berkeley to warrant an extra 30k in tuition yearly?",

But if you were to give me 250k to spend on an education, basically making college free (and which is the entire premise of your question), then yeah I'd choose the option that has, in my opinion, the best mix of prestige, opportunities, and fit. For me, Northwestern comes out on top in this equation due to personal preference.\n\nI can't speak for Vanderbilt but Northwestern and UChicago are both T10 schools with nationwide recognition. Berkeley is obviously great, but it's a grad-focused research institution and is humongous compared to those two.\n\nBut if you wanna go to Berkeley, that's great. It's your life and choice, if you're able to get in. No one's forcing you to go anywhere else!",
