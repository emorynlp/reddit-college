  "text": "I applying as a transfer student to some colleges including RIT, Georgia Tech, RPI. This is because now I want to change my major, and my current college is an Art school which does not have the area I want to pursue. I\u2019m using Common App. \n\nI believe I do have a solid story to write about for my personal essay which shows my character and strengths.\nHowever right now I think I am stuck because I want to change my major too and don\u2019t know if it will be as easy for me.\n\nIf anyone has applied and been accepted to colleges, please give me some advice or share how you got in. I really want want my essay to be stellar and effectively show my strongest character traits. Also should I include extracurriculars and activities from high school? I have some experiences during high school that I know will boost my application.",
