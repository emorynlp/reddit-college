I told them that once all this college application nonsense is over, we are spending their Spring semester learning to drive and getting the damn license. \n\nI don't want to sound boomerish, but this Gen X mom is tired. When we were kids, we were READY for the license at 16. We didn't have cell phones or computers, so the only way to see your friends was to work a shitty part time job and save up to buy some wheels. Didn't matter if it was a beater with no power steering - it was freedom.\n\nI'm busy. My middle name isn't Uber. Y'all need to learn to drive. \n\n(Obviously this does not apply to international students or people who live in urban areas with ample mass transit. You do you.)",
