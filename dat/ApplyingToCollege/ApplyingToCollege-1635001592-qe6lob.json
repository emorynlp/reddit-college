In fact, I got like 6/20 on an exam. I eventually sat down and worked my way up by trying to understand how the math worked and grinding Khan academy. In the end, I managed to get an A from the final. I still use this sort of technique when I struggle with this kind of stuff. Just try to relax, take it slowly, and focus on yourself. Once it clicks, everything will be easier.",
