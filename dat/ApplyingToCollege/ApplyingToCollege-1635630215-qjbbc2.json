  "text": "What are some suggested Universities for a Finance major that can't spend an arm and a leg? I don't qualify for much if any financial aid but my parents are not paying for college or anything after I'm 18 so I need an option that I can actually afford.\n\nOr some that have good merit scholarship opportunities? I have a 4.0 UW and 4.66 W and my SAT is 1340. Also have decent but not special EC's.\n\nJust looking for some suggestions. This is what i'm applying for currently:\nUni of Oregon,\nUni of Washington,\nUCSB,\nUCI,\nIndiana Tech, \nUni of Minnesota, \n\nnot sure what else to add but any help would be great!",

Dixie State. Assuming that a 1360 SAT is about a 28 ACT, you would qualify for 4 years of tuition with their Presidential Scholarship [https://scholarships.dixie.edu/non-resident-freshman-scholarships-2/](https://scholarships.dixie.edu/non-resident-freshman-scholarships-2/) . It's in a WARM locale and not too far from Vegas....",
