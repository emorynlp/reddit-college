  "text": "(The situation is hypothetical, but possible given my school)\n\nDue to covid, nobody was returned any papers after an exam, and my school won't let me see my grade 11 papers (my only grade 12 paper was early in the year and not good). Since I can't see my past papers, can I write one and ask my English teacher to review it as if it was an exam and submit it?",

We will still give applications submitted without graded papers a full review and make an informed decision about their writing ability with the available information in the rest of the application.\u201d",

      "text": "I bet you could talk to a teacher and work with them to revise it before you submit it. I submitted a microecon paper but worked with my teacher to revise it before I submitted it because there were a few suggestions he had. I would say just contact your teachers and maybe work something out with them if you anticipate this being an issue",
