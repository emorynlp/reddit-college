  "text": "hi guys. first off, the APs are really expensive - around 300 dollars per subject in my area. \nsecondly, my school does not offer AP courses/classes. \nthird, and i\u2019d like if someone could confirm this - unless you take a lot of APs, you\u2019re generally not given any credit?\n\nmy whole aim is to have an edge for college applications - no matter how minute. i do not want to take the APs just because i may have some advantage in college. \n\nall this being said, can someone suggest an alternative to taking the APs in India?\nsomething to prove that i can take college level classes / can handle extra work load? basically something that creates a similar impression in the heads of an admission officer like the AP does? and ofc something that\u2019s cheaper/free.\n\nthank you.",

      "text": "First of all, it is absolutely not necessary to take APs, colleges will evaluate you based in what was available to you. \n\nIf you still want to take some college level coursework, I would recommend to try out Dual Enrollment. I am also from India and thats what I am doing. I think in most colleges, you can take 3 classes per quarter/semester for completely free.\n\nAnd also I think these classes are not offered anywhere in India, so you have to take them online, it can be a bit of a pain because of  time differences\n\nThis is the college I am considering (it runs on a quarter schedule)\n\nhttps://www.deanza.edu/admissions/dual/\n\nI also think that this is slightly better than self studied APs because instead if just cramming for a 3 hour test, you have taken a class for 10-12 weeks and have an actual grade to show to the colleges",

      "text": ">third, and i\u2019d like if someone could confirm this - unless you take a lot of APs, you\u2019re generally not given any credit?\n\nthat's false, but everything else you said was right. credit policies at a competitive university may require a more competitive score (maybe a 4 or just a 5), but many universities will accept 3+. one other thing regarding ap credit, is that they often don't apply to what you're majoring. i self-studied ap world and got a 5 (self studying is doable, I'm in a similar situation as you) but if i were to major in history, i likely wouldn't get credit.\n\nif you can take a-levels (assuming they're cheaper, which they probably would be with the Cambridge system in India), that would work, but there are some significant differences between the exams",

              "text": "i don't know too much about a-levels, but i know some... for example in UK admissions, competitive scores typically range from AAB to A*AA. the equivalence (according to different UK universities) is around 4-5 5's in AP exams, sometimes along with like a 30+ ACT. a-levels are taken after sixthform (gcse's), then students pick 3, sometimes 4, subjects to focus on for about 2 years and take the A levels\n\nI'm gonna take a few more ap exams this year as im still in college but if i do well i hope to reduce general education courses in colleges or apply to some UK universities",
