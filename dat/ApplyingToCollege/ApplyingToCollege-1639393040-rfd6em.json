  "text": "Hi, I am an Indian student who is currently studying in isc board. My question was regarding how much variation can there be in your predictives to still be accepted. For instance, if I have a predictive score of 90-95 and end up scoring between 80-85 will the college rescind their offer. Given the fact that the overall percentage in boards is still 90+.I am asking this because I just had chemistry and that went very bad. If it helps I am pursuing an engineering major.",
