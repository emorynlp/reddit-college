  "text": "I'm a junior, and I have a B/B+ in calc right now. Its been kind of tricky because I skipped pre calc(took over the summer), since I plan to take multivariable calc in the summer and linear algebra next year. I know its not that bad, but since I generally get A's, it hurts my gpa a lot since only 6 classes count to it because I'm doing dual enrollment. Anyways, do you think colleges will recognize that my grades aren't the best because I skipped a year?",

Go on a hike, take a day trip somewhere, etc, without having to worry about homework. If your school offers MV during the school year, I think you could do other things with your time in the summer. There is no such thing as \u201csummer break\u201d ever again once you finish college so enjoy that freedom while you have it.",
