  "text": "I'm in 12th grade and I want to study game development in the future. I was looking at The Netherlands universities and I saw that Hanze UAS and Saxion UAS are using Unity so I assume they also use C#. I've been learning Unreal Engine for a year now and I really like it. I don't want to give up on it and start learning another engine. Even though I'm using blueprints in UE I also know some C++. I don't know how related C# and C++ are. \n\nAre there any universities in Europe that use Unreal Engine as the \"study\" engine?",
