  "text": " I want to take a gap year but I am not sure if I should apply to my schools this year or the next.\n\nMy chances will probably be better next year by a lot but of course, getting in now would put me in a really comfortable position. I do not want to apply this year if they will throw my application right into the bin next year, though. Does someone have experience or knowledge on this?",

      "text": "i was in the same situation, i applied last year (knowing i was gonna take a gap year) and now im applying again. doing the apps process twice is not a great idea in my experience, i recommend not applying rn and wait till after ur gap year. you\u2019ll have more experiences and your entire view of what you want in a school/major might drastically change (mine did!) if ur gonna take a gap year anyways might as well give yourself the flexibility :)",

          "text": "i agree with this but only if it applies to you! i applied to schools last year during a very transformative period of my life. i didn\u2019t know who i was and i didn\u2019t know how to represent myself in an application because of that. i didn\u2019t get in anywhere (and i have a 4.5/1550), so i had to take a gap year and reapply. outside of school i became so much more comfortable with myself and how to express my quirks to others. i am in such a better place to apply this year. my essays are 100x better than last year and i have a chance at some of the schools that were my dream schools last year. if you don\u2019t think a gap year would help you in the process of developing more into your complete self, maybe apply this year and defer enrollment.",
