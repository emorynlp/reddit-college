      "text": "Schools look at the mid-year report for RD and possibly ED2. The mid year report is submitted in January with your first semester grades.\n\nUChicago will not see mid year reports before ED1 and EA decisions are made. If you are accepted, UChicago would see the mid year report afterward, in January, to make sure you're still on track. (Don't worry, you will not get your admission offer rescinded for three Bs.)\n\nBe careful not to confuse the mid year report with a first quarter, or first marking-period, grade report. Some highly-selective schools ask for that for ED1/EA, though certainly not most.",
