I\u2019m taking calculus rn at Georgia Tech and every homework problem would be the equivalent of the \u201cchallenge problems\u201d in my AP calc class. That being said, as a college student living on campus, I have so much more time to learn and study so it\u2019s easier to learn the material itself. If you asked high school me to do the work I\u2019m doing right now, I might die, but college me is learning more and doing better than high school me ever could.\n\nAlso, being surrounded by a bunch of people who actually want to learn and are excited about their major really helps. Study groups are so much more beneficial and the amount of free tutoring services on campus is great.",

High school doesn't really expect that kind of rigour from students, unless you go to a fancy college prep school (and those aren't a thing where I'm from)",

I failed the class but passed the AP exam (meanwhile, my classmates passed the class but failed the AP exam). It only counted towards elective credit in my college, so I took Stats again in my freshman year and it was sooo much easier that, despite the extra coursework, I passed with an A+ . I'd say, ultimately, it really depends on your teacher. My college Stats professor was amazing at teaching that the extra rigorous coursework felt more of a breeze compared to in high school when it felt like hell.\n\nI also took AP Lang, AP Lit, AP Gov, AP Econ, and AP World History, and AP US History. I passed them but, overall, my college courses were easier (for the most part) compared to my AP classes. I chose my professors carefully and asked senior students for the experience beforehand. The material was harder in college but how well the professor teaches you is one major factor that affects how rigorous the course is for you. I had a professor who *bragged* about how 95% of his class fails (which was true) because he liked to \"weed out the weak\" but, really, he just sucked at teaching that the course was more difficult than it should have been. So that's why I think it depends.\n\nEdit: When picking your professors, check out how students have scored them on RateMyProfessor.",
