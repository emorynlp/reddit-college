  "text": "Let\u2019s say I got into a super elite school (not that I will lol, just hypothetically). Would they rescind me for a C second semester? Or getting straight B\u2019s? What does it take? Would they rescind me for dropping a class? \n\nJust curious, not planning to flunk all my classes (knock on wood).",

      "text": "The rule of thumb is to avoid Ds, Fs, or felonies.\n\nIt is extremely unlikely that a super elite private university would rescind for a single C. Or straight Bs. However, some may have a reputation for issuing scary warning letters.\n\nSome public universities may have different criteria that is more strict (UCs).",

      "text": "Assuming a student profile typical of a super elite school admitted student (straight As, no disciplinary problems), here is a non-exhaustive ist of things that could get you rescinded: \n\n- Straight Bs (rescission very unlikely, but possible)\n\n- Multiple Cs or worse\n\n- Significant crimes (felonies, certain misdemeanors)\n\n- Academic dishonesty\n\n- Really, really bad shit on social media that becomes big enough that the school finds out about it\n\n- Major dishonesty on your application\n\n- Major school disciplinary action\n\nDon't do these things.",
