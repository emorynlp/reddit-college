  "title:": "Withdrawing UPenn Wharton ED",
  "text": "Is it possible to withdraw a Wharton ED application? Long story short: my dad checked the ED button that my counselor then sent my materials for. Basically, I didn't make the active choice to apply. I told my counseler I would check the ED box later that night. During that night, I intended that I would use it as time to think. As it turns out, my dad (thanks a lot :/ ) clicked the ED box through my common app account.\n\nI don't want to be binded to wharton though, and I have a pretty decent shot at getting in.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nIs it possible to withdraw a Wharton ED application  without ruining my chances there?\n\nIn the penn applicant portal it says there's a withdraw application form but I'm not sure if that applies to ED or not? \n\nSomebody pls help :(",
