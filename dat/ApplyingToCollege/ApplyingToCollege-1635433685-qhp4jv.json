Moral policing everywhere, our school skirts cannot be above our knees!! What's the point of a skirt? Make us girls where pants in hot scorching Indian summers???   \n\n\nAnd when boys declare their state of misery, wearing coudroy pants in summer (5th grade and above, shorts till 5th grade) that, THAT teacher, uugghh, mockingly tells them to try wearing a skirt!!",
