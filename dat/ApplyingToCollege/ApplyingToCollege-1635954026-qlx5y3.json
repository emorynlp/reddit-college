  "text": "Next semester I am dropping a class for late arrival. I have used Common App, ApplyTexas, and two universities' unique portals for applications. I have been accepted into two out of the seven schools I applied to. I have had to do two SRAR's, one on Common App and the other in a university website. How do I notify schools of a schedule change?",
