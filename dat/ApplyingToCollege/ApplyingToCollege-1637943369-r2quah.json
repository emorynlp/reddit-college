  "text": "I didn\u2019t have any bad things that affected my life much. (No health issues no death no mental health problems and no issues with family business or anything) so do I have to write the Covid essay? One of my friend wrote about hobbies and interests he developed during Covid so is that a good thing to write or should I leave it blank???",
