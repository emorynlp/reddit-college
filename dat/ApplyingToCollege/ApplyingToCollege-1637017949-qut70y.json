      "text": "Hi, I live less than 1.5 miles from GWU's campus, and my dad worked for GWU for 10 years when I was younger. I'd love to give you some pros and cons, and then unique factors that could be a pro or con depending on your preferences.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n1. **Great location in Washington, DC.** So much to see, eat, shop, and explore nearby. You've got amazing hiking in Great Falls just twenty minutes away, and wonderful running and biking baths all over the DC area. Very diverse city and very progressive & accepting.\n2. **Wonderful internship and career opportunities**, especially if you want to go into something like international relations, public policy, environmental policy, lobbying, government contracting, defense, or anything that relates to the government. And Northern Virginia has something called the tech corridor, with so many software/technology companies stretching from DC all the way out into Loudon County.\n3. **You truly experience all 4 seasons.** In winter, DC gets down to the high 20s and low 30s for a few months. It's beautiful with all the snow. In spring, the cherry blossoms come out, and so do millions of tourists from all over the world to come to the Cherry Blossom Festival. In summer, DC is hot and humid, but super lively and active. So much music, food, and activity all over the place. In fall, DC is really pretty as well; the falls here are mild and pleasant.\n4. **Amazon HQ2 is coming in just 8 minutes away from GWU.** This is going to bring in lots of opportunities in the tech industry.\n5. **Great if you want to be politically active.** Protests, rallies, and marches happen seemingly every day.\n6. **Wonderful public transportation.** With the metro, you can take the train all over the DC area, to Nationals games, to Tysons mall, or even into Maryland.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. GWU does not meet 100% of demonstrated financial aid, and their financial aid is not the best. Some people seem to luck out and get generous packages, while others do not.\n2. GWU has no \"real campus\" aside from their Mt Vernon campus a few miles away, but that doesn't really count honestly, because you probably won't spend a lot of time there. The campus is basically a cluster of buildings. It's nice, but not that traditional college-y feel that you'd find at American or Georgetown.\n3. DC is expensive. The cost of living is high, home/apartment prices are high, and it's expanding rapidly.\n\n**Unique Factors that could be Pros or Cons:**\n\n1. At least when I toured 2 years ago, they didn't have a classic dining hall. They instead had food courts with all sorts of food (Chick-Fil-A, etc) and students get food there.\n\n\\-----\n\nBest of luck! GWU is an awesome school & I'd definitely apply if I didn't live less than 2 miles away lol. :)",

              "text": "Yeah, I'd say it's like a mix of BU and NYU, but better, and here's why:\n\nThere's some courtyards, and a quad or two, similar to BU. **Better,** because the campus is in a walkable cluster instead of in a mile-long stretch down a busy road.\n\nIt's really close to the National Mall, which is a huge park with walking/running paths, the Washington Monument, and various memorials, similar to how NYU is near Washington Square Park. **Better,** because the National Mall is larger and grassier, so there's more room for it to feel like an actual park/field, instead of a Washington Square Park, which is super crowded.",
