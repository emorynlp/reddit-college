  "text": "I applied EA to University of Vermont with pretty good stats, but I'm still super anxious I won't get in. I never build things up or get excited for stuff usually, so it's very new for me to be this excited about possibly going there, but I'm constantly sitting here self-doubting myself until December 17th. \n\nIf I don't get in, with how much I've already excited myself, I'd be absolutely crushed.",

      "text": "As long as you have like a 3.5 with a 1300 or whatever the ACT equivalent is (and I\u2019m assuming you do or something close at least since you say you have pretty good stats) you got a very high chance at it. It\u2019s a very solid school but it accepts 2/3rds of its applicants so there\u2019s no need to stress too bad over it. It maybe could help to find a school with similar features that you like that\u2019s slightly less selective (70+% acceptance)? But you really should be fine",
