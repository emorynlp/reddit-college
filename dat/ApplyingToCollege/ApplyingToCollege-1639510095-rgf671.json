  "text": "So Barnard says applicants are eligible to waive the English proficiency requirement if they\n\n* Earned one or more of the following subsection scores:\n   * 700 or higher on the Evidence Based Reading and Writing section of the redesigned SAT (beginning in March 2016)\n   * 29 or higher on the English or Reading sections of the ACT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was able to take the ACT only once, and it was the first time I ever saw the test, so I got a 30 in English but a 21 in Reading and the overall score was quite low as well. Can I self-report just the 30 in English? Has anyone done this?",
