  "text": "All year I\u2019ve been telling myself it\u2019ll get better. The quarter is going to end in about a month, though, and by my calculations, the highest I could possibly get in the class is an 82. My teacher has a stick up her ass 24/7 so if I ask her if there\u2019s anything I can do to bring the grade up, I doubt she\u2019d say yes. \n\nY\u2019all please give me some advice. I can\u2019t drop the class, nor do I want to. I want to learn this stuff, but I just know my semester mid year grade is gonna be shitty asf. \n\nI do all the practice quizzes, optional homework, actual homework, I study, I fucking bought princeton review\u2019s homework help program, I have another tutor, and khan academy and organic chem tutor. I don\u2019t understand how people are surviving this class. \n\nIt makes me feel so dumb. But I really don\u2019t know what else to do to bring the grade up \ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "This may not help, but I\u2019ve learned that over time classes would usually just \u2018click in place\u2019 for me. It may take longer for things to click though. I would also analyze where you are making mistakes, such as if they are silly or conceptual. I think a problem is that sometimes people can memorize computational processes but not the ideas, and then they can\u2019t apply that to problems which look slightly different. This may be the case for you.",

      "text": "I know you may have already tried this, but the first option I always explore is studying with other students who are doing well. I would learn how they studied, what they thought was more important, how they approached solutions, etc. The trade-off for them is that when they help you learn, they actually end up solidifying their own knowledgebase. Anyway, I figured since you can\u2019t get afterclass help from your teacher it seems the next best source are the kids who are ace\u2019ing it.",

Approach her and ask if you can get extra help after class. Don\u2019t ask what else you can do, ask her for direct help. \n\nI know a lot of crusty people of which others pass around an assumption about that person. But often when you are able to crack the shell, the person underneath isn\u2019t all that bad.\n\nGood luck!",
