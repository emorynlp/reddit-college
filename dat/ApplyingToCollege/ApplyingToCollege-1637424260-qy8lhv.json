Also in most schools there is minimum grade requirement for student council so how come you are the president with these grades. I don't mean to offence i am really curious as an international student.",

          "text": "Hey, I can understand, but I was genuinely dismayed by my 9th-grade result. Therefore, I decided to work hard from there onwards. However, I was surrounded by spoiled kids, so I finished that grade partying, playing, and with my GF as well. Also, I was famous in my school and among teenagers and had thousands of followers on insta. Anyways, at the starting of my 11th grade, I decided that it was enough, and I gave up 'everything': even my social media handles and my GF as well. After that, I just disappeared into the thin air. I even handed my phone to my parents. So, this was my journey in short.",
