I was supposed to be in AP English in 10th grade but it got cancelled since there was only 2 other people besides me.\n\nSocial networking? If you want to be successful in a school like this you are alone. Not many peer groups care to even graduate. Most kids have no aspirations beyond dropping out as soon as possible and getting into manual labor. Or dropping out as soon as possible so they can do lots of drugs and party every weekend. Success (if it involves anything beyond HS) is not a discussed topic among students in these schools.\n\nIf you want to be academically inclined as a poor kid, it feels like the entire world is against you. And finally after all those years, I can pick my head up for the first time, and see the light at the end of the tunnel, finally colleges are opening up to less fortunate folk, and some of the snotty rich kids on this sub have the audacity to say\n\n \"poor kids have it so much better\"",
