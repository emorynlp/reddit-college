  "text": "Hey guys I was just deferred from Yale. After a bit of tears I\u2019ve recollected myself and now i am preparing to see what I can do or say to help my chances out in regular decision. One major thing was that one of my teachers finally got around to writing a letter of recommendation for me. I absolutely love this teacher and I know he brings something new that the other two recommenders don\u2019t have. Thing is Yale only requires two and I\u2019ve seen that it isn\u2019t encouraged to send a third. I don\u2019t want to come off negatively when they review my application again, so should I submit this letter or not? Has anyone been in a similar situation?",
