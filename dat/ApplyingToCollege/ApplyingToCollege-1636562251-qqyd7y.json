I sent a reminder back again early this month, deadline btw is the 15th of December and i\u2019m just so freaking terrified my professors will bail on me even though i emailed them beforehand to write a lor and they all agreed. What happens if the deadline is here and i only have one letter? I don\u2019t know what to do i keep stressing about it and it\u2019s making me depressed and lose sleep\ud83d\ude1e",
