  "title:": "I wrote my personal essay... on McDonald McNuggets",
  "text": "I honestly love it so much but everyone around me tells me not to write a personal essay on McDonald McNuggets. It starts with Mcnuggets but goes on to show my personal growth. I'm very new to the college process. Would college admission officers think that an essay on McDonald McNuggets is unprofessional? I have another essay written just in case but it's so boring.\n\nPS: I'm applying to a state school with 50% acceptance. I'm confident I'll get in but would this kind of essay affect a chance of admission?",

This year is test-optional, grades and ec's are a fucking confusing mess. Have fun! go crazy! anything is possible",
