  "text": "Hi, I'm EDing to Duke. My deadline is today. Their website just says: Two Teacher Recommendations *(will accept through November 20)*\n\nMy counselor has told all my teachers that they can submit their recs late, after Nov 1st. I'm submitting my app today and did not know of this. I contacted my teachers today thinking they've done all their work, but they're saying they will submit it next week. Even my \"Other\" recommender is doing this.\n\nIs this a problem, since I have a 3rd recommender and an Other one? I'm very stressed.",
