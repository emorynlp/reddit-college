      "text": "Depends on what you want in a school and what you want to study.\n\nI would usually suggest schools that have auto admissions policies if you qualify - that way you aren't guessing if they are safe. U of Arizona, Arizona State, U of Missouri, U of Iowa, Iowa State are some of the better options that do admissions that way. Your state may have a public option that makes more sense than those for you.\n\nNote that safe for admission overall may not be safe for every major - nursing for example can have a different standard than the school as a whole.",
