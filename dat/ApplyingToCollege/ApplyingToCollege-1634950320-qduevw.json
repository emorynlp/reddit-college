  "text": "So at the end of junior year I had an A- for both of the semesters, but when I received my transcript at the beginning of senior year it was a B+ at the end of the year instead of A-, making my gpa 3.9 and disqualifying me for the 4.0 student award thing my school does(A- = 4.0 in my school and we are unweighted only).  I have since then gotten the error fixed and have a 4.0 again. should I get the award thing officially fixed or nah. I know it's only a school award but I want it back lol",
