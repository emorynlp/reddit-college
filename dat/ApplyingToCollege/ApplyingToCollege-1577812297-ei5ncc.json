  "text": "they have an essay, \u201cCaltech students are known for their humor and pranks, what do you do for fun\"\n\nI have already written a proper response, but I am international, and they take only \\~30 so unless they blacklist me forever, there is really no downsides to it. (my SAT is 1530, so not too great with scores).\n\nso. ShOuLd I rIcKrOlL CaLtEcH\n\nEDIT: 1530 is good for ivies. But not for caltech. Also for the TGID folks, i am too lazy to make innovative handles. Also, i do have a proper response. Will just add it towards the end haha",

      "text": "So as a fun fact, you have several people in the Caltech admissions process that reads your application.   First is your regional admissions officer.  They're the first.   But a lot more people get a say on your application.   The other admissions officers, obviously, but, a big fun fact about Caltech, students and professors also might have a say on it.  Sometimes committees are formed to affirm if an applicant is \"Caltech worthy.\"    so if you did this, I think you'd really appeal to some students, maybe even a few professors.   However you definitely shouldn't JUST send the link.  Especially since they may not even view it.   Who knows.  \n\nTruly, it's up to you what you do, but I can reccomend that a single YouTube link for an essay is not a good idea.   At the very least have something complementary that completes the prompt as well.\n\nEdit: As some on the Caltech '24 Discord said, they probably print it too.  So they'd have to have the curiosity to go to the link as well.  Assuming the admissions officers don't strip it out and there's no rules that they're not allowed to visit such links.",
