  "text": "I\u2019m interested in business but also in some majors in arts/sciences school, I feel that business is my first choice but aren\u2019t business schools usually harder to get into? So maybe it would be better to apply art/science for easier acceptance? On the other hand if I get in for arts and science it might be hard to transfer to business if I decide I want to",
