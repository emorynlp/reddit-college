      "text": "I'll explain it lol. With Harvard and Yale, if you apply REA to either of them, you can't apply early action to any other private college. So if you wanted to apply to Yale early, you couldn't apply to Harvard early. REA gives basically no boost anyways, so I'd recommend applying early to plenty other private schools like Georgetown, Caltech, UChicago, and MIT. If you really wanted to do REA, I'd recommend Yale because it gives a tiny boost where Harvard gives no boost",
