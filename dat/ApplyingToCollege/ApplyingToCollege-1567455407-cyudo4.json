This is also not to mention that a person with a T20 degree will always beat out someone with a degree from somewhere else (given that other factors are similar) because that prestige carries a lot of perks. So I have to be hard on myself, you don\u2019t actively think about your mistakes and bad decisions then you are doomed to either repeat them or allow someone to go down the same path. My issues started in High school, I was always considered the smart kid prior and the life that included a great university was always seen as a given.  You\u2019re right I\u2019m not destined for it but it was the life I wanted. \n\nI\u2019ve always loathed the phrase \u201cbe grateful for all you have\u201d because it only teaches people to become complacent and not actively seek better opportunities. You can always do something better. \n\nAs much as we\u2019d like t to be the case, life is not long. It is short. The average person is in their prime socially and physically in their late teens to mid 30s. After that, opportunities are lost and one settles. And while it\u2019s true that one can bring positive into the world, a good education usually backs that up. Also, while most Harvard grads won\u2019t get a Wikipedia page or monument erected in their honor, because of their schooling and credentials, they are more likely to be involved in something that has more worth and are more likely to secure a legacy. \n\nBut forging ones path has no guarantee. People forge their own paths everyday and end up forgot and returned to dust within a decade with no impact on the world. Plus the advice to forge ones own path does nothing to address the previous points.",

That puts you in the top 25% right there. You say you were smart so that probably hasn\u2019t changed much, you just need to apply it to something that you like and motivates you. \n\nI didn\u2019t say be grateful for everything. I said be grateful for the skills and things you have. Be specific about what you\u2019re grateful for because it\u2019s a very under appreciated feeling these days in my opinion. You aren\u2019t going to be walking around all day feeling grateful and ignoring all the trash that surrounds you. But in proper doses, it improves your mood and improves your ability to be a positive person \u2014someone who others want to be around.  \n\nMark my word in 10, 15, 20 years you will look back at these next 3-4 years of your life, regardless about how you currently feel, and wish you could do it all over again simply because of the opportunities.  You have your entire adult life in front of you.  Average colleges will give you plenty of opportunities to succeed at life if you choose to use them.",

But when those 5 points save your average and keep it an A that\u2019s when you realize the studying was more impt. And yeah I don\u2019t really know what kinds of ECs to do still. Research and stuff seems boring, and probably isn\u2019t that helpful for like computer related stuff.
