  "text": "So to sum up, I got rejected from Rice for ED1. And I still got my ED2 left, but to be honest I don't know where to use it on. I'm applying to CS and in my current list right now, I don't see any clear school option for ED2.\n\nCurrent school list: Rice (rejected), UMass Amherst, UF, UMN-Twin Cities, CWRU, Purdue, Grinnell, URoch, Vanderbilt, Tufts, WashU, UMiami, Lehigh, RIT, Drexel\n\nI'm looking at Tufts right now, overall the school is super good but when it comes to CS, sometimes it even loses to UMass Amherst? So my parent and I are pretty confused.\n\nCan anyone take a look at my list right now and give me some advice on what school should I spend my ED2 on ( if you have a school outside of my list, that's fine too). Or should I even ED2 in the first place?",

It\u2019s even ranked higher than Vanderbilt, Tufts,\u2026 in the US News ranking. I know thats ranking can be very subjective and heavily reliant on research output so I\u2019m quite confused tbh. What\u2019s your take as a person who live in the US?",

The only cases in which higher acceptance rates don\u2019t mean much is REA for stanford, princeton, harvard, etc. Harvard in particular had a 3.3% acceptance rate during the regular decision round last admissions cycle and a 7.4% during the early round. This difference can be attributed to legacies, athletes, and donors being accepted at higher rates rather than unhooked applicants. Cornell, on the other hand, had an 8.7% acceptance rate regular decision compared to a 24% for ED. I think its safe to say that ED\u2019ing many schools increases your chances",
