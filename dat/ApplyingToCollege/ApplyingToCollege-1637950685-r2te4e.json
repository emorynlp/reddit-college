  "text": "I've already chosen a major for college applications, but I don't specifically know what I want from that major; I just want to learn about it. And all of these \"Why this major?\" questions are just so stupid when my answer is simply \"Why not?\". Then again, why am I even choosing this major when I know nothing about it? I'm probably overreacting, but if I don't know the exact reason to why I want to pursue a major and what it will do for me in the future, then this could impact my chances of getting accepted into a college.",

      "text": "I honestly don't know why I'm going with my major. I just like maths and it interests me. That's all I have to say about it. So I wrote about its huge range of applications and how I like the satisfying feeling of cracking a problem. Just try to find something that resonates with you about your major. It doesn't have to be a super specific and personal thing, just something about it that you like. I'm just bloviating based on what I did, don't quote me lol",
