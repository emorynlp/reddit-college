I suppose I was trying to convey nonchalance a little... forcefully out of vexation in seeing so many people over-analyze trivial things, but it came across as seeming rude.\n\nNo, I actually was quite thoughtful and polite when putting it there, apologizing for additional reading. I know a lot of people use the additional info section to add superfluous information, but the links I added were important in verifying activities that had no link to my school and that no one other than myself knew about.",

It's, of course, courteous to put as little extra info as possible. I just phrased it in such a way that I was only adding the links there in case they were curious about some things listed in my activities section because 2 of the activities can't really be verified by lor's and what not.",
