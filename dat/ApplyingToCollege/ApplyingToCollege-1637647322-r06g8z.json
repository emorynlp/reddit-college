Have your run the Net Price Calculator for all of these was schools? \n\nFor example, you are not going to get much aid from the selective public flagships( Penn State, Ohio State, Maryland, UNC, Georgia, Florida ) as an OOS applicant.\n\nAnd at first glance, I doesn't look like any of the private schools you listed are full-need schools.",
