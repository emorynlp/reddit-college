They believe they will become part of an elite group that has gone through a rigorous curriculum and accomplished something a difficult and respectable. However, if it is revealed that degrees from certain institutions are not given out based on merit but rather on political or social connections, then the value of their stamp of approval is certainly undermined.",

While it may be a true generalization that the offspring of rich and successful people tend to become rich and successful themselves, that is not true in all cases. For those cases where the generalization proves true, they should be able to stand on their own merits and graduate from elite rigorous institutions on their own. However if schools start to make special carve outs and exceptions to their standards this will compromise the reputation of the institution and degrade the credentials of any person that holds a degree from that institution. Furthermore institutions expect ethical standards from their students. Students should also demand that institutions they belong to also conduct themselves with integrity. One measure of integrity in my opinion is to treat all people the same regardless of the size of their bank account or political connections.",
