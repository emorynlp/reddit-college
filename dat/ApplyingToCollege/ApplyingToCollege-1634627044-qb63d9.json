  "text": "I am an international student applying for some aid (50%) to US colleges. Will this negatively impact my admission. I heard that public colleges do not give aid to international students. Is it true? My parental income is >$70K. However, we have assets which are not a part of tax return, am I still eligible for aid? Lastly, do state colleges give aid to int students?",
