          "text": "Agree wholeheartedly.   \nTo add, you do NOT have to go to an elite college to move up in the social ladder.   \n\n\nThere's this dangerous and self deprecating idea emerging from within the education community that it is a social responsibility for elite universities to be some kind of harbinger for social justice and opening its gates.  \n\n\nOne can go to an affordable state school or a community college, gain a degree, obtain experiences in their career related field, and proceed. In fact, elite colleges are elite in that the people that go there are either or a combination of:  \n1. Wealthy  \n2. Academically Promising  \n3. Socially Promising  \n\n\nOf course, having wealth plays into whether or not a student reaches their full potential - and the large portion of wealthy families value education and so spend much more money on it. My family is very poor (near the US Poverty line), however we do value education so we move to districts with good education and sacrifice quality of life for quality of education.",

                          "text": "It's complicated. His mom was upper-middle class but his adoptive father was a poor, first-generation immigrant. When he lived in Miami he was in a middle-class (if not lower-middle class at times) household and attended an ok-ish school. During his early adult life, his parents had diversified investments, his father was in a late stage of a successful decades-long career, and his mother likely inherited some money. This pushed them towards the upper-middle or upper class.\n\nThis is why it's so hard to analyze the spectrum of privileges that Jeff Bezos did and didn't grow up with. It is, for example, a statistical miracle that his father became a successful engineer. Same with his mom's teenage pregnancy.\n\nThe financial status of Jeff Bezos'  family changed drastically from his childhood to when he founded Amazon.\n\nAll that said, the statistical anomaly that is Jeff Bezos seems largely irrelevant to this thread.",

Rodney king was 30 years ago, and the exact same thing happens over and over again and nothing happens. there are large portions of the US where I and other black and Latino people can\u2019t go in fear of being harassed, assaulted, or worse",

It\u2019s concerning in that it would be better if the chances were closer, but mathematically it doesn\u2019t seem to be concerning or unusual, and a lot of the underlying factors aren\u2019t necessarily that bad. \nwhat would be more concerning is the low income success rate at flagship state schools, especially top public unis, because those schools are specifically designed to promote the citizens of the state. harvard and similar schools are intended to push the limits of human capability and understanding, and i don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of pocket to say that students from the top 1% are way way way more equipped to do that than students from the bottom quintile (that\u2019s not something that anyone controls directly and i mean no offense by that statement, i\u2019m just saying)",

In other words, you may as well have a high GPA and high SAT, but barely any awards/honors and some ECs because you are poor and live in a bad schooling district and/or have a job. That does not necessarily mean you are less passionate or less capable, but college admissions, more often than not, will hold that against you.\n\nSee, you are making it seem like all people have exactly the same opportunity of getting into Harvard regardless of socioeconomic disadvantage, and that the ones accepted are worthy ones. But that merits making other questions: how many of the poor students would perform better if they had the same opportunities as rich people do? Taking this into consideration, how is legacy and donators admissions justified? \nIf there is a socioeconomic disparity that creates a disproportionate distribution, then are we taking the access to top tier education to those who more need it?",

Some people will think that regardless of parental income, we (well, the state I guess) should give all children the tools necessary to get accepted into an Ivy. They'd prefer to see the distribution of Ivy students more flat when split by parental income.\n\nOthers would like to determine if controlling for \"all other factors\", does solely being richer give you an edge in acceptance? (Vast majority of the country would agree that it **should not**). Again though, it's rather difficult to control for all the things a high-income family tends to give you. The linked paper has figures in the appendix that make an attempt to control for things like SAT scores.

Yet, more than half of the selected students are from a few elite schools, and a large proportion of them are from elite background.\n\nIt doesn't happen because of discrimination, it just means that being from a priviledged background gives you a head start.\n\nMeritocracy does injustice towards the unprivileged.

It will sound harsh but many people here are ignorant of the fact that, due to a great part of the U.S. College Admissions depending on stuff like awards, ECs or other things, rich people have WAY more chance to have good opportunities (unless you live in NY or CA where there are huge magnet schools). Like, compare the Math club of your local public school with the one of the top private school. The differences are sometimes ridiculously big, and it should not be that way.",
