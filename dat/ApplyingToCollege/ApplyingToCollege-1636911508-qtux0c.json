Here's a rough example:\n\nPast: My name is \\_\\_\\_\\_, I'm a student from (insert school here) and I'm from (insert place here). You can provide some context here if that's relevant.\n\nPresent: My current interests at school include \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, and outside of school I enjoy doing \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\nFuture: I'm hoping to continue pursuing them at university by studying \\_\\_\\_\\_, and in the future, I\"m looking forward to (insert goals here).",
