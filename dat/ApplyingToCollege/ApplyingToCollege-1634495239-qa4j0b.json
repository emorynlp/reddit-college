  "text": "Hey everyone! Up until now I was 100% in love with Duke ready to ED there. On the way back from a trip, my family stopped in Durham to check out Duke and the town and campus looked dead. We had recently checked out Columbia and UCLA; compared to those two, Duke was quiet, and Durham was small. What do college students at Duke do for fun outside of academics? I\u2019m a little scared because I was ready with my application to ED, but now I\u2019m questioning my decision!",

It's coming back, but slowly. We have a lot going on, but it's not super visible at the moment. In non-pandemic times, here's some things available around town:\n\nThe Durham Performing Arts Center (DPAC) has traveling Broadway shows,  concerts, comedy shows, etc. \n\nRight by there is the American Tobacco Campus that has live music and other events in the courtyard along with restaurants and a pretty fountain area that's nice to hang out.\n\nDuke Gardens has beautiful flowers. Olmstead State Park is nearby with good hiking.\n\nDowntown has lots of popular restaurants from dives to fine dining. Bar trivia, chicken and waffles, tapas, late night quesadillas, etc.\n\nThere's lots of opportunities for sports: disc golf, community baseball, rock climbing, horseback riding, kayaking, TRI Sports (community teams for things like volleyball, kickball, dodgeball, etc.), Durham Bulls games, Carolina Courage games are nearby. \n\nThere's several popular venues that have events like burlesque shows, fire dancers, Mexican-style wrestling, storytelling competitions. \n\nThe social dance scene is huge: salsa, blues, swing, tango, bachata, ballroom, kazumba, etc.\n\nDurham is a very diverse city, so really anything you're interested in, we have or it's nearby in Raleigh or Chapel Hill",

Students to go into town but it\u2019s not like there\u2019s ever going to be enough in downtown to make it feel like a college town, because, again, Durham really isn\u2019t a college town. Lots of Duke students will go to shooters and (maybe for older students/grad students) Devine\u2019s\u2014those are the main nightclubs/bars that cater to students. Other than that though most social events and activities will be on campus. \n\n2) You visited over family weekend lol. Meaning most students were spending time with visiting family, most likely at on-campus events (in buildings, where you wouldn\u2019t see them) or in their rooms or at hotels.",
