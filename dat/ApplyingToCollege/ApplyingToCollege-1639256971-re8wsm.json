  "text": "So kids from my school have been hearing back from colleges and it is finally hitting me that so many kids are getting rejected. I now feel really scared about my own college list so please let me know what I should do.\n\nI am a girl and go to a competitive private school in Manhattan (nyc) and a have 34 ACT (superscore) and 5 total APs (my school doesn\u2019t offer many). I have strong grades. My school doesn\u2019t have GPA or rank its students. I am interested in business with an interest in entrepreneurship/marketing. Also my extracurriculars are pretty interesting and related to my major so I think colleges will like them but I don\u2019t feel comfortable saying them publicly. \n\nI also am legacy for Boston University and Syracuse. I have \u201chooks\u201d/connections for NYU, Mich, Duke, and Penn but idk realistically how much that would affect my chances because like half my grade is legacy to all these schools.\n\nThis is my original plan:\n\nED1:\u00a0\n- University of Pennsylvania (Wharton)\n\nEA:\u00a0\n- University of Wisconsin-Madison (Wisconsin School of Business)\n- Indiana University Bloomington (Kelley School of Business)\n- University of Michigan (Ross School of Business)\n- University of Miami (Herbert Business School)\n\nED2:\n- New York University (Stern School of Business - Business, Technology, and Entrepreneurship major)\n\nRegular Decision:\n- Syracuse University (either\u00a0Martin J. Whitman School of Management or\u00a0Newhouse School Of Public Communications)\n- Boston University (Questrom School of Business)\n- University of Southern California (Marshall School of Business)\n- Washington University (Olin School of Business)\n- Duke University\n- Tufts University\n- Cornell (CALS -communication major)\n- Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Ik it\u2019s a huge reach)\n\n\nPlease let me know what I should add!",

Whitman and especially Newhouse are not safeties, they are targets. \n\nI agree with whoever said to add some SUNY flagships. I\u2019d also consider some easier to get into liberal arts colleges. \n\nBut talk to your counselor and see what they recommend. That\u2019s why you pay for private school.",
