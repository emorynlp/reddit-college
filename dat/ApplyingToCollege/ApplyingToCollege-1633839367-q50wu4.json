  "text": "Hello there,\n\nFirst of all, I want to list some of my stats other than my SAT:\n\nAsian Male\n\nLooking to major in Finance with a concentration in Financial Planning\n\n3.61 Weighted GPA\n\n3.49 Unweighted GPA\n\n369/532 Class Rank\n\n5-6 ECs, including an internship, job, and 3 years of basketball head coaching.\n\nFinally, my SAT score in August was a 1200. However, my reading score was a 660, and my math score was just 540. I also just took the SAT in October, but am not expecting much different. Some of my target schools are Virginia Tech, UPitt, Purdue, JMU, GMU, and IU Bloomington.\n\nDo you think I should submit my score even if it stays very disproportionate considering my stats are not great?\n\nThank you",
