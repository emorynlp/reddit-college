  "text": "Will it just become home for cat pictures? \n\nWill the mods become homeless since nobody is posting? \n\nWill UC Hicago send us a cease and desist because they don\u2019t like what we call them???\n\nWill we band together with our brand new shiny college acceptances to take over the world and usher in a new world order that revolves around try-harding gpas, ecs, and test scores?!?!? \n\nOr maybe we will just get to laugh at the new wave of HS seniors freaking out about their 35 ACT not being a 36\u2026\n\nNo matter what happens, I\u2019m glad that I\u2019ll be able to witness it with all of you! \u2764\ufe0f",
