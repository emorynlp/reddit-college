      "text": "Read lots of books. Fiction and self help books will help you learn about writing with a voice and understanding perspective.  \n\nWrite a journal. Get used to writing down your thoughts and comfortable with the idea of expressing yourself. \n\nTake the hardest course load you can manage while caring for your mental emotional and physical health. Try to end in calculus senior year. Take four years of foreign language if you\u2019re interested in highly rejective colleges. Take physics, bio, and chem. \n\nMake good grades. \n\nFocus on doing stuff that\u2019s meaningful and important to you.",
