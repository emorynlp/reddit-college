  "title:": "I live in a country that has terrible administrations. How important are the Transcript of Records for unis and career?",
  "text": "Hello, I have completed both my Bachelors and Masters degrees in one university that is supposedly one of the top universities in my country. The administration workers are extremely toxic and they are causing me a breakdown. My Transcript of Records has mistakes in the titles of the courses (e.g. \"Introduction to Language\" instead of \"Introduction to Python\" ), as well as illogical courses titles (e.g. there is Course Chemistry 2 and Chemistry 3 but there is no Chemistry 1 at all). They refuse to correct them and I have to fight them and yell and possibly miss many universities deadlines. I want to pursue a PhD or Masters abroad and I am really stressed and anxious about this causing me problems in universities or when applying to jobs. The Diploma Supplement also has tons of typos and mistakes (Access requirement for a Bachelors in Biochem is a Bachelors in Biochem). I am on the edge of giving up on all 5 years of studies. Thank you for reading and thank you for your guidance and advice.",

      "text": "Your best bet may well be to contact several of the schools you are interested in and ask how much they can work with you correcting what you have in hand. Most schools are familiar with the quirks of other countries. Your transcript is most important as to grades. If those are accurate maybe a school can work with you.",
