Even a deferral at least justifies your nervousness and anxiety because it means you have a chance and are a qualified applicant (other than some schools who defer everyone they don't accept). \n\nBut a rejection? Man, that shit hurts like hell, and it makes you feel so stupid for being so anxious about the decision. Because that means you never had any chance at all, and they didn't even think your application was worth a second look. That's just... crushing, especially for EE.
