  "text": "I attended a university this year, but got in some trouble recently. I was essentially kicked out, but the disciplinary process never went through with because I just decided to withdraw. I am looking to apply to new schools for next year but are unsure what to do. Since I withdrew, does that mean other colleges are required to know I attended another school even though I received no credit? Will they care or ask why? Since there was no disciplinary action ever taken against me, aren't I not required to tell them what happened? Would I still be able to apply as a freshman or would I need to apply as a transfer student? I did not get any credit so transferring credit is not a concern.",
