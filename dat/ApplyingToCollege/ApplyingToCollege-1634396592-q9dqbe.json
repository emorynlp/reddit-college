  "text": "I\u2019m planning to apply to geophysics at a college and then want to switch to astrophysics or physics. The first year is common for all and you have to give your major by the end of the first year. So I won\u2019t be tied down to geophysics right?",

      "text": "Yes. 3/5ths of college students change major at least once.\n\nHowever, although it's easy to change major, it's typically really hard to change department, so I recommend applying to the harder department first, then transferring out if you change your mind. (Ex: in many schools, applying to CS then switching to an arts major is way easier than applying into the arts department and then trying to transfer to the CS department once you're in.)\n\nIf Physics is a harder department than geophysics, it might be safer to try your luck at physics.",
