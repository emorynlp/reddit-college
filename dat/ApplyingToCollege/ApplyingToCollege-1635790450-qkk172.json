  "text": "Just applied for Brown PLME and I put \u201cdentist, medicine\u201d in the \u201cfuture plans\u201d section of the common app instead of \u201cphysician, medicine\u201d as I got confused when applying thru common app and didn\u2019t see the selection for \u201cphysician\u201d when submitting my app. Please tell me this doesn\u2019t matter especially for PLME? Should I email the admissions office?\n\nThanks lol",
