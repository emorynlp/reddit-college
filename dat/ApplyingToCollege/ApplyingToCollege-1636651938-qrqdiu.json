  "title:": "Why do people keep applying to and attending ultra-conservative Christian schools that actively discriminates against lgbtq+ people?",
  "text": "Today I was surfing the internet when I saw mention of Hope College, which is in Michigan, somewhere. Since I had never heard of them, I thought of checking their website out. Now, one of my foremost priority for applying to any school after the quality of academics and fin aid is the school's use of Title IX. Turns out Hope College, which is a Christian LAC, actively discriminates against the queer community, so much so that a few of them were punished severely for violating the school's policies or something. Baylor University, Pepperdine University, Brigham Young University, Liberty University, has consistently appeared in the list of worst colleges for lgbtq+ youth. (Fun fact, Hope College doesn't even make the 'Shame List' of Campus Pride). Aside from Liberty, I have seen many people from here applying to the other schools. I genuinely don't understand why, in spite of the regressive stances of these universities, people keep applying to these places?\n\nIs a quality education justification enough to enroll in schools which perpetuate queerphobia? Is God reason enough? If people can stop applying to Rice because of Texas's anti-abortion laws, why don't they keep the same energy to boycott queerphobic schools?\n\nI am not talking of schools like Georgetown or Notre Dame, which even though are religious, don't go on to exclude the lgbtq+ community. I am talking specifically of those ultra-conservative Christian schools, be they of any denomination, who make Christianity a part of their whole campus and curriculum. \n\nI have nothing against religion. I genuinely don't understand why they want to go these places. Maybe there's more to it than meets the eye? Although I have a hard time seeing the other side when it comes to basic human rights of anyone else.",

      "text": "Reddit is a progressive bubble and does not reflect the real world. Very few people are actually going to boycott Texas schools over abortion law, and these sorts of Christian colleges are actually growing in enrollment, for better or worse.\n\nI'm from a conservative area in rural West Virginia, and have grown up in one of its most conservative Christian communities. To put it bluntly, the vast majority of folks who attend these schools could not care less about how LGBTQ+ people are treated. There are quite a few exceptions among students, and not all Christian colleges are hateful, but that's just how it is with some folks.\n\nI won't talk about Brigham Young because they're Mormon (questionably Christian) and have their own set of rules (no coffee or tea, for example).\n\nBob Jones University, Liberty University, Cedarville University, and Pensacola Christian College: four of the most conservative Christian colleges in the United States. Most students feeding into these schools grew up in what I call the \"Christian education pipeline\", where a child is raised in an education system where Christianity is part of all aspects of education from kindergarten through 12th grade, and usually through college. The idea is to \"develop the heart and mind in a Christ-centered environment\", or something like that.\nWhen people go to these sorts of colleges, it is often just the type of conservative Christian education they want to be in, where the tight rules reflect their worldview and they see them as good, including restrictions on LGBTQ+ people. Another subset of students at these places are people forced into them by their parents or social norm. I think you can guess why.\n\n\nChristian/Catholic colleges range from mostly hands-off like Notre Dame to dictating your ability to leave campus like at Pensacola. Some people are more conservative than others. Some people don't trust themselves with the freedom that comes with a traditional college experience. Others get offered really good scholarships. I could go to Liberty for free if I wanted to. I won't, because my religious beliefs are fundamentally in conflict with theirs, but I can see why it attracts some people.\n\n\nThere are less extreme (and arguably more sane) Christian colleges out there, but this strain of American Christianity is the dominant one, and these colleges will get the most attention as a result.",

Most of us just have places to go, and a car is an easy way to get there.  \n\nNot everyone who attends a university with a history of \"bad\" is a bad person.  \n\nSome of them are just making a tough financial decision.  \n\nSure, technically we're talking about \"Selling Out one's Individual Morals\".  \n\nBut EVERYONE has a price, so don't throw stones just because someone's price is \"free tuition\".  \n\nHere is an example:  \n\nHow much good could you offer to the world if you had one Billion dollars?  \n\nOne thousand millions.  \n\nHow much political leverage could you \"buy\" to change policies?  \n\nHow many legal support agencies could you fund to help people find justice?  \n\n\nConsider for a moment: Stoner Elon Musk takes a massive bong rip. A rip so hard, deep and pure that Snoop Dog himself is impressed.  \n\nBecause stoner-Elon has nothing better to do with his money, he offers you one Billion dollars as a gift if you graduate from Brigham Young University with a 3.5+ overall GPA.  \n\nYou can major in whatever you want, and a full-ride scholarship is part of the deal.  \n\nBut if you drop out, or get administratively dropped from the school, you have to reimburse all tuition costs to date.",

It's not just about you and your parents, but your extended family and the community.  It's a world view that has been taught basically since birth of us versus them, good versus evil.  If you've followed American news and politics even slightly in the last 5 years or so it should be clear how difficult it is for people to adjust that world view and consider that what they were taught might not actually be right.",

I hate to break it to you, but both of these colleges are objectively bad.",

Also, you're correct in that a college doesn't *have* to be T50 to be good, but I would say that most colleges outside of T50 are not nearly as good as the ones inside it (there are a few exceptions of course). Also, you ignored my other points: the fact that it has mediocre outcomes at best and 0 name recognition (that is important in some fields).",

Baylor, Bob Jones, Pensacola, etc. all are recognized, especially if someone was pursuing an mdiv or something similar",
