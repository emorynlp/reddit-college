  "text": "I\u2019m applying to university in the UK next year and I found out that my school will only allow teachers who are your form teachers to write references to colleges in the UK. However, my form teacher and i don\u2019t have the best relationship currently as I have recently been having issues with punctuality given my grandfather\u2019s cancer treatments and me being the only person who can care for him at the moment. with the school year ending i\u2019m pretty sure she would write a poor reference letter nonetheless and I was wondering how badly this would affect my application in comparison to other factors like grades or interviews.",
