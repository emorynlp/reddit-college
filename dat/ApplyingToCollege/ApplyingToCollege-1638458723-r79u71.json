  "text": "Hey everyone, I'm a mass communication graduate who's willing to pursue marketing (Post Graduate certificate) in Canada and work along the same route. I want to study another course after the Marketing program but I'm confused with which field/specialisation to choose. Should I go with business analytics or digital marketing? Or any other course ( I'm open to suggestions)  Would changing the stream, like going into analytics be a smart move and  provide me with a competitive edge ? \n\nI am new to this community and would love to hear your suggestions or advices. Appreciate you reading this bit, kindly help a young student out!  \n\nP.s. - My DMs are open, feel free to get in touch.",
