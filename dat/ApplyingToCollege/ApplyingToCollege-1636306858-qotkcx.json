  "text": "I got a letter from Stanford saying that they \"identify high school students who are ready to engage in college-level courses\" and are inviting me to participate in Stanford's fourth academic quarter called Summer Session. However, I don't know if this has any meaning/significance in college admissions or if they just buy SAT data and send it to whoever meets certain brackets of information. Help/advice? It sounds like it would be expensive.",
