  "title:": "asking teacher to revise a LOR?",
  "text": "i asked my art teacher to write me a LOR bc she\u2019s the only teacher i have a strong relationship w/ outside the classroom. \n\nshe sent me my LOR (bc she didn\u2019t know students can\u2019t send the letters themselves) and giving into my temptations, i read it. the LOR was 190 words w/ vague descriptions despite me providing her w/ multiple pages of my experiences, qualities, etc. i later learned it was her first time writing a LOR. \n\ni really do appreciate her help, but i was just expecting a little more with how close we are. \n\nwould it be wrong to ask my teacher to be more specific and enthusiastic in my LOR? or am i being a jerk and asking for too much? or should i just not submit any LORs?",

      "text": "Here\u2019s what I would do: send an email saying hey, you can submit your lor directly through the commonapp. Additionally, usually lor\u2019s are more descriptive, and I know that although you\u2019re busy, I would appreciate it if you were more anecdotal in your writing. Obviously this is kinda bold, but this lor is important. She sent it to you so it\u2019s not like she didn\u2019t expect you to read it. Ultimately up to you but it\u2019s ok to advocate for yourself especially when stuff like this can help determine your future.",
