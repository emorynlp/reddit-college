No fee means everyone would apply to the top colleges. Even those barely putting effort into supplementals and no change of getting in would apply, and everyone gets less view time on their application.\n\nEdit: for sat and ap, I mean the score send fee makes no sense. The test fee has an argument to be made.",

I mean I'm only applying to matches/targets for EA so that's lessening my stress, but I do obviously wish I worked on apps more consistently. \n\nBut at least we have a few days left!

Just also remember that it's probably easier than you think it is, and don't work yourself to burnout. It's a marathon, not a race. Once you get in, you've still got college, possibly grad school admissions, grad school, job interviews, and then a lifetime of work ahead. Pace yourself, take care of yourself, and don't forget to have some fun with it, you never get this time back.",
