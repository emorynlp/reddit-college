  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nSo I was looking through Cornell\u2019s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences First Year Requirements and saw this:\n\n* \\[3 Units of Science (biology, chemistry, and physics recommended)\\]\n\nIn high school, I took Honors Earth Science, Honors Living Environment, Honors Chem, AP Chem, and AP Bio.\n\nDoes it matter that I did not take physics? \n\nThanks! And hope everyone is doing well during this stressful time!",

      "text": "If physics is recommended, then it will hurt your application if you did not take it. However, if your application is better than other applications in several areas, it will be less of an issue. Your application won\u2019t automatically be thrown out, it just makes it a bit harder to get in.",
