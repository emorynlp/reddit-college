  "text": "Ok so I am not sure on whether this is the correct subreddit but I would think this would reach the correct people with the most reasonable answers. So I am currently a sophomore attending a school ranked top 5 in New Jersey and is considered a top STEM school. To get into this school I had to take tests and they take the best of each county/ district. The last year and a half I have attended this school I have felt it is not for me, it lacks social aspect considering it is all nerds and the friends I have don't really feel like the people I like. Because of this I have considered going back to my home high school which is far from being considered the best, but has a IB program similar to the magnet school and has a high school experience with all my friends for the past 10 years attending it. Although it is foolish of me to choose a school because of its high school experience I just don't feel like the school fits me, what I also don't want it is regret I am doing well at the magnet school with being top 25ish in the class. So if I decide to transfer back I don't want to miss on opportunities for college as it is ranked well for being prepped for college, but once again high school is only a one time experience. Also I forgot to mention if I were to attend my home high school I would finish valedictorian.",

      "text": "well switching high schools halfway through kinda sucks if you care about that. i would say that choosing a school that suits you matters more for college than in high school and giving yourself the best chance at a school you like is more important. of course if you think you can do well there then I wouldn't say its a bad idea",
