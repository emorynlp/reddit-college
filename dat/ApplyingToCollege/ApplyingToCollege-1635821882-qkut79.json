(I don\u2019t have a SSN)\n\nSo i tried to find my one at CSS profile, but the page isn\u2019t working\u2026 \n\nAnd additionally, I remember they let me know the Idoc id when they sent the receipt. However, this year, the College Board only sent me the receipt which even doesn\u2019t include any information but the payment.\n\nDoes it mean that I have a problem on my application??\n\nAnd I sent an email that explains my situation to AO (proof photos attached). Do you think they will tolerate me to submit it a few days after the deadline\u2026??",
