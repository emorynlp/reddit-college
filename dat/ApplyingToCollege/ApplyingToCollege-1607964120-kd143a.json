  "text": "When you post something like \u201cwow I\u2019m so dumb, I only got into [Insert University]\u201d where everyone can see it, there\u2019s a pretty good chance that that was someone\u2019s reach school and they didn\u2019t get into it. Seeing something like that can be pretty crushing.\n\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say that you can never have a little healthy complaining or self-deprecation, just be mindful of your audience.",

You'll almost certainly encounter physics problems and material in your future calculus classes, differential equations, etc. Chemistry is applied physics, and you'll need to be able to know and use physics concepts for physical chemistry and Quantum chemistry (the latter usually being optional, but extremely interesting). Keep your head up. \n\nPhysics is hard for everyone. *Everyone*. This is why some of the greatest minds of our time were/are physicists - it is very intellectually demanding, engaging, and expansive. It *does* attempt to explain our entire universe and everything in it, from the beginning of time to the end, after all. It's hard by nature. But you can do it! I genuinely believe in you, internet stranger. Please, never give up and you will go as far as you like in Chemistry and math.",

Everybody's dream school is different and higher ranking doesn't mean better. It's all about fit. \n\nPlus, Emory freshman get to be on campus, and the school is handling the pandemic like a champ, with weekly testing and only a few cases during first semester. So all the other T20s and T30s can suck it.\n\nSorry if this was too aggressive, I'm just defensive of my school! I'm so excited to meet the class of 25 :) hope to see you on campus next fall!!",

      "text": "i definitely agree that we should be mindful of all perspectives, though i also think we should all understand the different standards we hold for ourselves. one who sobs over a 4 on an ap exam may be experiencing grief and invalidation on the same caliber as a student sobbing over a 2, depending on how much they expect from themselves as well as how they typically perform. \n\nso if you are genuinely and deeply feeling down about yourself even when performing above average, just not above or even at Your average, it\u2019s okay to feel sad. it\u2019s okay to be crushed. you hold yourself to high standards, and i understand that. i\u2019m like that myself, though i don\u2019t really care too much about the name of whichever college i end up at. \n\nif you know a part of you is about to post this for the attention or clout, then this isn\u2019t for you, because honestly that\u2019s a sh*tty thing to do regardless of what standards you hold for yourself. \n\nfor those within different standard bubbles (or every bubble, really), please don\u2019t compare yourself to everyone else. your achievements are Your achievements, and what is a good school to you is a good school to you. understand that when people get down on themselves, it is in no way an indirect criticism of you. i doubt (and again, if your intentions are actually the following you don\u2019t deserve my respect) any single person posts these because they want to criticize those who haven\u2019t received the same scores or haven\u2019t been admitted to the same school. i struggle with this myself, hearing some of the most intelligent and productive individuals i know tell me they\u2019re stupid or wasting their lives when i know i\u2019ve accomplished significantly less as of now. it hurts, but i know it\u2019s not for me. it\u2019s not meant to hurt me, and it\u2019s not a direct reflection of what i should or could be doing. i am going at my own pace and i am doing well, as is each and every single one of you. \n\npeople share their grief and frustrations to anyone who will listen, as i feel a lot of you who are active on here do. please don\u2019t invalidate these feelings of loss, even if it doesn\u2019t seem like such a big deal to you. even in these different bubbles and expectations for ourselves, our feelings are human and are one and the same. just keep that in mind :)",
