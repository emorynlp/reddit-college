  "text": "I'm a highschool junior. Everyone always talks about junior year being the hardest and most stressful. Everyone around me is super busy and stressed and staying up to two in the morning. I'm not. I havent been stressed or busy yet. I feel that I'm not doing enough. I'm taking three aps, have straight a's, play a jv sport, am only in a singular club,, and have a part time job. I feel that there is so much more I can do with all the extra time I have. Any suggestions? Any one else stuck in the same situation?",
