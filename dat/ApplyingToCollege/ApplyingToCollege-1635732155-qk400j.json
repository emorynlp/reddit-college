  "title:": "\u201cWhy Brown\u201d supplement advice",
  "text": "Hey! I\u2019ve finished my supplement but I am starting to get a bit apprehensive. My intended major is biophysics, a cross road between physics and biology. I think brown is a perfect school for me bc of the open curriculum not restricting me to either field. However, a lot of the essay examples online show that people often cite a love for history and science, or psychology and math. They have completely different interests where as mines are similar. Also, could it be argued that my intention to explore biology and physics in an open curriculum is already encapsulated in the \u201cbiophysics\u201d major. If true then I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a strong argument for the open curriculum.",

They\u2019re like the same thing or at least very closely related. And he got in to Brown. Sorry I can\u2019t be of much help to your actual application bc I just saw this, but I hope this qualms your worries a bit",

What I ended up doing is saying I wanted to build a holistic understanding of cancer and that browns open curriculum would be a perfect place for that bc I could learn the chem, physical, biological, engineering, ethical, racial questions that come with cancer it\u2019s treatment. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll like that tho cuz I\u2019m talking about exploring in the context of one thing though\u2026 expecting a rejection now (:",
