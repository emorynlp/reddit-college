  "text": "hi everyone! i'm currently a senior at a high school in the us and i plan on studying biology along a premed track. i was always considering going to college in the US, until i learned about mcgill university in montreal. i really think it would be a good fit for me. i've done a bit of research and i've found out that american med schools view a canadian bachelors the same as that from an american college. i guess i'm just posting here to make sure?? do you guys think that a canadian BS would make it more difficult to get into an american med school??\n\nTLDR; i'm an american interested in a canadian university for premed and want to make sure a canadian degree won't harm my chances of being accepted into med school",
