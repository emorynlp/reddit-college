  "text": "By May 2022 I will have completed 25 credits at my local community college. That's from a winter class then the Spring semester, and I will probably take a summer class or two. I want to apply for a 4 year for Fall 2022, and the due date is April 1, 2022. \n\nMy grades senior year sucked, and I want them to fully see how much better I can do, but I don't get how that can happen when I won't be done with my classes by then\n\nCan I apply as I said before finishing these courses?  What would my transcript look like then? I never applied to colleges during high school so I don't have much experience and google isn't helping. thanks :)",
