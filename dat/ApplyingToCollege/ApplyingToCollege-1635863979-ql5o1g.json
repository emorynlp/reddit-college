  "text": "I submitted my common app and writing supplement last night before the deadline, but I only got the email from Princeton today. And when I checked on their website, it said that everything was received on 11/02/21. Is that just because that's when I made my account? I just want to make sure my application is still good for Early Action.",

Colleges download overnight the batch of everything that was submitted before midnight eastern; the download date will be after midnight eastern.
