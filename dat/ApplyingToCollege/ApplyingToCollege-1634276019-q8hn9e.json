  "text": "Their website says \"**Applicants to majors in the College of Engineering(COE)**\u00a0will be ranked using a modified eligibility index that will take into consideration applicants\u2019 math GPA in\u00a0addition to the factors listed above.\"\n\n1. My GPA for A-G Grade Point Average (GPA) for 10/11 Grade is 4.17 = 4.17\\*800 = 3336 points\n2. Local Admission Area = 200 points\n3. Maths Coursework Grade Point Average (GPA) = 400 points x **Math GPA** (NOT SURE WHAT THIS MATH GPA MEANS, is it average GPA in all math courses in 10/11 grade? What about if I have taken APs in math?\n\nThere is another link on their website which gives the formula to calculate MATH GPA from SAT or ACT match score. But as they are not considering SAT and ACT, I am not sure how will they calculate the Math GPA.",
