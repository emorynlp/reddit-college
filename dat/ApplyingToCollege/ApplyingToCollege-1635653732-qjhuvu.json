  "title:": "Confused about UT Austin Required Essay",
  "text": "For the record, I am applying with the Coalition Application. \n\nOn the UT Austin website it says, \"All freshmen must submit a required essay. Topic A in ApplyTexas, or the UT Austin Required Essay in the Coalition application. Please keep your essay between 500-700 words.\" \n\nThe essay topic is: \"Tell us your story. What unique opportunities or challenges have you experienced throughout your high school career that have shaped who you are today?\"\n\nThe problem is that I can't find this anywhere on the Coalition Application. The closest thing I can see is the \"Required Short Answer\" but that's not the same thing, right? Even when I printed out a pdf of the application, I couldn't see it anywhere.\n\nAlso, one more question: do they see the personal statement that I wrote for the Coalition Application? It doesn't show up anywhere on the aforementioned pdf.\n\nThanks!",
