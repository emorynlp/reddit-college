  "text": "When I pressed review and submit it wouldn\u2019t load the pdf so it\u2019d be stuck loading and I couldn\u2019t check off the application. Suddenly i thought of going inspect element and removing the loading symbol just to see if it\u2019d work. You bet your *** it worked. I finally got to submit until i got hit with another error. I kept doing the same thing over and over again until it told me I couldn\u2019t submit because the questions were unfinished. Defeated and about to deep throat a cactus, I went back to the home page and saw that my application now said submitted. Dog bless",
