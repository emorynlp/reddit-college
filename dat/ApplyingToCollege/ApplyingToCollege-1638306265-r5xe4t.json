      "text": "Maybe? If you have 500 spots and 1000 applicants one year (AR of 50%) and then 500 spots and 2000 applicants when you go test-optional (AR of 25%) acceptance rates are going to go down. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s more competitive. \r  \n\r  \nLast year, when everyone went test-optional for the first time, people EVERYWHERE jumped on the chance to apply. People with 4.0s but meh SAT or no scores went test-optional to strengthen their apps, and there were a good amount of people that didn't even write their SAT/ACT that said \"heck it\" and threw their apps into schools they never previously considered. This means we have roughly two types of new applicants: ones who are bumped up to a higher chance of admission, and ones whose chances don\u2019t change at all. \r  \n\r  \nBut when you consider what goes into a strong application, a score can only help you so much. For the majority of applicants, it\u2019s either a maybe or a no.  \r  \n\r  \nThe only people test-optional admissions are helping were those who are competitive but have no or meh scores. If you have a \u201cgood or guaranteed\u201d admission chance, you have nothing to worry about bc you are really really rare and your chances won\u2019t be impacted much. This is because test-optional applicants, like normal applicants, have a very small % of people that are that insanely competitive. Naturally, they want more insane than normal. So some applicants will be bumped back, but not those already in great standing.  But if you are in the mid/lower tier of applicants, it will get harder. \r  \n\r  \nThe test-optional admissions allowed people who had made great achievements but who had no test scores (or weak ones) to be appreciated for their accomplishments. And that\u2019s fantastic. But no, it\u2019s not necessarily more competitive.",

Schools will enroll roughly the same number of students from roughly the same size graduating class, so by that definition it will be pretty much unchanged.",
