  "text": "So this is the best, most privileged problem I can imagine having let me say that right off the bat. I was just accepted to Cornell ED. I applied to 25 schools in total is it absolutely mandatory I actually withdraw the applications because that seems a little silly to me. Like I already paid the enrollment deposit what difference does it make it just saves me some time not to.",

Rescind everything else, it will open up more spots for the rest of us!\n\nOn a different note, congrats on \ud83c\udf3dL!\n\nAlso this post is kinda funny cuz it exposes how lazy everyone gets after they get accepted",
