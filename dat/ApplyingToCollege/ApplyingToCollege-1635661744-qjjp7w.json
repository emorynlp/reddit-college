  "text": "Wassup guys. I\u2019m currently a junior in hs and have some questions. so far my transcript looks like this : had a 4.0 GPA as a freshman, then Covid messed me up and ended with like a 2.6 gpa for my sophomore year. Right now I have a 3.7ish gpa in my junior year. Im not going to take the SAT or Act since I know I\u2019ll do bad on it.\n\nI only had one AP class which was AP human Geo. And I don\u2019t have any extracurricular except key club. I know I won\u2019t be able to make it into a college so I\u2019m going to go the a community college and then transfer. Can you guys help me understand what the TAG program is.",

I mean financially it could be more beneficial but I think in terms of is it possible for you to be accepted I believe that yes there are 4 years that would love to have you as long as you finish strong. You should talk to your counselor. \n\nJust looked up the acceptance rate for Chico and I think a 72% is pretty strong. If it\u2019s something you really wanna pursue I would definitely say go for it!",
