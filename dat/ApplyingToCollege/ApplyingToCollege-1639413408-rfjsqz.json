  "title:": "Letter of Recommendation Question",
  "text": "I am 32 and currently finishing prerequisites after taking 10 years off from school. I am applying to a nuclear medicine program, but I am concerned about the letter of recommendation. It says to use a current or previous employer. I currently work with my family in our small business, so my current employer would be my dad. My last employer was at a pharmacy 8 years ago. My question is: who to use for the recommendation? Would it look bad coming from my parent or would it look worse using an employer from so long ago? I am inclined to use the pharmacy reference because it is more applicable to the program I am trying to get into and I am on really good terms with the pharmacist/manager I worked for, but have some doubts.",
