      "text": "I had a similar question (I'm not particularly keen on paying money to send out CSS to schools Im applying for merit scholarships at because that seems like a waste of money for non need-based aid.) Wondered if FAFSA and CSS were required for any aid (including merit based) so I just emailed each admissions office. \n\nEach college may have a different policy so Id suggest just emailing them individually.",
