  "text": "Hi all, I'm very new to this way of applying to universities as I graduated in Canada. Here are several questions I want to ask:\n\n1. Some universities require to submit an online application first, and then submitting additional materials such as another personal essay. Is the \"online application\" meaning Coalition?\n2. If so, do I need to complete my Coalition profile and locker before I start my applications for schools? Or can I click \"start my application\" first, and finish my portfolio and locker?\n3. When I submit my teacher's email for a letter of recommendation, how does it work? Does my teacher just have to upload a file or something? (I need to explain the process as my teachers are also unfamiliar with this)\n4. Like I asked in #3, is it the same for counsellors when they submit official transcripts? Just uploading a file?\n5. Do I have to create individual accounts for each school that I'm applying to? Can I not see the status of my application on Coalition?\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "text": "Coalition is a application platform like the CommonApp that you can use to apply to multiple schools.\n\n1. This depends on the university - some only use CommonApp, some only Coalition, some their own application system, and some a combination of these - check their admissions website for details.\n\n2. You can work on the common portion and the school specific portion in parallel.\n\n3. They need to fill in a form and then upload their recommendation letter.\n\n4. Yes.\n\n5. You only create one account for all your applications.",
