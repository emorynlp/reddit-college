Thanks!",

I'm in the same situation, and I know UChicago's website says\n\n>If you are a student attending school outside of the US, you will apply as and be read as an international student. For purposes of your application, we will read your application in the context of where you attend high school regardless of citizenship. If you are US citizen attending high school abroad, then you will be able to apply for federal financial aid, and your application will be reviewed on a need-blind basis like other domestic applicants.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm pretty sure this means we're counted as international for admissions purposes, but we can still apply for federal aid through the FAFSA.",
