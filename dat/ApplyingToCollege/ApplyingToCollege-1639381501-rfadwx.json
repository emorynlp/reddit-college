  "text": "Waiting for my ED results is literally making me manic. I can't bring myself to eat, sleep, focus on studying\u2014or anything outside of the college, for that matter. It's miserable. I haven't experienced this type of psychosis since I went through anorexia.\n\nWhat's more, I am absolutely in love with the school I ED'd to...to the point where I can't imagine being nearly as happy anywhere else. I know it's not good to hyper-fixate on anything, and I try not to, but it's so hard ( also have ADHD which doesn't help). The thought of rejection makes my stomach sink, and the anxiety of knowing my fate is decided yet unknown to me is just nauseating.\n\nSomeone help me stop being so narrow-minded. I know college shouldn't be this serious but idk man. I've always struggled with validating myself through the worst things",

      "text": "Hey Friend-\n\nI totally see the stress you are going through since I would feel the same if I was in your shoes. I think it\u2019s great that you are cognizant that the degree to which this stress is manifesting is unhealthy and it seems like you are wanting to get help/support with that. \n\nDo you have a trusted adult you can talk to about this? Would you be comfortable working with a therapist on this or at least having someone be there to help you process whatever feelings you have once you get that decision? This process can be horrible, especially for folx in ED recovery land. \n\nSending you tons of positive vibes. \u2764\ufe0f",

      "text": "Emotional planning \n\nIt\u2019s time do some emotional planning. Get real with yourself and hope for the best but expect the worst. Know that you did everything you could possibly do but it just probably isn\u2019t gonna work out in your favor and be ready for that. A lot a lot a lot of kids with super shiny amazing applications won\u2019t have decisions go their way.\n\nHere\u2019s a post I wrote this weekend that talks more about emotional planning. https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/r8sjp7/happy_weekend_beautiful_seniors_if_you_applied/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nAnd here\u2019s a podcast from Inside College Admissions from Scoir where I chat about planning for your decisions. https://insidecollegeadmissions.buzzsprout.com/1384537/9651241\n\nThese early decisions can really hurt if things don\u2019t go your way for sure. And it\u2019s ok to give into the pain. But either way \u2014 you got this. You are way more than your college admissions. You will grow and learn and be stronger for it in the end.",

IM SO SCARED I LITERALLY WONT KNOW HOW TO ACT IF THEY REJECT ME. I think i\u2019m literally gonna cry for a month straight and not be able to focus on anything else. i mean that\u2019s kinda what\u2019s happening to me rn cause i have finals that i need to study for but just thinking about the ED results is making me so anxious and stressed i can\u2019t focus on studying at all",
