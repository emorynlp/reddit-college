  "text": "Schools like Harvard, Princeton, etc seem to emphasize that their criteria and standards are the same for REA AND RD. Is the increase in REA acceptance rate due to the increased percent of qualified students who choose to apply early? If so, is there an advantage of REA other than an earlier decision?",

      "text": "The other advantage may be that those colleges tend to defer a large number of apps from REA, so you could get a chance to submit a LOCI, add extra ECs, and have your app looked over twice. But otherwise, the common wisdom is that there isn\u2019t much of an advantage to REA once you account for legacies, athletes, feeder school students, etc., and an overall more qualified pool.",
