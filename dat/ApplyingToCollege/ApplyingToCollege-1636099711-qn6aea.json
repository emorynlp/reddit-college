  "text": "I applied to UW early action about 3 weeks ago. Today, I got an email from their admission office saying that one particular document was missing from my application. It came up in the to-do list under tasks in the myUW portal. However, there is no option to upload it. Could someone who's familiar with this tell me how to send in the document?",

          "text": "It's the official transcript of my secondary school external examination (the icse boards for me, I'm from India). I just looked at the university's website, it says that all transcripts must be submitted directly by counsellors via commonapp. I guess my school counsellor forgot to upload mine. I'll get in touch with her.\nThanks for the reply! You're a legend",
