  "text": "So, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because my brain has been in grind mode of finishing these applications today and I had the blonde moment of the century, but at the end of the application after double checking everything like A THOUSAND TIMES. I realized I put that my parents were not present in California for the passed three years but I somehow put IVE BEEN PRESENT. \n\nI added our address for my permanent address and their address as well and their address is indeed in California and we have never moved out of this state an but i don\u2019t know what happen I misread the question and now i\u2019m stressed. Everything about my application shows I\u2019m from California (where I was born, where I live, Where I attend school) and to my luck this was the only thing I couldn\u2019t edit after submitting the application.\n\nDoes this effect my chances whatsoever? I\u2019m also independent on my taxes Idk if that helps at all BUT PLEASE IM FREAKING OUT I APPLIED TO LIKE 7 UCS",

              "text": "agree with this, emailing them is better than not having it fixed at all. I think they ask bc in state tuition is less than oos, and in state students have advantage esp bc now they cannot take too many oos students",
