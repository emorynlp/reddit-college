      "text": "Hey. So I have applied to universities in the U.K. as well. I sent in my UCAS application this Monday as Oxford requires them by 15th October. Afaik, most universities have an application deadline near the end of January of next year. And they will typically tell you their decision by 19th May. Hope that helps!",
