  "text": "So I live in Nevada. Nevada has 4 schools and all but one suck. University of Nevada Reno is ok, I was planning on applying to it as my safety, but my mom wants me to actually go there, even if I get into a better out of state school. She wants me to go because of the cost - she said that where you go to undergrad doesn't matter at all if you are planning on going to grad school like I am.  On the unlikely chance I get into a top school though, should I attend? How much does the school you go to for undergrad matter?",

A top school for a similar cost is better than a lesser school for similar cost, a top school for quadruple the cost\u2026 probably not. \n\nYou can\u2019t decide until you know how much \u201cmore\u201d is.",

      "text": "Make sure to look at net price calculators for schools that interest you -- depending on your income a selective private out of state school might be really inexpensive after financial aid.  \n\nYou could also qualify for WUE discounts at some other public schools in the west that can make them cost competitive - Colorado State, University of Utah, Oregon State, some Cal States, and others.\n\nIt's easy to overstate how much it matters but a better school for undergrad can have more support resources to make sure you graduate, undergrad research opportunities that can make you more competitive at better grad schools, and things like that.",

      "text": "If the cost is leaving you with 60k+ debt for all 4 years, then I very much doubt its worth it if you have a much cheaper option at home. If its just like 20k, then thats very managable and presitge can easy make up that difference. \n\nJust be sure to run NPC (Net price calculators) on schools youll be applying to and see if you can get any thick merit money anywhere else lol",
