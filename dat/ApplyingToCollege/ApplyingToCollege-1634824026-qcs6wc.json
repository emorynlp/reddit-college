  "text": "Yo guys wtf\ud83d\ude2d... I literally spent months in the Farmers Protest (a protest going on in my country), and like even faced fucking police brutality. And my principal goes \"You shouldn't mention anything political in your application. Colleges won't like it and I won't mention this in your rec letter.\" WTF \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80... Then some fucking administrative assistant says that no matter what teachers right in their LORs, he'll FUCKING READ THEM AND DECIDE WHETHER TO SEND EM OR NOT. WHAAAA?? Goes \"I've been doing this for 18 years... I know how this works.\" Literally doesn't know what common app is\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d. And in all the 18 years he's been \"doing this\", not a single student from our school got in anywhere with scholarship..\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21... Istg this school's going to ruin me\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80",

Either tell your school that you could contact the unis and tell them they didn't comply to the truth, however that's a risky option or just include at places where you have control",
