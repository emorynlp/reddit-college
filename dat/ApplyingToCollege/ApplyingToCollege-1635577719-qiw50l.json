  "text": "One of my colleges doesn\u2019t use the CommonApp so I can\u2019t self-report. However, because of a bunch of family issues I had to skip an AP exam I registered for and ended up getting a 1. I don\u2019t want to show this to colleges, and I can\u2019t find some online step-by-step guide to removing scores! What do I do?",
