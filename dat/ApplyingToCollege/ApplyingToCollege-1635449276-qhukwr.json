      "text": "Hi, would you mind telling me how when you applied and when you got an email with the myillini info? I\u2019m scared because I applied on 10/31 and I know it\u2019s only 11/1, but I haven\u2019t received an email and I know you have to enter courses and grades in the myillini account by 11/10. But if you tell me it took like two days or something, I won\u2019t be so worried lol.",
