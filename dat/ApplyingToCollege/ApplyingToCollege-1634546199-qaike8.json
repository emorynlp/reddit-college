  "text": "Hi! So Im an Indian student who studies under CBSE. On CommonApp under the grades section they ask whether we have any courses with grades on official transcripts to report for 12th grade. I'll only get an official transcript for 12th grade in december or jan after my term 1 exams are conducted. Im applying early so as of now I have no courses listed for 12th grade. Should I attach my predicted marks instead or leave it blank? I've contacted my school and even they're confused about it. If someone could please help asap that would be amazing.",
