  "title:": "I ruined my own NHS Application..",
  "text": "To cut it straight to the point, while I was in the process for applying for NHS I accidentally put an EC (apart of a committee) under \u201cWork Experience\u201d instead of Volunteer Work. I don\u2019t even know how I mistaken the two, but anyways. I feel like this really impacted my chance to get into NHS because my school is very passionate about nonprofit and volunteer work, and I\u2019ve done both, but my resume doesn\u2019t reflect that because of my one mistake.  \n\nBut I really do feel that mistake was really drastic even though it wasn\u2019t meant to happen.  I\u2019ve been feeling very awful about that mistake  because my application feedback stated that \u201cMany aspects of your application were incredibly impressive, but it did not fulfill the criteria set in the application.\u201d , which makes me assume that the lack of volunteer work was a driving factor in the rejection since I feel as if my recommendations, statement, and gpa were pretty good. \n\nSo yeah I\u2019m honestly really upset. I really wanted to be apart of NHS since I care about school involvement and also because my gpa is already not that good (about a 3.5 UW if rounded) due to extenuating circumstances. I\u2019m just over it, really.",

          "text": "Yeah, I talked to a few teachers who told me that they thought my application was impressive and were confused that I got rejected, since I hold 3 leadership positions in school. They felt like it was a mistake but again I\u2019m not too sure. My school is somewhat known for prioritizing kids with higher GPAs and \u201cstrong sense of character\u201d over students who are just alright students with solid ECs, which they did acknowledge to me. but they also said that they would help me. They felt like I should\u2019ve got in regardless. But that\u2019s good to know- I thought that NHS was really crucial towards your application for college.",

It\u2019s pathetically not valuable anymore. Focus on clubs and activities that relate to ur major and sharpen the spike in ur app. Don\u2019t worry bout NHS, you\u2019ll be fine",
