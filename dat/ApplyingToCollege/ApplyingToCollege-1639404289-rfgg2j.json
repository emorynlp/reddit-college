  "text": "i'm an international cbse student currently in 11th. even though i've wanted to go to America since 9th grade and spent a lot of time reading about college apps on reddit, i got extremely lazy beginning through mid of 11th and did nothing academic in the summer before 11th, fuck me. my next possible sat date is in may, which is also my only chance of giving the APs. i've heard they're gonna be more important from now since SAT subject tests are no longer a thing .\n\ni've started to study seriously for the SAT from the past few days, but i keep feeling like it's too late now and i should focus on school and APs. will i end up forgetting everything i learn now? on my first practice test after a little bit of math prep, i got a 1200. 630M 570RW and i'm hoping for a 1550+ on the actual test lmao\n\nis it gonna be realistic to give both APs and the SAT during May? i plan on giving AP CSP, Calc BC, and Physics C. i study math and physics at school so that should supplement my curriculum (hopefully idk i suck at physics)",

      "text": "I did the ACT and 3 APs last May and it worked out - you just have to plan ahead. Also - you can (and most people do) take the ACT/SAT more than once - so one sitting isn't make or break.  Also - don't worry about the Summer - honestly most people I know don't do anything in particular over summer. Some get a part-time job. The applications are all about framing what you HAVE done.",
