I\u2019m top 15% of my class with 4.25 weighted and 3.82 unweighted GPA, no SAT Covid cancellations :( \nWhat other colleges for a finance major do you think I should take a shot at? If anyone here has gone to Bentley did they think it was worth it?",

BC has a decent reputation for finance.\n\nMore undergrad business programs [https://poetsandquantsforundergrads.com/2021/01/11/best-undergraduate-business-schools-ranking/4/](https://poetsandquantsforundergrads.com/2021/01/11/best-undergraduate-business-schools-ranking/4/)\n\nIt might help to test in Dec if possible.\n\nRun the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply.",

I didn\u2019t really like the vibe of Babson or u Amherst but I like BU and loved BC. I wld definitely go to BC if I could same w Northeastern but do you think it\u2019s a reach w my stats. Ik I have really good grades but it seems like those schools are getting so selective nowadays",

      "text": "Looking at finance aswell with around the same GPA as you. Bentley University is probably one of my top choices aswell. BC & UMass Amherst got a really good program although it\u2019s hard to get into. Stonehill, ulowell and Suffolk can probably be some solid safeties for us aswell. I know for myself (3.83, 4.3 gpa, 1320 sat) BC, isenberg and BU are reaches where Bentley is my target. Best of luck!",
