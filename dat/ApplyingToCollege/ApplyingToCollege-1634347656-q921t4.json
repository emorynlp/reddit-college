  "title:": "Is my unweighted gpa a dealbreaker for competitive schools?",
  "text": "So my high school only sends cumulative weighted gpa on our transcript and no unweighted to colleges. Throughout high school, I\u2019ve taken all honors, 7 APs, and multiple medically focused classes that are dual enrollment with good universities. My grades are As and Bs, with one C (I hate this c so much). My weighted is apparently a 4.035 and my unweighted is a 3.6. Is this really bad for me? I heard some colleges recalculate weighted gpas and will see my 3.6 through common app. If it makes it any better, I\u2019m a NMSF and have a 33 act. I plan on applying to competitive colleges (not ivies, but like 10-20% acceptance rates). Will my unweighted gpa rlly hurt my chances?",

      "text": "chill, a 3.6 is well above the avg gpa and its good. explain any reason behind your lower grades, particularly that C, in the addl info and work on what you can control -- your essays and whatnot. these schools are largely holistic, so a gpa slightly lower than the average admit is never a deal breaking one. just compensate elsewhere.",
