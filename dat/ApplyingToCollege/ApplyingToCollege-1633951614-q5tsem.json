  "title:": "Should I report a 3 in AP Chinese",
  "text": "I'm currently a senior applying to colleges and I'm wondering if I should report my 3 on AP Chinese. I am also ethnically Chinese, so I was pretty disappointed with the score. I took the exam in 2020 where it was the 15 minute speaking-only exam, and I just screwed up lol. I got a 5 on every other AP exam I took (9 total). Should I report the score?\n\nCons to reporting:\n\n* 3 is a pretty bad score for schools I'm applying to (T20 reaches, T50 targets)\n\nPros to reporting:\n\n* I took the course so they might find it sus if my score is missing\n* At least it'll look more genuine and they don't care about AP scores that much? idk",
