  "text": "Hello Everyone! Just about finished sending in all my EA applications. I applied to a few colleges but was wondering if anyone would want to recommend schools with good programs for Poli Sci or Int Realations,\n\n**Here are My Stats**: Female - Public High School - Illinois - About 2,000 Kids in Total at my HS\n\n**Gpa:** 3.56/4.0 Weighted **Test scores**: Applied test Op bc my scores were awful\n\n**Activities**: Fencing Team (Captain for 3/4 years), District student board representative, Student election judge (and on Election Day) Foreign Policy youth collaborative club, Global peace ambassador program thing, over 100+ hours community service (National community service ambassador award), School tutor, Religious ed volunteer teacher, + 2 part time jobs\n\n**Common ap essay**: Wrote about being a creative thinker and argued why humans should walk on 4 legs as a metaphor (needed something original)\n\n**Recs**: Spanish teacher (who I went to the Galapagos with on a school trip) + a probably ok counselor rec.\n\nSchools I've applied to:\n\n(ACCEPTED) Valparaiso, UDenver, West Virginia, Seton hall (int relations + law degree) (NEED TO HEAR BACK) Virginia tech, American U of Paris, UofSC, Elon (Also applied to App state but its complicated)\n\nNeedless to say...any other schools I should add?? I love Seton Halls Law program but I was wondering if there's any good schools I can still add with good programs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks :)",
