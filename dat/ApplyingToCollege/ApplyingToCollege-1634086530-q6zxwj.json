Anyone else facing this shit?",

Mind you, she wasn\u2019t a good teacher. She would forget to give details for certain assignments (eg. format) and would lower the grade for those that weren\u2019t exactly as she wanted them. She would give higher grades to sons/daughters of her former students. One thing that happened to me that REALLY pissed me off (apart from the format thing and the fact that she made us spend A LOT of money on big flyers just to give everyone a 8 or less), was when we had an assignment regarding transgenic soy. I made a NINE PAGES research on it, citing all my sources. Turns out she gave me a 9 (which it isn\u2019t a bad grade) and she wouldn\u2019t give me a 10 because my research was \u201cextremely long\u201d, that I just \u201cwanted to brag and seem smarter than my classmates\u201d and that \u201cin real life no one will read something as long\u201d. Truly and odd fellow. I think she was also in love with one of my classmates\u2019 uncle and would always favor him lol",
