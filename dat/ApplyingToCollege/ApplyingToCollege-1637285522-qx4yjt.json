There will be two seminars: anti oppressive studies and critical black studies and both rising juniors and seniors can apply for either. It seems like they'll be somewhat similar to the past TASP programs (free, 6 weeks long, and include a lot of discussion/writing). I assume that they'll still be really competitive. I'm applying for critical black studies!",
