  "text": "So I'm really worried about not being able to afford my top school if I do get in. I would gladly take on all of the student debt in loans but my parents keep telling me that's not possible because they would have to put the loans in their names. Does anyone understand how this works?",

      "text": "There are limits to how much you can take out in student loans per year. If those don\u2019t cover your costs, your parents would have to come up with the rest\u2026after all other financial aid is factored in. Depending on eligibility for financial aid from the college and the government, the shortfall could be more than your parents can afford. \n\nBecause these calculators are not designed to adequately take into account the true ability to pay, most of the time the middle class gets hosed the worst. Very poor and very wealthy have little problems paying for college while those in the middle are expected to pay through the nose.",

              "text": "It means the federal government thinks you and your family can afford to spend $4500 a year for college (tuition, living expenses, books, etc.).  That's definitely on the lower range.  The net price calculator each school has will give you an estimate of what they think you would have to pay after aid - it could be even lower, or it could be higher. Some schools will meet all your need, others won't.\n\nWhen you get an aid estimate, the work study and federal loan that might show up as part of it would be normal things you would expect to have to do to help pay for college.  If the aid includes terms like \"parent plus loan\" or private loans, just think of that part as not being aid at all.",

      "text": "Make sure you have options for schools that are affordable to you (whether out of pocket or through aid). If your top school is unaffordable without a large amount of loans then is it really your top school? Be very careful about taking on significant debt for undergraduate work; you may decide to go to graduate school and need loans then. Also, it's no fun to be in your 20s and have significant debt to pay off; you'll have plenty of other expenses coming your way and depending on your career it could take you 10 years or more to pay off. Proceed with caution and best of luck with your decisions and studies!",

It is way too expensive which is why the federal government doesn\u2019t let you do it and private loan vultures will happily do it on the condition that you stay shackled to them in perpetuity.\n\nThe best way to afford college is to be a top student who can either receive a full need based scholarship at a top private university or a top student who can receive a merit based scholarship at a less competitive university.\n\nThere is no shame in taking two years in community college and transferring to a local in state public school and there is ZERO judgement in pausing for a couple of years to save up some cash to help you pay.",
