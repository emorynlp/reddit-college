  "text": "More than 50 thousand students get admitted to T20's every year. I imagine that every applicant that gets admitted to one of these schools is qualified at to get admitted to any other top school. But they get rejected at the majority of them and get admitted to few, most of the times one. Hell, Harvard admits get rejected at BU, MIT admits get waitlisted at UCD.\n\n\"Oh the guy with 1410 SAT and some club involvement was obviously a better fit than the girl with a 1580 and multiple published research papers.\"\n\nIs that right? Where does this weird and naive view that AO's perfectly determine your personality based on a 500 word personal statement and a generic ass \"Why us?\" essay in the 8 minutes they spend evaluating your application. Did the AO at Uchicago admit the guy with 1410 over the girl with 1580 because he was oh so \"quirky\" and wrote an essay about how mac n cheese is an allegory for college admissions? If so that is bullshit.\n\nMoreover, there are so many people with 1550+ SAT scores, great EC's with clubs internships and research, and good essay writing skills. Unless you are an IMO gold medalist or something, it is near impossible to stand out. The only option left is to shotgun at that point, because the process lacks any semblance of objectivity when selecting between this type of student.\n\nAnd as a risk averse person, boy did I shotgun. 26 schools, 2 safeties, 5 matches, 19 reaches. Lady luck smiled at me her all life, but I don't trust her, and I'm not taking any chances. If I get shafted anyways at this point,  I don't care. I don't know what I could do more.",

Maybe the way someone twitches, combined with their eye contact habits and their propensity for waiting, turns people off subconsciously. Add in other factors like when your admissions officer read your application. You can't ever say with certainty that these factors were responsible, or that they're even bad. But they can still do a lot of harm. \n\nThis has always been my worst fear, honestly, in life. Objectively, I can do pretty much anything I want to. When I get rejected from some positions, it's not because I didn't have the right achievements or because I was a sociopath or something.

Instead, most of those kids are offered Regents as a carrot. The exceptions and odd cases are what we remember.\n\nI also think some of the variability comes from the sheer number of apps UCs deal with. Readers/AOs can talk all day about how they are evenhanded, but we all know a bad day sours how you perceive something or vice versa. The chance that 2 readers have a bad day on the same app is not super high, but if you have so many apps, of course it\u2019s going to happen. There are also probably certain essays or PIQs that are less appealing to some of the UCs vs others, so maybe an answer more easily turned off readers for some reason.",

          "text": "This feels like a consequence of the state of standardized testing in the US, honestly. From what I can tell, entrance exams in other countries can actually tell you something conclusive about an applicant. \n\nThe SAT and ACT really only test math, reading, and writing. The ACT has a \"Science\" section, but it's really just \"reading with graphs\". No science, no history, no social sciences, no anything else. These tests also don't test advanced topics. A lot of people are ready to take these exams in middle school or early high school. \n\nFinding a \"good enough\" score isn't too hard, but past that threshold, you don't get very much information about applicants. Someone who got a 1600 on the SAT isn't necessarily academically smarter than someone who got a 1510, for instance, and I think that's just ludicrous from a test-writing perspective. I got a 2300 on the SAT back when it was out of 2400, which isn't bad but many of my classmates got over 2300, some even 2380+. Yet, I was the only one out of us to win a national Olympiad award. \n\n(And that's not getting into access questions about these exams. It would make WAY more sense for state governments to make the SAT or ACT their high school exit exam, yet they'll throw money at other dumbass exams that ultimately mean nothing in college applications.)\n\nI don't personally agree with admissions relying entirely on one exam, but it would be nice if we had a reliable standardized exam at all. \n\nAnyways, it's really strange that grad schools will ask these types of personality prompts. In my experience, they wanted a personal statement where you do talk about how you got into the field and what outreach you might do outside it, but the focus is by far on your experience and research accomplishments. (Sometimes schools will split the personal statement into a \"Personal History\" and a \"Research\" section, but this is very much like filling out a form but in essay form.) What field are you applying to?",

I studied Computer Engineering for my bachelors and I want to study HCI/Interaction Design... related fields for my masters. I wasnt exactly asked for \"personality prompts\" directly, but alongside your Research Purpose, Interests and Academic CV, they also ask for an statement of purpose which should include your personal history and inspirations from family and life  ...and such, which is bizzare in my opinion because Im a private person and its really not comfortable for me to divulge this information or express myself to strangers in this fashion.",

It feels weirdly corporate, like you need to be \"authentic\" but also very polished. It's one thing from college apps I really did not miss at all. \n\nI was lucky in that my field heavily prioritized research experience. I got into every grad school I applied to and a national fellowship, and I basically just wrote \"I got into this field when I read this book and I did some high school competitions\".

I have no idea. Once upon a time, standardized testing was a far from perfect tool, but that's shifting (and who knows if its for the best or the worst).\n\nFor me, the bigger issue is the sheer insanity of being able to apply to upwards of 20 colleges.  This is a recent development; fifteen years ago, you applied to 5.  Because of this, colleges have many more applications to review.  They've tried to limit this through increasingly insane supplements on the Common App, but y'all are in an untenable position, because while it hurts the system for you to apply to more, no one wants to not get in somewhere, so you have to apply for more.  \n\nMeanwhile, because of rankings, colleges get punished for having a low yield rate, so they use [crazy things](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/14/colleges-quietly-rank-prospective-students-based-their-personal-data/) like cookies to see if you're actually a good fit.  After all, if you're opening every spammy message that they send, then clearly they've captured your interest, so it's a bit safer to accept you.\n\nThe result? You all writing a bunch of applications that barely get read, all while stressed to the max over whether their extracurriculars are good enough or if they bring enough to a campus community, and college admissions officers who have to read a bunch of applications and figure out who actually wants to come be part of a campus that they are passionate about, and who is just hedging their bets.",

      "text": "1.  Yes, most T50 admits are academically qualified to succeed at almost any college.  Yale even says on their admissions website that 75% of their applicants are qualified to do the work there.  \n\n2.  Concepts like fit, yield protection, institutional goals, demonstrated interest (including ED/EA), and holistic review are critical for understanding the paradoxical outcomes and how this process works.  In your example of Harvard vs BU, let me assure you Harvard took that kid because they wanted them more.  BU didn't because there were other applicants they wanted more.  They weren't spinning a wheel or rolling dice.\n\n3.  AOs spend an average of just a few minutes per application.  But they spend a TON more time on the applications that are getting admitted.  Those get multiple reads, discussion, analysis, etc.  If 25% of applications aren't even academically qualified, then those can receive literally seconds of review.  The closer an applicant is to the \"cutoff line\" for admission, the more time the office will spend on them.\n\n4.  AOs aren't trying to understand your entire personality from your application - just the parts that are relevant to them.  How will you engage and impact their community?  What will you contribute to the classroom, lab, dorm, dining hall, fitness center, sports fields, clubs, activities, campus culture, and surrounding community?  The essays are one of the most effective ways for them to understand this.\n\n5.  You mentioned essays being spurious, but so are test scores.  They correlate ridiculously closely with income, and can absolutely be gamed with study and prep.  At the end of the day, that 1410 is in the 96th percentile and the 1580 is in the 99th.  That's simply not that large of a difference and it's possible and even likely that other things in the application will matter more.  A dozen or so multiple choice questions on a random Saturday morning two years ago just aren't that indicative of your ability, potential, and value to a college community.\n\n6.  You're right that there are far too many qualified applicants for the number of spots and it's hard to stand out.  The process is not objective.  It's not \"fair\" or meritocratic.  It never purports to be.\n\n7.  The good news is that it just doesn't matter that much.  Where you go to undergrad isn't all that significant compared to what you achieve there, the skills you cultivate, the network you build, etc.  Most A2C-level students are going to go to grad school anyway, which renders your undergraduate brand nearly irrelevant.  Don't view this as \"getting shafted\" because you will still get an amazing education and have incredible opportunities for success.",

Do you think everyone qualified should be admitted everywhere and then decide where they want to go?\n\nBy my math, there are about 14,000 spots for incoming freshmen for the 8 Ivy League schools each year. And there are about 20,000 kids who score above 1550 on the SAT every year and more with a 35/36 on the ACT. Do you see the problem?",

This despite the fact that his ECs were just above average. Meanwhile, we see other \"higher stat, more impressive EC\" applicants, both domestic and intl, getting straight up rejected from schools with a lower rank than Columbia, despite having a higher EFC.\n\nThe guy with a 1410 deserves every bit of his acceptance. He got accepted over a bunch of kids I know who got a combination of near-perfect SAT scores, higher EFCs, patents, graduated valedictorian (they did end up at T30s though) but I know that in many cases their circumstances were much better in the first place. It's easier to get a 1500+ superscore with tons of money for prep and the ability to retake an exam for like 5 times over someone who only had one shot at taking the exam. The same could apply to ECs, to grades etc.\n\nAt some point, colleges get tired of seeing the same kid who's done research at some university over and over again that they'd take  on someone who has lower stats but a better contribution to the university's community in a heartbeat.\n\nYou'd also be surprised at just how far a 1410 can take you outside of the US. It can get you to top places like Uni College London, sizeable scholarships in top Australian and Canadian schools etc.",

Some colleges will reject or waitlist you if they think you are NOT going to accept their offer of attendance. This happens with really good applicants and their safety school (and even among ivies) - if your stats are obviously good enough for Harvard, the AO might think you have a good chance of getting in and reject you from an \"easier\" school. \n\nColleges do not want to offer a position to say 10,000 students but only 5,000 accept the offer because they got better offers elsewhere.
