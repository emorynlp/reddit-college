  "text": "Hey, y'all!\n\nI've submitted my CommonApp to all my colleges at this point. However, when going through them, I noticed that I accidentally listed the date of my COMPOSITE score on the ACT as Sep. 12, when in reality it was Sep. 11. I list the individual components (English, Math, etc.) as the correct date of Sep. 11. \n\nIt's obviously a minor mistake, and I'm sure they could figure it out. Should I bother sending out emails to each university or should I let it be?\n\nThanks!",
