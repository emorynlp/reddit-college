  "text": "So I just contacted my counselor for the  recommendation and transcripts. I am SCARED. Because I am afraid he will ask for a fee again.\n\nMy school has this dumb policy (borderline illegal and just plain wrong) that those who want to apply to US universities (I am international) have to pay a fee of 233 USD (Converted it from my currency) for the documents to be uploaded to the system and half ass counseling sessions who clearly favor kids with straight A* and a million ec's. We have literally no choice but to pay the fee or I could say bye bye to my dream colleges.\n\nNow I am applying again and this time they also had another fee floating around called a gap year fee which is 116 USD...I JUST CAN'T WIN. I am broke enough as it is and if my school asks for money again then my parents will NOT PAY.\n\nHonestly I don't want them to because the school is ripping kids off to feed my headmistress Gucci purses and Louis whoever the fuck shoes. Please pray for me..\n\nEdit: thank you so much for all of your advice! I didn't actually think my post will get so much notice but you guys proved me wrong. Some of you are asking about where I am from and I am not comfortable sharing that information on the internet but all I can say is that I am south asian. Oh and my counselor is ignoring me so I can't give you guys an update (if you want me to update you..idk) but I'll try to keep you posted. Again thank you for reading my post. \u2764",

I understand that you aim at certain ones, for different reasons, but the difference between the quality of education in different unis cannot be that big.\n\nI get that if you're going to Harvard it acts as a status symbol and you might benefit from it indirectly through networking, but if getting there most likely leads to failure, worst-case scenario depression and no social life I can't see the pros ever outweighing the cons when you could opt to any other uni\n\nI'm truly sorry if this sounds ignorant, I'm not by choice, but coming from Finland this entire concept is strange to me because people here obviously lack having 30 universities teaching the same exact thing and so I think I definitely qualify as ignorant (or uneducated).",

                  "text": "I see, so you were referring more to getting into specific top schools. I think that question transcends whether you're an international or national student. Harvard, for instance, gets tens of thousands of applicants from everywhere, so it's kind of moot. \n\nBut to get at the question, specifically with international students in mind, honestly a lot of it is misperception. Here in Peru, for example, parents only know a handful of American universities, and they're very close minded about others. I literally just recommended Nova Southeastern to a student who wants to study neuroscience. I've been to NSU's campus, they have a great program, and they have dual admission so you can go straight to med school. \n\nMom wouldn't let me add it to her list because \"it wasn't within her expectations for her son\". When I asked why she didn't think NSU was good enough, her response was simply \"I've never heard of it before.\"\n\nAnother misconception is that an \"average\" university abroad is not going to be better than the \"best\" local college. Not true. Also, kind of misses the point of going abroad. So they only apply to top schools because if you don't get in there, then what's the point of going abroad? It's this closedmindedness that irritates me. Going abroad is about so much more than the academic reputation of the institution.  \n\nSo you've got parents who know jack shit about universities abroad, and students who know even less. Without guidance they all end up pushing for these top schools, and the disappointment and frustrations that you touched on in your original post.",

And holy shit do I feel bad.\n\nLike, there are bad parents, but these parents are good, but just horrible in one aspect (could be more, obviously, but that's disregarding the point).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm super glad that my parents pretty much quit school as soon as it was a realistic possibility so I've never had pressure, but I've always literally gotten to ignore what they care about and just did my thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly It's kind of a shame that this isn't the norm, I had to grow up rather fast when it came to responsibility (according to some people I'm still a child at heart in different ways though) but it also gave me so much freedom I'm happy for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just feel like getting into an university is the first real time you're truly making a big decision for yourself (as the studies often lead to a career). And so you should be allowed to make the decision for yourself while the closest people in your life support you.\n\nNow learning this isn't the case and creates a shitload of pressure is honestly fucking annoying, wish you all the best.",

We try to encourage our client-parents to let go and be supportive, but at the end of the day they're the ones that pay the bills.
