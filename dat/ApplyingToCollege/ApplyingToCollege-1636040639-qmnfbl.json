  "text": "I know this sounds like a stupid question \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d but please hear me out. If my interviewer introduced himself as Jon Smith (not real name), how do I address him in the interview and on email? I checked his Linkedin and he has a PhD. Do I call him by Jon Smith, Dr Smith or Mr Smith? Also, do I need to send my common app activities to him or do I just wait until he asks for it?",
