  "text": "Hi, I've just finished my A-Levels in the UK (A\\*AAC) and am considering studying a fashion course in Italy. I don't have the funds for a private university + living costs in a city like Milan without a scholarship. I have looked for Fashion courses (that's including Design, Business and Stylist) in English, but couldn't find any that are not super expensive. If any of you are studying fashion Italy, have experience or any useful info, I'd be very thankful for your responses.",
