  "text": "i\u2019m thinking about getting rid of my last two classes and working after completing college applications, then doing dual enrollment second semester (free classes cuz i\u2019m low income). but will early release look bad for colleges? i\u2019m a painfully average student so i don\u2019t want to do anything that\u2019ll ruin my chances\u2026also i feel like i\u2019m gonna miss out on some social interactions if i leave early, but idk if those 20 minutes with my friends are worth the two hours of sitting through 5th and 6th period. idk if i\u2019m gonna be ready to drive in snow and rain too, maybe i\u2019m overthinking it but i have anxiety so it\u2019s hard not to. but early release still seems appealing to me it\u2019s just so complicated. idk what i wanna do and i have to decide within the next few days. any advice would help but pls be nice cuz i\u2019m just so stressed rn.",
