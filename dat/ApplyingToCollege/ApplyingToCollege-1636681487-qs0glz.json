  "text": "Applying to multiple UCs as an out of state student, and I just realized that they require two arts credits (because schools in my area operate on semester schedules) and I didn't realize that UC required one whole year. I'm in my senior year, and I was wondering if I could take classes at my local community college to fulfill the requirement. \n\nAlso, if I were to take the courses, does 1 semester hour credit (SHC) = 1 semester credit, so that 1 class that gives 3 SHCs = enough units for UC?",

OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.",
