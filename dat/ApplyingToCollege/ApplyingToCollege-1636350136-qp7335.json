  "text": "I have theatre production right now and I am wondering if this can be considered as one of 5/6 academic course when i apply to the universities.\n\nAlso, I had to take one social study course to complete grade 11, but there is no social study 11 so we all took one of social studies 12. I took 20th century world history 12. Is this going to be considered as a grade 12 level course?",
