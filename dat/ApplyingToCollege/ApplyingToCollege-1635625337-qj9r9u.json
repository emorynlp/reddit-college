  "text": "3 schools I am applying to (UT Austin, Michigan, Carnegie Mellon) show that the transcript is missing when I check the application portal. \n\nSpecifically, UT Austin MyStatus says my transcript was declined because I uploaded an unofficial transcript (even though I didn\u2019t upload anything and my guidance counselor sends those like every other damn school in the nation).\n\nHowever, 4 of my other schools have received the transcripts. I have contacted my counselor and the 3 schools. Anyone have any explanations? Thanks a bunch!",
