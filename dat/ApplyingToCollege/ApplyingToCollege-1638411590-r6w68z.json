  "text": "Anyone remember what the phase 1 of the scholarship asked for? I can\u2019t seem to remember what I put in. Did it ask for activities list, etc? Or was it just counselor sending in transcript \n\nAlso, anyone know the amount of people that applied? I\u2019m trying to figure out what the \u201cacceptance\u201d rate for the semi-finalists is\n\nThx \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",
