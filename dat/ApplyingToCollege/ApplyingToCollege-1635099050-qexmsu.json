  "text": "So I just got a job yesterday but I won\u2019t begin for about 2 weeks and I have been planning an event that I\u2019ll be leading in a few weeks as well, but for the ea deadline of Nov 1, these won\u2019t be done in time. Can I still add them to my activities but state when I\u2019m starting them or is that weird? These activities have (or will) take up a lot of my time",
