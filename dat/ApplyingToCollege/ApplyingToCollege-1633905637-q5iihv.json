              "text": "> Or why companies have special internships for women? \n\nThe vast majority of companies don't have it and those that do, are majority men. It's almost like they exist because their existing recruiting pipelines are unfairly, auto-biased towards men. \n\nLike when Amazon thought it had a good recruiting system so it tried to automate it based off of past data and it was so bad that they found out their recruiting algorithm literally devalued a candidate if there was the word women on their resume? Turns out, their great hiring committees were subconsciously or consciously biased against women the entire time. \n\nYou wanna know why there doesn't exist a white male internship program at Morgan Stanley? Because since they were founded 90 or so years ago, they've de facto been white male only for 50 of those years, have been majority white male for another 20-30, and only in the last 10 years are we seeing real change where there's a lot more representation of minorities and other demographics. But even that change is only at the entry level. Of the [20 people](https://www.morganstanley.com/about-us-governance/operating-committee) in Morgan Stanley's operating committee, 5 are women, 5 are visible minorities (there are some overlaps). And that's probably the best it has ever been. There are more men named John in the F500 CEO list than there are women. \n\nBut sure, the real victims are men, who also happen to disproportionately control just about every powerful governmental institution and every important company in America, right?\n\nEdit: downvotes but no arguments. Probably because everything I said is based on fact.",
