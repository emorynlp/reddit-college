  "text": "I'm in a kids against hunger club where we met every other week and learned about hunger crises. There were also food packing events (2 hrs and approx 3-4 semester) that I attended. I'm still debating if I should include this activity but assuming that I do, what do I put for the position description? Another club I've been in 9th-12th is biology club where we have presentations on various biology topics. We also prepare as a club for the Biology Olympiad and take it in Jan/Feb. I was never an officer nor did I place in the semi-finals either time I took it, so I don't know if it's worthy to include. help \ud83d\ude14",
