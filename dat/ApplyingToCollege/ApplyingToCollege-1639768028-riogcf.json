  "text": "Bit of a dumb question but I just want to make sure - I applied to 3 schools on the 15th, and all of them said I could submit my SAT scores from this months test despite getting the results after the deadline. I\u2019ve already sent official score reports to all 3 today, but should I email them to let them know this as well? And if I do, should I include what the scores were so they can use it in the application process instead of waiting for the scores to get there?",
