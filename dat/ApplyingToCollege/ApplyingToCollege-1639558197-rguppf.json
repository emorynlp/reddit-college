  "title:": "How I got into Dartmouth solely with my essays.",
  "text": "I recently got a call from a Dartmouth admissions officer breaking down crying apparently it was the best essay she\u2019s ever read in her life. My personal statement was about the time I chugged a beer outside a 7/11 so fast that a homeless guy gave ME $5. I subsequently bought him a pack of cigarettes and we became friends and I brought him to high school parties every weekend. \nAnyways here are my stats:\nGPA 3.1 W 2.9 UW\nSAT/ACT: Optional (I slept in too late and missed it\ud83d\udc80)\nDemographics: White dude. My parents make $5 million/yr combined and my dad is the President of Dartmouth. \n\nIn conclusion, anybody with mediocre stats, there is still hope!!!!",
