Like worst class I\u2019ve taken ever. Worse than BC. Worse than APCSA. Worse than ur mom. And I cant even drop cus that would make me a pssy. So I wont. \n\nBut still yo this class sucks nuts",

My school does both in 1 year too. \n\nPhysics C is hard bro, my teacher also has this weird ass thing called group tests. Basically you have 2 or 3 people in a group and they take the test together. And he will randomly select one of their papers and grade only that. Whatever that person gets, the whole group gets. \n\nI'm not a god at physics C, and I'm mediocre myself. But bro I was hard carrying my team, I was literally doing everything and they were just copying off me. He selected the person who did the first question on her own and didn't correct it despite it being wrong. We got a 60 on the text. The average was a 65 or 70 though. It was also too long and most people didn't finish.",
