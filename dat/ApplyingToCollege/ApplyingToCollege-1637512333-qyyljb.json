  "text": "Hi. Is it ok to start an essay with a dialogue?\n\nI started my essay with dialogue. More like a sound.\n\nIt goes like this:  '\"DING\" rang the school bell'\n\nAnd then I  just put another dialogue and continue with my story without giving a hint of what was happening. I just went to tell that story. So, it is more of a narrative, describing the complete situation of the moment. And, spoiler alert: It's all about failure. Like, I express everything about my situation, and then, I bring up the twist by failing in that task or situation.\n\nFinally, in the conclusion, I TALK. I talk about my middle present self (the earlier one was my past self, 8th grade me, then, in conclusion, am talking about my 9th or 10th-grade self) and how I encountered the same situation and did well that time and that shaped me who I am today (it relates to my ECs a bit as well (but not my major)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, my question is: Is it a good narration? Like, not showing any of my good qualities anywhere in the essay (other than the conclusion), just describing the situation and finally failing. And, at the end of about 50 words, I talk about the 'change' that is brought, like describing how it shaped me today and stuff (it sounds good and not a cliche, trust me). However, I am worried that I won't be able to show what I bring to their college.**\n\nThere are a lot of dialogues in between. So, it's just a full narration essay with dialogue and stuff.\n\n**How does it sound like?**\n\n**DO i share a few starting line of my essay to you?**",

      "text": "I can\u2019t really judge your essay off of what you gave, but the point of the essay should be ti make the school see you as an asset that can thrive there, so if the whole essay is about failure with a minimal section about what you learned/how you changed, I don\u2019t really get a full picture of who you are. I would talk more about yourself, especially if you failed because of an external situation, rather than your own actions. In any case, writing about yourself in a bad light can be risky\u2014but since I haven\u2019t ready your essay, please take everything I say with a grain of salt lol",
