  "text": "I have a general idea of what to do when having been deferred at a university, but am curious as to what specific course of action would be the most beneficial to me. I\u2019ve got new SAT results coming in tomorrow that are hopefully better than the ones I submitted in November, but know it will take a lot more than that to get off the \u2018maybe list\u2019. Aside from submitting a letter of continued interest, what events, projects, etc. did you take part in during the 2-3 months following your deferral that resulted in your eventual acceptance? Did you do anything unique for your letter of continued interest that you felt helped you stand out? I\u2019ve got a few ideas but don\u2019t want to waste my time doing something that will be seen as negligible by the admissions office. Thanks in advance to those willing to share.",

      "text": "I think a common misconception is that what students do after their deferral is what got them in. Most students who receive a deferral are quality candidates, but the admissions committee would like to review them with the entire body of applicants. The people who get into Harvard REA are the people Harvard absolutely know they would take even in the RD round. It is worth sending a LOCI, but with a school like Harvard, unless you do something really significant over the next few months, your chances will not change drastically. Harvard knows their yield rate is extremely strong. They are not worried about students\u2019 interest, because they know the vast majority of those who get in will undoubtedly attend. It really is a game of luck with these top schools\u2014speaking from experience. I think a LOCI will keep you on the maybe list, and it will come down to how you fit in the RD pool. I think not submitting a LOCI makes it easier for the officers to reject you RD.",

              "text": "I don\u2019t think a video would be a good choice for Harvard. They are not a quirky school, so I don\u2019t feel like they would appreciate it. I would stick to a one-page LOCI. You also have to remember that these officers only spend around 10 mins on a read, so I am unsure if they would even watch a video.",
