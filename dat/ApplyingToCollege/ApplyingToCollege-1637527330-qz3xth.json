  "text": "soo i have a giant test tomorrow and presentation tomorrow but im typing this out. i feel so stuck and hopeless and i was wondering if you guys had any insight. \n\ni've lived in a strict, fgli, tiger parent household for all of my life. when my sibling didn't get into the top middle school in our area, they was constantly beaten and berated. now, ever since when i didn't get into my parent's desired hs (~ 3 yrs ago) my life has took a turn for the worse. last year in august, i had my school loaned ipad smashed and my arms/knees were smashed with a knife; the bruises were purple and i took a pic of one. i lied and told the vp of my school that the device just randomly stopped working. another time when i was sneaking on a device at night (my curfew is extremely early), i had two laptops smashed. \n\nfor 3 years straight, i've been called weak, a loser, and stupid by my mom, and seriously mocks me for being sad - these have all happened so constantly. i haven't been able to do able ECS (activities) for college applications bc of my extreme device limit during quarantine, and just a huge lack of motivation. \n\ni genuinely thought that i could hold out and do my best to get into an elite college to escape this house. but as i'm only starting 11th, and feeling so bad, i'm not sure what to do. i do have an appointment with a psychiatrist next month but im not sure if ill make it until then. i did tell my guidance couns/school social worker/adult irl, but it really hasn't helped. cps came to my house last week, but i don't think they're going to take any action besides checking to see if i get any more physical bruises. they did ask for a pic of the one my mom gave me last year, which i have yet to respond to because im not sure what will happen.\n\neven thought my mom has stopped the physical abuse, i still feel so unbelievably unmotivated and sad every day. even my passions don\u2019t even make me happy now. i generally have a strict curfew so i usually just go home with my mom being home all evening. i hate my high school location, and i don't have any genuinely close friends or even any friends in general. even if i do form some they\u2019re gonna to be fickle or fade out like they do in the past, or it wont be a genuine one. i'm starting to struggle in school bc i've been slacking off, and my grades/teachers impressions are dropping which i know are going to kill my admissions chances because junior year grades are the most important.  \n\nthank you for reading through this long rant and sorry for any typos ^^",

      "text": "This actually sounds exactly like myself in 8th grade, albeit my parents didn't actually break anything super important. That aside, it's good that you're getting help. I, unwisely, was never able to get help, and while I won't actively try to kill myself, I think I would be happy if I died somehow. Either way, I'm still here. Definitely can relate to the part abt being berated by your mom-- having a parent tell u to kill urself almost every day is really not fun, and it's definitely hard to do a lot of things when ur parents are so strict with devices.\n\nWhat I did in my situation is, I took something that I was already doing (piano and art in my case) and kind of just expressed my emotions through it. Even if I wasn't passionate abt it necessarily, it helped to get a lot of the stuff I couldn't say out, which I think is very helpful. It also kind of gives you a hobby which is good for colleges.\n\nAt the worst, I also tried to give myself things to look forward to. E.g. if there was an extra day off from school in like a week, I would say something like \"oh it's only 1 week then I get to do whatever I want on that day off\" or if my parents were going to a specific store the next day I would think \"ok I won't kill myself because I have to eat [whatever good food I wanted to eat] before I die\". Imo u just need to find something you care about enough to keep going.\n\nAnother thing: cps is absolutely fucking useless. They literally just went to my house, talked to my parents, and left, which only made it much worse for a while. Then I guess my parents eventually stopped caring. I think I'd avoid talking to cps too much.\n\nAlso, in general: a little bit is better than nothing. For example, even if u can only bring urself to do 2 math problems that day, it's fine. Just do as much as you can as early as you can, even if you have no motivation left. \n\nTalk to ur teachers if u have late work, and ask them if you can make it up. There are usually quite a few ecs you can get just by joining clubs at school too, so that definitely helps. And if you can, try to get a job and save up some money. Good luck.",

      "text": "First off, you are incredibly strong to have endured everything you have. You shouldn't have had too, no child should, because your home should be your sanctuary and the place you look forward to entering each day. It's terrible that you feel such a need to escape. But I don't think ANYONE would blame you. \n\nI'm just giving you my opinions, so do take it with a grain of salt.\n\nI'd say you should prioritize your mental and physical wellbeing; we are nothing without them. Get into exercise if you could, simple routines in your room (I could send you a list of workouts/exercises if you'd want, that way you don't need to watch videos with your limited screen time). \n\nDeal with your trauma and don't neglect yourself when you are having a bad day. Could you try telling your parents/mother you have some sort of mandatory study group that you absolutely must go to? That way you could get some peace and quiet to yourself for a bit. \n\nGiven your trauma, could you go to the police? This is largely dependant on your comfort zone, but you have been seriously harmed by your parents and you have evidence of it. You could also call one of the numbers under USA [at this link](https://checkpointorg.com/global/), I'm not sure how much help they would be but it doesn't hurt to try? You could call the number during lunch at school and if you don't have a phone, then you could borrow a teacher's or counselers. Who cares if they see who you've called? Given you've told them what you are going through, maybe it might tell them to really take you seriously and for them to stop being so darn unhelpful.\n\nI can't believe you haven't shouted at your parents in anger. If you really need to (given everything you've already been through, it might be something to consider) try appealing to a kind parent/community member and ask them if you could stay in a room of theirs? Tell them everything you are going through. You could also try setting up a fundraiser on GoFundMe and write your whole story there ([https://www.gofundme.com/en-ca](https://www.gofundme.com/en-ca)). A friend of mine raised 2000 dollars to go to a science fair through GoFundMe, so hopefully people would listen to your cause if you spell our what your situation is as amazingly as you did here. Then you could hopefully get enough money to rent a place somewhere near where you live so that you are away from your family? Just an idea. \n\nIf you really need to get out of your house, just go. You could enter the foster care system. \n\nIt takes bravery to bee in your position and fight. More people should see this post. I hope that things work out with time, and that you have access to everything you need. Don't lose hope and don't give up! \n\nPS. The Harry Potter books are available online and you could probably get them at a library or your school. They have helped me through difficult times, and it might bring you some comfort.",
