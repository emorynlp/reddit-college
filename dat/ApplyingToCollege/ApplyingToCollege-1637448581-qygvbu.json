  "text": "I'm currently a senior looking to apply to some UCs. The problem is I haven't yet fulfilled the fine arts requirement and none of the courses I'm taking this year will help. My plan is to sign up for the AP Art History and (depending on if I get in or not) self-studying for the exam. Is this plan viable? \n\n&#x200B;\n\np.s. their website does explicitly say that a score of >3 for AP Art History does fulfill the requirement, but I wont have this at the time I apply as the exam is in May.  Thanks in advance!",

And also know that since it's after 12/15, you will be paying a late fee for the exam, and that it is your responsibility to find a test center to register you. Many are not allowing outside students to register.\n\nAny acceptance offer will be conditional on you getting a 3+, or otherwise fulfilling the requirement.",
