  "text": "Honestly, I'm not even sad that I got rejected from that school. But it's the people around me, like, what are they thinking of me now? I tried my hardest, and I'm afraid they'll think I'm not good enough. I know that fate is fate, but I really wish I could see my future, no matter what it is. It's not the result that scares me, but it's the unknown. Anyways, I'm really doubting myself now... no matter all the \"sorry's\" I get.",
