  "text": "Dear A2C, \n\nI hope y\u2019all are doing well. \n\nI just want you to know: at the end of this process, you\u2019re going to be fine. Last year, when I got deferred ED by Bowdoin College, I was crushed. I legitimately didn\u2019t understand how I was going to be happy anywhere else. \n\nNow, I couldn\u2019t be happier. As a freshman at Davidson, I have access to amazing faculty, classmates, staff, and a beautiful campus. This process doesn\u2019t define you. At the end, you\u2019ll be okay. \n\nBest, \nSomeone who cared way too much about this process.",
