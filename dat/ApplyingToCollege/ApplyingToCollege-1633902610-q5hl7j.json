  "text": "For some reason when reviewing my submitted A&M Application the format of my extracurricular activities is completely out of order. For example, my 6th activity was my membership in my school's national social studies honor society. I was only a member of it senior year. The activity I included for 7th EC was football during my freshman year. For some reason when looking at my football activity, it also includes my membership in national social studies honor society during my senior year. So like when viewing the football EC it shows my hours as a freshman and my title of \"football player\" but then it also includes my NSSHS membership title of \"member\" and includes those hours on the senior year part of my football EC.  Hopefully you can kind of understand this? Basically, in the EC section the hours and memberships are overlapping and I can't change it. It isnt happening to just NSSHS and Football, it's also occuring to like 4 of my activities. I can promise you I triple checked my activities section to make sure everything was right and in order before submitting and now when reviewing the submitted EC list, it's totally messed up. Should I contact the A&M office of admissions tomorrow?",
