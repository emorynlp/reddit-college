  "text": "I was about to submit my UC application but it says i\u2019m missing a geometry requirement in math. I took geometry in 8th grade so I can\u2019t report it on my Academic History page, and I even took an integrated math course in freshman year which covered geometry. I\u2019m in Calc BC right now. There\u2019s a button at the bottom of the review and submit page that says to confirm that I\u2019m missing the geometry requirement but I don\u2019t know if that will make me ineligible for admission to UCs. Has anyone else had this problem?",
