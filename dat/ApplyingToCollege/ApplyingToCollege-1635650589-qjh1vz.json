      "text": "Hi Striking_Care2492!\n\nWhen it comes to SAT / ACT scores and submitting them, most colleges accept self-reported scores (aka the score you typed into the common application). This should be sufficient / not require an official score report from CollegeBoard / ACT.\n\nIn the off chance that the college requires an official score report, I know of students who submitted the official report even a month later and it didn\u2019t impact their chance of getting into the university. The only purpose of the official score report is for colleges to confirm that your score is official / legit.\n\nHope this helps!",
