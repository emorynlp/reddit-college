  "title:": "Which colleges should I be applying to with 29 IB points?",
  "text": "I did really bad in school (29/45 IB points-- approximately 3.2GPA), but I talk a bit about it in my essays (subjects I took weren't of my own interest-- story of finding myself, etc.). I have somewhat strong SAT score (1470) and excellent ECs (internships, several volunteer experiences, and international sports recognition). Subjects I want to major in college were strong in my transcript.\n\nWith this profile, what colleges should I be applying to? Those that match my GPA achievement level (where everything else won't help me) or a little bit higher (those that are above my GPA achievement level)?",
