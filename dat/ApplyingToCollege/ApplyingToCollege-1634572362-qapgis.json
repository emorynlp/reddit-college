  "text": "So I got an email from a shitty state school awhile ago, saying if I polled they would process it in a week without a fee or essays required. I did that, got an acceptance, and now have realized, does this mean I can\u2019t apply to any other schools that are rarely decision or restricted early action? Or did this application just count as normal decision?",
