  "text": "So basically, my pops approached me and wants to help me with my college apps through his pretty extensive web of connections. He knows directly, or through good friends/his own partners, trustees at some of the top LACs. Should I let him do this? Aside from the ethics of this, would this help my app in any beneficial way? Or would it even piss off the admissions officers that I'm in a sense trying to backdoor my way into their colleges? I'm a US citizen but go to school abroad in Europe, I have a decent app that's probably somewhat competitive (36 ACT not like that matters at all anymore lmao).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks, and sorry if this comes off as pretentious, I just want to get into college.",
