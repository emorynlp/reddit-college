  "text": "I have this daunting question about whether mentioning proficiency in foreign language like Hindi in resume for college admission helps or will have any negative effect? I am proud of my heritage and I support my daughter to explicitly indicate Hindi along with English in her resume while she applies for college. However my husband thinks mentioning a language like Spanish or any other European language in resume was great but mentioning Hindi does not create same excitement  and might give negative effect in some cases as it  may result in unnecessary profiling . My daughter is very keen on mentioning Hindi in resume and she is determined show it on resume. My husband suggests even if you have to learn Spanish.. do that but replace Hindi by Spanish as its more relevant in US.  Wanted some more thought on this topic.",

      "text": "If she's proficient in Hindi, it's fine to list on a college resume. As far as profiling, if that were to happen, it could just as likely be gleaned elsewhere - her name, your name, your college, etc.\n\nFor a post-college resume, mentioning Hindi (or Spanish for that matter) will unlikely make an HR exec jump up and down unless those skills are needed for the job.",
