  "text": "So like how do the credits from AP work. If I take an AP for let's say physics, but I don't require a physics class in college, would the credit still be used\n\nI want to pursue computer science and my counselor says to give AP unites States history and physcology",

      "text": "Depends on the college. If the score earns credit, you get the credit. If you don't need a physics course in college, it counts as a free elective.\n\nNote that for some colleges, AP scores can't apply to the major. You may not need to retake the course, but you'd take an additional course instead.",

      "text": "You take the test and get a score from 1 to 5.  A score of 3 is the lowest any school typically gives credit for.   Every school is different with respect to what scores they require on which tests in order to get credit.  Some don't give credit at all and just place you into a higher course.  If, at a given school, you can claim course credit, then you get that credit regardless of whether it's needed for your degree.  If it's for a grade (as opposed to simply \"pass\") then it may affect your GPA.\n\nWith respect to U.S. History and Psychology, most schools in the U.S. have elective requirements even for CS degrees, so course credit for those classes may allow you to skip taking those courses in college if they would be required.\n\nBeyond course credit, simply taking \"rigorous\" classes (in all areas, not just CS/Math/Science) during high school makes you a stronger applicant.",

      "text": "You would get credit on your transcript for the course, but it won\u2019t reduce the Plan of Study for your degree. I.e., you still need to take the same courses.\n\nCheck all of the requirements in your Plan of Study. There may be science electives, free electives, etc., that a Physics credit will fulfill, even it doesn\u2019t specifically call out a Physics course.\n\nUSH and Psych are good courses and likely will fulfill some requirements in most programs.",
