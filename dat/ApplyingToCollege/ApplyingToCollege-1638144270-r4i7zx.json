  "text": "Hey, so I'm a genderfluid senior applying to college and i was wondering how exactly i might tackle that kind of thing. Should i just not bring it up at all and act cisgender? Or would it help me a little in the diversity department? My main fear is that the admissions officer reading my essay might be one of those \"genderfluidity isn't real\" people, which would really hurt my chances. \n\nI am applying to mostly liberal arts colleges like Brown, UPenn, Harvard, etc. but unfortunately it's not a given that people will actually \"believe\" in my gender identity, even in liberal areas. \n\nThanks for any help!",

I'm not sure if it will give me any sort of \"diversity boost\" as you mentioned (if anything it'll probably hurt me as I'm afab and applying for engineering lmao) but I wanted to represent myself as honestly as possible to admissions readers. And if they reject me because they think my gender identity is fake I don't want to go to the school anyways.\n\nBtw to reassure you there's non discrimination polices for lgbt individuals in admissions at most colleges, and schools like Brown especially will probably be accepting.",
