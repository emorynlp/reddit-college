  "text": "I'm an International Student currently studying as a high school junior. I recently learned of the Bank of America Student Leaders program which is essentially an internship for HS students. I'm still very confused about that program and can't seem to find information about it, I would really appreciate it if any of you had information about it. However, my question is about Extracurricular activities that a student interested in majors like Business, Economics, and Finance could do that are similar to the Bank of America one and look good on my application. I would really appreciate this and thank you very much.",
