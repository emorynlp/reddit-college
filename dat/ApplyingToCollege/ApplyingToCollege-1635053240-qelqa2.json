I want to say that after I was diagnosed with anxiety I did a lot of reading into anxiety/psychology and that my counselor really helped me feel more confident about taking care of my mental health and I want to help others feel confident too but I\u2019m worried AOs will think it\u2019s not good for someone with mental illness to study psych or be a doctor (also interested in pre med) \n\nThis is for a \u201cwhy x major\u201d essay btw",
