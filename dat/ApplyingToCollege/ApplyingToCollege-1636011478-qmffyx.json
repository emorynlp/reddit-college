I had a friend tell me it should only be 1-2 pages but if I'm including ecas from outside my activities list I feel mine would be around 3-4 pages\n* do school activities count on this list?\n* how much description should I go with for each activity?\n* will using the default google docs resume format be looked down upon by AOs?",
