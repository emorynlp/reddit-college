  "text": "Hey, let me start off by saying that I am an international applicant and that EC's are a lot less \"supported\" here, in here high school is almost entirely academic.

I always felt so disadvantaged in this field, I saw the crazy lists of a lot of American applicants and was intimidated.\nWe never had any clubs to lead, or competitions to win, none of this was ever encouraged (it wasn\u2019t disencouraged either but still). \nDo you really think these are enough (both in number and \u201cprestige\u201d) to compete for top schools?",

              "text": "I feel you. It\u2019s more than okay. In my case, I did have a few ECs, but not as crazy as some people\u2019s, since the curriculum is HARD. Like, we work in something called tech education, that\u2019s basically a normal curriculum + 5 courses on a specific area. This 5 courses represent what you specialize on, for example, mine is marketing and commerce, this year I\u2019m doing consumer taxes, information systems, interviews and polls & entrepreneurship. It\u2019s not easy to maintain good grades and EC\u2019s, but we got this!!! Just don\u2019t compare yourself to ppl and all will be well",
