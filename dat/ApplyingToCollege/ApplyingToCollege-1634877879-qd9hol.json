  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI already submitted my Common App to UNC. Do I have to submit my school transcript separately through Parchment, or is that something my counselor puts in the school report section of the Common App she uploaded? It says I have till November 1 to put in my supplemental materials, so I am assuming I have till then to submit my transcript. Thank you!",
