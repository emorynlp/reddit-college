  "title:": "How much will scholarships/ financial aid be effected if I graduate high school early?",
  "text": "\nThe title pretty much sums it up. I am a high school senior thinking of graduating a semester early. I was wondering how much it would effect my eligibility for scholarships since I won\u2019t have an official class rank. On some scholarships I know that I meet the requirements without class rank as I have a 4.43 weighted GPA (3.7 unweighted) and my SAT is an 1160.",

      "text": "Most high schools do not rank.\n\nIf you are referring to outside scholarships, you would need to look at the rules for the specific scholarship. (Most outside scholarships tend to be small amounts.)\n\nSome general thoughts on paying for college:\r first see whether you are eligible for any *need-based* financial aid. Run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.) Federal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow. Larger loans require a parent signature and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow.\r  \nIf the *need-based* estimate does not make the college affordable for your family, then look for *merit scholarships*. ***Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves***. Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college. (You can also apply test optional.)\r  \nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/; see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family.",
