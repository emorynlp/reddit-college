  "text": " I'm applying via joint application to a few finnish universities. My grades aren't the best, apart from English (9 or a 10 almost every year). My math is in the medium zone (5 or 6, sometimes a 7) and my IT grades took an hit this year and last year (used to be 8s and 9s, now it's 5 or a 6). I did a few practice SATs and I got the scores 1120, 1230 and 1210. The only scoring reference regarding SATs I could find was on kamk, which only needs a 800.\n\nWhat do they look at primarily?",
