I say that only because the person making the hiring decision may be a bit more likely to have gone to those schools.  But really it doesn't matter at all as long as you're in like the top 10-20.\n\nKeep in mind that half the students at the ivies are there for sports/legacy, so anything top 20 or so is viewed fairly similarly.  Course of study/performance is more important.",

Nope, not at all. If I were looking for economists, I would not look at Caltech; and, if I were looking for someone studying agriculture or resource economics... I would not look at ANY of these schools.\n\nSo small differences do not matter much, but areas of expertise do matter.",
