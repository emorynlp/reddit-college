      "text": "Try r/IntltoUSA. And please google as well. Extremely common question.\n\nUnderstand the difference between need-based financial aid and merit scholarships. There are only a handful of schools that both meet full financial need for internationals (as calculated based on the school's own formula) and are need-blind for admission (won't consider your need), and these schools are extremely competitive for admission. There are more schools that may give need-based aid but are not need-blind for admission. The rule of thumb is that acceptance rates for internationals to top US schools tend to be around half the overall rate.\n\nMerit scholarships (based on your academic credentials) you would find at lower ranked schools, especially those that offer large automatic merit. If your family can afford at least living expenses, these become possible. Google for lists of schools with large automatic merit.",
