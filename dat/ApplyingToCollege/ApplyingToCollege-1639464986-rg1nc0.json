So that will be past the deadline. I have to accept this school as a back up. I might not get into that planned school. Should I accept the offer?",

I\u2019m applying to a competitive major in that school which will have a notification date in June and I have until July to accept their decision. I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re doing it like that. I don\u2019t wanna risk it because it\u2019s competitive but no impossible so there is a chance I won\u2019t get my major. That\u2019s why I want to enroll into another college. I don\u2019t mind losing that money if it is used as to secure my spot. Will the schools know that I already enrolled?",
