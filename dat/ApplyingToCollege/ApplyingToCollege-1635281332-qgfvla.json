  "text": "And businesses think about profit maximization. You can be the brightest student there is, but if you\u2019re not financially beneficial to them (can pay, are an athlete who can bring them more fame and money, or just any other possibility) at that given moment \u2014 they might reject you. But that is just real life.\n\nSo don\u2019t take things personally, and just do your best without thinking too much of possible outcomes. \n\nAs the saying goes \u2014 nothing personal, just business.\n\nI\u2019m telling this as a third year in a top college who gets a looot of aid and has seen how the internal institutional structure functions.\n\nGood luck to you all!!",

This means they probably just didn't even submit a financial aid form/request, which schools can see while still being 'need-blind.' They essentially know some people will pay in full. This is also reflected in the absolutely nonsensical distribution of student families' wealth at Harvard; like a third of the class is in the top 1%.",
