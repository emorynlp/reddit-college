  "text": "I\u2019m thinking of applying to a US University from the UK. Does anyone know if the top ones like Stanford, MIT, Yale etc. often give unconditional offers? And if so, does that mean that I can go there regardless of my final A-Level results (assuming I have great predicted grades, ace the standardised tests etc.)? Not particularly worried about them, just curious lol",
