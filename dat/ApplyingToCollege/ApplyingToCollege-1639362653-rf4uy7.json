      "text": "Columbia and Penn's financial aid packages for internationals will be the same as for domestic students (save for work-study, obviously). They both meet 100% need of ALL admits. That said, both are need-aware for international students, meaning asking for aid unfortunately is considered in choosing whether to admit you. The colleges that are need-blind for internationals are Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, and Amherst.",
