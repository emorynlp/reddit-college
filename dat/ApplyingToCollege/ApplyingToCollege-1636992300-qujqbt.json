  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am a intl sophomore at very good highschool. \n\nI did well on the PSAT and will probably do even better on the SAT and have an A GPA that I hope to get up to A+. However, I do nothing of significance for extracurriculars (though I have many hobbies that can easily be guided into ECs) and don't know what I should do to increase my chances of acception. I am very lost.\n\nThat's why I wanted to hire a college counselor or firm to help me out with my application and EC's but it looks like they are more geared towards helping people with the SAT and AP's and grades and stuff...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, they cost a lot. My parents are willing to take out a loan to pay for it but I don't want them to unless it'll actually help me...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo these private consultants matter? What should I do? Thank you.",
