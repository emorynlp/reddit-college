  "text": "Reapplying for spring session, last year when we did fafsa we got barely any aid, and my parents just don\u2019t want to do it this year. Okay I guess, your money. I\u2019m applying to some need aware privates OOS so I\u2019m sure that will help, but what about public schools labeled need blind. Does that factor in at all? They would be making a substantial amount of money off of us, would they be aware of that?",

      "text": "If the school is need blind, not filing FAFSA will not help your chances of admission.\n\nPublic universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more.\n\nRun the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply.",
