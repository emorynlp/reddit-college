  "text": "hi y\u2019all! im just offering some basic advice about writing your essays and whatnot. based on all the essays i\u2019ve edited so far, i\u2019ve realized that there were some common issues that stood out to me.\n\n1. don\u2019t be vague. i know this seems like common sense but really really get into the specifics of what you\u2019re talking about so admission officers know you\u2019re not bluffing. really double check to see if you\u2019re giving the most helpful information!\n\n2. don\u2019t try too hard to use big words. it works in writing essays for class, i know, i\u2019ve done it too LOL but when it comes to admissions essays, it takes the genuine tone out of your writing\n\n3. don\u2019t try to condense your entire life into one essay. i know there are a lot of experiences that shape you, but it\u2019s so so important to choose that one or two to share just so you don\u2019t risk losing your reader.\n\nhope these general tips helped you, even if it only helped a little! im a college freelancer now so i\u2019ve definitely read my fair share of essays! good luck with apps!",
