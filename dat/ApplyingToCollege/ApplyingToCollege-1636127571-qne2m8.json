  "text": "I just dropped my pre-calc class because I was too behind and I just couldn't deal with it ontop of my depleting mental health. The grade won't be on my transcript, but I'm still really upset and feeling ashamed of myself. Some people tell me not taking math isn't a horrible decision and others are saying i'll be looked at differently. I don't plan on majoring in STEM (want to be a poli sci/international relations) but will this genuinely hurt my application?",
