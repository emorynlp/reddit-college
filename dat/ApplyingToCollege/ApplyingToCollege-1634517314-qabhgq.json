  "text": "My parents are upset if I tell them I\u2019m doing anything (volunteering, homework, relaxing, etc.) BUT college essays. They\u2019re starting to make me worried.\n\nI\u2019m applying early to two schools, each with a decent amount of supplemental essays. How long do you predict the common app essay plus supplements will take? Should I be worried that I\u2019m just starting now?\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, but I do have a very rough draft of a common app essay that I\u2019ve been working on the past couple days.",

Editing is also hell but it doesn't help that I get emotionally attached to my first drafts.",
