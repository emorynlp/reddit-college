  "text": "I got into Oxford University for PPE [Philosophy, Politics, and Economics] a couple weeks ago and was ecstatic. I've fallen in love with the college I was assigned to (Lincoln College) in the university, and my course is so cool -- literally Malala Yousafzai studied it !! When I told my dad that I was really considering it, he said \"Well it's no Harvard. But it's a fine back-up option.\" \n\nAnyways, that's on never being good enough for immigrant parents <3",

For example, there are people who are not certain about their major choice and want to take the first 1-2 years of undergraduate years to explore it, so a US college that does not require declaring major until the end sophomore year will be a better fit for them. There are also people who are dead set on their focus and like the tutoring system, so Oxbridge will be their choice.\n\nWhen doing college research, I also noticed that Oxbridge's CS curriculums are more theory-focused than Imperial College London which has an equally prestigious  CS program. I feel someone who wants to become a computer scientist may lean toward Oxford and someone who wants to become a developer may lean toward Imperial.",

I got in for E&M, the hardest course they have and there was no bullshit about how many nonprofits I\u2019d started or my hook/research etc. I scored highly on the entrance exams which have free prep materials and are not super easy to game. I didn\u2019t know wtf I was doing in the interview but I understood the subject and was able to sort out their puzzles. Regardless of whether the system is more fair, the fact is that everything in admissions there is based upon what you do academically and no window dressing/ donation/consultant can help you if you don\u2019t achieve your grades. To me it\u2019s a lighter version of the systems we see in Asia that are all based on one test. Add to that the fact that it\u2019s very inexpensive to apply and I certainly view the system as more equitable. From the way they present themselves in talking to us, they certainly have much more of a commitment to equity than the two-faced test optional pseudo-need blind mess we have going on here.",

I understand that wealthier people may have access to Tutors and such, which is why Oxford have tried to admit more public school pupils. However, they don\u2019t usually take ethnicity or background into account when sending offers, only  outstanding academic performance, which anyone can realistically achieve with hard work, and by choosing subjects that they like.

And maybe they didn't have awesome ECs?\n\nAdmission at Oxford is based on grades, expertise and commitment in a specific field, performance on an entrance exam tailored to that field, and an in-depth interview in that field. Harvard mostly selects people who have accomplished widely, not people who have in-depth knowledge in one field. Only a small proportion of people are accepted to Harvard on academics alone, the rest are accepted (for high grades plus) leadership in EC's, \"personal attributes\", athletics, legacy status etc., none of which factor into Oxford.   \n\nI was accepted at Harvard and rejected by Oxford. I have a lot of high-level ECs and accomplishments in many different areas, including a first-author publication in one area, university research in another area, high-level awards and major leadership in two other areas, but nothing impressive in the specific area I applied to Oxford in.  \n\nThe two systems are really different. I'm happy I'll be at Harvard because it's a great school that will give me a chance to sample different areas as an undergrad. But if I knew exactly what I wanted to do, then Oxford would be amazing because you do only that for three years, like grad school for undergrads.",

The admissions are more meritocratic than holistic like in the US. Seems like it was the same during my dad's time as well ( He got rejected by UCLA but got into King's College and AIIMS ~ Harvard Medical School of my country for his super-specialization). Also Oxbridge is more focused towards entrance exams for screening out students like the CMTUA and MAT for CS. Plus its cheaper for international students than in the US ( 50k vs 80k) but still ppl be chasing after the ivies",

I had good ECs--a couple internships, research, and national awards; I barely prepared for the Cambridge interview or really anything for my UCAS app.\n\nI really enjoyed the Cambridge academic interview, and the UCAS was *soooo* much faster to complete than the CommonApp. Plus, Oxbridge is just as prestigious as HYPSM.\n\nBut in terms of pure difficulty of acceptance, I feel like people overestimate the difficulty of getting into Oxbridge. I'd honestly recommend anyone on this sub who can afford it and knows what they want to specialize in to apply to one of Oxbridge. I feel like a lot of people on this sub could get into Oxbridge if they are passionate about their subject. Meanwhile, most USAMO attendee with great math grades are rejected from HYPSM.",

In fact my gpa was 2.7 because I simply don\u2019t do anything in school.

I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m paying all this just to have the teaching be subpar and I could learn it all on my own from a fucking library and YouTube for free.\n\nEdit: I think covid is furthering the issue. I\u2019m a final year astrophysics so I don\u2019t have labs anyway and it\u2019s just a ton of assignments with no guidance at all. It\u2019s pretty much just working on my own and being at home makes it worse. Supervisions are zoom calls and they are about 30 percent as effective as in person.",

I know the onus is still on the student to read the book and solve it, but there shouldn\u2019t be masquerading around the fact that the lecture notes are almost always quite useless in solving problem sheets.\n\nIn general, there isn\u2019t much attention given to what students already know and what they are supposed to already know. This is particularly a problem for astrophysics because they take students from math and physics. Those who come from physics don\u2019t necessarily have the math background to easily understand what lecturers are saying. This was an issue with the quantum course and the lecturer not wanting to release notes until weeks after lectures. I hope it\u2019s not an issue going forward, but all the hassle in the last year has made me really have a sour tongue for school and I don\u2019t even want to continue on with masters(even though I do really love Astro) if this is what it is going to be like.",
