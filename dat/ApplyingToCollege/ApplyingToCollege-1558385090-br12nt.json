Do you think selecting for physical genetic traits is at all comparable to selecting who is permitted to access elite learning environments? One is a choice about ability, the other is a choice about *access*, and if you don't think those are different, I think you should reflect more critically on American society's view of race, educate yourself about its history, and recognize the throughlines that affect Black students' ability to attend these schools.",
