  "text": "For the past 2 months or so my parents have been in a bad patch. They aren\u2019t speaking to eachother and my mom has become depressed and suicidal but is on antidepressants. This has affected me a lot, i think about it often and it makes me upset. I have a great relationship with my mom but i have picked up on the things happening in my house. The tension in my house makes me upset as their child and I\u2019ve never faced anything like this before.\n\nBut because of this, my grades have faltered slightly this quarter. (A+s to A-s) I\u2019m applying to t20s but should i or should i not include this in the add info section. I don\u2019t exactly want AOs to think i slacked off in my senior year.\nEdit: if yes, how exactly should i be wording it?",
