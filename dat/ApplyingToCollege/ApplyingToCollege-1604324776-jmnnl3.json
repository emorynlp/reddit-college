  "title:": "Thoughts from someone who was rejected from all his top choices",
  "text": "Hey all,\n\nLast year I was in your exact position. I ED'd to my dream school and thought I had a very good chance of getting it. Four of my family members had attended, I had a strong academic/extracurricular profile, I had good essays, etc. I was set on applying to this school since middle school.\n\nWaiting sucked.\n\nSome days, I felt like there was no way I was going to get in. Other days, I planned how I would react when I got accepted. On a few occasions, I literally had to check my application portal because I dreamed I got in.\n\nAnyway, December rolls around, and I opened my early college decisions. I was rejected or deferred from almost every single ED/EA I applied to. Nevertheless, I poured myself into all my essays, letters of continued interest, etc., determined to get into my dream school. I literally can't remember the last time I had written and re-written so many essays.\n\nIt was exhausing.\n\nFast forward a few more anxious weeks and a pandemic to regular decision day. With the exception of one school, I got rejected or waitlisted from every single reach and target I applied to. My family awkwardly patted me on the back and left my bedroom to give me some space.\n\nAt first, I felt nothing.\n\nLiterally nothing. I didn't feel sad, mad, or anything. Looking back, I think I was in shock and couldn't process it. I read the rejection/waitlist emails a few more times, hoping I had somehow misread the messages... I didn't. The one reach school I was accepted into was literally on the bottom of my list. It's not that it was a bad school or anything, I just felt zero affinity to the school and had a bad visiting experience. The only reason I applied was because it had an easy application.\n\nI had some friends who were also rejected from their top choices, but it seemed like they got over their rejections really easily. I, on the other hand, continued to be unhappy about the school, even after doing all the summer visiting stuff they have for accepted students. I seriously pondered taking a gap year. I wrote email reminders to myself to learn about applying to schools as a transfer.\n\nAs I'm writing this, I'm sitting in my dorm room, and I think my perspective has changed. I don't know if I finally drunk the school's kool-aid or if covid has changed my values, but I'm honestly so incredibly grateful to be here. Getting rejected from all my top choices was a huge wake up call for me. It's funny, I was doing a reading for one of my classes last night, and it mentioned a study about overconfident people. Statistically, if you ask someone how well they think they'll do in a class, a large majority will say in the top half. I guess everyone likes to think of themselves as smart, top of our class, etc., but someone has to get rejected. Someone has to get a C on the exam.\n\nLook, I'm not saying that \"everything works out in the end\" or anything like that. But, I do want to encourage you to remember to keep things in perspective.\n\nGood luck all!\n\nedit: thanks for all the rewards! Really made my day waking up to this! Just want to emphasize that I wasn't trying to come off as ungrateful for getting into one of my reaches, rather, I was trying to emphasize that I simply didn't feel like I fit in the school's environment very well. I think the point of my post was also that perceptions can change overtime (i.e., I didn't like the school and now I do)",

I was never a top student, but was definitely above average. So in the past years after I've seen people really improve themselves, at one point it really bothered me. Like I used to find it hard to think during class if I couldn't get an answer that other people were getting.\n\nThen one evening, while I'm thinking about all of it, I open a google doc, and just type and type to explain to myself what this superiority complex is doing to me, and it somehow worked.\n\nI got over it. Thank god I'm over that shit. Fuck that competition. It's toxic and unhealthy as fuck. I just work without looking at anybody else now, and honestly its so much better.\n\nThat kind of turned into a rant, sorry about that. Thanks for the post OP, glad you're doing well. Post made me feel a little better too.\n\nEdit: Typo",

Ten years later now, and I think UMBC was an awesome experience and I probably would have been miserable at JHU.",

Instead, my friends and I have been playing D&D over Zoom these past few months, a new experience for most of us.  I am so happy to have these friends, especially after all these years.  I would never have met any of them if my college entry had gone the way I wanted and expected it to.\nI got a big envelope from my top school, and was so excited until I got to the part of the letter saying it was a deferred acceptance for the spring semester, but I could study abroad for the first semester if I wanted; it felt at the time like I just wasn't quite good enough to join the rest of the class in August.  Fortunately, some wiser people convinced me that I would be a fool to pass on that opportunity, and I met my best friend that first night in London.  This affected the trajectory for my academic, social, and personal life in innumerable ways that I wouldn't trade away for anything.  \nI guess my point here is that it's easy to get frustrated when life doesn't follow a plan that you have, and that can blind you to all the good things that just aren't what you expected.  Awesome job recognizing the positive things that came out of your own plan getting thrown off the rails, OP!",

It says so much about your incredible personality.\n\nI\u2019ll like to share my own insight to help encourage other students as well. As an ivy grad and an active alum interviewer, my kid couldn\u2019t get into my alma mater. Her grandpa (my dad) also went there and her aunt and uncle are well known professors at this Ivy. I pictured my kids going to this school ever since I was a frosh shopping at the school\u2019s bookstore looking at all the infant and child sized spiritwear emblazoned with the ivy\u2019s name and crest. We visited this school countless times since my kids were little and they all felt destined to go there for college. Despite this ivy being known for admitting legacy kids, my eldest applied ED and was coldly rejected. She had the stats, the EC\u2019s and everything else on the check list, but still wasn\u2019t \u201clucky\u201d enough.\n\nThe problem these days is getting into any college these days is waaaaaaay different than just five years ago, let alone a full generation ago. Most parents DON\u2019T get it. They don\u2019t know getting into state schools isn\u2019t even a sure thing these days.\n\nIf you don\u2019t get into any of your dream schools or even the top 3/4 of your list, please don\u2019t lose hope.\n\nThere are just too many overqualified applicants these days that it is not possible to admit all of them. Oftentimes, this leaves your fate to chance or the mood of a tie breaking admissions officer who forgot her Starbucks coffee that morning. \n\nAs long as you\u2019re open to making things work, it will work- anywhere you go - even at a junior college.\nIf it\u2019s of any consolation, for grad school - I got into an ivy and a state school and decided on the state school. My parents had a fit. \n\nAnyway I met my husband there. My hubs went to a community college and was my classmate; we wound up not only going to the same grad school together but \u201ccouple matched\u201d to our post grad residency. Ultimately, we opened a practice together and have a happy family and work life. I thank God I didn\u2019t go to that ivy grad school. Lol!! Sure I got slack from friends and family who thought I probably could not get in but I learned to care less.\n\nSometimes, you just never know why things happen, but embrace it and you can always make it work beyond your greatest expectations.\n\nEdited: typo",
