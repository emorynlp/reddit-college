  "title:": "How do admissions look at SAT subscores with the EBRW section?",
  "text": "I am sent two SAT scores to be superscored by every college I applied to (they all superscore). As a note, I am a senior and will not be taking the SAT again so there's no need for suggestions to take the SAT again. My current question has to do with the EBRW section. So my section scores are similar between both tests I submitted: a 680 and a 710.\n\nHowever, my scores within the Reading subsection and the Writing subsection are quite different between both tests.  \n\n\nFor the 710: SAT Reading 36/40 | SAT Writing 35/40\n\nFor the 680: SAT Reading 30/40 | SAT Writing 38/40   \n\n\n(the 680 was my more recent test, but I was really nervous for no reason during the reading section and made a lot of silly mistakes)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould admissions consider at all that I have demonstrated I am capable of an EBRW score higher than 710 (like an informal superscore by just looking at my score reports), or will they simply not consider it? I can understand either being the case (most likely that they don't consider it) but wanted to reach out anyways to see if anyone had more to say about this.",
