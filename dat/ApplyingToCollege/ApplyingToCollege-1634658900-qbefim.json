  "text": "I am an international student. I am currently really confused about which university to attend starting winter. I have 2 options that I can attend either University of South Florida or the Memorial University of Newfoundland. I'll be doing a computer engineering major. However, I am not too sure which one I really wanna go to. Perks of MUN are probably a co-op program, which is why I am leaning towards it more. However, I really wanna hear your thoughts regarding my choices.",
