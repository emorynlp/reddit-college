      "text": "Firstly congratulations - that is so cool!   \nSecond, if you really think that your application lacks a critical dimension by the exclusion of this data, I'm sure you can email the admissions department and they'd understand. (i.e. by adding it to your application).   \nNote : If the university you are applying to has an update option on the portal, that might be a  possible choice too. But sometimes, this allows you to only update once in the application cycle, so 'now' might not be the best choice to utilize it maybe. \n\n  \nNevertheless, I personally think mailing the admissions department is the best way to go about it.   \nCongratulations for your achievements once again! You got this :)",
