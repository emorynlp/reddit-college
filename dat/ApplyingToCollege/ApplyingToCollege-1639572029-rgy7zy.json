  "text": "Whether we get accepted, deferred, or rejected, we will all be okay. \n\nWe will go to good schools, make lifelong friends, get our degrees, and find jobs that we're passionate about. \n\nWould I like to do that as a Yalie? Yes lmao. But there's a good chance I won't, and that doesn't seal my fate. One way or another we're all gonna take the world by the balls and I can't wait to see what we do <3",
