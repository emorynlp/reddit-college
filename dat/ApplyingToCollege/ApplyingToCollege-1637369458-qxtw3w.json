  "text": "so i submitted my uc application today and after i did that i realized that for one of my volunteer projects i overestimated the amount of things i made (i\u2019m withholding the details for privacy reasons because the info is traceable online) i made 81, but i said on the application, quote, \u201cabout 100\u201d. because this info is verifiable through google and they can search it up (even tho they probably won\u2019t) is this difference a big enough deal to raise red flags and should i contact my campuses to fix it? or am i just paranoid lmao",
