              "text": "I only applied to 7 schools last year, and I actually got accepted to one, but it was too expensive for me. Personal tips from my experience:\n\n1. Shotgun to as many schools as you can. Take advantage of those 20 schools for Common App, use Coalition if you have time. Apply to schools without essays if you don't think you can write too many essays\n\n2. Ask for LoRs early!! Teachers r super busy especially during the holidays\n\n3. Start essays as early as you can, even if it's just writing bullet points or word vomits\n\n4. Do early rounds!!!!! Literal game-changer imo\n\n5. Fill out your finaid documents EARLY and BEFORE the deadline. (This is why early rounds are a game-changer, it forces you to have everything ready at an earlier time)",
