  "title:": "Why do people numerically rank their essays out of 10 on Chanceme?",
  "text": "Something that I've always been weirded out about is how people will put that their essays are a 9/10 or an 8/10, etc.. First of all, standards of writing are different. What good writing is to someone might not be good to another person. A numerical score hides important factors like your topic, and how personal your essay is. I guarantee, it's not hard to write a 9/10 level essay and have it actually be a 4/10 if you write about a topic that isn't personal enough.  I don't take anything away from the numerical score when people put them on chance me because it's turning something that isn't meant to be a score into a score. There's a reason why colleges want essays. They want to understand the applicant. Just by saying a score tells someone nothing about you. I hope that this will influence people to either not talk about essays in their chancemes or give more specific details about their essays like the topic if they want to get the most out of their posts.",

      "text": "I think because it's just an essay metric to go off of in regards to the actual chancing process. Writing is subjective, yes, but I think most applicants recognize whether or not their writing was good by their own standards or not. It's like, if you know you half-assed the essay, could it still be good because you're a good writer? Yes. But in general a half-assed essay is a weak part of an application therefore your chances will statistically be lower.\n\nEdit: Oh also plagiarism. No one wants to share their essay topic or too many details for fear of it being stolen or copied. Or having too many identifying details.",
