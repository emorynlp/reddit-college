  "text": "I originally wanted to apply ED to WashU but I saw in a Reddit post that they\u2019ll defer me 100%. My application is not bad and I won't be submitting my sat (1420: 630R&W; 790M). Should I try ED Washu or just focus on my application and next Sat?                     \n                                                                                                \nEdit: major CS and can't pay more than 15k",

                  "text": "I think the biggest potential risk is that they (and all similar full need intl schools) accept someone and the money is generous/fair but maybe not generous/fair enough to make it work.  Would that decision still be binding or could someone get out of the ED contract?  \n\nPart of me would say, \u201cWhy risk it?\u201d  Unlike domestics, internationals can\u2019t run a NPC to get estimated family contribution. A school could give everything but a $15,000 family contribution, but if that family can only give $9,000-$10,000 max including personal loans, would a university even hold them to the ED contract?  \n\nThat is the real risk IMO. \n\nPart of me also says, \u201cThey\u2019re not going to accept internationals ED anyway unless they really, really know the aid package is going to work.\u201d  Schools don\u2019t want to be dicks and hold people to something they can\u2019t afford based upon their imperfect understanding of what a middle class person living in Tunisia or Belarus or Paraguay can afford. \n\nSchools want to a) keep the ED matriculants predictable and b) would rather compare all of the international w need applicants together as one giant pool when they figure out how to distribute the international aid pool. \n\nThat is the open question. The money pool for internationals is pretty small. The applicant pool is pretty small too. So there can be a lot of volatility in overall applicant quality year over year. Much more volatile and less consistent than the domestic pool. It\u2019s difficult for schools to flag someone ED as \u201cobvious admit, we\u2019ll make the money work for him/her.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t see an ED advantage or disadvantage in this scenario provided the app turned in ED would be the same as the app turned in RD. If something were to improve by RD on the app, I\u2019d be inclined to wait until RD. Anybody who would get in as an international w need ED (OMG, we must have this person) is going\u2019s to get in RD. The only potential cost is in being that \u201cmust have ED\u201d person still needing to fill out all of those Rd apps for a bunch of schools. \n\nThat\u2019s probably not the vast majority of international w need applicants who show up on WashU, Vandy, Duke, Cornell\u2019s campuses in the fall thought",
