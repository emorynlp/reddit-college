  "text": "never posted on this sub before so apologies in advance if this kind of question isn't allowed!\n\nso, I'm currently looking at transferring to the Fashion Institute of Technology for the fall 2022 semester and I'm really interested in the illustration BFA and the toy design BFA that they offer. i was wondering if anyone here happens to be in either of those majors and would be able to share generally what they're like, pros and cons, what they look for in portfolios, etc? i'm also curious if either of these specific programs are difficult to get accepted into since i've heard that FIT is pretty competitive.\n\nhonestly i'm a bit more interested in toy design, but there's so little information about it outside of what's on FIT's website that i'm nervous to apply, especially considering i don't have a ton of toy design experience (outside of some concept sketches and one toy design project from a 3D sculpture class). a couple of older articles and videos said it's really tough (which i don't mind), and i spoke to one student that said it's a super small group but they don't personally know anyone in it or anything else about it. \n\ni've already emailed the admissions office with my questions but i'm still waiting for a reply lol, so i figured i should see if any current students would be able to help me out.",
