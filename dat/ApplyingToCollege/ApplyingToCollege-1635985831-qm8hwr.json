  "text": "So my brother (in 8th grade) is really smart and will probably do extremely well in high school, so we are trying to figure out what the most impressive ECs will be for him.\n\nHe is really fast at Typing: 177 words per minute, top 200 in the world, and has the world record on the keyboard layout that he uses. If he keeps at it, he will probably hit 200 words per minute by the time he applies.\n\nWould this be considered an extremely impressive EC or would AOs just find it a bit interesting and shrug it off because it doesn't have much to with academics and isn't a conventional EC?",

Kids at our school  really like it and (when my oldest son was in it-- current kids not interested) -- the trip to nationals each year (places like Anaheim, DC, Dallas) was always a fun escape for them. There are all kinds of cool (and obscure) things you can win in this organization:)",
