  "text": "Got deferred from Harvard REA. applied w intended majors: economics, government, history (in that order). I know that Harvard doesn\u2019t admit based on majors, but it\u2019s still harder to stand out when there\u2019s an influx of economics intended majors. \n\nI\u2019m also interested in studying sociology (it\u2019s still related to my career path and ecs) and I\u2019m regretting not mentioning it. Should I mention this new academic interest in the letter or just hold out w economics till the end?",
