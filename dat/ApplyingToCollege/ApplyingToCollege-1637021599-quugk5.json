  "text": "So my fall sport recently ended and my club team (which I used to do in the winter/spring) kinda fell apart over the pandemic so this is the least busy I have ever been during the school year since middle school. I have my other ECs but they only meet like once a week so I feel like I\u2019m doing nothing. I cannot believe I feel GUILTY for having free time\u2026I am legitimately searching out more scholarships to apply to bc I\u2019ve already drafted most of my RD supps. I guess this is something else to bring to my therapy appointment this week lololol can anyone relate",
