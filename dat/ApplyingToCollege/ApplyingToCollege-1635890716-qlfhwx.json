  "text": "So I get like super passionate and slightly emotional aka tears in my eyes when I talk about vulnerable topics that are very dear and close to my heart.\n\nWhat if a question comes up like tell me about what you stand up for or conflicts or struggles in your life or your biggest obstacle you have faced..\n\nAnd then I talk about my personal stuff like my society and culture that is still very much sexist and how behind doors, the voices of women of my relatives are just non-existent when it comes to physical abuse etc and lgtb and I am trying to stand up for them and speak up about it and how I will continue to do so...\n\nWill this be just a tad too much to share? Because I genuinely care about this and part of my application with women's health other stuff speaks about activism. But I don't want to be  an emotional mess and feel like I am manipulating her or him with my tears and sob stories (even though hey are very much real and prevalent where I live)...\n\nAnd even if I dial it back with the emotions..I don't think I can because as I said I get very emotional when I talk about this stuff.",

      "text": "If you can, try not to have tears in your eyes. You don't know who your interviewer is, and what they think of tears during a friendly interview with a stranger. Some would be understanding, but some would be uncomfortable, or worse, wonder if it was a sign of weakness or instability. Could you channel that passion into more of an anger than sadness? Or focus on the hopeful feelings of progress already made, rectifying those injustices. I would do some practice interviews with just that question so you can control your response, and also practice your responses in front of a mirror. \nGood Luck!!",
