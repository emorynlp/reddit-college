  "title:": "There are colleges in a very rural area. People from big cities, how did it feel for you to live in this area after spending your whole life in a big city?",
  "text": "I am an international student coming from a big city with population over 3 million. I am very used to constant engagement within community and nonstop changes and opportunities as it always happens in big cities. What would you say about colleges in rural areas? How hard it was to adapt to that rural area after spending your life in a city? Did you feel stressed out? I don't know what it is like cause I've never lived somewhere else and I'm worried that I won't have enough \"freedom and things I can do\". I would like to apply to one college ED2, but it's located in the rural area and I need more information to finally make the decision",
