  "text": "I have applied to this College just a week ago and got accepted couple of days later. Feed me through the reputations and what's the scenario for PGWP after graduation on this college. I know this college is not eligible to provide PGWP after I graduate, but I researched and found out it is working with Red Deer College which acquired PGWP on some of their programs. I have applied for Software Development and that is well suited.\n\nGive me some suggestions, please. Also tell me how is life in Vancouver as a student. That would be appreciated.",
