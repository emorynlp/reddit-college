Im trying to shoot my shot at MIT or some ivies.\n\nHeres what i am doing if you wanted to know:\n\nFor clubs i am doing 8 clubs (i can manage them)\n\nFor sports i am doing track and field\n\nFor school i am doing 1 AP (AP Computer Science Principles) and 2 Honors (Algebra 2 and Biology)\n\nFor volunteer hours i am currently at 20 hours\n\nI am also partaking in some competitions ranging from math to science to robotics\n\nOverall i would really love any advice you guys give me and since some of you have already gone through the college admission process, i figured you guys can help me the most.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks.\n\nSignificantFig8856",

Continue with the clubs if your enjoying them, continue with the competitions if your enjoying them. Investigate ways to do academics outside of school. Start reading books in fields your interested in. Try to get an internship. And please just make sure your happy with each day when you go to sleep.

School clubs aren't that impressive so don't join a ton of them!! think about how many thousands of kids are president of their school's DECA, or speech and debate club. tbh i wasted so much time on school clubs (i did about 8 clubs too) even though i didnt even really like half of them. My advice: Quit like half of those clubs and join city-wide/county-wide/state-wide clubs instead. those are usually more fun and more impressive. i only put 2 school clubs on my activities list because they were so much less significant than everything else. \\*but stay in the clubs you really like\n2. when i was a freshman, i thought sports helped apps. they really don't. only do them if you enjoy them. if they start taking too much time and stress you out, dont hesitate to drop them. \n3. enjoy highschool. it isnt one or the other. you can have fun and be smart / achieve a lot",

For ec\u2019s it might seem good to join things colleges will like supposedly, but they see right through it. Instead think of a passion you have and expand as far as you can with it. That should be it for ec\u2019s seriously do not do something just for college. I would advise joining just honors society and small commitment clubs. Always quality over quantity. \n\nEchoing thoughts of those already commenting. This might be blunt, but literally just be a social person. Life is a lot easier if people like you, especially your teachers. Don\u2019t be afraid to speak up in class or share about your weekend. Remember teachers are humans too and this we\u2019ll come into handy for letters of rec.",

      "text": "Freshmen year is the year you will have the most time. Most people use this time to have fun and relax guilt-free, but if you\u2019re serious about working up a hearty college app, I recommend building your skills. This includes critical thinking, speed reading, speed writing, basically all the little things. The one skill I want to emphasize the most is work ethic. Discipline and hard work builds a solid foundation to do pretty much anything academically. Another thing you should practice is time management. When things get rough, sleep is the first thing in the chopping block. Please do not do this. Sleep is very important \ud83d\ude14 \nAnother thing you could do is find a passion (can be flexible; don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re stuck with it) and try learning more about it. For example, if you\u2019re really into chemistry, start self studying it and learn more about it. Join clubs and classes about it as well.",
