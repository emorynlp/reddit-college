  "text": "Paired with a very high SAT (1580) and GPA (3.97), what constitutes a rigorous enough course load to have a decent shot at an Ivy? My school is all honors and I took the accelerated classes available, but I haven't taken APs (which are not available at my school) or concurrent enrollment (which is, I really should've done this but it's very hard to fit into your schedule). I don't know how colleges would see this, but I'm also doing an independent study translating Latin poetry into English. (I'm a prospective classics major). I'm worried that this isn't good enough.",

      "text": "I think most Ivy AOs expect that you take the most rigorous course load available at your school, without needing to fit in dual enrollment.  If APs were not available to you, then it's fine.  In this competitive admissions climate, many kids try to get ahead by self-studying for APs and taking DE courses, but those choices aren't necessary to be considered competitive (vs NOT taking the most rigorous course load available to you -  that might be a small red flag to AOs that you don't challenge yourself, you're not motivated, etc).",
