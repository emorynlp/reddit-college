  "text": "Hey all. I'm closeted Non-binary, and am considering marking both male and non-binary on my application before I submit. Does doing this hurt my chances of admission based on statistics? Does it help? I know for certain colleges such as Brown there is a leaning towards male students, and being exclusively male is an advantage, but I am wondering since I do not plan to fully come out until I am in college, should I even mark it down? I would be completely fine either way, I just worry I'm hurting my chances by picking one or the other.   \n\n\nThanks!",
