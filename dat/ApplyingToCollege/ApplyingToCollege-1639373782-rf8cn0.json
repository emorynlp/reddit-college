  "text": "I submitted my UC app in Nov but as an international student, I had my final exams at the same time so I didn't spend much time double-checking etc (that was my bad, I should've started earlier). Anyway I just revisited my app and I realised that for one of the essay questions, I didn't really answer the question. I wrote about what I learnt about leadership in general, based on my various experiences growing up, instead of reflecting on just \"one\" experience (the prompt was about \"an example\" of a leadership experience where u helped achieve sth)... am I going to get rejected from everything just because of this one essay?",
