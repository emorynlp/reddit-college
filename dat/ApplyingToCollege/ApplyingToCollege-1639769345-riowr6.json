It may be a concern for them, but you won't be denied if other parts of your application would otherwise have led to an acceptance. In the same way, you won't be accepted if you have a perfect GPA without other parts of your application standing out. \n\nAt selective schools, it will be a concern, but it's not a major red flag. As someone who teaches university engineering physics, I'm not concerned by it.",
