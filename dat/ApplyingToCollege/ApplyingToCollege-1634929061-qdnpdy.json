  "text": "I am an international applying EA to UMich. I did get a 118 on TOEFL but I just sent the scores through the portal. I'm afraid the scores may not reach before the Nov 1 deadline. However, the website of UMich says that I may be exempted from language proficiency tests if my SAT EBRW is greater than 650. Mine is 700+. So in case my TOEFL doesn't arrive in time, I wouldn't be moved to the RD pool right?",
