My daughter has 11 schools in teh acommon App. She has released three of them for EA and will release the others as ED2 or RD in the future.\n\nThe Common App sends whatever is on record at the time an application is released. If you add a score, it will be sent to schools released in the future, but not to those already released.   \n\n\nSchools that you apply to will almost always provide a portal to confirm your application and provide updates like new test scores.",
