One of those books that really haunts the reader if they think too much. Highly recommend it.",

I\u2019d say read A Farewell to Arms, as it complements his prose with some action, something that new readers find lacking in his works. It\u2019ll teach you to find openings where you could go straight to the point and places where you shouldn\u2019t, a skill essential to convey themes in your writing. But don\u2019t abide to a reading only one style. I\u2019ve seen it in this comment section already, but I\u2019ll echo it again: The Great Gatsby. It\u2019s truly one of the most artful pieces I\u2019ve read and I assure you, if you want a novel with lots of substance and complexity, it\u2019ll give you all you need. Good luck on your reading journey!",
