  "text": "Look, I know many of you are feeling stressed (or more) about decisions this week. I get it \u2014 it\u2019s a crazy tough time -- especially if you weren\u2019t offered admission. First, know this: It\u2019s their loss. You are gonna be sad for a day or two or even three, and then you\u2019re gonna get your shit together and move forward. Still, I have to tell you that y'all have blown me away with your support and care for each other as a community. Watching you cry together and celebrate together and meme together and even sing together makes an (admissions)mom proud!\n\n**Time to Keep Zigging**\n\nIf things didn\u2019t go the way you want, trust me when I say that it doesn\u2019t mean you did anything wrong.  It doesn\u2019t change who you are or who you\u2019re becoming or the amazing trajectory of your lives.\n\nIt just means you\u2019re gonna zig instead of zag. And zigging is really fucking awesome. When you zig you learn from the unexpected. Sure. It all hurts. It sucks so much, like really really bad for some of you, and it\u2019s ok to feel all that, but then you\u2019re gonna get back to your zig. You got this.\n\n\ud83c\udf26**Dealing with Feelings**\n\nWhen decisions don\u2019t go your way it can feel pretty shitty, but it\u2019s ok to feel the pain. In fact, the only way to get past the pain is to allow it. In my family, we call it Going on a Bear Hunt. I don\u2019t know if you know the children\u2019s chant, but it\u2019s about getting thrown the tall swishy swashy grass and the thick oozy gooey mud and the fast rushing river.  To me, those are metaphors for the emotions we have to pass through as we make our way through anger, sadness, and disappointment.  My therapist used to call it making it through the train tunnel. You\u2019ve got to let yourself feel those emotions or you get stuck and you need to make your way out. In mindfulness, we use a technique called RAIN.\n\nRecognize your feelings.\n\nAccept and acknowledge that they are there.\n\nInvestigate them \u2014 what caused them, why are you feeling them\n\nNon\u2014identify; know that they are just feelings and feelings come and go.\n\nYou are the observer of your feelings, but you\u2019re not your feelings. Think of it like this: You are the sky. Everything else is just the weather. Those feelings -- as horrible as they might be -- are like really bad weather. They will come and go. They are not you.\n\nThis is all to say, you\u2019re gonna be ok. Allow yourself to be sad or angry. Sometimes schools make really stupid fucked up decisions and it\u2019s not a reflection on you, but that doesn\u2019t make it easier to swallow right in the beginning. So be sad or angry. Smash some pillows, angry cry.  Go through those feelings and then go find ice cream.\n\n\ud83c\udf66**Eat lots of ice cream and do some intense pillow bashing**\n\nSeniors come back and tell me this every year: After they\u2019ve cried, pounded their pillows, licked their wounds, and eaten ice cream \u2014 and I mean there\u2019s a lot of ice cream eating going on during college-admission-decision time \u2014 a few months later, they come back and talk about how even though it was the most stressful experience of their short lives, they are proud of how much they learned about themselves and how much stronger they feel now. This is the good kind of stress -- where you grow and learn.\n\nNow, in case you think I\u2019m trying to turn the admissions experience into some happy-ending forest-like fairytale \u2014 I\u2019m not. In fact, I think there\u2019s a lot wrong with it. I believe the non-stop college talk in schools and homes is downright dangerous for some kids \u2014 and the constant college admissions chatter causes unnecessary stress in many others.\n\n**\ud83d\udc9e Forget about Dream Schools.**\n\nInstead of spending so much time focusing on one school \u2014 a \u201cdream school,\u201d I encourage you to find your \u201cDream You\u201d -- not your Dream U. Look, I know you\u2019ve been taught to \u201cdream big\u201d and \u201cfollow your dreams,\u201d but it\u2019s not about finding the school of your dreams; it\u2019s about finding the you of your dreams. In my book, find the best version of you. When you\u2019re drooling over that perfect school with a perfect campus and perfect classes, you\u2019re not dreaming about any one school. You\u2019re dreaming about who you want to be and where you can become who you want to be, and there isn\u2019t only one Dream School where you can do that.\u201d So, I invite you to think deeply \u2014 and figure out what it is about that certain school that makes you consider it your dream school \u2014 because, I guarantee that your dream isn\u2019t out there in the form of a college; it is in YOU.\n\n\ud83d\ude0e **You can only control your own actions**\n\nProbably the most relevant lesson to the college admissions journey is the understanding that we can only control our own actions \u2014 and it\u2019s fruitless to spend our time and energy trying to control anything else. And what you can control in college admissions is what goes in the application \u2014 essays, activity descriptions, and grades and test scores to a limited extent. What you cannot control is the number of other well-qualified amazing students who might be applying to the same tiny teacup of schools as you are; you cannot control the bulk of your transcript by the time you\u2019re a senior; you cannot control the institutional needs of the colleges on your list; you cannot control the mood, preferences, or predilections of the application readers. You cannot, in essence, control what colleges want at the particular reading of your application on a particular day, and as an admissions officer from U Chicago once told me, \u201cjust when you think you\u2019ve figured out, what we want, we\u2019ve changed our mind.\u201d The only thing you can control is becoming who you are and then putting together the best application that reflects the best of who you are.\n\n\ud83d\udc40 **Institutional needs? What does that mean?**\n\nI've been asked before what \"institutional needs\" means: it means colleges have to create a class, so they\u2019re looking for all kinds of people with varying strengths, abilities, talents, and backgrounds. They don\u2019t want to have a uniform set of people who are all robotically doing the same stuff. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have holistic admissions and not just base it on stats. Also, they have a school to run so certain departments and faculty might have more needs at different times. Or sometimes it's just whatever their board members and presidents tell them they should keep in mind as they create a class. This is the part of college admissions that we have no control over and why applicants need to not take any of it personally. Institutional needs change year to year so you can\u2019t prep and plan ahead.\n\n[Here\u2019s a comment by one of our former moderators that he made on r/UTAustinAdmissions2, and I think it explains a lot about institutional needs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustinAdmissions2/comments/rdqpm4/where_is_utaustins_first_admissions_wave_sharing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\n\ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f **Remember to Breathe**\n\nWhen I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed by sadness and frustration, I try to remind myself to stop and breathe and say these words:\n\nI am who I am\n\nThis is what it is\n\nMay I accept things as they are\n\nMay I trust in the unfolding\n\nIt\u2019s so simple to breathe, yet when we are full-on in the anger and sadness and worry feels it can be crazy difficult to remember. And these words can help you with the reality that there is only so much you can control. Right now, what you can control is how you process this time in your life and next steps.\n\n**\ud83d\udc96Now, here\u2019s what I love most about college admissions**\n\nIt can actually be this period of amazing self-growth and development \u2014 like no other if you allow yourself to recognize that some amount of stress is necessary and good for your development, and if we acknowledge that there might be ways to reframe our understanding of college admissions by changing the words and phrases we use. When you take control of your admissions journey and you incorporate some mindfulness into your lives, you can grow in self-confidence and maturity as you dig in and learn more about yourself than you ever have. Figuring out what you want in a college, developing a list, and writing personal essays all require deep reflection and self-investigation. Taking the reins and handling the details and difficulties of the application process demonstrates your abilities and strengths. And, no matter the outcome, no matter where you end up going to college, no matter how painful some of this journey might be, this transformational experience, filled not only with stress but also with excitement and joy \u2014 is turning you into a stronger human, ready to take on college \u2014 and life.\n\n\ud83e\uddf8**One last note:** It can really hurt when life doesn\u2019t go your way and sometimes you just have to give in to the pain \u2014 that\u2019s the only way through it. So slam doors, eat ice cream, bash pillows, cry \u2014 it\u2019s all ok. It\u2019s their loss. You are gonna be sad for a day or two, and then you\u2019re gonna get your shit together and \"thank-you-next\" them, so that you can recognize that this one door shutting? It\u2019s really an infinite number of doors opening. This is your chance. This is your time to learn how strong you are and learn more about colleges and what you want for yourself. This isn\u2019t an ending. It\u2019s a beginning.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 **I\u2019ve written a couple of posts recently that might help:**\n\nHere\u2019s my first one about emotional planning and what that means:[ https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/r8sjp7/happy\\_weekend\\_beautiful\\_seniors\\_if\\_you\\_applied/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/r8sjp7/happy_weekend_beautiful_seniors_if_you_applied/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nHere\u2019s my post from last week some stories about baby trees, lotuses, college decisions, and you:[ https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/rdhia6/you\\_can\\_handle\\_this\\_college\\_decision\\_time\\_is\\_hard/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/rdhia6/you_can_handle_this_college_decision_time_is_hard/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nAlso-- I was recently on the \"Inside College Admissions\" Podcast with Scoir talking about handling your decisions and how it hurts, but then it passes.  Even if it feels like the worst thing in the world right now, it will pass. You are the sky; everything else is the weather. [If you'd like to take a listen, here's the link](https://insidecollegeadmissions.buzzsprout.com/1384537/9651241)\n\nAlso, u/ScholarGrade and u/McNeilAdmissions have both recently written awesome posts about handling the stress of decisions. I suggest you read those too.\n\n\ud83d\udc9c **Deferred?** For those of you who were deferred, we\u2019ll be talking about writing a LOCI in January. Do whatever the college says to do in the paperwork, sign forms, etc. But if you\u2019re planning to write a Letter of Continued Interest  (LOCI),  I suggest you do that in January after colleges are back on campus if they don\u2019t give you other more explicit directions.  I\u2019ll be making a new post soon, but here\u2019s my post from last year, [if you\u2019d like to learn more: ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/kh2foz/so_you_were_deferred_what_to_do_now_its_time_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nTl;dr: You are a badass. You don\u2019t need them. You have you.\n\nEditing to add this in bc it's just too good not to:\n\nWhen life gives you lemons, lean back and squeeze that shit into your eyeballs. Then glare back at life and say, \"that all you got, motherfucker?\" -- Mark Manson\n\n(and don't do that -- it will hurt a whole fuck ton!!!)",

      "text": "Great advice:\n\nA couple of things that seemed to work for both of my kids:\n\nUse your application to show exactly who you are.  Many students think the application is all about having better stats, LORs, and/or essays, but in their effort to compete, are packaging their application to sound like a lot of other applications.  Often, students are too busy thinking about the spin that their application doesn't accurately portray them.  \n\nBe yourself.  And as yourself, be enough.  - Peer Gynt\n\nAnd take a serious look at some of the T100-200 schools.  There are some amazing opportunities for Target and Safety schools in the T100-200 range.  These are often schools that offer the same amenities (honors programs, study abroad, etc..) as more prestigious colleges and maybe even scholarships for competitive students.\n\nOn average, a good student can get as good an education at a T100-200 as at a higher-ranked school.  In fact, a highly self-motivated student may actually stand out more at a school that is slightly less prestigious.\n\nI highly recommend that students look for schools which have the qualities they want but which may not have as much name recognition.  \n\nI want to remind all of the students here:. You are worthy.  None of these competitive schools has the ability to accept all applicants.  You can find a college that will be a home for you.",
