  "text": "I think that's something in my personality, idk.\nCuriously, one of my biggest skills is writing, and that's reflected on my application. The problem is that when I read my Common App essay to review it I immediately hate it. I don't know if you can understand that, it's something that I have. When I am writing, whatever is it about, it always feels so important, but when I'm reviewing it looks so silly.\nOne of my ECs is that I have a website where I post my cr\u00f3nicas (a Brazilian writing genre), and even when I'm writing artistically for this site I can't think twice. I post what I write almost immediately. \nAnyway, I don't know if I'm shy or anything, but I would like to know if you have any tips for that issue. I wrote what I think is my 18th draft today, counting all the 7 themes I've tried to write about, and I really think this one is good. Besides, I believe it's inside the word limit (I write on paper so I don't know exactly). But I'm avoiding this essay the whole afternoon because I fear I'm going to hate it, and I know it needs some adjustments because I remember some parts that weren't really perfect. Anyway I'm talking too much. Any tips?",
