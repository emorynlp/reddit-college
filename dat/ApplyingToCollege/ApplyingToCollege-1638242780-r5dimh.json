  "title:": "Accidentally misspelled a Rice residential college\u2019s name in my essay, am I screwed?",
  "text": "I misspelled \u201cWiess\u201d as \u201cWeiss\u201d because I literally have never seen it spelled as \u201cWiess\u201d and it even tries to autocorrect me when I type it that way and I didn\u2019t realize my mistake until today. Is it an understandable error or will it make me look bad? I used the name three times in one essay, all misspelled.",

      "text": "As a Rice student, Wiess is the name of the residential college and Weiss is the name of an academic building. Kinda confusing lol. In fact, people from other residential colleges sometimes call Wiess \"Weiss\" just to offend them :D. I'm sure it'll be fine: it's an easy thing to misspell. Admissions officers that don't know too much about the individual residential colleges may not even notice the misspelling!",
