  "text": "Okay, so basically, I am studying in India and applying to US universities for Fall '22. In the Cumulative GPA section of Coalition App, should I put an average of percentages from 9-12? I have my official percentage for 9th,10th, and 11th, but for 12th, I have the predicted scores only. So should I take the average of 9-11th grade or 9-12th grades?",
