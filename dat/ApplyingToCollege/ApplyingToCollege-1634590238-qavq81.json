You\u2019re doing good. 1 you\u2019re applying to college, that alone is something noteworthy. 2, you\u2019re making the effort for EA. 3, you\u2019re taking the time to do things, even if they stress you out. You\u2019re more than enough and colleges will see that, but you gotta breathe first. Ground yourself. Find a tether and hold on to it. Best of luck!",
