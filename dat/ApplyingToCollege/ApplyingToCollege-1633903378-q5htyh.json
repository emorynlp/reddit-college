  "text": "No support. NONE. \n\nI recently found out my class rank, which is 20th out of 316 students. Pretty good, eh? Well, according to my mom, that is mediocre. She expected me to be AT LEAST 5th. I didn't tell my dad, but I can assure you, he will say the same thing, if not worse. And needless to say that they don't support me during this application process. At least consider the circumstances, be proud of my accomplishments, and don't compare me to others. \n\nSorry for the rant.",

They refuse the give out rankings unless you get permission from the principle cause kids with amazing grades were placing 50-100 when in any other school they would easily be top 25-50. I got it cause one of my colleges required rank and it was 53/418. I came home exited to tell my parents. I asked my mom to guess, she said 10. I shook my head, and she said 5. Soul crushed a little bit there.",

I know it seems like every accomplishment and every achievement you've had just gets brushed off and it can be frustrating, the more you start caring about the way they treat you the more control they'll have of you.   \n\n\nSending love!",
