  "text": " Hi, currently attending a community college and hoping to transfer to a college next fall and study Mechanical Engineering. I've spent a lot of time looking for which colleges would have a good engineering program. After many hours on the web I then ask myself, does it really matter? If all the schools are ABET accredited then every school should pretty much teach the same material. The only difference I would see if the quality of the labs.\n\nComments?",

      "text": "Maybe go to an engineering sub (search it first) and ask there as well. My understanding is that engineering students benefit tremendously from internships, which often lead to their first jobs, so a school\u2019s ability to reliably connect its students to those opportunities seems like a big thing to look for.",

      "text": "There are still differences in career placement rates, grad rates, research opportunities, and things like that.\n\nYou are right though that the differences in mechanical engineering are smaller than many other fields, and there are lots of good options.",

      "text": "You are correct that ABET accreditation recognizes the quality of an engineering program. \n\nYou should contact a few 4-year colleges that interest you to discuss how/which/if your credits from the CC will transfer as requirements in their mechanical engineering programs.",
