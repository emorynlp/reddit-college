  "text": "I even took the day off of school to avoid this and now they're telling me to stream myself opening my rejection. I tried to give multiple excuses without saying 'no' directly and they're still pushing me. I literally told them I would give them a screenshot of my decision too and apparently that's not good enough. They are a pretty close friend of mine and I know I will 99.9999999% get rejected bc it's such a prestigious school, but still I'd like some privacy opening my first decision. idk am I being too sensitive?\n\nEdit: I took care of it (got rejected) but everything's fine now. ty for the suggestions!",
