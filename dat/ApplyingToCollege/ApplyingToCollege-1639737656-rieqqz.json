      "text": "Not ED, but I was rejected from Stanford REA a few years back, and it hurt a lot. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI took a lot of classes on their campus and did some research under a mentor and got him to write a letter of rec during my application, and I thought I was sure to get in. In fact, I didn't try on my other college essays at all, so when I was rejected from Stanford, it was a huge wakeup call and I all of a sudden had to work on essays for eight other schools I was applying to in under a month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah.. didn't work out so great. I wasn't able to complete a lot of my college essays on time, so I ended up only  applying for 4 schools instead of the original 10. Needless to say, I stayed close to home and attended a local college. And it was great! I made friends that I took road trips with, the academics were much easier than in high school \\*\\*and\\*\\* I had a big scholarship so I had a crap ton of free time and money to just live. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that being said, I didn't even think about transferring until my parents sat me down and talked about maybe going through the college admissions process again. They felt as though I didn't try hard enough my senior year of college, and was wondering if I was maybe jealous of my friends and family who were attending more prestigious colleges. Wow, rude much? But they were right, every time I saw a friend post homecoming pictures or a photo dump of their college life, I did feel jealous. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I sat down and put in the work. Compared to high school where I spent maybe 3 hours working on essays for ten schools, I now put in 6 hours a week working on them for two month for only five schools - all completed! It was just as nerve-racking as before, especially since I was reading about how transfer acceptance rate is less than normal and how schools don't prioritize transfer kids. And, I guess this is a roundabout way to tell my story: but I got into Columbia and Yale, and I am living the Blair Waldorf life in NYC. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, yeah, it turned out pretty well. But, there are a few things I learned that might be useful for you: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* When people say admissions are a crapshoot, they really do mean it. I might be salty still over Stanford REA, but I really was a stellar applicant, and those fifty word prompts and that letter to my roommate essay is probably still better than anything I have written during my time here. So don't let you being rejected from your ED choice be a reason to hate yourself. It does not detract anything from you, your hard work, or your intellect. \n* Now, when people say that community college or a local university is just as good of an education as a top school, that's where I disagree a little. This is from personal experience, but as a math major, I notice that the Calculus sequence at Columbia is much more challenging. Sure, the concepts don't change from school to school, but, in my experience, I got a lot more from Columbia than at my local university, even in something as simple as Calculus I. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess all of this is to say: don't give up. Don't settle. Look at what you are planning on learning and what your goals are and prioritize schools that can help you reach them. If prestige doesn't matter in your future job and you want to have a fun relaxing time while easily coasting, then nothing wrong with that! On the flip side, if you want somewhere challenging and aim a little higher academically, then don't make the mistake I did senior year and give up. You got this!",
