  "text": "Hello! My question is about their anthropology program. I'm (hopefully) graduating this semester, and I'm planning on going into anthropology. However, I'm graduating with a Psychology BA. Would I be able to get into the Anthropology Master's program with a Psychology degree, or do I need a Bachelor's in the same area?",
