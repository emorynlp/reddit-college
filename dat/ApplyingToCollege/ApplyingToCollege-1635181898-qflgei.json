  "text": "basically, i need three safeties & i only have two.\n\ncontext: \n\n- i\u2019m nigerian-american & from texas\n\n- i have the stats to get scholarships from both schools\n\n- i want to major in anthropology and do premed\n\n- both schools have little to no black people, so idrc about a black community in this instance. \n\n- completely different settings, but i don\u2019t want to go to fordham ONLY bc it\u2019s in new york. what else is there to offer (that you know of..?)?\n\n- i\u2019m mainly looking at grad school experience, grade inflation/deflation, opportunities, and college experience",

              "text": "Probably Fordham. While the school itself is only like 3.5% Black & 35% BIPOC, the surrounding area is MUCH more diverse than the surrounding area of Clemson. \n\nFordham is in the Bronx, and the Fordham Heights neighborhood is 26% Black. The Bronx as a whole is 35% Black & 69% BIPOC.\n\nBest of luck btw, I've seen you post on here a lot and your list seems really extensive and well-thought out. :)",
