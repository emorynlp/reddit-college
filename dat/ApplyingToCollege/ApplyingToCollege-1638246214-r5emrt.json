  "title:": "Help me find more safeties and targets",
  "text": "Hey folks, \nI\u2019m really looking for some more safeties and targets to apply to. I want some with a political science or public policy focus as I want to go into Law later on. I applied to Stanford, Harvard, UNC (OOS), GW and a couple other T20s. \nAnything with alot of opportunities for internships would be nice but I want them to be target schools like around 40% acceptance rate. \nLet me know if you have any that come to mind! \nThanks",
