  "text": "Not sure where I should say this but needed to tell someone so here I am. I guess ever since this application process rolled around my already low self confidence dropped to the floor; I see things like kids in my class applying to my targets as safeties, or realizing that I\u2019m really not that smart compared to kids that seem like they\u2019ve cured cancer at age 18 and are applying to the same schools as I am. Not to mention the fact that my brother goes to a T20; I love him and this isn\u2019t his fault, but slowly realizing that I can\u2019t do as well as he has done hurts constantly. I don\u2019t know why this one thing has become the biggest factor in this, but realizing that I\u2019m really not that unique in any way has hurt the most - I hear all the time that colleges value diversity and uniqueness, and I have no clue how to convince myself I do. My parents have been super supportive and optimistic throughout the entire process but I feel like that makes it worse. I hate making them have so much faith in me that I don\u2019t have myself. I just don\u2019t know what to do to change any of this, and it feels like I can\u2019t control the fact that Im going on a downwards spiral.",

      "text": "hi! i totally understand how you feel - this is exactly how i feel, and im sure probably a majority of applicants feel this way too!  just keep in mind that though you may feel you aren't unique, you have personal qualities and characteristics (that other people don't have) that you should feel proud of! in the grand scheme of things, college apps aren't super important - the people you surround yourself with, what you end up pursuing, your own personal habits and characteristics are what will catapult you to where you wanna be in life! but either way, i hope you feel more confident in yourself - you are so much better in every single aspect than you think you are! you deserve to believe in yourself and feel happy!",

I went through this a lot when I was applying to colleges so I can sympathize with how you feel.\n\nI was never really active in my high-school years, most of it was online and I didn't do many ECs. Eventually, I realized that going to college was a big step in figuring out what I want to do and what makes me unique, no matter what college I went to.",
