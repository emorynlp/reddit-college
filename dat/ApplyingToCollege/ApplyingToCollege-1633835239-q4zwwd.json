      "text": "in order to apply to most schools, people use applications like the CommonApp and CoalitionApp to apply since most colleges accept applications through them. Exceptions include schools like MIT and Georgetown, but they're in the minority.\n\nYou'd first create an account on the respective website, fill out your biographical and family information, stuff about your school and education, list up to 10 extra curricular activities (clubs, sports, jobs, hobbies, etc.), 5 awards, and write a personal statement essay (650 words).\n\nAfter that, you'll add up to 20 colleges to your list and fill out questions they require. some schools may ask you to write supplemental essays (eg. \"why do you want to attend here?\" or \"why do you want to major in this?\").\n\nit's a bit complicated (this is very very simplified) so I recommend checking this sub's wiki for tips and resources on every aspect of the application.",
