Does this mean I can submit sections from separate dates and only give colleges the exact superscore? \n\nAlso, I read that you should include the AP tests you plan to take at the end of senior year. How does that work? I won\u2019t even know my score until way after apps are done. Should I guess which are going to be good?",

What I want to know is if by listing future tests, I\u2019m locking in score sends without knowing how I\u2019ll do and risking sending bad scores if I do poorly on the tests. Can I opt out later on once I know my senior AP scores?",

Remember that senior APs occur after you are already admitted and deposited/enrolled and the score report comes in July, barely in time to register for fall semester classes.
