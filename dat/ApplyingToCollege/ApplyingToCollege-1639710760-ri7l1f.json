  "text": "How does going back to school work with applications? I only applied to one school because I assumed I\u2019d be accepted and I wasn\u2019t. What do I need to do to change that? \n\nFor background, I\u2019m trying to return to school because I\u2019ve been working as an engineer for the past year.  I only have an associates though and want to get a bsme so I have better opportunities applying to other jobs. My question is, what do I do? I mean I\u2019m already working as an engineer which I feel like should be enough? Do I need to go to community college & take a bunch of BS classes just to get them to accept me? I\u2019m very confused right now",
