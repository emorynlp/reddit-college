  "text": "Make a list of schools that have similar prompts such as ~~\"Why this school,\"~~ \"Community\" and \"Extracurricular.\" Figure out the word counts and write one essay that can be applied to all schools. For example, if school A says it can be between 250-300 words and school B says max of 250 words, just write one 250 word essay for both! This can help save a lot of time if you are stressing about writing supps. I wish I had done this earlier. It would have saved me a lot of stress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  I don't mean to literally copy and paste your why this college essay, but I thought that would be obvious.\n\nTo reclarify, for most prompts, you can strategize by writing one essay that  can be *adapted* to fit all schools. For the why this college essay, it depends on your writing style but after writing around five of them, I've realized that they tend to follow a similar format. This advice more caters to other types of essays, such as community and EC but can also apply to \"why this college\" in some situations ",

Colleges ask a lot of the same questions so it is really useful. Sometimes I've even been able to use 90% of one essay for an entirely different prompt but that rarely happens.",

For obvious reasons you shouldn't literally copy and paste that type of essay but you can use old essays as outlines for new ones. \n\nFor other prompts this advice is more useful. I was stressing about writing my 20 supplements until I realized I could strategize by writing a few that can be repurposed for all schools.",
