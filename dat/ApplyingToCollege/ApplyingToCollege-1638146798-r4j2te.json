  "text": "I have a 3.72 UW and it's going to prevent me from getting into any top school.\n\nIt's upward trending, but it doesn't matter. I've desperately been doing research online on Reddit, Quora, etc to see if it's possible for me to get into a top school, but it isn't.\n\nMy 1500 SAT, unique ECs, LORs from teachers I built relationships with and my essays that I spent so much time on are all going to waste.\n\nEverything I've worked for going to shit because of one fucking number. I'm angry, anxious and most of all disappointed. It's over.\n\nSorry for ranting but I have no one else to say it to.\n\nEdit: I don't know if this matters but there are 400 kids in my graduating class and my school doesn't do class rank but I am in the top 40-50ish in terms of GPA.",
