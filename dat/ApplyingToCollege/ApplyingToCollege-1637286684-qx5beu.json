                      "text": "Ok, so since you are in your sophomore year, you do have more flexibility. I think AP Psychology would be a good fit for you because that is in a field you are interested in. If you plan on applying in the future as a psych major to a competitive university, the majority of people you are competing against will probably have taken this class or an equivalent. \n\nIt's also important to consider if your transcript will reflect that you dropped this class. It's not the end of the world if it does, but a dropped class can sometimes convey to colleges that you couldn't handle the coursework. Again, not the end of the world and not all colleges will think this, but best to ask your counselor if the dropped class will be listed on the transcript and if there is a way to get rid of that.",
