And i\u2019m not too familiar with the colleges there so i\u2019d like to ask which ones are \u2018good\u2019 in terms of academic, and also lol a good social life? This may sound stupid but i have always wanted toattend those colleges that have their own sports team in those big stadiums (like in the movies) and somewhat loud and lively dorms with those parties and stuff.\n\nI\u2019m planning to take com science and finance btw.",
