  "text": "This is going to be some of the most nerve wracking days in your life. I was in your position a year ago and got deferred from my dream school. I was absolutely crushed and thought i wouldn\u2019t get in anywhere. \nIf you get in, that\u2019s great, congrats!!! \nIf you get deferred or rejected, it\u2019s going to really suck but that\u2019s okay. Please take some time for yourself to cry and be upset. Eat a whole pint of ice cream and binge watch bad reality tv (which is what I did), scream your favorite songs at the top of your lungs, or go pet a dog. Let yourself be sad for a bit instead of brushing it off. \nAlso, I know this is super corny (and something my mom said every day last year which I didn\u2019t believe) but you will end up where you belong, even if it isn\u2019t where you think it is. And I know that can be very hard to believe, but no matter what your decision in these upcoming days, know you will end up where you\u2019re supposed to be, even if it isn\u2019t where you think it is right now :)",
