Some require you to upload other stuff and/or add information directly. You\u2019ll need to check the specific requirements for the school(s) you\u2019re applying to.",

You should look there.\n\nAfter you submit your app, you receive login credentials for an admission portal (for virtually **all** colleges). There, you can check on the status of various other things like your school documents, scores, etc. The portal may also include a way to update scores. For many colleges, the portal is also where you will receive your decision.\n\nA few schools might ask you to do something additional for the app in the portal, such as enter grades or an additional essay. Fortunately, this is not very common.",
