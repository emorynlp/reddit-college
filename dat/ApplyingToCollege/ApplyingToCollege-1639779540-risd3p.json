  "text": "My recommender who was my freshman year teacher wrote me a rec letter in sophomore year for something I applied for. I gave her about a month to write my letter and provided her with tons of detail on specific things I wanted. She sent it back to me with modify it how you wish, and she didn't change anything. I asked her if she meant I modify and write it, and she said yes. Any advice? I feel like what I wrote won't sound anything like what she wrote before.",
