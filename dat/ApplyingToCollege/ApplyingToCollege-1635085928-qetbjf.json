College admissions officers know this. \n\nRead your essay aloud 2 more times and fix any bumps. Print up your application or have someone sit beside you and go over the preview copy page by page slowly. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve done that and you have everything ready to go, hit submit! It\u2019s very exciting \u2014 lots of screen confetti and celebrating\n\nI know Voltaire said it first, but my mom always told me \u201cdon\u2019t let the perfect get in the way of the good\u201d. She shared lots of wise words with me, but I think these might have been some of the best to carry through life. \n\nCome back and tell us when you\u2019ve submitted so we can do a happy dance with you!\n\n(Also, let\u2019s say you submit and you find a big error later that needs to be corrected \u2014 not like a minor typo \u2014 then you get to send an \u201coops\u201d email with the correction!

I accidently put physiology instead of psychology for one of my classes. This was because the computer system auto fills the class and I guess I wasn't paying attention. Anyways , I contacted UCI admissions and the consultant understood my mistake and made a note of it and changed it. Still got accepted and now I'm a junior. Everyone is human bro, relax , we all make mistakes.",

I take IB and it took me the whole day to finally submit my extended essay. My tip is to look over it once, run it through Grammarly, etc. and just send it. Don't keep going back and checking, just force yourself to send it. The more you keep checking the more 'mistakes' you're gonna find.",
