  "text": "Hello, I have a 3.9 GPA with 4.2 weighted. I got an 1100 on SAT. I did all the required things they want such as taking pre calc etc. I\u2019m in NHS and dual sport athlete all four years. I volunteer a lot at churches and am part of 3 clubs. Would I get into Wisconsin-Madison with this? I am trying for computer science. I took AP Computer Science course and got a 4 on the AP EXAM. My dad went there for post-grad as well. Should I submit a test score or should I not? Thank you.",
