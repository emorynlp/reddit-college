  "text": "I was looking over my reviewed responses for a submitted app, and I found that I put the wrong gpa for cumulative gpa when compared to that of my sent request. I put my gpa as 0.0001 less (last digit was a typo) and I\u2019m not joking about this. Is this an issue? Should I call the admissions officer Bc I\u2019m worrying",
