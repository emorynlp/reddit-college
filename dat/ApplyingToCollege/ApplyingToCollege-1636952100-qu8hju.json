      "text": "Using such profanity is ignominious, and I cannot say that the school was in the wrong for punishing you.\n\nThat said, we all make mistakes, and we all let things slip through our lips that we shouldn\u2019t have let slip. \n\nThe Common App no longer requires students to report disciplinary action, but certain schools still require it on their school-specific question section. I\u2019d recommend finding schools that don\u2019t ask for disciplinary action and prioritizing them. If the school you\u2019re recruited to does require you to list disciplinary actions, I\u2019m afraid that there would be a realistic chance they rescind your offer.",
