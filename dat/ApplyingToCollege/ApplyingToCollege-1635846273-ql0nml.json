  "text": "their website says that they\u2019ll accept a late application, but that the finaid result will get back later. not sure if this applies to rd only or both rd and rea. i\u2019ll be submitting the idoc in the next few hours, and i\u2019m completely fine with them sending the finaid decision later. \n\nshould i email them to explain the delay? or would that be annoying?\n\nthank you!",
