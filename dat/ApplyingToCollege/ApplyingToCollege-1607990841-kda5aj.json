There\u2019s websites that have similar things, but I\u2019ve noticed that they\u2019ll often have inaccurate dates and times. On top of that, I standardized my version in EST along with including a clock at the top of the sheet that displays the current date and time in EST to make it easier for people in other time zones to see how close a decision is. Mine also has a section where decisions that are confirmed for today and tomorrow are automatically copied to a section near the top of the sheet and highlighted in their spots on the long list, while more compilations don\u2019t have these types of sections. They also auto cross out after they\u2019ve passed. \n\nTl;dr: my version has a calendar version along with a better distinction system of decision dates coming that day, the next day, and those that have already past, along with standardized timing and being easier to figure out regardless of your personal timezone",
