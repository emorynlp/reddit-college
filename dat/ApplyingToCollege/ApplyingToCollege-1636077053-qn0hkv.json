  "text": "I said something contriversial and it turns out the other side got offended. I thought i was very calm in the way I phrased it but they blew is out of proportion. I didn't get a detention or suspended but my principal talked to me 2 times about this making and forced me to say that im guilty, even though im not.\n\nWill this go on my transcript or do i need to mention this? I have work too hard to let one comment ruin my chances to a good school.",
