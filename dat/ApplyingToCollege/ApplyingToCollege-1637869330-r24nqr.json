  "title:": "Real Safeties, Matches, and Reaches from the Class of 2024 [15 Applicant Profiles + Admissions Advice]",
  "text": "Hi A2C-ers!\n\nMany of you are familiar with the Real Safeties, Matches, and Reaches (RSMR) document from the [class of 2023](https://old.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ccb8g9/real_safeties_matches_and_reaches_from_the_class/), [class of 2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/90hb61/real_safeties_matches_and_reaches_from_the_class/), and [class of 2021](https://www.docdroid.net/nC8QrlQ/real-safeties-matches-and-reaches-from-the-class-of-2021.pdf). This year, the College Admissions Hub Discord server has once again compiled and organized applicant profiles for your viewing pleasure. This year\u2019s resource features 15 unique profiles, as well as an advice document of those individuals imparting wisdom onto you for the upcoming college admissions cycle!\n\nIf you\u2019d like to get straight to the document, feel free to scroll down to the bottom. It won\u2019t hurt our feelings ~~okay it will a little but that's ok~~. However, we recommend you read (or at least skim) through this post so you have good direction as to how to use these resources.\n\nBut first, a shameless plug for the College Admissions Hub Discord server:\n\nWhat is the College Admissions Hub?\n\nThe College Admissions Hub is a Discord server filled with over 12,000 future and current college students. We represent an incredibly diverse group of high school students, college students (both undergraduate and graduate), and alumni! We have users from all sexual and gender identities, ethnicities, socio-economic backgrounds, and countries (such as the USA, Canada, El Salvador, Australia, United Kingdom, India, Singapore, China). We are a melting pot and hope to share our experiences and advice with as many users as possible!\n\nOur server is a place where students can seek advice from a supportive network of peers and mentors. Some of the services we provide are:\n\n* General advice and assistance in the application process\n* Peer essay reviewing and feedback, along with help with essay brainstorming\n* Financial aid application assistance\n* Help for transfer and international applicants\n\nThe College Admissions Hub boasts students who matriculate to all kinds of universities. Some examples from the Class of 2024 include Cornell, Brown, Tulane, Bowdoin, Tufts, Penn State, MIT, among many other universities across the USA!\n\nThe server has been up for nearly 4 years and we are very proud of how we have been able to help and the services we have been able to provide. We aren't just a serious academic based server. We are a community who loves to have fun! If this interests you, our server link is available here: [https://discord.gg/cah](https://discord.gg/cah)\n\nWhy did we make the Real Safeties, Matches, and Reaches document?\n\nThis question can be best answered by the creators of 2021\u2019s Real Safeties, Matches, and Reaches (RSMR)\n\n>*\u201cThere seems to be a general misunderstanding of what is a real \u201cmatch, safety, and reach\u201d when applying to college. People often think that it only takes \u201cgood grades\u201d and \u201cgood test scores\u201d to get into Harvard or Stanford, when, in reality, there are a lot of other factors that contribute as well.\u201d*\n\nThese documents are intended to be a glimpse into some of those \u201cother factors\u201d so that you can make the best decisions when creating your college list.\n\nWho is this made for and how should they use it?\n\nThis document is made for all those who are applying to colleges in the upcoming cycle, as well as those who are supporting applicants (counselors, parents, siblings) and wish to be more informed about the process.\n\nAlthough the mission of this year\u2019s RSMR is the same as the last two years, the two resources differ structurally. We\u2019ve decided to split up the contents of RSMR into two separate files: one with domestic/international profiles and one a compilation of admissions advice. This decision was made in the hopes that applicants could find more relevant profiles much easier.\n\nWe recommend that users **FIRST** read through the advice document before proceeding to the profiles themselves. It\u2019s quite easy to get lost in the results and not take in some of the amazing and insightful advice offered by recent applicants. When viewing the profile files, make sure to not focus too much one single applicant, especially outliers. Look for trends as they will be a better predictor of your success than any one applicant.\n\nWe wish the Class of 2024 the best of luck in their endeavours. Regardless of whether or not you decide to join us on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/cah), we hope that we have provided valuable assistance through this challenging yet rewarding process. Now, without further ado, we present the Real Safeties, Matches, and Reaches from the Class of 2024!\n\nPDF:\n\n[Advice](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QtYGQXuNfHRpuUdPQ-7gugiFsIld3goC/view?usp=sharing)\n\n[Profiles](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sZqZ66eySgZyIfN0Pcf1IoipxmzWWJYx/view?usp=sharing)\n\nGoogle Docs:\n\n[Advice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Om9d9d-3LRNZv96hTB5GF8xin-kQT2xDIOhu0Qq0HzY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[Profiles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mqs6DAdKfR4k-S6_6P4KK9u5g-ZiKB1GbNOZV3qSIgk/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe CAH Staff Team",
