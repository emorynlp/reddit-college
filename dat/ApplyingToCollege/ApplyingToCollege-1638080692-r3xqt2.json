  "text": "Heyy guys, I have a question. I want to major in International Relations or International Studies. One of my options is Weber State University in Utah, which offers the International Studies minor, but not as a major. I don't understand minors too much cause it is not a thing in my home country, but I want to understand if I will be able to major in International Studies in this college or what, someone explain me, please.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso if you have opinions about Weber please feel free to tell me everything about it, thanks.",

      "text": "\\-Your instinct was correct\u2014Weber State University only offers International Relations as a minor, so you couldn't major in it there. The most similar majors would probably be Political Science, International Business, or maybe Anthropology, Geography, or History (gotten from the [list of required courses](https://catalog.weber.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=19&poid=9246) for that minor). But nothing appears to be that close to an International Relations major there, so you should definitely consider that if you decide to apply.\n\n\\-Minors are \"official\" like majors are and show up on your transcript, but are considered much less extensive because they usually require around 1/3-1/2 the number courses a major does. So you get much less depth in them.\n\n\\-They can be a plus job-wise (especially if they're in some sort of skills-heavy field, like languages or CS/data science), but they're far from essential (and in fact can prevent you from taking a wider breadth of coursework). \n\n\\-Some people minor in things similar to their major, especially if there's a lot of overlap and it'd be easy. Some people minor in something far from it, to pursue an interest or to combine them into a more unique career field.\n\n\\-You usually need at least 1 major to graduate from a 4-year university program. Minors are pretty much never required.",
