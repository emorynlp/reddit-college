  "text": "Hi, I'm from India and applying for US. \n\nI just saw on the common app that some universities require that you take the IELTS/TOEFL/PTE if english isn't your first language. \n\nSo for a CBSE student who's studied English since the first year of schooling, is it still necessary for me to give the IELTS etc? \n\nI have given the Cambridge English Tests (B1, B2) but they are not accepted. I don't have the time to give IELTS etc, so what should I do? Are those tests even required for me? Can I still apply?",
