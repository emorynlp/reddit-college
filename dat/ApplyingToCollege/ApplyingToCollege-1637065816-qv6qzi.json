  "text": "I have an Asperger syndrome. It was a great problem for me when I was younger, but as I grew up I got used to it and now I know how to deal with it.\n\nI'm thinking of writing my essay about the struggle of having AS. I fear they would reject me because I have AS and they may think I would be problematic in the collage community.\n\nDo you think it is a good idea to write about struggle growing up with AS?\n\nBTW: I'm international applying to MIT, Stanford and Ivy league schools this year.",

Now, as I'm thinking of it more, I see the problems I would have describing why I'm best fit for the university based on this challenge.\n\nI would probably end up writing about my love for programming and how I got to research in AI. It just didn't sound that much at first as it is something normal to me after the years I do it.",

Think of one or two positive qualities you want to communicate to admissions and then think of an anecdote or story that shows that. There is a wiki at the top of the subreddit with a section on essays; I like Hack the College Essay.\n\nI would be reluctant to disclose as it is unclear what the benefit would be.",
