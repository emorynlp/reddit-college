  "text": "Found out the some classes I took in middle school that counted as high school credit (spanish and algebra) will appear on my high school transcript. My gpa is lowered quite a bit by this, however I got straight a's junior year and will this year too. I talked to my counselor and she said that there is no way to remove them. Will colleges take into consideration the fact that I got those grades in middle school (in other words, will they recalculate my gpa without those middle school grades?)",
