  "text": "My supplemental essays were written with the assumption that they would be read in the order that they appear on the application portal. Now I'm realizing this may not necessarily be the case, and I really don't want an AO to read it in the wrong order and have to piece everything together in their head.\n\nFor example, my \"Describe the world you came from\" essay leads into my \"Tell us why this field appeals to you\".",

The rest are stand alone.\n\nOnly the \u201cDescribe the world you came from\u201d and \u201cTell us about why this field appeals to you\u201d build on each other, and they are nearly back-to-back essays in the online application. \n\nThis is because the world I came from naturally shaped my aspirations, and to avoid redundant writing instead of mentioning the \u201corigin story\u201d of my aspirations again, I build upon these aspirations to talk about my future goals being the reason I want to study the field.",
