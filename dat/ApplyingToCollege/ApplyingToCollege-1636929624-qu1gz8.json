      "text": "They're both great schools with amazing CS programs, so you won't have problems finding jobs or internships at either one... But the universities themselves are very different - Rutgers (New Brunswick) has a traditional campus while Drexel is made up of buildings in a city area, with the CS department recently moved to a slightly further away building... Check to see which one appeals more to you, and their costs too, and then decide.",

Choose Rutgers I couldn\u2019t be happier with my decision to be honest.\n\nEdit: and I highly agree on the free time part for Rutgers, I know Drexel students are pretty busy when I was researching the school last year, if you have any questions pm me",
