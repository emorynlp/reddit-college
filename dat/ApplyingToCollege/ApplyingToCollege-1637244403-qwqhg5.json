  "text": "Hey! I want to know which is the best college(not university) in Canada for studying a diploma in information technology so that I can later transfer to a good university to complete a degree in computer science. I am looking for a reputed college with a great program so that I can easily transfer my credits later on while taking admission directly in the third year in universities. \n\nAll responses are appreciated, so feel free to reply.",
