  "text": "SO this college shit is BRAND FUCKING NEW to me and I think I'm gonna cry. God, it's so stressful.\n\nWhat types of videos can I put into my portfolio?\n\nCan I use vlogs & visuals? Does it have to be short films and skits?\n\nAlso, what is it called if I want to give concepts and visual ideas rather than being part of a production?\n\nThis is so embarrassing but no one around me knows anything about video production and I'm really struggling to ask the right questions. Please help thank you. Loves and kisses.",
