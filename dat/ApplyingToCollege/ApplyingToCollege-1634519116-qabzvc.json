A lot of people end up transferring schools at some point not just from ccs and end up being really happy, so I don\u2019t think you\u2019d miss out on too much by entering a 4-year later",

      "text": "how did you \"mess up really bad in HS\"? Unless you have a subpar gpa, poor act/sat, lack of EC's, want to go to a college where you are under the average applicant or something else, I think its still worth  to try to apply to colleges, and you can at least try your best as a senior in hopes of getting into a halfway decent community college. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, it's good to practice/maintain a good academic/studying regime so when you go to community college where your grades will count much more, you are not as lost and more prepared for your classes",
