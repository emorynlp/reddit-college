      "text": "To me this depends on where you want to go to college, how strong your preference is, and what your profile looks like.\n\nIf you REALLY want to go to a highly selective college AND you're a competitive applicant, then IMO it's worth it to get some professional guidance because it can significantly tip the scales in your favor.  \n\nIf you don't really care where you end up, or if you are chiefly interested in less selective colleges, or you're not competitive for selective colleges anyway, then a consultant isn't really worth it because they won't add much value for you.  Your results and options for enrollment will be much the same as if you had flown solo.  Obviously there may be other benefits - you might get more merit aid, the process may be easier and less stressful, etc.  But those may not outweigh the high price tag.  All of this also hinges on how affordable the consultant is for you.\n\nHere's a post on what you should know about college admissions consultants:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bmzuha/what_you_need_to_know_about_college_admissions/",

      "text": "If you meet all of the criteria the admissions counselor above outlined and the fees aren\u2019t consequential, I\u2019d actually begin working with someone now. Early benefits as a junior:\n\n-creating a list and having someone who does this for a living to bounce ideas/suggest other schools for fit. Imagine having a list confidently locked down by end of May 2022. \n\n-thinking about your ECs and your personal narrative NOW when you have more time to deliberate on why you do the things you do and what you should also do BEFORE August 2022. A good counselor should be able to help you clarify your thinking and find \u201choles\u201d you may want to patch over while you still have time. Imagine not looking back next August wishing you had thought of X to pursue your junior year or cultivating a better relationship with Y teacher/mentor for LORs. \n\n-taking a stab at a personal statement now. Admissions counselors have more time in the spring especially. If you have a couple of good essays going in to senior year that you can adapt, that can be helpful. Imagine being able to say that you have a couple of strong and vetted essays 95% complete before apps are even issued. \n\nIf you\u2019re someone who might need a gentle nudge coming from a full pay background where your family is going to shell out 350,000 for 4 years of ed AND you expect to apply to 12+ schools, there is a lot of groundwork you can knock out in the next 9 months to give yourself much smoother sailing next year. 10,000 in that context is not a \u201cthing\u201d. \n\nIf you can kill the beast before senior year starts, that\u2019s a really nice luxury to have. That\u2019s how I\u2019d look at it. If you\u2019re a diligent self starter who can adhere to self imposed deadlines, this may not be an issue. But for 95% of us who are mere mortals, that\u2019s usually not the case.",

          "text": "Totally agree. We were introduced to a good counsellor for our son earlier this year for Fall 2022 admissions. I really wish we had engaged him earlier. \n\nEach candidate is unique... Our son has a physical condition and is very active in Sports. Because of this admission counsellor, we have good direction and we now know how to plan. Our decision flow chart has been simplified. Our packaging of my son's uniqueness has been simplified - we have become more aware of what is needed and what is not.  \n\n u/Pitsuh is right in that all the info is available on the internet. In our case, none of us at our home knew how to help or even where to begin looking. And for our son's specific physical condition, I was not even aware that we have so many resources to help us. \n\nRegardless of your counselor, I would start with the CB web site, use their college matching site ( BigFuture). I would also sign up on CC and use their site for help with matching universities/colleges. The key part of the research is in understanding how your target college's honors programs, and EC programs of interest work. This knowledge is where I have found our Counsellor to be invaluable. Good luck!",

              "text": "Yeah I\u2019m not a fan of counselors curating a \u201cbrand\u201d for a kid through all 4 years of high school. Which is not what you\u2019re doing. But like you, I do think there is a lot of value in engaging someone 2-3 semesters prior to junior year if someone is going to hire a consultant at all. Students can clarify their selection thinking, identify the \u201cextra 10%\u201d a counselor can bring to the table, shore up weak points, and get a handle/plan on process (ED choices, essays, LORs) before the applications are even available. 90% of the actual pain and learning curve can be spread out over the 9 months before apps are even published. It makes for a much less stressful senior year and app process.  I wouldn\u2019t want to pay for basic/blocking and tackling execution issues during fall of senior year. A good plan eliminates that need and adds the real value. \n\nI think even for applicants who have a good handle on things, you can get a more objective read on chances/targets from an outside consultant you doesn\u2019t know you on a more personal level via school/family/friend/etc.",

There are some amazing websites and people like College Essay Guy who will give all the information you need to get into top colleges. But, I will admit that the with a private consultant, your workload decreases significantly. \n\nIMO if you can EASILY afford them, then just go for it! I'm sure you'll regret not hiring one if you do not end up getting into the college you always dreamed about. Unless you are stuck on getting into THAT college and can afford to take a gap year and apply again with a counselor's help the next time, it would be much better to hire one as soon as you can.\n\nAlso, There are many other things private consultants can help you with: shortlisting colleges (super important), scholarships, essays, deadlines, ECs and other small yet important things.",

As another example, we helped a student to develop an app, relevant to her interests. We stepped in and told her that she had to do something to stand out, and we helped her along the whole process, including basically walking her through the whole process, and then helped her stay on track and reach out to relevant blogs in order to gain recognition for the effort. Do we help with framing the activities? Yes, of course. However, in many cases, we can actually help shape students' activities in huge ways.",
