  "text": "I am very much different from what my parents think I am and I really want to portray my true self in the essays but my parents want to read them all. I don't know what to do lmao, they have also taken my common app password so I can't even write two essays for each prompt and replace them before submitting (I can try maybe). I will appreciate any advice and please don't say something along \"just write what you want to and don't care about your parents\" because you don't know how things are in my family lol",

If they want to do that don't take my advice but if they just want to look at the essays do that",

However, that probably means you also forgo their financial support.",

I wanted to write an essay about being asexual, since it's something important to me and my identity, but I'm not going to because I'm not coming out to my parents for a college essay. I also wanted to write about being depressed, but I'm not comfortable showing my parents that and it's not what colleges want to hear. \n\nWhen you write college essays you just have to find the parts of your \"true self\" that make for the best looking application.",
