      "text": "Hi newthinz,\n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend this approach, as you are going to the undergraduate program for the undergraduate resources. Many times (depending on school), the graduate programs run independently from the undergraduate programs / resources are not shared across. It may be possible to gain some opportunities (like research) at the grad school, but it should definitely not be the primary reason or even a component of why you want to go the undergraduate program.\n\nHope this helps!",
