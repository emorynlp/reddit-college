  "text": "So I\u2019m applying to around 6 schools, all are within my scoring criteria to get in and are not very prestigious (right now Montclair State University is my top pick) but I was wondering what I should/could put on my application for my activities \n\nFor example - I participated in multiple protests last summer for BLM. These were peaceful protests so no need to worry about a college looking at it and going \u201coh he was in a riot\u201d also all the colleges im applying to have laws that protect social activism \u2018violence\u2019 from student admission\n\nBut I don\u2019t know if I should include it. A friend told me that activities should show leadership or growth - but I\u2019m not sure if a BLM protest does this? Also, does it matter that I went at all? Should I only put down social activism down if I personally was involved in organizing and starting it? Would it look like I\u2019m trying to use social activism selfishly (when I don\u2019t want to do that) \n\nAlso - if I was in Boy Scouts for my 9th grade year (I had done it since like 3rd grade in the younger programs but BSA only started 8th grade or so) should I bother putting it down if I only did it for 3/4 of the year and then stopped? \n\nWould it be ok to say that I did it for a good amount of time that year or would it look like I\u2019m trying to play it up. I don\u2019t know what type of records the BSA keep but I do have my adult leader for those years who can back me up when it comes to how much time we spent and what we did. \n\nSorry for the lengthy questions - just want to make sure I\u2019m doing this right, I\u2019ve been reading horror stories about admissions and students being dropped for slight time differences lol.",

      "text": "For the BLM protests, it might be better to mention it in a supplemental essay (if your schools have that) and save the EC section to activities you continuously did all year round. For Boy Scouts, you can still do put it - if you need more extracurriculars.",

      "text": "So my kiddo got accepted into Montclair last week (and it is the school they will likely go to.) \nTo be honest, I don't think they are looking too hard at EC's because my kiddos ECs consist of taking care of younger sibling, marching in a LGBT parade, and writing stories on Wattpad.",
