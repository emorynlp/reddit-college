  "text": "Like wtf, I went on youtube to look at some of them and they're all insanely edited and so professional and shit. Like I was just gonna go outside and talk about how during high school I've been doing research to address environmental problems in the place that I live, but know I feel like I need to make it look professional or something. On the website they say that they don't look for production quality, but I can't help but feel nervous.",

I have seen them as well. Unless your EC is film production, I actually think (especially for Brown) having something look too slick/professional could backfire.",

He downloaded Wondershare Filmora from the App Store and said it ran well and allows users to do more, and more easily, than iMovie. He found a few glitches, but had no problems doing the video himself. He's not at all artsy, and his only experience has been editing some Tik Tok videos. Good luck!",

I'm guessing a good one can help, but unless its something extraordinary it shouldn't affect you too much. Also professional isn't the only way to go- she said they enjoy casual and comedic videos as well!",
