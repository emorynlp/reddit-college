  "text": "What the title says. These top universities recieve a disproportionate amount of media representation, considering that less than 5% of all college students in the country attend T30 universities.\n\nThe most recent example of this is the Netflix movie *To All the Boys: Always and Forever;* Lara Covey is accepted to UCB and NYU, while Peter Kavinsky is accepted into Stanford.\n\nI don't say this because I'm bitter; in fact, I was accepted to one of the T30 universities.\n\nIt's just unfair to the 95% of students who are not.",

There is a reason the choose schools like Harvard, UCLA, and NYU over schools like WashU, John's Hopkins, and Rice even though all 6 are great schools. People don't know WashU. They know NYU. \n\nThere are some shows and movies that portray a more realistic experience. I think Modern Family handled the college acceptances and rejections well. Haley got kicked out of college after running into some legal trouble and ended up attending community college. Alex was always an overachiever and while CalTech may have been a reach, she was co-Valedictorian and maxed out her GPA. Luke got rejected from the colleges he applied to and spent some time working before applying and getting accepted to the University of Oregon. That was more about the journey of the family though. It wasn't a quick Netflix movie.",

Much easier to go with a widely known Ivy League to show \"Characters are here because they are rich, smart, very well connected, or all three\" rather than \"This isn't a T50 university so you, viewer, have no idea if it is 'pretty good' or 'bottom of the barrel' and we will now have to spend some of the limited runtime explaining it to you\". If the plot of the movie involves someone rich, smart, or very well connected - just shorthand it with \"Harvard\" or \"MIT\" depending on more legal business vs. more tech.",

I think it's because while the school is in a really beautiful location (I spend a lot of time at a place nearby) there is basically nothing to do in la jolla besides go to the beach or enjoy the view at glider port because la jolla is basically a retirement community for the rich so there isn't much that is both affordable and interesting to college students (and some but not that much sports). My mom for example says the only two good things about her experience was finally getting her degree and meeting my dad. Full disclosure though I'm a San Diego kid trying to go pretty far way (mainly to experience something different) so don't base any decisions off my pessimism and justifying not applying to UCSD :)",

At least in \"Work It\" it's a little more realistic because the main character actually talks about building a good app and getting good grades etc. and she still gets rejected? I think from Duke (and Julliard got rejected as well). Presenting all these idealistic scenarios where teens easily choose between really good schools is setting high standards for real seniors in the audience and that's just seriously triggering",

In fact it is realistic for many teenagers in America to aspire to the same colleges, I'm assuming what's unrealistic is them getting in-\n\nWhich is more of a critique of teen-focused entertainment in general. Teen rom-coms are aspirational. They're entire selling point and appeal is they potray lives teens wish they had, which includes not just looking perfect, having very interesting lives and being completely ripped, it also includes getting into aspirational colleges. These movies aren't made to make you question ideas, expose stories and perspectives, or even evoke real emotion. They are to make you feel good. Which isn't good, but then again no one ever claimed they were good movies.\n\nBo Burnham actually has a great critique on this type of entertainment, in his comedic music and even his movie Eighth Grade.",
