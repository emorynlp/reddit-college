  "text": "Today I sat with the IB kids at lunch (rare occurrence, it\u2019s finals week). This includes the class President and salutatorian, whom I\u2019m friends with and the valedictorian and two other top 30 kids, whom I\u2019m just friendly with. Mind you I am also top 30. But today we were talking about our college apps and scholarship apps (another note: I just lost a full ride to the valedictorian earlier this week). Bro I feel so shitty, but it\u2019s honestly on me.\n\n\nThey\u2019re applying to Harvard, NYU, Vandy, and Northwestern. While I\u2019m a comp sci student and just about every where is my reach, I consider my highest reach to be Rice and that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t want to go to a top school besides Rice. In that 30 minutes I sat with them I felt like I was wasting my potential. I felt like I wasn\u2019t good enough so why waste my time applying to get rejected by these places? I\u2019m good but I\u2019m not good like them. I did a few things in hs but at this point, did I really do enough aka as much as them? It was just a whole internal battle that I felt so shit for. Again, I know it\u2019s on me and I don\u2019t hold any jealousy or bitterness towards them but I\u2019m just having a human moment. I\u2019m just gonna listen to that Moana song until I feel happy about where I am again.",

      "text": "I totally feel this. As long as you think you\u2019d be happy at Rice and at your other colleges you\u2019ve done nothing wrong :) on the other hand, you\u2019ll never know if you don\u2019t try so if you want to apply to one or two high top schools you should (ex. Harvard since there\u2019s only three supplementals)",
