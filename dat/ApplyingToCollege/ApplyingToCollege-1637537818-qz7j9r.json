  "text": "Okay here me out I just finished my Penn interview like 2 minutes ago and I'm freaking out. My interviewer allotted only about 30 minutes because she probably had interviews back to back with other students, but the whole time I could not read her body reactions and I just felt like she was silently judging me.\n\nShe would as a question, I would answer, but like she wouldn't add in anything so I was going on these long tangents. The end was the worst however, I got super awkward and I didn't know how to close off or conclude anything and we just sat there for like 20 seconds. \n\nLIKE I COULD NOT READ HER FOR THE LIFE OF ME DO YOU LIKE ME OR NOT HELP YOUR GIRL OUT IM FREAKING OUT.",

One of my friends is probably the nicest kid I know, so I know the people aren't the issue! our interviewer too was very cold and only typed while we talked, not even making eye contact. Try not to worry about it too much!",

      "text": "Oh hey, I had a relatively similar experience too!   \n\n\nMy interviewer was the co-chair of a nearby region so he was pretty busy and had interviews back to back that day apparently. He also came like 20 minutes late to the interview. Mine lasted about like 30-40 minutes I think. \n\nHowever, during me answering, he was completely neutral. Like he seemed pretty formulaic. He was attentively just listening and like even more carefully (the squinting and listening) at some answers and just typing away. I think typing covered like a good 90% during my answering heh. I guess it's for the report idk \n\nHowever, he was super excited and interested to answer questions about his Penn experience aha (he also said he was an extrovert all along so ig that matches). \n\nBut yeah, all in all, mine was entirely unreadable too!",

      "text": "I had my Princeton interview yesterday and... yeah same thing happened to me. It was an hour long conversation and my interviewer talked more than me plus he didn't question me further about the topics I liked and mostly gave advices about the university. I don't know how I feel about it but I prepared very well for this. He didn't even ask me *tell me a bit about yourself* or questions regarding what I liked to do or anything. He did ask me what my hobby was but he didn't ask further questions about it. I am really scared as I wanted to talk more but the conversation seemed like he wasn't interested in me. I don't know if it's because his age (he is around 80 years old) or is it just that I'm bad with conversations?? No idea. Felt very weird and have been feeling down since then.",
