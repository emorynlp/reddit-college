  "text": "\nBasically, the title says it all, I got deferred from my target school, WPI, last night. I\u2019m trying to think of it positively, a deferment is better than a flat out rejection, and being deferred from a school doesn\u2019t mean that I won\u2019t be accepted into the more selective schools I applied to. \n\n\nIt does hurt a bit seeing how everyone who\u2019s complaining about deferments were people who applied to Yale or another top university, and here I am, deferred from a university with an acceptance rate over 50%. \n\nRegardless, I\u2019m going to keep up my grades, write a killer LOCI, and keep in good spirits. I got a gut feeling that I will end up being accepted and attending WPI.",
