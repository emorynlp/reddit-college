  "title:": "If you have a learning disability that make learning foreign languages difficult, do not go to BU if your major is in CAS",
  "text": "BU provides absolutely no accommodations for learning-disabled students seeking them for the CAS language requirement (which is 4 semesters long). I implore you to read this before you make a decision if this applies to you: https://www.bu.edu/bridge/archive/1998/06-26/features3.html\n\nI\u2019m graduating nearly 2 years late for no reason other than this stupid requirement which I\u2019ve had to restart 3 times now. Every other requirement is done, my 5/2022 graduation is now pushed to 01/2024. Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did by assuming a school will offer accommodations. \n\nPlease make an informed decision.",
