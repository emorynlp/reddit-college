However, there is no state priority in private schools, so you would have a better chance of admission applying to a private university. Also, unlike public universities, they often give priority to candidates from underrepresented states and countries, because they like to showcase the demographics of their incoming class and like to have all states and a wide range of countries represented. Also, private universities have endowments that they can use to provide grants and scholarships if they want you enough, whereas financial aid and scholarships are virtually impossible for international students to get at most public universities.",
