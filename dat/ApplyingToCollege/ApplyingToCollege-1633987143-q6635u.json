  "text": "I know this changes for every school and program, but what's the best way to find out if I need 4 years of math class for college? I skipped a few in high school so I finished the APs, but I heard that some want 4 years no matter what. Is there any quick way to check online if I'm applying to a ton of schools? Thanks!",
