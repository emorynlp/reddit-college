  "text": "in my biology club, in addition to learning about biology topics, we also collectively studied for the biology Olympiad. I've taken it both 10th and 11th grade but I never placed in the semi finals or finals. would it be worth including or should I just omit it as a whole?   \nI am also applying as a bio major so I feel like including that I didn't even place would look kind of bad.",
