Start researching which colleges you wanna apply to because prestige is not everything, make a common app account and start working on your personal statement (650 words). Most top colleges will also ask for supplemental essays (100-250 words). You will also need at least 2 letters of recommendations from your professors. The deadline to submit the common app is 31st December.\n\nRegarding scholarships, the colleges will require you to submit your financial information in a form called the CSS. And if youare accepted by a top college, they will only require you to pay how much you can afford, the rest will be covered by scholarships, the top 30 or 40 colleges do this I think.\n\nYou will also need good extracurriculars to get accepted into top colleges but it is too late now to start doing them as you onky have a month left.",
