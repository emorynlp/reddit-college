  "text": "I see a ton of people on here talking about how they do research at T20 universities and how they\u2019ve published papers. That is absurd. I get it\u2019s normal now I\u2019m highly competitive admissions but why is it normal that 15-17 year olds are doing academic research at universities? \n\nLive your life, you guys are KIDS. You\u2019re going to have your whole adult life to pursue a career or study in labs, why is it an expectation now for teenagers to have research to get into these colleges? Take a step back and think about how CRAZY it is that we have high schoolers writing papers on scientific journals just so they can go to college. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense.",

It was more designing where the plants go + donating stuff I already owned because I was leaving home/my parents didn't have interest in keeping them). I guess if you can word hobbies like you've had opportunity to leave behind as a legacy sort, that's what makes colleges think these kids are doing something amazing, but in actuality, we're just doing stuff we always did :p  \n\n\nI still can't wrap my head around kids doing stem research in their junior year for science fair tho... if you're trying to go for nationals then i guess?",

Sure, there may be over-saturation, but you have more opportunities than say, someone from nowhere, Kentucky (no offense to who lives in Kentucky). If you have money, you can pay for lessons to learn about whatever it is you're interested in, so when you apply to said programs or try to convince a professor to take you on, you're way more qualified than some rando who just emailed them. Not to mention the lessons you learn may get you to brush arms with someone with connections who can secure you a spot where you want. And time matters because you need time to do research or to go to a research program. Say you do get into the program of your dreams, but you need to help out at home with your younger siblings or smth, and you cant dump them in daycare or an afterschool program. You won't be able to do said research program because you literally have no time. That time is used taking care of your siblings [this is an example]",

If it looks like everyone else is doing it if they are given a chance and college admission to top universities and crowded / competitive majors are looking for it, they need to consider getting on it too. I would rather blame the universities for overweighting this type of often superficial experience in the admission process. Many schools try to remove standardized tests but they inject these things to differentiate students.  Imagine one day, some schools would reject students for being unwise with their precious childhood with too much time spent on chasing achievements. I read a few places that most high school students\u2019 research work didn\u2019t go anywhere and the labs would have to clean up after the summer. So it is just like a summer lab class after all.",

It's a holistic admissions process, so they have to differentiate students by some measures, participation in research is one of them. In any holistic admissions process, there will be students that find a way to \"cheat\" the system (your example being impressive-looking research where they didn't really do anything). I think the main fault is the pressure that's placed on kids to get into prestigious universities (some would say university period) in the first place. If the value of going to a top college wasn't so over-inflated, then there would be fewer kids pursuing activities they don't care about to get into said colleges.\n\nSidenote- I am heavily in favor of MIT's advice of \"[applying sideways](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying_sideways/)\".",

The 98+ % is wasting their time and lab resources. The research opportunities are difficult to get so it is not an open enroll process. To get to these schools, they first need to get to the researches :).  Schools also pump up their selectivity by increasing applications so they raise false hope which in turn raises competitiveness and youth time wasting and more searching for researching opportunities. \n\nHolistic approach incorporates too much subjectivity which leads to personal bias of application readers.",

None of them were crazy or anything, mostly just me screwing around and making some fun projects that I spun into something that could have some \"larger societal impact\" or whatever. One of them got me to ISEF (I'm like 80% sure cause this was during the breakout of covid and not a ton of people went to the virtual fair lol... but still beef for the resume). \n\nI got an internship through a local program that connects students with internships. I applied to a program, got the job, and was connected to a professor at a local university to work in his lab over the summer. It definitely ate my summer, but it's not like I was doing anything else. Plus, it was fun to explore the city. \n\nNever wrote or published any journals, but got some good experience writing research papers on my projects (had to for a school program). More importantly, I got experience that I could write about in essays.\n\nBiggest piece of advice in terms of getting an internship from a college prof- you don't have to go to Stanford or some prestigious university to get research. Honestly, the more prestigious the university, the more likely the professors are already getting absolutely flooded with cold emails. Any school, no matter how big or small, is probably going to have at least something going on. \n\nSo yeah. That's how I did research lol.",

To have an h-index of 3 now, you need 3 papers cited at least 3 times. Your next paper won't move that needle until it is cited at least 4 times. In geology, 20% of papers are cited never to once per year (mostly by the authors themselves), and 80% of papers are cited less than 5 times a year.

Heck, even some masters students aren't published. \n\nSetting research as a requirement is not just detrimental to high schoolers, but also to researchers in many cases. It takes time out of projects to train people, even if undergrads are joining projects, they typically have a few related advanced classes under their belt before doing so. \n\nHonestly speaking, it is not a fair assumption that professors or researchers will take people on. This is just from my experiences as a current grad student working on several projects, but I can pretty confidently say that if I or my advisor (or any professor in my department) were approached by a high school student, we would probably not be able to take them on (for a variety of reasons in addition to those given as well).\n\nThese reasons are pretty simple when you boil them down: \n\nSome research is physically hazardous. That is a no-go for minors, insurance literally won't allow us to do it.\n\nCommon Rule research is also many times not allowable. There are very strict guidelines which can result in serious fines and even prison time if these are violated. All researchers on such projects have to go through IRB-sanctioned trainings on the applications of the Common Rule and register with the appropriate IRB among other things. \n\nCertain types of technical research require quite a bit of foundational knowledge. This requires training and experience which is usually done in lab courses. \n\nProfessors' priority is the students of the university. Prioritizing outside students can, and has been, grounds for termination (even for those with tenure).\n\nSometimes we work on classified projects or those restricted by NDAs. This should be all I need to say about this (and is all I can say about it).",

Once you've been working on something for 6 months, you know your work inside and out.\n\nMy research ended up being somewhat significant in the field of Envi Eng so I published in a non-HS venue.\n\nWhen I got the internship in March, I took a quarter-long college class at a CC until June to learn the specific programming language I needed for my work.",
