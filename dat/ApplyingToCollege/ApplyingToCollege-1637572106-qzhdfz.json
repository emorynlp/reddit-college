I might get a B in one of my classes this semester and I'm kinda freaking out because will that screw over my upward trend, how much do colleges care about first-semester senior grades?",

              "text": "It may be too late to do this for this semester. But the best solution would be to talk to your teacher. Tell them you are applying for really competitive colleges and ask for details about how you can improve your grade. It may be extra credit, writing an essay early and having the teacher look at it before you turn in the final draft, etc (if you give a teacher an essay to look at early, it should basically be finished at that point already, otherwise they will give you notes you would have figured out yourself).",
