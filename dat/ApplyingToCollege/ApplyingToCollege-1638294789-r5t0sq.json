  "text": "Hello Jazz community!\n\nI am applying for admission to a jazz studies program and am considering whether to apply as a BM in performance vs. a general BA in music.\n\nBoth require the same audition materials for my instrument. My main question is:\n\nAre auditions for prospective performance majors viewed more rigorously than those of general BA applicants?\n\nI understand the curriculum differences and so it would seem to make sense that there would be an incentive to more closely scrutinize those who choose to pursue a performance degree as you will be doing, well...more performance in classes, ensembles, etc.\n\nAdmission rates for the BM in performance on my instrument for last year were higher than those for the BA in music the prior year.\n\nThoughts?\n\n(I generally am more interested in performing but want my application to be reviewed in the most favorable light- I always figure there are opportunities to transfer to a BM track if I decide to later on post (hopeful) admission, lol. This audition also will be a pre-recorded video submission).\n\nThanks!",
