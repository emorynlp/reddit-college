  "text": "Because I live 30miles away from a small city,  The place where I live is a township made by country's biggest oil refinery they have their own school which has good ranking in the state but is closed for public and employes's family members can study there. At the end  all of this is counted in rural area.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwill this boost my chance.",
