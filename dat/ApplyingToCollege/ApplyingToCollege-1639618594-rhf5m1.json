  "text": "Yale defer here. I'm confused... Yale is giving off mixed signals. I didn't get an interview during the REA period but somehow got deferred? They specifically stated that they're only interviewing people they need more info on, so how did they make the decision to defer me without interviewing me? (+ There's definitely a lot of alums in my area, so a lack of interviewers is probably not the reason.)\n\nCan anyone tell me what this Yale deferral means for me? Do I still have a strong chance RD?",

      "text": "My theory is your reader/s read your app, got a good idea of who you are, and felt that the committee was ready to make a decision. However, since you got deferred it means that less than 4/5 of admission officers voted to accept you. The idea that the lack of an interview means auto-admit or auto-reject is bs.",
