  "text": "I uploaded this to the supplementary materials section and it appeared under my materials. I assumed it was turned in. Today I went to my materials and clicked continue (not sure if I clicked it before) and when I went afterwards to my portal it said my video had been submitted. But it is past the deadline, so I assume I must have submitted it on time? Or else it wouldn\u2019t show submitted, right? Is it late? Will they accept it? What I\u2019m asking ig is if it says it\u2019s submitted on my portal that must mean it\u2019s fine and they have it, right? Or should I email an AO to make sure?",
