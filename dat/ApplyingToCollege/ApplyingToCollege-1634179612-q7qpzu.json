What can we do to make our application more eye catching?\n\nYes, there are many applications read on a daily basis so there isn\u2019t a significant amount of time given to every single application. My rule of thumb is put a face to the application! \n\nAttend in virtual information sessions, participate in interviews if possible. Make sure that you are taking compelling and challenging courses in your senior year. With many colleges opting to suspend the use of standardized testing its pivotal that students make their applications as human as possible.\n\n\n\n2.\t\u2060Is it suspicious if we submit all of our ap scores except one? I got 4s and 5s on all my exams except APUSH, which I got a 2 on. \nWould it be a red flag if I didnt report that one?\n\nI don\u2019t think it will draw too much attention. Many times that can worry can be alleviated if you performed exceptionally well in the actual class and possibly have a letter of recommendation from that teacher.\n\n3.\t\u2060Does our high school demographic matter? No one at my school has ever gone to a T10 and I'm worried if that will hurt my chances.\n\nAll counselors provide your colleges with the high school\u2019s school report. It\u2019s a document that lists all the courses available at your school. The school will then compare your transcript to what is in the school report.\n\nEx: if you took 2 APs but had the opportunity to take 5\n\n4.\t\u2060Would you be willing to review my essay?\n\nSend it over!",

          "text": "Sorry this took awhile haha!\n\n1.\t\u2060As a counselor, does it irritate you when students apply to \"too many\" schools?  How many is \"too many\"?\n\nFor me I understand that students have various interests and want to cast their net on schools that check different boxes. What I like to tell students is think about which schools are within your match and fit range and have them reflect on how many supplements do you want write. Does every school have supplemental essays? No but a tell tale sign that you may not be invested as you think in a school is if a supplement as dragging you along and you\u2019re having trouble justifying why you want to go there. \n\n\n2.\t\u2060Do you happen to know how complete the data in Naviance scatter plots is?  In particular, do you know if accepted/rejected status is self-reported by students?\n\nNaviance is flawed certainly, to answer your question, accepted/rejected status is provided to counselors on a case by case basis. For many private schools, without FERPA authorization we do not have access to particular student information especially regarding acceptances. Students can indicated they were accepted as many cases colleges have refrained from telling me over the phone of a students application status due to confidentiality.\n\n3.\t\u2060What myths that students (and parents) believe do you most fervently want to see dispelled?\n\nOh man this a good question! Myths that commonly hear are that  students and/or parents many times feel that community colleges can sometimes feel like a dead end. This is very much not the case. I think it\u2019s worth looking into whether a community college you are looking at has articulation agreements. Basically a partnership between a 2 and 4 year school where you easily transition from one school to the other upon completing the two years at the community college.\n\nAnother myth is that financial aid is set and can\u2019t be changed. Not true! Financial aid appeals very well do work if you are able to provide examples of financial aid packages from competing schools that are offering more. Additionally, if you can indicate that there have been any huge alterations to your families financial circumstances within the past year that can be cause for appealing your financial aid. \n\n4.\t\u2060What aspect of college admissions do you think students spend \"too much\" time/effort on?  What aspect(s) do they spend *too little* time/effort on?\n\n\nI think many times students spend too much time thinking about the financial component of college, more so looking for scholarships and sources for grants. Of course scholarships are helpful, but as any good counselor will tell you make sure that you focus on your match and fit first then we can worry about the financial aspect after. Your Expected Family Contribution won\u2019t change when all is accounted for so that time worrying about scholarships, though it can be effective, can be used in seeing what is your return on investment in choosing certain schools/majors. \n\nIn other words, what are some companies/organizations that typically hire from that college? What does the career center look like? Is it helpful? \n\nWhat support systems exist on campus for students? How is mental health prioritized?\n\nLooking into these factors can help students make a plan for what is available to help them reach their goals and supports that exist along the way. \n\n\n5.\t\u2060What is the most damaging *non-obvious* mistake you see students make w.r.t. admissions?\n\nThe most damaging *non-obvious*  mistakes that students make with regards to admissions I\u2019ve seen are either dropping difficult courses senior year that may otherwise have made them stand out. As a counselor I have to submit transcripts three times a year to colleges. This includes your transcript from junior year (fall of your senior year), mid year transcript and final transcript. It doesn\u2019t help when a student is taking an AP course in the fall and that course Is no longer in their transcript in the spring. \n\nAlso,  another mistake I see is not taking advantage of interviews. Sometimes students underestimate the value that an interview has in the admissions process. With the adequate preparation and delivery, an interview can help.\n\n6.\t\u2060What is the most beneficial *non-obvious* thing you see (some) students do w.r.t. admissions?\n\nThe most beneficial *non-obvious thing I\u2019ve seen some students do with regards to admissions is sending thank you letters/emails to admissions reps that they get in contact with. Admissions reps are people too. Chances are the admissions rep for a college that visits your high school will be the one in charge of reading the applications in your region so it helps to be extra nice :).",

          "text": "Hi, I'd also like to also take a shot at some answers here... Practicing school counselor for a little under a decade at this point... Too lazy to answer all six, but your first three are very enticing!\n\n1.) As I hold senior meetings with my caseload of seniors I will generally recommend a 3 to 8 rule. I will not penalize them for applying to more but the general advice I give them during senior meetings if \"Ultimately, if you find the right fit you will only be going to one of those schools. In essence after 8 schools you have just paid X-1 schools an average of $50 to say \"Yes\" or \"No\" you can go here, even though you ultimately do not. That money may be better served going elsewhere, especially if applying to more than 10 schools. It ultimately isn't going to create more work for me however, especially if using Common App or Naviance (now that they also use the one-and-done system from Common App.)\n\n2.) Naviance's Scatterplot data is **100%** reliant on student and staff reports. The data points are not provided by schools, nor are they automatically imported. For many schools the data is generally created simply from the student saying \"Accepted,\" Rejected,\" or whatever other option. However, I have taken the liberty of hosting Instant Decision Days to more accurately know acceptances versus denials, and many counselors have access to Slate now so we can use that information to accurately input acceptance and denials on behalf of students. Access to the National Clearinghouse can also help with this though it takes a while for the Clearinghouse's information to get updated and accurate and I don't know how many people are going to go in and update a past graduating class to be accurate.\n\n3.) I think his response concerning articulation agreements would be one I agree with as well. I literally have that conversation with every senior every year from the valedictorian to the student who is just now considering college. However, one thing I will say above all else is that your student's counselor is likely much more of an expert than you are, so please do not try to question our competence. We have your student's best interest at heart whereas a college typically doesn't. If a College told you some inane August, September, or October due date you have to beat before \"all the scholarship money runs out\" they're telling you this because they need a higher potential enrollment to keep professors on staff. That is the number one reason they tell this lie! So if your student's school counselor tells you they can't make these dates because they're updating school profiles, preparing updated transcripts, or any other school policy it's because they've experienced this before and are following best practice. Odds are they've seen more in this situation (100s of kids vs your 1) so their knowledge is more vast than yours.",

Since you mentioned your school has limited APs, the colleges will know that from your school\u2019s school report.
