  "text": "       So I go to a vo-tech high school, in the HVAC program specifically, and I want to know if it would be beneficial to write about why a kid from a vocational background wants to major in philosophy and politics\u2026\n\n       I was kind of \u201cforced\u201d into the program since I was in middle school, my parents always telling me that I was going to do it regardless, or if not HVAC, some other technical trade. But it\u2019s not something I wanted to ever do off of my own volition.\n\n       I\u2019m thinking of writing about why my grades aren\u2019t quite high (3.6 GPA, with a 4.0 last year), and my coursework is pretty standard compared  to most students (took the highest math offered, but no APs as they weren\u2019t offered.) However, I do have a somewhat decent SAT score of 1460.\n\n      I want to write about how I tried to sweep my desire for higher education under the rug, and act as if my grades never mattered anyways, as I had no real intentions on going to college, so I didn\u2019t apply myself almost at all in school (in the least pretentious way). But in the past couple of months, I came to terms with the fact that if this isn\u2019t really something I wanted to do, then going to college to learn more about what I\u2019m passionate about is a must.\n\nWould colleges see this as a valid explanation? Would it add depth and value to my application, and seen as diversity\u2014or would it just make me seem like a dummy?\n\n\nP.s.- I\u2019m applying to NYU Gallatin EDII, and sorry for the long post! I\u2019m just very worried about schools seeing my background as a handicap\u2026",
