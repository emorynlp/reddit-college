  "text": "I was trying to fill out UMKC\u2019s application last night when I got stuck on the residency question - I\u2019ve lived in the state I currently reside in since August 2019 but the date selection stopped at 2018 and it\u2019s a required question. Is there anything I can do to get around this? Do I just send an email off to the admissions officer after I submit my application to clarify that it was 2019 not 2018? Not sure what the best way to handle this is",
