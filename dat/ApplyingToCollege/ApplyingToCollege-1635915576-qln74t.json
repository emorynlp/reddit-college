      "text": "Usually the portal will indicate whether scores were received, in a checklist of items. Perhaps give it another day or two for your app to be processed, but if you do not see an indication that scores were received within the next couple of days, I would go ahead and report in the portal. Some colleges accept self-reported scores via the portal and not the app, though Harvard, like most, accepts both through the portal and through the app.",
