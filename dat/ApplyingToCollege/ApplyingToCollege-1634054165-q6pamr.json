  "title:": "CBSE Deflation Query; What is the best place to mention how an applicant has performed quite well despite the SEVERE grade deflation (CBSE student asking on behalf of counselor)",
  "text": "Hi,\n\nOur school followed severe grade deflation in 9th and 11th in order to prepare us for our national examinations in 10th and 12th (basically every other Indian school)\n\nCould someone please advice\n\n1)What's the best place to mention this? On the remarks of my official school transcript that the counselor will be uploading, On the counselor rec? Or someplace else? (I want this information to come from my school's end only)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) What exactly should I mention. So I got around 85-88 in 11th grade but that was the highest for my course load (my stream, that was Commerce). Tho the overall Highest was 91% in 11th (but it wasn't possible at all for anyone with my courseload. The person getting the highest was a Science Student (PCM).\n\n CAN I ask my counselor to mention that I got the highest possible marks in 11th grade with my caseload? (would this be the right thing?)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) What would be the best place for my counselor/my school to mention that I was in the top 10 or 5% throughout high school? My transcript or in the counselor rec form/questionnaire? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n I understand almost every other Indian school does this but I feel this is done on an unprecedented level in our school, so I contacted my school if they'd just be willing to acknowledge this from their end, they said they'd definitely try their best to help me so I could come up with ways of expressing this information and they'll let me know what they could put; hence my queries.\n\n THIS **MATTERS** a **lot** to me because one of my top choices is **score-free** for me and I believe without that context my grades just won't seem competitive enough: I'm not over/underestimating myself simply saying what counselors have mentioned to me once in the past.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTIA!!!",
