              "text": "there are 3 types of schools: Reach schools, Target schools, and safety schools. At my school the average student applies to 8 schools (it's a college prep school) and our college counselors like us to have (again, for the average student) 2 safeties, 4 targets, and 2 reaches. Safeties are the \"sleep well at night\" schools because you could apply to them blindfolded and know you can get in, targets are one's where you probably have a 50-50 shot of making it, you fit squarely in their testing, GPA, and ideal student margins. Reach is the \"good luck\" type of colleges, the ones where you have a low chance of getting in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, don't apply ED to a reach school unless it's your dream school bc you have a low chance of getting admitted anyways. Reaches should only be applied to if they're your dream college, but some people will apply just to see if they can get in (I'm guilty of this, since U Chicago has an EA).\n\nThese terms are subjective to the individual student. My safeties are places like Union College, whereas my targets are places like Amherst and Williams, which to some might be a target or reach school respectively. These labels are also influenced by the acceptance rate, which is why the Ivies are always reaches, as so many people apply to them that the chances of admittance are negligible.\n\nWhatever state your school is in has a state school, and if you make the cutoff line they're basically required to admit you, that's a safety for everyone. the ivies are a reach in everyone's books, and anything else is dependent on the student.\n\nIk I just sounded like a prep kid with a stick up their ass. I'm sorry, I just have this mode I've been in recently where anything college related is a statistic that I need to analyze and interpret lol. I hope this helps tho",
