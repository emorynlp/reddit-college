      "text": "Just a side note, I wouldn\u2019t rely heavily on the markings on the CDS, as they can be a little misleading. A number of schools mark that they consider demonstrated interest when what they really mean is they consider your answer to their \u201cWhy us\u201d essay. For instance, from the Duke admissions FAQ page:\n\n>\t\u201cDemonstrated interest\u201d as most people use the term is not a plus factor in our process.  Students don\u2019t need to visit the campus, and we discourage students from contacting the Admissions Office in order to demonstrate their interest in us. There is no benefit to emailing or meeting your regional admissions officer.\n>\n>\tWhat we do recommend is that students take the time to explore what Duke has to offer them in light of their hopes and expectations for college, and to think carefully about why there may be a good match between them and us. That will allow them to write a thoughtful and detailed answer to our essay on this subject. Our experience is that students who have fully investigated Duke, whether virtually or in person, are better able to articulate why Duke is a good match for them. We do our best to make enough information about Duke available to everybody.\n>\n>\tIf you want a term to use what we look for, you could say that applicants should be able to communicate their \u201cdemonstrated knowledge\u201d through their application rather than their \u201cdemonstrated interest\u201d through the number of times they have visited, met, or contacted us.",
