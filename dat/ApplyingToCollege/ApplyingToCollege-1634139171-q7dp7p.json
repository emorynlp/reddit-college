  "text": "i\u2019ve self reported a few AP exam scores for my college applications, but i don\u2019t want the colleges i\u2019m applying to to see my bio exam score or my AB calc subscore from the BC exam. the issue is I don\u2019t know how to send the scores so that those two are excluded\n\ni heard that you can just report the scores, and it\u2019s not necessary to send them in until after you\u2019re admitted to a college. is that the case? and if so, should i wait to report the scores?\n\nthanks so much",
