Fewer applicants, plus AOs will of course be more interested in someone committed v. someone who is not. If they think their SAT score will be the most important part of their application, then RD v. ED doesn\u2019t matter since it only takes 10 seconds to look through a score. However, if the more important part of their application is something mentioned in an essay or through an EC, ED is worth it because on that plan there\u2019s a chance the AO will be able to give more time to said things. And I totally agree with you on a 1500-1550 both showing the same level of intelligence.",

But those candidates need to be sorted and selected somehow. \u201cLesser\u201d is in quotes for a reason. \u201cLesser\u201d =/= unqualified. \u201cLesser\u201d =/= appreciable difference. \n\nColleges conduct ED rounds to lock in matriculants and mitigate enrollment uncertainty. There will be a marginal (emphasis on marginal) advantage to applying ED. \n\nNote: I\u2019m not saying for all years, all schools or for all applicant subgroups. But on average this is true. In certain years schools may overestimate the total pool and be too selective in the ED rounds. For certain student subsets of the overall pool, ED may be generally more selective. But overall...and in most years...ED is marginally less selective for the vast majority of schools. \n\nColleges forfeit some degree of candidate  \u201coptimization\u201d to reduce admissions volatility. And they do so realizing that 1) admitting a few \u201c7.8\u201d or \u201c7.9\u201d candidates at the expense of a few \u201c8.0\u201d candidates will make no appreciable difference on campus and 2) the odds of the \u201c8.0\u201d applicant being a better college student/campus contributor is barely over 50% anyway. \n\nChoice of application round has no impact on the admissions decision for the vast majority of applicants.

A lot of the ED seats are filled by legacy and athletes, and the odds of getting in as a regular student is just as high as applying regular decision. That said, if you truly feel uncomfortable sending a 1500, which is a great score by the way, then sending in a 1550 regular decision would yield marginally better odds of getting in. Also, regular decision offers you more time to make a better application and still have as good odds of getting in. The only real advantage of ED when it comes to top schools is getting your decision early.",
