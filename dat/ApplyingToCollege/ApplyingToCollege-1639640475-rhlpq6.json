  "text": "\"The admissions committee at New York University has carefully considered your application and supporting credentials for all programs in which you expressed interest on your application. It is with regret that I must inform you that we are unable to offer you admission to NYU this year. . .\"\nI don't know how to feel about my rejection from NYU. It still doesn't feel real, especially when I've poured my heart and soul out for the last year and a half preparing for this particular application. Despite my crazy senior year schedule, I spent countless hours working on my Personal and NYU essay, revising draft after draft to make sure that I have the best set of essays possible. I even did everything possible that would benefit my application: running my own charity events, taking part in independent research programs, being on the school honor roll while taking every AP offered at school, surrounding myself with NYU students and alums... I was so certain that I was going to be accepted. But yesterday, when I opened my portal and saw these words, I was crushed. I couldn't help and still can't help but ponder about what I did wrong and how was I not adequate. To be completely honest, I don't know what to do anymore; I don't want to be anywhere other than NYU, and I know that going to any other school will just not fulfill me.",

      "text": "I\u2019m in the exact same situation as you op\u2026 I did all I could, showed as much demonstrated interest and made my personality align with the major I wanted, but the rejection was too much to handle\u2026 \n\nAt one time, I thought I was gonna be the perfect fit for them, and I thought that no other schools gonna fit me this well! When I got rejected 12 hours ago, I thought I was gonna cry- i thought I could quickly decompress from this and move on, but I couldn\u2019t really either.. especially from doing so much research on them and what I could do nearby, it all crushed me too quick- \n\nI\u2019ve trying to get into the mindset of disliking that school and thinking of other possibilities, even if it\u2019s not the best overall. Just remember, both you and me definitely have other places we\u2019ll be happy at, and maybe it means that we don\u2019t have to walk through streets that smell like piss :)",

I remember last year that I couldn\u2019t get out of bed for a good couple of days and that it took over 2 months for me to start feeling normal again. It\u2019s a process.\n\nI am not going to lie to you. Wherever you end up at you\u2019re most likely not gonna be as excited as you were for that one school. That is not to say, however, that you won\u2019t be happy.\n\nPlease take your time to process this, but do not let it destroy you.",
