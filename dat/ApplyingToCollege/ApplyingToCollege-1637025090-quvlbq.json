  "text": "I received the mass email today about there being lots of applications, etc., but the email also said to submit the SRAR even if you submitted an official transcript. However, when I emailed my AO (before this email bc it was unclear), he said if I was submitting an official transcript then SRAR isn't required. Very confused by this info. Should I now submit the SRAR?",

My kid did SRAR and didn\u2019t link it himself but they got it b/c it was listed as one of his schools. It\u2019s easy if you\u2019ve done the SRAR.",
