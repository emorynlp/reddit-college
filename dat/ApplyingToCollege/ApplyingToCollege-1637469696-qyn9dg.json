  "text": "I had my virtual MIT interview recently and while it didn't go 100% as I would've wanted, it was pretty okay. Until the end, when she asked if I had any questions and I was on this doc so I scrolled to find questions that I had thought of before hand. Then she asked me if I had notes in a serious tone and I was like, yeah I just wanted to find my questions. Will she think I don't have integrity/ is this a red flag?",

She'll just make a little note like \"The applicant had notes for the interview\" or something and might add how she felt about it.\n\nBUT, and trust me on this, if the rest of your application is good enough to get an acceptance, this 100% won't change the decision.",

      "text": "Not necessarily integrity (you can't really cheat on an interview) but I think it gives you sort of a bad rep that you can't go with the flow of things but if you could maybe have taken the time to explain it like you had the notes from the actual interview written down and you wanted to look through them real quick then that's fine. Unless your interviewer bashes you hardcore on your review sheet, you aren't screwed.",
