But I read that colleges like to keep their reported \"average financial aid amount given to students\" high so they try to take either those who pay the whole tuition, or those who pay nothing at all. Is that actually true?",

Regardless of what your EFC calculation is, the college will recalculate what they will offer you if admitted.",
