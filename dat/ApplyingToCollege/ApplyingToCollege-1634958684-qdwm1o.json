  "text": "For a few of my state schools, I'm applying to a different major than all of my other schools (for financial reasons). Because of this, I wanted to know if I can change the \"Career Interest\" part of the \"Future Plans\" section of my CommonApp after I've submitted my state school apps to reflect the different major I'll be applying for. IK these changes won't apply to colleges I've already applied to, but I just want to ensure that my CommonApp is editable after submitting to schools. \n\nSo basically, can I edit my CommonApp (Future Plans, Activities List, Personal Statement, etc) for my future colleges?",
