  "text": "Hi, I am an international high school senior who is applying to three early schools (including ED and EA) with a deadline of Nov 1. But the problem is that I just sent my Duolingo and SAT scores, which means the schools will probably receive them after the deadline. I've already checked their websites, but they do not say anything about it. Do colleges wait for a few weeks until they receive all the tests?",

      "text": "Check each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll \u2013 self-reporting is faster, so self-report if possible. Other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission - for most colleges, having scores arrive after the deadline is not a problem. A few may be stricter.",
