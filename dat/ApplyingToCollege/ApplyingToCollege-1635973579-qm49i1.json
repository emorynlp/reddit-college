  "text": "I didn\u2019t try to get a credit card until after taking out student loans and now basically no credit card will approve me (even student cards) soooo I\u2019m stuck getting a secured card that\u2019s basically a loan builder for the next year (has basically no cash back/benefits, very sad). Moral of the story try to get a student card before taking out loans. Oh also use pre approval for cards bc applying lowers your credit score regardless of approval (who knew!) \n\nSigned, \n\n~A frustrated college student with debt and no credit \n\nP.s credit card debt is the worst kind of debt u don\u2019t want any of that garbage",
