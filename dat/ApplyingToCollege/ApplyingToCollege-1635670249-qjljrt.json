  "title:": "Is it ok to put SAT score on UC app?",
  "text": "I got National merit semi finalist and I want to put it on my awards section for UC app but I got it through alternate entry (I qualified through my SAT score instead of PSAT). The UC app asks you what u did to receive the award so I have to put that I qualified through SAT score but I\u2019m scared (probably irrationally) that since I put my SAT score on the app they will disqualify my application or something because technically they aren\u2019t supposed to factor in SAT into admissions.\n\nThey won\u2019t care right? Is anyone else putting their SAT on the UC app for a reason like mine? \n\nThanks for the help",
