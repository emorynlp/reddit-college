  "text": "Basically title. She agreed to pay for my education in full at my dream school (which I have already been accepted to but received no aid for) on one condition. She says I'm only allowed to go if I start eating healthier and exercising. Basically she doesn't want me to die young and I'll get to go. \n\nI even got accepted into a school where I'd practically be paid to go to, but she insists on my dream school and aaaaaah \n\nI don't want to be a \u2728burden\u2728 but she's so great for this. Can y'all just compliment her for me?\n\nEdit: I wanted to emphasize that this isn\u2019t easy for her. She\u2019s working really hard and making big sacrifices to make this happen. But dw y\u2019all, I\u2019m applying to scholarships and trying to soften the blow on her.",

          "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that. I know everyone\u2019s financial situation is different and not every household is as fortunate. But assuming the worst, if your cost to attend is 80k per year then 70% leaves you with 24,000 left to pay per year. Of course this isn\u2019t ideal, but the average pay per year for a part time job is about 20k or so. And yea, it definitely sucks to work and study at the same time for school but it\u2019s one idea. You can also do work study at the university which usually comes out to between three and four thousand per year. And everything helps. With just the work-study, you\u2019re left with about 20k left to pay per year. You can take a lot of time to work now and find scholarships. Of you apply to let\u2019s say fifty worth one thousand each but only win ten, that\u2019s 10,000 additional dollars to cut down on your tuition. Shotgunning scholarships is one of the most recommended things on this sub for cutting down the cost of college. And grad school is always something to consider, but if you\u2019re NOT going to grad school then 100,000 in loans may not be the worst thing in the world. Especially if you\u2019re starting salary is high. \nI know, all of this is much easier said than done, but I believe in you. I know you can make it to the university you want if you put your mind to it :)",

So even if you did want to lose weight for your own reasons and not because you're being paid to, the max you could lose \"over the course of a few months\" would be 12-24 pounds. It takes time to put weight on and it also takes time to get it off. Just because other people in your fam have medical issues does not mean you will. That's like saying my aunt is allergic to nuts so I'm not gonna eat them myself. By all means, lose weight in a healthy way if that's what you want to do. What I am saying is wrong is manipulating someone else's behavior by paying them to meet YOUR goals for them. That is never healthy even if you have admirable or altruistic reasons for doing so.",
