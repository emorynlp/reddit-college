  "text": "I am applying to the UBC International Scholars Program but my recommender is still unable to submit her recommendation. I even resent her an invite but she says she can't view the application further from the first page.  I had contacted UBC by the contact form on the website, emailed all the accounts 15 days back and even called the office and stayed on the line for 30 mins. (International calls are expensive as hell) But I received no help. And the deadline is on December 1st.\n\nWhat can I do? TT I'm seriously panicking. I've been working on this application for months and I don't want to lose a chance just because of something completely out of my control.",
