  "text": "While I've made my plans and researched, I figured that I'm going to importantly need second insights from others who've been through the process, especially international students. For the most part I want to see what backups I can make for the pieces I'm dealt with in case anything goes south, \n\nA little about me, I'm a 19 years old student from Egypt who's starting his first university year in tourism and hospitality(as it was the only proper option for me available), and is intending to graduate with a bachelor's 4 years later to pursue study, work and life in Canada, as there's little to no happiness for me to find the longer I stay where I live.\n\nMy concern however, lays in my highschool GPA; I graduated with 60%(approx D average of GPA, so the lowest possible), it mainly had to do with an extreme learning difficulty studying in my native language while in contrast I processed and understood things quite well in English, the shitty education system and 'teachers', and other abhorrent circumstances that only served as neverending foils and hindrance to my mental state and how hard I tried to do in school throughout my childhood. Things were hopelessly out of my hands in other, simple words, so I'm unfairly stuck with dealing with it. I can rant and elaborate better about it in a different comment, but that's not the focus of the topic I'm trying to discuss here. \n\nIt's fortunate that English is the primarily language in which studies are taught here at my faculty considering the international sector, so I can finally need not to worry about the crippling difficulties I had to endure. Plus the benefit of also studying in French as a second language. But this is what I'm mainly here for at my university; getting the bachelor's for CRS points and sufficiently studying for a high college GPA to make do and salvage my chances.\n\nMy question is, will my highschool grades be a curse when it comes to applying for a two-year program in Canada by the time I graduate? Or they're more likely to look at my foreign university's score and degree to decide instead? I'm going to freelance to save enough funds anyhow by myself, but I was also wondering if financial aid would additionally be eligible for me or not in retrospect in the case of college credits and not HS grades. \n\nI'm planning to study computer science on the side as well because that's what I intend to take for the two-year program and work with afterwards, but I mainly wanted to ascertain for myself whether if I'm going to face any complications in regards to highschool GPA or not.",
