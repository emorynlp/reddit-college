I don\u2019t really want to go to a top school because of the cost, but yet again I\u2019m scared of the social embarrassment idk it just sounds stupid but it scares me a lot.",

Often though they give higher ranked undergrads more leeway on GPA and have better access to extracirriculars. You will be fine without going to a high ranked undergrad but it usually only helps you",

      "text": ">Do med schools really care about where you do your pre med from?\n\nNot as much as many folks on here think.  They look at grades, MCAT, and activities that suggest you're serious about practicing medicine.  Undergraduate research, healthcare-related ECs, etc.  The \"best\" schools for pre-med are the ones that make those last two things as easy and straightforward as possible.  But, even if you don't attend one of the \"best\" pre-med schools, you can still (usually) engage in those activities.",
