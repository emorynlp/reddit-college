  "text": "So I\u2019m 25, went back to CC last fall and am gearing up to transfer next fall. I, for some reason, wasn\u2019t aware until recently that I don\u2019t NEED my associates degree before transferring\u2026 I recently switched from an Arts major to a Science major, so the classes I would need to graduate are a little different, but I also goofed my first 3 semesters by not taking all of my correct gen Eds. I don\u2019t feel like I need take spend time in Eng 101/102, and Speech 101 classes, and would rather take Chem/Physics/Calc & other classes that pertain more to the program I wanna transfer into. I plan on getting the same # of credits, I\u2019m just not sure if this is the better option or if it would hurt me in my transfer somehow. Advice is appreciated",
