  "title:": "Question about University of South Carolina CommonApp!!!",
  "text": "This is a somewhat urgent questions as the application is due tomorrow!\n\nI was looking over the questions on the CommonApp before submitting and I noticed that they ask about middle school courses you took. From the ones they ask about, I took Algebra I and a world language in middle school, but only Algebra I is shown on my transcript. Should I still put yes for world language, or does it only ask about the ones that are shown on your transcript?",

Something like that wouldn\u2019t count as a foreign language course.",
