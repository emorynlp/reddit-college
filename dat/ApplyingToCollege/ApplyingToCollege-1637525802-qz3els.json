The best advice I can give you? Read books! Read the news! It\u2019s what you\u2019ll be doing for most of your scholarity at SP anyways. Also, make sure you have a great understanding of LH\u2019s campus, the classes offered, any notable teachers you can cite. They\u2019ll want to hear that in the interview.",
