  "text": "hi all! i wanted to put this out there for anyone who\u2019s been rejected/deferred ed or very nervous about the rd round. hopefully this will make you feel a bit better.\n\nmy twin sister got deferred from her dream school two weeks ago. however, on wednesday i was accepted into my dream school. \n\nmy initial reaction was bliss\u2014 i felt so accomplished and validated. when i went to school, everyone congratulated me and was talking about the acceptance. i always thought that this acceptance would finally make me feel intelligent, hardworking, and worthy. i thought it was going to show people that i was \u201cgood enough.\u201d \n\npeople started talking badly about me a few hours later, talking about how i have \u201cno life.\u201d\n\ni got home, and really nothing changed. i didn\u2019t have an elevated sense of self confidence, everything was the same. i still didn\u2019t feel \u201cgood enough.\u201d at the end of the day, no one cares that i was accepted. i see my sister look so sad and envious because she too believes what i did. in my eyes, she is everything and more and i am so heartbroken to see she feels like she needs an acceptance to validate what i think is so obvious.\n\nif you\u2019re looking for what i was, let me just tell you that no college acceptance will provide you with it. it\u2019s intrinsic and what college you pay a ridiculous amount of money for is not everything. \n\nthere are so many hardworking, ambitious students here and with or without a brand name college you will be fine. you aren\u2019t better or worse depending on your college decisions.",

Your kind words about your sister tell me you are a thoughtful and kind person.  And you are right... your sister\u2019s worth is not measured by any acceptance or rejection.  She will end up where she is meant to be, and it may very well be better than she imagined.",

      "text": "I got into my dream school (as did my twin sister)! Honestly, the first thing I felt when I opened my decision was nausea and anxiety. The chase was almost more enjoyable than the reality of leaving home and going to college in ~8 months. The financial aid offer I had first gotten was way less than what the net price calculator had said and I basically had a panic attack while sitting backstage (it was opening night of our school play) because I didn\u2019t know what to do next. \n\nThe excitement definitely came over the next few days (especially since I managed to appeal to increase my financial aid offer haha), but I still feel academically insecure, I still have anxiety, while I might have a \u2018light at the end of the tunnel\u2019 for getting out of my turbulent home situation, I\u2019m no better of a person than I was last Friday at this exact time before I opened my decision. I\u2019ve \u2018unlocked\u2019 the next level but I still need to go through it to gain the actual merit and personality development, and I\u2019d gain a lot of that merit (I will say, not all of it because I won\u2019t deny that I\u2019m going to have access to more school specific resources) because of my own drive and ambition and study habits over the name of a school. I\u2019m still myself and I have to do the work to get from where I am now to who I want to be!",

I'm still extremely happy and grateful, but a lot of the insecurities and sadness I thought I would be automatically be done with are still here today. I'm so happy to be accepted, but getting into a college will not really fix any mental health issues you have, you have to work on that yourself.",
