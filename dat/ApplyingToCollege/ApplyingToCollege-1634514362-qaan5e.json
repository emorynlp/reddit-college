  "text": "My parents think that I should ED to Penn just to boost my chances of getting in a top college (they don't know a lot about colleges/the process of applying, but unfortunately think that they do). Especially since we can afford to pay the full price, they think that I am giving up a lot by not choosing ED. Personally,  I want to REA to Stanford, not that it is necessarily my dream school, just that I want to apply to all the schools on my list to have some choice between where I am accepted, weighing out my options. Also, in no way to come across as full of myself, but I have worked hard in high school, and do think that I will get into at least one if not a couple of t20s, ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/qa6aui/chance_me_stanford_rea/) is my chance me if you want to check for yourself). Most importantly, however, at this point, I don't have a number 1 school, so I don't think ED is the right choice in that sense either. Is there any way that I can convince them that not using ED is not a big deal, or do you guys think they are right?",

      "text": "I don\u2019t think they\u2019re right. Looking at your chanceme I agree that you have a good chance at getting in to schools. In my opinion you could ED to any t20 and it would do the same thing: slightly boost your chances. ED should always be about you wanting to go to that school over any other school, not how it boosts your chances of getting in.",

      "text": "Two reasons to ED:\n\n1-school is your definite #1\n\n2-you\u2019re largely indifferent regarding a few schools and EDing to one of those 2-5 is most likely to produce a significant odds boost. And I\u2019m not sure UPenn, once you remove the legacies and athletes out of the ED pile, really does that. If you were pretty neutral between Cornell, NU, and WashU, in that scenario I could see EDing to WashU as a domestic applicant as it gives you the best chance to end the process/work sooner.",
