  "title:": "MIT Interview- No reply from interviewer",
  "text": "I got contacted by my MIT interviewer two weeks back and I replied (in like 5 hours?) with dates I was available to call but they never said anything back. I sent a follow up email a few days back but idk if that's gonna help. I just want to make sure that if I don't get an interview done it will be waived instead of them saying I was contacted or wtv. MIT says early action interviews are done in November and the month is about to end so should I wait a bit more before emailing them or just not do anything?",
