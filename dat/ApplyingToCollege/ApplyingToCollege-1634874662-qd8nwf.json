  "text": "Sorry in advance, I'm writing this late and severely anxious.\n\nOverall, I'm a pretty good student. 4.0 GPA, 1470 SAT, captain of my Computer Science and Math teams, etc. And for the most part, I've been a decent enough kid all throughout high school. But, there's a significant drop in my grades on my transcript, as well as a major shift in my behavior that feels like I have to talk about it. \n\nThe only problem is that I had these issues because of a miscarriage sophomore year, when I was 14. I fell in love with and trusted someone who didn't actually have my best interest at heart and made a mistake because I didn't have very good sex Ed (Texas student.)\n\nI wrote my personal essay about it, but I'm reconsidering submitting it to colleges. It's been checked by two English teachers and my best friend, all of whom are fairly liberal women. \n\nI don't want to hurt my admissions chances with this essay, but everything from my choice of major to my grades and work ethic came from the desperation I felt to be a better person in the name of my daughter. Is it a mistake?",

      "text": "wait how do you have a 4.0 GPA if you have a significant drop in grades on your transcript?\n\nBut anyway yeah your essay is super risky and there's no telling how AOs will see it- it could reflect very well (AOs could be touched by your determination to make a better life for your child and how you grew from your mistakes, for instance), or it could reflect poorly (AOs could view you as reckless/impulsive, think you're trying to make excuses with by blaming it on \"bad sex ed\", fear that you might get pregnant again in college, etc). \n\nImo you should send it to all your high reaches and have a more \"safe\" essay for your targets/safeties.",
