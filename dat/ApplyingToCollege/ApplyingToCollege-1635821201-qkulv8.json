  "title:": "C in a dual enrollment Biology class",
  "text": "I\u2019m a high school junior taking a dual enrollment biology class at a local community college. This class is really fast paced as it\u2019s a whole biology class in one semester. I\u2019m struggling to keep up and night end up with a B- or a C in this class. Will a C or low B affect my college or science GPA for medical school? I have A\u2019s and B+ in all my other dual enrollment classes (english, government, US history) but this biology class is the only class I\u2019m struggling with. I plan to go into pre med after I graduate but I\u2019m worried if this biology class will effect my science and college GPA for med school.",
