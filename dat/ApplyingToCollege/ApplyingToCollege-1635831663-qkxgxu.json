  "text": "So I am about to go to a military academy in the Philippines next year because my family can't afford college, so I have no choice but to go and study in the military academy. But apparently, going into the military academy will have me a bachelor's degree as a result and I heard that you can freely choose what degree you want to earn within a preferred field. For example, you chose to be in the airforce and you want to be a mechanical engineer, your degree title will be related to what you choose. \n\n I want to take a degree in mechanical engineering in the future with a specialization in robotics, but the only problem that I have is that my grades in high school are not that good. I want to study abroad in the future to go study in universities like Georgia tech or any other unis that offer this program. I get a little anxious especially since my grades in high school are nothing special.\n\n So my question is if I did apply for a second bachelor's degree will they only look for your grades on your previous degree or will they still look into your grades in high school? Do I still need to take an SAT? Any advice for applications? If you do have some recommendations or tips please do share, that would be appreciated.",
