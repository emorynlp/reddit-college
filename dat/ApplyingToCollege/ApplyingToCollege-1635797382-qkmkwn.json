      "text": "Most common: ask if you can submit the free International Student Financial Aid Application instead, and if so, ask if you can receive a PDF copy via email. Each college manages their own form this year. Some colleges will give you a CSS profile fee waiver code, but most will not since they actually have to pay that fee for you to College Board (vs the domestic student who automatically get waivers based on income).",
