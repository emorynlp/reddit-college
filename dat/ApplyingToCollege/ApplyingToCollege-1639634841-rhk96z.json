          "text": "**tl;dr: college is more about connections than an education, especially in this field, so i want to get into the schools that will give me the best connections**\n\nlong answer:\n\ngreat question! first of all, to be honest, in my mind, at this point in time college is really only worth it for the connections you make or the status you achieve just by saying you went to some school.\n\ne.g. getting into a school like stanford, harvard, or yale is really only a big deal because you'll make great connections with excellent professors/researchers in your field, or because it looks great on your resume (for certain, specific jobs. a lot of career fields nowadays don't give two hoots about where you go, so yeah)\n\nthat's why i'm applying to stanford and yale. i will make great connections in those two places, and they'll look great on a resume. for the sports business industry specifically, one way to get into the career fields i'm interested in is by having a law degree, and going to stanford/yale gives you a really good opportunity to go to law school. especially because who knows, maybe i'll just decide to go into generic law or something!\n\ni applied to northwestern because my real dream is to get into sports media, but it's nearly impossible to make good money in that field without having ridiculous drive and passion and working your butt off for 20 years. that is, unless you make great connections. northwestern is probably **the** top school in the country for aspiring sports media members (even though it doesn't have a specific sports journalism degree) because of the **connections** you'll make while you're there. many of the most premier sports media members today (especially in the NBA circle) are northwestern alums, so i'll hopefully be able to make great connections that way. and if not, it's also a great marketing school, so that's a great backup plan.\n\nsorry for the hecka long response, but hope this answered some of your questions! i'd be happy to answer more if you're interested!",

I'm trying to find more schools that are great for film business thank you in advance!",

                  "text": "it's not super prominently advertised, especially since they don't have a proper sports journalism/sports communication major and so if you google \"top colleges for sports media\" it won't come up often. i mostly found out through lots of research + noticed it from lots of people in the biz.\n\nI'd say if you're supper passionate about getting in to film business, do more in depth research than just googling or using [niche.com](https://niche.com) or us news! it can be helpful. you got a while tho, so just focus on keeping your grades up and consider doing things related to your major to see if you'd like it!\n\nmaybe even try reaching out to someone you admire who has the job you'd like! can't hurt!\n\noff the top of my head USC and NYU are two schools you'll probably wanna look at for getting into the film industry. as i mentioned i'm applying to USC for business in the cinematic school, and USC has the top film school in the country so that's definitely perfect for you wanna do. plus it's in the entertainment capital of the world, so connections abound!",
