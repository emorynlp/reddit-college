  "text": "I have pretty good stats, a 1500, ~3.9, extra curriculars out the wazoo, and I\u2019ve been told I have good essay writing skills\u2026 but I just don\u2019t know if I want to go to one of those crazy competitive schools. \n\n1. I want to go to medical school and need a good GPA and a lot of money, 2. I have pretty major ADHD and really don\u2019t want to fail (as per wanting to go to medical school), and 3. I just really don\u2019t want to go through this process anymore, today (after realizing I had to rewrite my common app), I had a pretty bad anxiety attack and just felt like I couldn\u2019t make it. The only thing keeping me sane is telling myself that I can just go to my state school (U of O) and get into the honors college, but would that be waisting my chances? All I want is to be over with this process, and be in a school. I don\u2019t want to be heavily impacting the rest of my life because a stupid anxiety attack is making it so I can\u2019t write my essay. \n\nSorry if my writing is jumbled, as it might seem I\u2019m not having the best time right now and am kinda freaking out. Thanks for any responses y\u2019all can give me, I just really need an outside perspective.",
