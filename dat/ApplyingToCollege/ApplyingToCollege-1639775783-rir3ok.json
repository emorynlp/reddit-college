      "text": "Colleges allow you to list information like that to allow applicants to identify what\u2019s important to understand them.  Sexual orientation may sound like a personal question, and in many cultural contexts (and legal contexts given the country) it is a very significant disclosure.  However, you should feel safe identifying as LGBTQ when you apply to a US college or university, and I would encourage you to do so.  It will likely add something to your application rather than detract from it.  Should you be accepted I\u2019d encourage you also to look into the resources for LGBTQ students.  You\u2019ll likely be welcomed to a really safe, supportive campus community for folks like yourself.  Good luck!",
