  "text": "My dream school is a T5, and with the numerous ecs, leadership, research, and awards that I had, I thought I (at least) stood a chance at coca-cola. but nope, rejected from the first round! \n\nit's just making me so sad and imposter syndrome is hitting in big time, I feel like I'm going to be rejected from everywhere :((",

It would be dumb to think they review 68,000 applications in 1 week given that professional college admission offices cant even review 50 k in 2 months... the application is also incredibly simple and they probably keep it that way so it can be easily given a grade on multiple factors to decide semifinalists. You probably had some other strongsuits in your app that brought ur score up to what it needed to be. Regardless, point is that AO's dont care nearly as much about volunteer hrs as coke scholars does and many coke scholars finalists dont even get into the T5's op was talking about so op shouldnt have anything to worry abt.",

People on this sub have been saying they're using an algorithm that just considers stats and volunteer hours.\n\nPlus, it's impossible for every student accepted to a T5 to be a Coca-Cola semifinalist, considering that there are only 2000 semifinalists, so I don't think this says anything about your chances at your dream school. Schools also actually read the application instead of computerizing the process, and consider other important components like essays. Don't stress about this.",

It's not fair, and it doesn't seem like it's intended to be.\n\n>I literally don't know where I went wrong.\n\nI have no idea either. One of my friends got semifinalist, and while she's a great student and volunteer and deserves it, if we're being honest, she's not nearly as impressive as some of the kids on here who didn't get it.\n\n>I had 500+ hrs, perfect gpa, just no work experience bc I do research outside of school + take dual enrollment\n\nBased on this, you still have a shot at any T5 if the rest of your application is good too. I don't think the rejection from Coca-Cola reflects on you in any way as a college applicant. Don't worry about it.",
