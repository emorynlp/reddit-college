  "title:": "Finished my MIT Interview (My Takeaways)",
  "text": "First of all, it was SO much fun. I really enjoyed talking with my interviewer, and it was almost like I was having a conversation with my friend. She was really passionate about what she majored in at MIT and it was great to hear everything from her perspective. I love this school even more now...\n\nI compiled questions from other MIT interview posts I found. All the questions she asked were in the list, and she also asked other questions to build off of what you talk about. At the end of the interview, she asked me what I wished she had asked me about. In general, just be prepared to talk about what YOU like and what YOU love.\n\n**Potential Questions**\n\n* Who is the most influential person in your life\n* If you have infinite resources what would you do with them?\n* Tell me about an experience you had with a team\n* What would you change about your high school\n* What is your favorite subject\n* What are you looking most forward to in college?\n* What are you scared of in college?\n* If you could take any class in HS, what would it be?\n* Talk about a time you failed at something and how you got yourself out of it.\n* What do you do in your free time, outside of extracurriculars?\n* What's the most difficult thing you've done, either in terms of academics or extracurriculars?\n* What's the first thought that goes through your head when you wake up in the morning, and the last thought you have before you go to sleep at night?\n* What was your favorite book and why?\n* What's a weird thing that you do?\n* What's your most notable achievement so far?\n\nMy interviewer said that these questions are just conversation-starters, so we were free to let the conversation branch off to a lot of different topics. She stated that MIT was looking for interviews to see your personality and learn more about you that the application didn't cover.\n\nGood luck to everyone, you'll do amazing! \ud83c\udf40",
