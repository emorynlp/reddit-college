Or would it be against me?\n\nPS: I'm an international student and Ididn't apply for aid.",

And even then, there\u2019s no guarantee all colleges have the same policy on that. At the least, OP withdrawing from the ED contract without the consent of the college can screw over future applicants from OP\u2019s high school to that college, if not OP themselves. If an applicant strategizes ED and is disappointed when they get in, that\u2019s an issue that they\u2019re responsible for.",
