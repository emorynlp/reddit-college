  "text": "I also applied to BU, BC, Cornell, Northeastern, Rutgers (admitted), FIT and The New School. I really need a miracle, i was so expecting to get into nyu. If by some fluke I get into Cornell ill be happy, but the other schools in NYC i applied to are all for arts and im not sure if thats what i want to do yet.",

      "text": "You don't need a miracle, college admissions are not transitive. Schools make independent and imperfect decisions. If you got into Rutgers, you will have at least a shot at the schools mentioned.\n\nNot to mention that NYU's arts programs are highly competitive, likely more so than many other schools you listed.",
