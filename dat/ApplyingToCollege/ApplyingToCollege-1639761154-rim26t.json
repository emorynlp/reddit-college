  "text": "I also applied to BU, BC, Cornell, Northeastern, Rutgers (admitted), FIT and The New School. I really need a miracle, i was so expecting to get into nyu. If by some fluke I get into Cornell ill be happy, but the other schools in NYC i applied to are all for arts and im not sure if thats what i want to do yet.",

If you got into Rutgers, you will have at least a shot at the schools mentioned.\n\nNot to mention that NYU's arts programs are highly competitive, likely more so than many other schools you listed.",

              "text": "A shot is a shot, not a guarantee. The point is that you apply to many schools you like so that you get into at least a few you'd be happy to attend. You can't assume chances at schools from the decision of one. I wouldn't recommend latching onto Cornell as they have an incredibly low acceptance rate and high standards. I'm only saying you will likely get into a few of these. Cornell is probably the least likely of those listed, but no one can really say besides the admissions office.",
