  "title:": "How are foreign universities viewed in the United States?",
  "text": "I would assume that most 1st world country universities are viewed the same as domestic American colleges, but is that true? How about in other countries? For example, here in the Philippines, the top uni in the country is University of the Philippines - Diliman, which has an acceptance rate of only 15%. But in the states im sure practically no employers know of this uni unless they were from the Philippines or lived here for a significant amount of time. If a foreign university isn't from a 1st world country or in the top 100 in the world outside of the states, does the United States even care about your uni? \n\nI'm not asking this to see where I should apply outside of the states, in fact im only applying in the states, im just curious.",
