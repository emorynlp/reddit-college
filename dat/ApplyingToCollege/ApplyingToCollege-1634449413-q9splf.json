      "text": "\"Everyone must choose one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret\"  \nThis is a quote that always motivates me because there have been too many opportunities I missed or didn't make the most out of because I didn't put in maximum effort, whether it's sports or school. Just knowing that I didn't try my best makes me want to beat myself up whenever I think about it (not college apps, but other things).\n\nJust imagine what you will feel like when you finally get the acceptances you want, and know that your best work will come through consistent effort and work, not last minute, frantic BS'ing.",
