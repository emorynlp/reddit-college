  "text": "Hello A2C, I submitted my Stanford REA application yesterday, but I was just reviewing my Coalition App Profile and realized I minorly fucked up. I'm taking a combination of Cambridge A-Level classes and AP classes, and I apparently self-reported my second semester A-Level math as an AP.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I know this is a minor mistake and they'll probably see that my first semester math was A-Level and realize it was a mistake (and they'll also have my transcript), but as a stressed out applicant, I need reassurance: am I fucking screwed? If I change this mistake rn, it won't show up for them right? What do I do help",
