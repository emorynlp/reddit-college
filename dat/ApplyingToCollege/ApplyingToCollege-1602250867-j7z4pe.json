A 1480 can get you into so many colleges. Don't forget that sats aren't everything either. If the rest of your application is bangin, then colleges will for sure take you over someone with a 1600 and nothing else. I have a friend that got a higher sat than me, but i consistently outperformed him on college apps because he didn't have many extracurriculars at all. He couldn't even fill up all the spots. Trust me, everything will be alright in the end. Just be sure you are choosing colleges based off whether you'll enjoy your time there rather than basing it off prestige or rankings",

      "text": "I don't want to rain on anyone's parade, but please be careful deciding where to go to college based on where your high school SO goes.  Most high school relationships don't last in college.  This is four years of your life, six figures of someone's money, and one of the most formative experiences you'll have.  Don't let your vision be clouded by a high school crush.  \n\n[This article indicates just 5% of high school relationships last beyond freshman year of college.](https://www.albionpleiad.com/2013/02/break-up-valentines-piece/#:~:text=In%20total%2C%20I%20found%20only,as%20the%20%E2%80%9Cturkey%20dump.%E2%80%9D)\n\nIn general, if you are engaged or married, then it makes sense to make major life decisions together.  But if you're not, then make sure you will be happy with the decisions whether your relationship ends in marriage or not.  Obviously Harvard is a pretty decent school, so your GF going there is only a small part of what might make it alluring.\n\n[Just 2% of existing marriages are from a high school relationship.](https://mensdivorce.com/high-school-sweethearts/)\n\nThis means that you are FAR more likely to break up during your freshman year than you are to get married and spend the rest of your lives together.  Make your decisions accordingly.",

Princeton was my top choice, but they closed down EA for this year. I dont want to ED, so Amherst is crossed off. I\u2019m left with MIT Harvard and Yale. I am not even planning on applying to MIT so thats gone too, so the question becomes harvard or yale? after much thought, i finalised my choice to be the former :D",
