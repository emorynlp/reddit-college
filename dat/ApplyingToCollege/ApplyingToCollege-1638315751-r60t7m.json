  "text": "Hii, I've recently been reached out to by college board saying my IDOC is missing a 2020 national tax form. I'm an international student from Canada applying to Harvard and I submitted my canadian notice of assessment (which basically is a tax form) and collegeboard processed it, but they're still saying I'm missing a national tax form? Does anyone know what to do in this case? \n\nAlso would this negatively impact my chances to Harvard if they think my fin aid is incomplete? I feel like it's so strange that I'm only getting reached out to now when I literally submitted my IDOC profile like a month ago. \n\nI hope the reason why is bc harvard wants me and is already planning my financial aid package \ud83e\udd2a lol no.",
