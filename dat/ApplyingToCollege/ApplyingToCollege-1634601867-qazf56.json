You could argue that for an orchestra class that requires video submissions every day, but that\u2019s very rare. Many orchestra classes grade on attendance rather than coursework. Practice isn\u2019t coursework, it\u2019s something students do outside of school to enrich themselves (that\u2019s what an EC is). Districts that give maximum homework times for classes don\u2019t restrict practice times because they\u2019re not homework",
