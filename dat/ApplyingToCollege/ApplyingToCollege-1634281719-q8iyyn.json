  "text": "My UNC common app submission deadline is 12am local time on 15th OCT while the SAT scores are released by 6pm EST which is 3:30 am 16th Oct here. I really want to include the SAT scores in my application. While on the UNC website it says that you can send supplementary information(SAT Scores) by 1st Nov and that applications are only reviewed in Nov, the UNC website also says that UNC will only review self-reported scores even if I send the official scores from CB. \n\nTo put it simply, is there any way for me to self-report my SAT scores on the common app or MyCarolina portal after the Oct 15th deadline for the common app submission?",
