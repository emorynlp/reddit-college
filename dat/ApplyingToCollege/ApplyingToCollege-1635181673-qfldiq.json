I wouldn't choose it over MIT if you had the option and the costs for MIT were manageable, but I would also have it a lot higher than 100 or wherever they are on the national university ranking.\n\nThey definitely have some of the top research faculty in specific areas - the principal investigator for OSIRIS-REx is there for example.",

You might apply to a school like Arizona, or CU Boulder, or UW Seattle, or Penn State as safe/target options.\n\nWhen you pursue grad study eventually? Maybe. At that point you focus more on who your PhD advisor would be rather than the school as a whole, and some of the faculty you could work with at the LPL are among the best in the world.",

This might be because they have way more people than MIT/others, and they might do different projects. ASU might build a CubeSat, but MIT might design an entirely new type of CubeSat.\n\nI am not qualified to give the real answer, but that would be my guess.",
