  "text": "Dear findegil\\_131c,\n\nThat your dream schools rejected you should not come as a surprise. In spite of your mediocre extracurriculars and disgraceful grades, you applied anyway because you feared that your satisfaction with the perfectly decent school you end up attending will be marred by regrets over not having applied to institutions offering even more prestige.\n\nI agree that your worries were not completely unjustified. However, you are feeling miserable that what was an inevitable outcome actually took place; this is understandable, but it doesn\u2019t change how unreasonable it is. Miracles do happen sometimes, but we call them miracles precisely because one cannot rely on them all the time. You are applying as a math major; you should be able to understand this.\n\nTherefore, write thank-you notes \u2013 if you haven\u2019t already \u2013 to the admission offices, which rightfully rejected you to preserve their reputations. Yes, you\u2019ve certainly disappointed the distant relative who said you were a good fit for Caltech when you were 7, and the high-school geography teacher who was confident you could get into MIT even though (or maybe because) you never took geography. But you must not be disappointed in yourself. You have high ambitions, and you will be thriving wherever you go, insofar as this adjective can be applied to such an exceptional procrastinator.\n\nYou still have 10 applications to work on. That\u2019s a lot. It is time to forget how great it would be to tell people you go to Caltech, and start accepting the fact that you really aren\u2019t so special after all.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nYour past self\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: grammar & word choices",
