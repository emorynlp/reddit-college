  "title:": "I overheard my mom crying on the phone today because she wanted me to go to Harvard and I was rejected... even though I'll be starting at Northwestern in a few days",
  "text": "Made a throwaway to tell this story, since I really need a place to vent right now. Orientation at Northwestern starts super late due to the quarter system, so I've just been chilling at home while all my other friends have left for college. While I was watching TV in the living room last night, I thought I heard my mom say my name while she was on the phone in her bedroom. I was curious so I eavesdropped a little, and that's when I heard my mom sobbing \"all I wanted was for (insert my name here) to go to Harvard, but he wasn't good enough.\" I don't know who she was talking to, but I'm assuming it was to a relative or a friend, since my mom is part of the Chinese community in my town that loves to gossip about college and especially about which colleges their kids will be attending. I left at that point and don't really know how I've been feeling since, and I guess that's why I'm venting here. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo basically, my parents are both from China and met while they were both graduate students at Harvard. Ever since I was young, they constantly made it clear to me that Harvard was the only school that they wanted me to attend. Basically everything they made me do was to make me a more competitive applicant and increase my chances of getting into Harvard. They built up this expectation that I'd follow their legacy and didn't even consider that I might not get in. Fast forward to last December, and I found out I was deferred after applying early action. My parents were clearly disappointed, but still held out hope that I'd be accepted in the regular admissions cycle. Then, on decision day, I got my rejection letter and couldn't even look my parents in the eye. After getting all my decisions, I considered my choices and decided to attend Northwestern.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEver since, I could tell that they've been disappointed in me, even though they never said it to my face. It was always small comments like \"oh I heard (insert name here) from your school got into Harvard, what do you think they did that you didn't?\" or \"I think Northwestern's a good school, but it's not in the same league as Harvard.\" Hearing my mom literally cry on the phone because I didn't get into Harvard was the confirmation I needed that they were, in fact, disappointed in me as their son. I'm sorry Mom, that I wasn't good enough to get into Harvard. I really fucking tried, okay? Northwestern's a good school too, I wish you could be happy that I was going there instead. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOkay, rant over, thanks for listening.",

              "text": "This post brought me back to a time in my life when I dropped out of college and I got into a screaming match with my mom 20 years over it.\n\nWe're good now.\n\nParents want the best for you, and obviously you have some cultural issues you're running into right now with your mom. The reason I tell my sliver of a story is because while she may be expressing disappointment right now, that it likely doesnt have a bearing with your future with your mom. You'll want to confront this memory eventually down the line directly with her in the distant future to resolve it fully.\n\nBut remember you arent the stupid college you attend. And you arent a failure for this. Even if you fuck up like I did and drop out, you are still worthy and valid and dont let anyone, INCLUDING YOURSELF, tell you otherwise.",

As another Chinese guy who had to go to therapy for the one and only time in his life due to the stress of college admissions, it makes me happy to see you handling this in a healthy manner.  My parents went to Stanford/Berkeley and I was terrified that I wouldn't get into a school that measured up.  I'm sorry you have to deal with this from your parents.

He's one of the most interesting and well-rounded people I know. Lucky for me, I get to hang out with him a lot.  lol\n\nI think you may want to look at the schools' financial aid pages more closely. Granted, \"middle class\" means a lot of different things to different people, but for all the Ivy League schools and Stanford, if your family has an annual income of $65,000 (I would say is \"lower income\" for a family), your expected contribution is ZERO. If your family makes $150,000 in income (which, to me, is what \"upper middle class\" is) your expected contribution is around **0-10% of your income**.\n\nOur family is very much \"middle class\" (nowhere near $150,000/year).  Our out-of-pocket costs for 4 years at Stanford will be about $20,000 TOTAL. It would be far less without the required (for us) Cardinal Care medical insurance.\n\nAnyway -- it's a complicated thing to figure out, but the Ivy League schools have multi-billion dollar annual endowments that enable them to be very generous with scholarship/grant amounts for just about every family income level.",

Harvard is absolutely NOT necessarily the best school to go to as an undergraduate. It is an excellent school--no doubt (especially at the graduate level). But the USA is fortunate to have HUNDREDS of fantastic colleges, especially at the undergraduate level. In fact, depending on the individual, Harvard may be a terrible place to go. It might not be a good fit at all. It is much more likely that a different school is a better fit, given that there are thousands of other colleges out there, many hundreds of which offer superlative undergraduate educations. Not getting into Harvard in NO WAY means you are not \"good enough\". That's *absurd*. There are dozens of factors (too many to mention here) that go into admissions decisions.\n\nHere's a fact that may blow you away: if they wanted to, Harvard could fill their entire incoming freshman class with only valedictorians from the application pool they receive. In other words, they receive more applications from valedictorians alone than they have spots for. But they don't fill their freshman class with only valedictorians because of the aforementioned admission factors. If you got into Northwestern, you are KICKING ASS! Way to go!

Congrats on finding a college it sounds like you are happy with.\n\nIn this Information Age remember the only limit to your education is how much you choose to learn. The college you attend has less influence over that nowadays and it's sad your parents don't say that. Though that piece of paper you get at the end still matters to employers, once you get your foot in the door of your first job and start impressing them with your skills even that won't matter nearly as much as your accumulating knowledge and experience will. Good luck!",

      "text": "Hey bud,\n\nFuck the system.  If your parents think that people who go/have gone to Harvard are the only people who will ever be happy, successful, or important, then they need a history lesson.  For you, here is a list of very important people who did not go to a prestigious college:\n\n1. Bob Dylan\n2. Albert Einstein\n3. Jimmy Carter\n4. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n5. Malcolm X\n6. Thomas Edison\n7. Benjamin Franklin\n8. Christopher Columbus\n9. Warren Buffett\n10. Jesus\n11. Ernie, my driving school teacher, who yelled at a room full of people for making fun of my disability\n12. Me\n\nI'm sorry to say it, but if your parents were a little smarter, they would know that prestige doesn't count for anything outside of our social constructs that don't actually matter.  They would also know that Northeastern is still a pretty big privilege flex.  They would also know that you can get a great education pretty much anywhere; you get out of it what you put into it.  They owe you a giant apology, and they owe smaller ones to me, my family, and everyone else who didn't/won't go to Harvard.  They owe it to the world to change their outlook on prestige and human capabilities because they way they're acting now is hurting, to some extent, literally everybody who is alive right now.  I'm so sorry this is happening to you.",

      "text": "man that really sucks. tbh some parents try to live vicariously through their kids and put tons of pressure on them to do near impossible things like get into Harvard. it's dumb. why harvard? besides a fancy title and bragging rights, what does Harvard have (besides controversy, elitist legacies, and preppy students) that any other top college like Northwestern doesn't? I'm just so confused about what it is about Harvard that makes it so special, and why they feel like you going there versus any other school is going to better you as a person in any way. All that matters is that you're happy, and I really hope that your parents' opinions don't start to rub off on you and make you regret going to Northwestern.  If it makes you feel any better, my older sister goes to UChicago and my parents are obviously proud, but she has the worst relationship ever with my parents and she and my mom will probably never have a happy mother-daughter relationship ever again. See? Prestigious college education isn't everything! Have fun and kick ass at Northwestern!",

Someone I went to college with, which was a state school is now at Cal tech for her PhD in physics. She was a good student, took advantage of every opportunity including doing research for 3 years during undergrad. I also know people who went to more prestigious schools and are doing half as well.
