  "text": "I had my Princeton interview yesterday and it went really well. The interviewer and I really clicked and he said he\u2019d write me a strong recommendation. That being said, I\u2019m trying to not get my hopes up too much because it\u2019s my understanding that the interview has very little weight, especially at a school like Princeton. Is that true?",

      "text": "I think it depends on the school. I've done very little research and I'm not a part of admissions at any institution so take what I say with a grain of salt, but from what I've read, it seems that a select few do value the interview, while most others care very little. 2 I saw were MIT and Yale. Yale seemed to reference the interview a fair amount in the admissions files of students. MIT claims that the interview carries some weight, although not entirely sure how much that is.",
