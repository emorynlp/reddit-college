  "title:": "Question about self reported testing",
  "text": "I just applied to Amherst college, which is test optional. On their website, they\u2019ve mentioned that test scores can be self-reported, including being reported in the common app testing section. I didn\u2019t submit my sat score through college board so I was reliant on that. However, when I reviewed my application before sending, the testing section mentioned no tests have been reported. I\u2019ve read that self reported scores don\u2019t show up but I\u2019m worried.",
