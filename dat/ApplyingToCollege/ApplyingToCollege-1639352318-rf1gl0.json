  "title:": "any guesses to why harvard accepted fewer students rea last year for the class of 2025 than the year before, and any predictions for 2026 rea results?",
  "text": "For context, Harvard had a surge of applications last year (as did many t10s). Despite this, they admitted fewer students REA than they normally would have in a 'regular year'. I assumed it might have been due to the increase of deferred students from the year prior (2024 had lots of students defer their enrollment to 2025) but the dean of admissions said that it wasn't true. Does anyone have any idea why it might've been like this?\n\nAny predictions for how early admissions might turn out this year?",
