  "text": "Like the hundreds of other students of my school, I got rejected Cornell ED. I was going to be fine with it, but I knew that they hadn't received my first quarter grades. I felt that it could significantly impact my admissions bc I got b's and c's in 9th grade, and all a's after, so I could prove myself even more. I also took my most challenging courses in 12th grade, so all a's could show I have the capacity to excel academically. Ik Cornell technically doesn't have an appeal, but I read that they could do it in extreme circumstances. I decided to just email them anyways to reconsider my application with 12th grade grades. I doubt it'll work, but it's not like I had anything to lose, and it only took 15 mins of my time.",
