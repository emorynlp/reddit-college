  "text": "I'm currently a junior in high school and live in a fairly competitive state where our school counselor to student ratio is 500:1. I've heard from people that they advised getting a private college counselor around junior yr to help create a timeline / checklist / ec related stuff as well as help w essays when that time rolls around. How helpful are private counselors and how much are they 'needed'? \n\nAlso is it worth it to spend like 2-5k on them per year?",

      "text": "i've never interacted with my in-school counselor except for the very basics (i.e. requesting my transcripts and paying for my AP exams) and i feel like i'm handling the application process ok. if you can create a timeline/checklist, write your essays on time, etc., then you don't need to spend money on an external counselor. if you do need that extra motivation *and* a private counselor is decently affordable, go for it.",

      "text": "I agree with what infloresces has said, but if you do proceed to go the private counselor route, I would want you to not let their advice be the end all be all to anything you're doing. As you're looking for counselors, please be aware that there are some that are out to get money and not to really help. I am in a similar situation at my school where there is only 2 counselors for 1.5k students, and they are basically booked up with appointments and stuff and couldn't do much to help a lot of people, and my parent's don't know much about the college application process so we had to find one. As we were searching for counselors, we came across someone who was being quite arrogant. To put it short, they put everything about me down but then advertised their(EXTREMELY EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE) services as a solution to fix all of it. Beware of people like that.",

      "text": "Although it\u2019s ideal to get to know your school counselor, it\u2019s not crucial as long as they\u2019re competent (submits everything on time, keeps students updated, etc). My school counselor was new the year I applied to colleges and everything was fine. \n\nAs for private counselors, I would generally say that they are most impactful if you get one before the start of sophomore year *at the latest*. At that stage, they can (as unfair as it is) significantly built up an applicant\u2019s ECs, awards, and \u201cnarrative.\u201d That usefulness naturally decreases the less time you have until senior year. As for other things like making a timeline, checklist, etc, they\u2019re easily doable by yourself. For essay help, I would suggest going to a teacher who is a credible editor. However, if a private counselor is affordable for you (\u201cworth it\u201d depends on what 2-5K means for your family), you could hire one for essay help the summer before senior year.",
