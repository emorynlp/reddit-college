  "text": "Hey guys, I\u2019m the only senior from my hs (international) applying to colleges in the us. My school counselor and my teachers don\u2019t know shit about common app so they all just gave me their login and told me to do everything by myself \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21 (including recommendations and school transcript \u2014 our school doesn\u2019t even provide transcript). So guess what I\u2019m having to write my own recommendations and make my own transcript\ud83e\udd21\ud83d\ude03. I\u2019m already struggling with my own essays \ud83d\ude29.\n\nAlso would this be illegal?\u2026",

With the transcript take it to the highest level administrator you can and have them sign it.\n\nBy applying to American schools, you are evidently putting them in a situation they are not comfortable with--so, make their lives easy and do this for them. You want to do something different than everyone who has ever been at your school? Ok, you'll have to do a bit more then.\n\nPS For the American students thinking this is so terrible, imagine you want to apply to the University of Cambodia and all of the recommendations have to be submitted in Khmer, the transcript has to be translated in Khmer--and the GPA adjusted to a different system. Your teachers might not know how to proceed either.",

Just because someone speaks English doesn't mean they can translate. 2. You are now asking more teachers to do more work for you when the teachers already gave you a solution: write the recommendations yourself.",
