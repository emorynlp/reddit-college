  "text": "......i have 974 words. i asked multiple people to read it and let me know if it seemed too long-winded or boring, and they all said that it didn't. but generally the MAX ive seen ppl say theyve written is 800. (looked online a lot and most people say that they wrote 700-800 lol.) and a while back, uchicago used to say something to the effect of, \"our rec is like 250-500 words... u can go longer if u want, but dont make it Too ... boring like remember that we r human @ the end of the day\" \n\nso........... is what i have too long?!?!?!",
