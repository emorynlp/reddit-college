      "text": "Most state flagships will have a dependable psychology undergrad. Narrowing it down might depend what you plan to do with the psych degree after your BA or BSc. \n\nFor example, if you're interested in youth counseling, child development, or school psychology, look for a school that also has a good M.Ed program (even if you aren't interested in teaching.) For organizational or industrial psych, look for a school that had great business programs. Etc\n\nUW-Seattle, and I think UC Berkeley,  UCSD and UMich all have programs where psych undergrads can work as test dummies or even research assistants for grad students. In Canada: McGill and UWaterloo have extensive undergrad psych programs like that. That might be something you might want to look for when digging through a college's psych department page - how hands-on are the undergrads.\n\nDon't pay attention to rankings for Psych, as those are mainly grad school rankings. You can cross that bridge when you get there!",
