  "title:": "Is it possible to ask for more merit aid?",
  "text": "Asking because I received the lowest OOS merit aid (28,000 over 4 years) from Iowa State. I'm grateful to have gotten this award, but is it possible to ask for more? My gpa is well above the minimum for the highest award, the only thing I lack is SAT. I'm an American citizen living abroad, and in my country, SAT dates keep getting cancelled, so I can't take it even if I wanted to. I want to at least boost my award to the second highest (36,000 over 4 years). I coming from an EFC of 0, so any type of aid I can get would be great.\n\nJust want to say this because everyone always assumes im international when I ask questions and say I live abroad:\n\nIm a **US CITIZEN** living abroad, not an international student, and the school I go to is an American school with AP classes.",
