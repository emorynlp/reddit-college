  "text": "A bit of an odd question but I\u2019m genuinely at a loss here. Would mentioning I\u2019m trans have negative effects for my aps? Before I started to get help (aka mid fresgman and sophomore) my grades were terrible due to my depression and i feel it\u2019s necessary to explain the sudden jump in GPA to hopefully help my chances. However I fear that mentioning it might affect my chances. Is this true?",
