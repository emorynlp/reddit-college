  "title:": "Feeling great about my essays tbh",
  "text": "I just finished my UC app yesterday amidst the whole outage thing, and I was really stressed, but on a positive note: I loved the essays I wrote for the app! Maybe it's cause I wrote a bunch of essays before, but I feel like I had the perfect response for each prompt, and after reading them, they all feel very personal and special to me. If I had to think of a single positive that came out of the horrible college application process: it's that I think I truly improved my writing skills. Just wanted to share yea idk",
