What are the requirements? Do you know many other people who are doing it? What would being a member actually involve doing? Why would a college care about you doing it?\n\nWhy I think it\u2019s a waste: First, there are a bajillion people are in it. At my school, nearly half of each senior grade is in it, because the requirements are so easy. And it\u2019s not like as a member you do anything noteworthy. Most people don\u2019t do many hours, and volunteering hundreds of hours isn\u2019t even special in of itself unless you\u2019re doing something not just anyone can do, that takes actual ability/experience.",
