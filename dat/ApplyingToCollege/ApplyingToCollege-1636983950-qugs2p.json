      "text": "I am of the belief that the college has everything it needs to make its decisions. Every applicant to a selective college will have accomplishments which occur after submission. AOs know that, but they don\u2019t want to be inundated with minor updates from thousands of applicants.\n\nSo does that mean that one should not submit updates? No. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. But one needs to be judicious. If it\u2019s something that made the nationally-read papers (and not just the local free weekly) like an Academy Award nomination (or similar prestigious achievement), include on the update. If it\u2019s to tell them that you were elected softball captain, had another 4.0 quarter, or your website traffic doubled, don\u2019t.\n\nThat said, any course changes should be communicated via the method the college requests.",
