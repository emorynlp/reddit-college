  "text": "my parents want me to submit earlier because they don't want to take the risk of the portal crashing or something. I don't know I just constantly feel like the more time to reflect on my essays, the better. so would it be safe to wait until few days before the deadline?",

      "text": "Any application that is submitted by the deadline is considered equally.  There is no \"early\" bonus.\n\nBut filing a bit earlier will avoid any last minute issues (see my posts Nov. 2 and the day after UC apps were due), so is generally a good idea.\n\nA few days is plenty.  If you're not done/satisfied, don't rush to send them now.  But 12/31 or 12/30 is better than 1/1 11:58p (or whatever the due date).",
