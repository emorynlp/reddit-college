  "text": "Hii!\n\nI'm looking to shorten my uni list to 13 colleges for **RD**.\n\nDemographics: Female, Asian, Highly overrepresented country\n\nApplying as: Low-Income International (**EFC: 8k**) who is from a single-parent household.\n\nIntended Majors: Econ + Business if available. Econ is first choice.\n\nSAT: Test-optional due to overcrowded test centres and test centre issues when I finally managed to give it\n\nGrades: 6A\\* and 2As IGCSE. All 3 As in AS-Level (A is maximum). Predicted grades should be at least A\\*, A\\*, A, A  (A\\* in major subjects)\n\nAwards/Honors: top in class and highest ranker related achievements. Might be getting a top in country award for business in this month but unsure.\n\nECs: Substantial leadership, community service and major-oriented activities.\n\nEssays: Common app is pretty great and very personal, supplementals should be the same.\n\nLORs: Tried to give the best information to my teachers but they tend to write template styled generic LORs but hoping for the best. All the teachers really like me and consider me as the top student.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI prefer schools with a tight-knit community that don't have a lot of greek life. Open curriculum/minimal requirements are preferred since I don't want to explore a lot of liberal art courses or humanities focused requirements (ex: literature, history, art). **Of course, main criteria is financial aid and the Econ program.** No strong weather or location preferences.\n\nCurrent universities I'm looking at: Dartmouth, Brown, Bowdoin, Tufts, Swarthmore, Williams, Amherst, Harvard, Pomona, Haverford, Hamilton, Bates, Reed, Grinnel, Bennington, Lafayette, Lehigh, Colgate, Vanderbilt and Middlebury.\n\nNeed to cut down my list to 13 unless they have their own application aside from common app. Please suggest any universities you think I'd like as well.\n\nThank you so much for all the help!! Hope you have a good day :)",
