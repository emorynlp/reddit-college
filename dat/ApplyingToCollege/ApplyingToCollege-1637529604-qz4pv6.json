A 3.0 + 1600 SAT could be even worse than a 3.0 and a 1400 SAT, because it (if there's no underlying reason) would tell AOs that you're smart as fuck but couldn't care less about school.",

A low GPA to some is a 3.0, 3.5, or even a 3.9.   \n\n\nA 3.7 with an upward trend is better than a constant 3.7 though, so in general I would say:  \n*Upward 3.5 & 1550 SAT > Constant 3.9 & 1100 SAT*  \n\n\nStill, check the colleges' CDS and remember that most schools are test optional now.",

Gpa on the other hand is a culmination of essays, projects, test, etc, everything.",
