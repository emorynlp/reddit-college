  "text": "So in my country we have some entrance to high school national exams, which I did very badly on when I was in grade 9. Now the score report for these exams is attached with my grade 9 school grades, but these national exams do not affect my GPA. My counselor was saying he'd upload them on the common app, but I am not sure if he has to(he isn't either). \n\nIs it required to upload these entrance to high school exam scores, despite them not affecting my GPA?\n\n We have very good relations, so I am sure he wouldn't upload them if they're not required and I would kindly ask him not to do so.",
