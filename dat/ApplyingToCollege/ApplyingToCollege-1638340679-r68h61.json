      "text": "i did 14, 10 ECs + 4 honors. i didn't bother with basic stuff like honor roll because i thought it'd detract from my other activities/awards and it'd be redundant considering they can see my grades. it's better to highlight the things you're really passionate about than to bulk up on filler ECs, which could possibly weaken your overall impact. think about your app as a story and prioritize the ECs that will paint the most cohesive picture of yourself.\n\nalso be mindful that the UC app is insanely long and if you fill up all 20 slots, your reader will be more inclined to skim and focus less time on the stronger components.",
