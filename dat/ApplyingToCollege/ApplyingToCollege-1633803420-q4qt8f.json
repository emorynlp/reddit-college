He explained to me that a lot of mechanical engineers (with no internships or any specific training) have a broad skill set sometimes too broad, he said that aerospace engineers are better suited for those job positions related to space/aviation fields. Of course this depends on what university and what experience that job has with hiring people from that said university. \n\nThat\u2019s just what I heard. Ironically I spoke to an engineer today and he said for aero the biggest thing is internships. So I imagine both mech and aero probably compete for the same jobs and other factors then matter more",

An aerospace degree will definitely expose you to some things a mechanical degree won't -- GNC, avionics, orbital dynamics, etc. aren't part of a typical mechanical engineering degree.  \n\nHow much that matters is what gets debated -- it's incredibly common for the big aerospace companies to pay for your master's degree if you get hired that you can generally fill whatever knowledge gaps you have at that level.  That's why those co-op/internship opportunities to get your foot in the door are so important.",

Not trying to shit on any majors, but there's a lot of kids who go into CS/MechEng/Engineering even if that's not really their strong suit, just because these majors are really popular. As a result, these departments kinda have a relatively \"easier\" curriculum which more people can grasp, (still extremely challenging) so many students get through without really being that great at math. \n\nPhysics is not like that. There isn't overt interest in physics like there is in engineering and the only people who go into it are those who are really dedicated to it, which means that the curriculum is generally extremely challenging, at most top schools. It's obviously better if you have AP Physics C or Physics Olympiad experience, but at the minimum, make sure you're really comfortable with math if you're thinking about going into physics. I'm not just talking you got a 5 on AP BC Calc or whatever, make sure you are really comfortable and able to intuitively come to solutions. Only you can discern if this describes you but you gotta be really honest with yourself regarding who you think you are.",

Or even just a simple History degree a lot of employers just want a degree and STEM companies increasingly want a Humanities perspective as well. Also just a thought but if you went to a Community College it\u2019s almost like a 50% off sticker for college so it\u2019s a lot easier to major in what you want job prospects be damned if you have way less debt upon graduating.",

That\u2019s not the way to get across to someone. Also, you make a lot of assumptions. You said \u201claw school is only worth it if you go to the top ten schools (probably top five)\u201d. What do you think everyone who graduated in law from all the other schools are doing? That\u2019s the lamest advice I\u2019ve ever heard because it\u2019s FALSE. My dad majored in political science for his bachelor\u2019s and went to law school in an average college and he did exceptionally well for himself. All his lawyer buddies he knows and interacts with has graduated from average law schools and has done just as well as him. Trust me, people who don\u2019t go to a top ten law school aren\u2019t just failing at life. They\u2019re doing just as well as anybody else. Also, the world would be boring as hell if everyone took medicine, computer science, economics, business, and statistics. I know people who took all kinds of majors and are doing fine. A friend of my mom\u2019s majored in history and got a phd in gender studies . She\u2019s a social researcher. No, she doesn\u2019t make 200K/year but she\u2019s happy with her life. My sister majored in anthropology and has landed a job at a non-profit where she makes wonderful money. Taking the humanities isn\u2019t an instant failure. YIKES!",

Basically a major for those who are jack of all trades in technology, art, and math. \n\nCon: Hella long hours. All nighters (if you manage your time well, its avoidable). My social life kinda doesnt exist and I've only made friends from architecture. Very fast paced, full of critiques every other day from your professor about your work. Also job wages are pretty low which sucks compared to how much work you put in during college. Lots of firms underpay and overwork. Definitely not a major for those who want to get rich.\n\nStill chose the major though as I really love architecture.",
