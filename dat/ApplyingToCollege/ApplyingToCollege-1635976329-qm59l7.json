  "text": "So, in high school, I was not involved whatsoever except for one business club. I think I did pretty well and tried to do the best I could in it. I ended up winning 3rd place in a state competition and was scheduled to compete in a national competition but it got canceled due to the pandemic.\n\nAnyways, I decided to attend community college for my first 2 years to save money and to kind of restart my school career in a way. I\u2019m now in leadership positions in 3 clubs and I\u2019ll be transferring to another school next fall.\n\nI have a few people that I\u2019m already planning on asking for letters but I was wondering if anyone has asked a previous high school teacher for a letter of rec. while in the process of transferring from community college. I was planning on asking the business club advisor from the club I mentioned earlier and I just want to make sure if this is even acceptable or if anyone has done it before. \n\nI figured since it\u2019s only been about 2 years since I competed (Feb. 2020) and since I did fairly well enough in my specific field in the club to where I was recognized by my school that the advisor would remember me.",
