  "text": "I am a international student planning to major in biology and maybe follow a pre-vet track. I got in to some universities and got money on some of them. I don't know if I should prioritize the financial aspect, rankings or location (my sister lives in NJ and will be in NYC next year and my brother just got a job in michigan, It would be nice to be close to one of them). \n\nThis are the schools got in:\n\n\\- Oregon State (some scholarship)\n\n\\- University of Colorado Denver (some scholarship)\n\n\\- University of Cincinnati (cheapest for me)\n\n\\- Washington State\n\n\\- University of Iowa\n\n\\- University of Utah\n\n\\- Binghamton University\n\n\\- SUNY at Buffalo\n\n\\- Stony Brook University (very close to my sister)\n\nI am also waiting for Colorado State University and Rutgers. (I applied to a lot because I didn't know how hard it would be as an international transfer student planning to start on the spring semester)\n\nI am kind of lost so I would appreciate if some one had something to say",

      "text": "In terms of getting into vet school, I'm not sure it matters very much.  I would prioritize cost, distance from your family, and other subjective factors.  If any of them have some sort of combined BS/\"Whatever-Degree-Vets-Get\" program, then that might be a strong point in its favor.",

      "text": "Those are solid schools - I think it's fine to prioritize being near family or costs if you want to.  I certainly wouldn't worry about overall rankings, but there may be a benefit to specific schools.\n\nColorado State for example has an excellent vet school, so if you want to go on a pre-vet track they may have a better program even if they aren't highly ranked overall.  \n\nCU Denver is more of a commuter school so might not offer the environment you want.\n\nIowa is a fine school, but pre-vet students usually pick Iowa State - it's where the vet school is along with major federal research labs.\n\nIf it's not too late, I would consider applying to Michigan State too - comparable selectivity to the schools you got into, possibly close to your brother, and has a vet school.",
