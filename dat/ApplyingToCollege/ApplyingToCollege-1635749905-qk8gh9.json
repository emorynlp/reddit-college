  "text": "I have a question about waiving the FERPA rights for letters of recommendation, and I can't find anything like that on the ApplyTexas application. I know that there is a section on the Common App. I am wondering that you will be able to check it once you get access to the applicant systems designated to the college after submitting the ApplyTexas application.",
