  "text": "I have been trying to decide what college to ED to between Brown and WashU. I am planning on being pre-vet, but also hove been dancing (specifically ballet) for many years and would like to be able to continue that, if possible. \n\nPros for Brown\n-open curriculum means I can choose classes that interest me\n-less of an emphasis on grades allows for more emphasis on just learning (optional pass/fail, fails don\u2019t show on transcript, etc.)\n-smaller average class size\n- Ivy League/more name recognition (this doesn\u2019t really matter that much but I just thought I should note it)\n-good distance from home\n-it seems as if student happiness/morale is extremely high there but that\u2019s mainly from anecdotal evidence\n\nCons for brown\n-dance program isn\u2019t particularly strong (but there are options to take classes in providence and new performance building is being constructed)\n- providence isn\u2019t a particularly large city (but access to Boston and New York)\n-haven\u2019t heard much about the pre-vet advising there\n-food/dorms aren\u2019t anything to write home about\n- harder to get into (there is a chance I will \u201cwaste\u201d my ED)\n\nPros for WashU \n-extremely strong science program\n-dorms/campus consistently ranked high\n-have a good dance program\n-have good opportunities to work with vet schools/zoos\n-St. Louis is a larger city\n-larger campus/more facilities\n\nCons for WashU \n- Missouri is more conservative than I would like (also more likely for COVID resurgences)\n- seems more homogeneous/generic (both in campus and student body)\n- distance from home means either a plane ride or 15 hr drive\n- larger classes\n- I have heard that the bio program can be extremely difficult/rigorous and can lead to a more competitive atmosphere \n- more of a Greek-life presence than I would like",

      "text": "I can only speak for WashU but:\n\n- Missouri is unfortunately conservative, but St Louis is one of the most liberal cities in the US. Surprisingly, WashU has been doing amazing with covid, I believe we have under 10 active cases right now\n\n-  I can't see how the campus or student body is generic. It's a very very diverse place\n\n- Only Intro classes are large, they get smaller with time.\n\n- Bio is definitely rigorous at WashU, but since grades aren't based on curves, you aren't competing with each other. I've found some people to be really helpful in tough classes like Gen Chem. Plus, Vet schools know the rigor of WashU and will accept \"more modest GPAs\" from WashU graduates.\n\n- Greek life is definitely present, but it's pretty isolated from the rest of campus. As long as you aren't putting effort into looking for it (and you're not a business major) you shouldn't even notice them",

The point system sucks because the Silver Plan only gives you like 1300 calories a day IF you budget correctly.\n\n- There's a LOT more partying and drugs than I expected from WashU. If your suite-mates take part.... well good luck\n\nHonestly those are my only complaints thus far, it's a great place and it's really hard to be unhappy here",

The city is about as safe as any other major city during the daytime, and of course you should probably avoid downtown after dark unless theres a Cardinals game that night. (Keep in mind, this is pretty much every other city as well.)\n\nI've gone on walks around campus alone well after dark, even at 1-5am, and felt perfectly safe. Safer than the Northern Virginia suburb I came from even. I can assure you that you'll never feel unsafe at WashU as long as you don't do anything dumb",
