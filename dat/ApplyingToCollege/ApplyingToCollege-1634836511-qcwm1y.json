  "text": "My current reach school for aerospace engineering is MIT. With my fallback being a local college where I would have to switch to mechanical engineering. What would be a good target school either than Purdue, Illinois, Washington, Virginia Polytechnic, or Ohio State? (Those are already on my list.) My preference would be one with a transfer credit option because of AP classes and my plan to do prerequisites at a local Community College.  Right now, my GPA is 4.0 both weighted and unweighted, but I expect the weighted score to be higher by the time it updates.",

              "text": "Some private universities offer generous need-based financial aid; privates do not differentiate between in-state and out-of-state.\n\nSome public universities offer large merit scholarships to out-of-state students.\n\nFirst see whether you are eligible for any *need-based* financial aid. Run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a *need-based* estimate before you apply. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.) Federal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow. Larger loans require a parent signature and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow.\n\nIf the *need-based* estimate does not make the college affordable for your family, then look for *merit scholarships*. ***Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves.*** Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college.\n\nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: [https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/](https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/); see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family.",
