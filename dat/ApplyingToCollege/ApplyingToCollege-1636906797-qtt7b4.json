  "text": "I do not understand why Cornell is popular \n\nIt seems that people just want that Ivy Stamp and don't actually care about the school. \n\nThere are many better schools in the top 20 that are not ivies. \n\nThoughts?",

It\u2019s bigger, which has pros and cons, and it also has majors not found at many top schools (hotel, ag, etc.). They also are better at certain majors (like engineering). I\u2019m not a Cornell fan, but I understand why plenty of people are.",

      "text": "It's really good for STEM (best engineering program in the Ivy League), combined with the fact that it has slightly misleading admissions data. People see that it's T5 for undergraduate CS, and also has a relatively high admissions rate, and don't realize that the admissions rates are incredibly different for each college within Cornell. The College of Engineering has about a 5% admissions rate but most people just look at the overall admissions rate for every college within the university, which is much higher.",
