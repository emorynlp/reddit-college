It *may* not matter. \n\nThe problem for everyone applying everywhere is figuring out how to stand out if all other facets are equal. There\u2019s a danger I see too often that students assume if they have more things checked off, they\u2019re in. But the subjective part is the unknown which is why every chance to stand out beyond the straight answers is important.\n\nGood luck!",
