  "text": "Im trying to fill out my college app right now and it has me thinking just how much do admissions officers value summer programs. I did a summer program the summer before my senior year at the Young Women's Institute at IU. It was free & selective and I competed in their case competition, but I just dont know what the real weight on summer programs are. I heard some people say they are absolutely useless unless from some prestigious universtiy. If so, I am considering switching the program out and describing art instead...but idk",
