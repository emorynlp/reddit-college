I'm serious when I ask this....why are they accepting me when I fall below the admission requirements? Now I am wondering if I should apply to a few more that are out of reach (I did apply to Tufts, just to make my legacy grandparents happy). Editing to add: I've hit all of the A-G requirements.",

Unless u cured cancer, or have a legit reason why ur gpa is so low, then you\u2019re going to get rejected. A 1310 sat still isn\u2019t even in the range for these schools. You would have to go test optional, and ur gpa wouldn\u2019t help u at all. I applied ED to tufts with a 33 ACT and a 3.97 and I still don\u2019t have a great chance\u2026if u don\u2019t have the money or you\u2019re not good at taking rejections well, i would not apply. But, congrats on all of the other schools!! Arizona is a great state and it\u2019s beautiful! Good luck :)",
