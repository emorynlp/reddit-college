  "title:": "Struggling as an international student",
  "text": "Hi guys, I applied to a lot of universities and got accepted into a good amount of them. they all have one thing in common. they are expensive, but that is not a surprise since I am an international student. I've always wanted to study somewhere close to a big city since growing up it was very difficult for me to find friends with similar interests. I am also very interested in premed. for most of the colleges I applied to, I applied to programs such as chemistry and biochemistry in addition to biomedical engineering. I got accepted into the following schools: American University, University of San Francisco, Chapman University and Fordham university. in addition to less convenient schools like NJIT and Pace University. To be honest I've always had new York in heart but I cannot seem to find a good college with a spring start semester. Fordham seemed like a good option until I realized that some prerequisite medical school courses aren't offered in their chemistry program that I applied to which made me very upset because I very much wanted to live in NYC. I now find myself conflicted since I thought that if I'm going to pay that much I might as well be in a city that is a direct flight from my country,. its November and I still haven't picked a school and I'm afraid ill get too overwhelmed and end up not going this year even after deciding to not go this fall which is frankly very upsetting to both me and my family. I would love to hear what you guys think and what your suggestions are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance.",

              "text": "Note that at American universities, you can major in almost anything, and as long as you satisfy the premedical course requirements, and any required shadowing, etc, you can apply to medical school. At most universities, only 1/3 or so of your courses are in your \u2018home\u2019 department. The rest could be general education requirements, premedical requirements,  courses required as foundation for courses in your department, etc.",

It just means that the courses are more likely to also be offered in the summer, etc. Contact the dean in the link I posted- they are in charge of advising undergraduate pre-health students and getting the proper courses. There is a list of courses which satisfy premed requirements at the link.",
