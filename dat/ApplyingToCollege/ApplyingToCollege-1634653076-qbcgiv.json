  "text": "Having been virtual for about two grades, the only teachers I felt truly knew me were my 9th grade teachers. Theyre also teachers that sponsor my ECs and that I am very close with on a personal level. However, I read on Duke\u2019s site that they strongly prefer 11 or 12 grade teachers. Am I doomed?",

      "text": "It's a tough balance since we recognize a lot of students haven't been able to connect with their teachers during the pandemic. It's good that the teachers are ones who know you well and who you've stayed in contact with, that's really the primary thing we're looking for. That said, I'd recommend either adding a more recent teacher or including a line in your 'Additional Information' section that says something like 'Both of my teacher recommendations are from 9th grade because I was unable to get as close with my teachers over the pandemic. I have stayed in close contact with them over the years and am confident they can speak to my academic and personal growth from 9th grade to now.' (or whatever fits your wording).",
