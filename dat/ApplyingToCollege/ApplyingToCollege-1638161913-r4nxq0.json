  "text": "I did awful freshman year because I was going through an extremely tough time in my life/adjusting to high school (3.2), so it made my overall GPA a 3.57. I'm not applying to any Ivy Leagues or anything but I feel like I kinda screwed myself over. Maybe the upwards curve would help a little? I've gotten ~3.7s every other year including this first semester. I haven't been able to sleep at night since I've been so stressed :')\n\n(Sorry if this is the wrong flair)",
