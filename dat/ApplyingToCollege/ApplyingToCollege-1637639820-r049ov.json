  "text": "Yo, so I was going through my UC application and saw that I had two mistakes. Not sure if they're serious so came here to ask your guys' advice/thoughts.   \nOne - I listed some college courses on the high school courses as well. For example, I took the Game Design Principles(GAM22) college course and I did list it in the college courses section but I also listed the course 'Game Design Principles' for high school courses section.   \nTwo - On my second college course I listed that I got an A in the winter term(even though winter term isn't finished) and IP(in progress) for the fall term(even though it already finished). Stupid I know. BTW I also listed this one in the high school courses.  \nShould I email the colleges when I get my portal information? Should I just leave it? Will my application get revoked? I would really appreciate it if you guys gave me some advice, thank you.\n\nP.S. - Sorry if this is a weird post or if it is confusing. This is my first time posting since I just made a reddit account not too long ago.",
