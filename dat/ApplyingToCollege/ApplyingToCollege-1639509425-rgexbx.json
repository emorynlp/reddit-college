  "title:": "Uh help regarding what do? CC vs 4 year engineering?",
  "text": "So, I just had my first semester finals of senior year and got Fs in AP Calc and Physics. Basically, my chances of going to a 4 year were average and now they are dead. I have plenty of actual job experiences such as house framing and internships with GCs and architects but meh academics. I was already mediocre for most schools and this isn't making me feel any better.\n\nTo add on, I wouldn't say paying for college is hard, but merely not a light discussion with the parents. They insist on a straight 4-year cause \"I'm too smart\" for a CC and that money isn't a problem. My concern is that I would be relegated to a mediocre 4-year school and not getting the most out of it.\n\nI was planning to take calc and physics again with some general ed to save costs and take it more seriously. I figured instead of paying thousands for Calc 1, it would be better as it's not a core class to my major.\n\nI don't mind either but I keep hearing that I would be missing out on key classes and that it's hard to switch as an engineering major.\n\nFinal question is: How do I justify to my Asian parents that a CC plus transfer is equal to a straight shot at a big 4 year?",

      "text": "Just search in LinkedIn and you can show them several real examples of CA community college students going to Berkeley, NYU and UCLA. Tell them about TAG - guaranteed transfer from CC to some UCs like Davis, Santa Barbara. These colleges are in US news top 50 colleges.",
