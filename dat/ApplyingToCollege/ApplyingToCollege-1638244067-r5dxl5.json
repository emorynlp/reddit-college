  "title:": "I'm stumped on how to write my college essay.",
  "text": "I have 2 days to write my college application essay and i have no clue how to start. The prompt is \"Tell us your story. What unique opportunities or challenges have you experienced throughout your high school career that have shaped who you are today?\" I haven't really experienced too many hardships or challenges that greatly affected me. My entire life has gone pretty smoothly. I don't have the sob story that people usually write about.\n\nMy friend told me to just lie, but I don't really think that lying about anything is going to do anything for me in this situation. I had this idea to write about how my life has been pretty smoothly but i had friends who have gone through things and i would write about my experience with helping them get through whatever it was they were going through. However, when i told my mom about this idea, she told me it was a dumb idea and it wasn't even on topic.\n\nI genuinely need some help on what to write about and how to write it. Honestly any advice helps.",

So I guess just an experience where I learned something about myself. Im lost too so idk if this helps or not \ud83d\ude14",
