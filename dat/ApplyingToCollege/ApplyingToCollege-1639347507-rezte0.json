  "text": "I got a letter of recommendation from my engineering teacher. At the time he was asking me questions in order to tailor a letter, I thought I would pursue an undergrad degree in engineering and then potentially get a grad degree in something else, however, I did mention my other interests. Since then I've realized that doesn't make much sense, and that I'd rather get an undergrad degree in a more general area of interest (with more coursework in humanities as well) and go to grad school if I want a specialized or technical degree. My college applications reflect this.\n\nI don't know the contents of this teacher's letter, and I think that they will be broadly very strong. But I'm concerned that, should he have said something to the effect of \"X will make a great engineer,\" it will have a negative impact on my application.",
