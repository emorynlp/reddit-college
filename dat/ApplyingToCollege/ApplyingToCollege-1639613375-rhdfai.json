I didn't apply ED for this university because it's not my top choice school, but I'd be happy to get in.",

There was a different version of something similar, especially for athletes, but ED is fairly new, and Ivy League universities have favored RD legacies for several hundred years.\n\nIn modern times, I have heard that ED legacies get a bigger boost than RD legacies, but that\u2019s not from any objective data \u2026 just rumors and opinions.  \n\nSo what I\u2019m saying is yes, it will probably help you, but just a little bit.",
