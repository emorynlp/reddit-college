      "text": "Hi! Answering here so others can see it too - your deadline is your deadline. It\u2019s fine that CSS doesn\u2019t process for 3-5 days. Colleges understand this completely. CSS and IDOC are absolutely inundated with files right now, understandably, but as long as *you* submitted your info by the deadline, you are fine. Good luck!",

This happens a lot.\n\nThis will absolutely not affect your ED admissions decision/chances as long as you are applying to a need-blind school. The admissions office will not be coordinating with the financial aid office if your school is need-blind.",
