  "text": "I am an Illinois resident with a 1430 SAT (800 M 630 EBRW) could superscore to 1500 with my 700 EBRW from April. I have near average or below average EC\u2019s as I\u2019m not sure mine even really count. Some examples are me going to a private school on the weekends to learn the polish language from age 3-17. I have a seal of bi literacy in polish and will have one in Spanish by April. I also participated in a math and soccer team freshman year. I\u2019ve passed a majority of my AP classes and have taken a total of 10 AP classes. Will have around 30ish community service hours by December. I\u2019m planning on majoring in something that would benefit me in preparing for the LSAT as I\u2019m planning on attending law school (philosophy, economics, not really too sure would appreciate suggestions). I don\u2019t really care whether or not the school is large or expensive would appreciate any suggestions for which schools I should apply to.",
