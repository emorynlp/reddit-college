  "text": "Hey guys! I see so many posts on people doing so many different cool things , like founding their own companies or nonprofits or doing some cool research project. I was wondering how many people over-embellish their experiences to make it sound cool. Cause technically I can say that I founded a new greener way to produce plastics when really I just made simulations for the group that actually did the heavy lifting.",
