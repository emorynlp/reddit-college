I know they were pretty far off from meeting my need (as a domestic student) when I did the net price calculator, if that helps at all? I know international and domestic aid is different, and that's not the final aid package, so that probably won't help a ton, but they wanted me to take out almost 1/4 of my family's income a year in loans, and I'm barely above low income.",

In each college\u2019s CDS, international aid can be found in section H6. \n\nhttps://www.coloradocollege.edu/offices/ipe/documents/CDS_2020-2021_w_Tuition.pdf\n\nPer section H6, roughly 100 internationals (or about 5-6% of all full time undergrads) got financial aid. Their average cash award was about $45,000. Compared to a lot of more selective schools, that\u2019s an average to below average number of internationals on aid relative to the student body. The aid number is also lower. A lot of the more selective schools award about 60,000 per recipient. Hard to say how you compare to the average international needing aid from a financial perspective, but it would appear that to make this work, you\u2019d require need-based aid + a merit award of some type covering 1/3 of the full cost of attendance.",
