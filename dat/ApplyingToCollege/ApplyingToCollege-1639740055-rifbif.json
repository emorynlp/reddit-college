  "text": "Hey, current college freshman here. Last school year, I got waitlisted by my dream school. I never got off the waitlist, and now I'm at another college. Now, I've come to love my college. I've made a lot of great friends, and the school is (mostly) a great fit for me. But over the course of this past semester, I still couldn't help but yearn for what could've been. \n\nI can't help but occasionally think about my dream school and picture the campus in my head, or look at pictures online. I see pictures of others I know attending this school on social media. I simped so hard for that school, and I came so close, but... it didn't happen. Honestly, I know I'm better off at my current college for my major-interests. But my heart still yearns and aches for what could've been. I know I would've been happy there, but I'm happy here too (very much so), and that's the weird thing. I think it's the idea of a potential alternate reality of attending my dream school that still makes me a bit sad, because I know I'll never get to live that reality now. \n\n(aside: I wasn't really sure what to tag this as so I just chose emotional support because it didn't fully fit in anywhere, but I'm not necessarily seeking emotional support - just wanted to write my feelings down somewhere.)",
