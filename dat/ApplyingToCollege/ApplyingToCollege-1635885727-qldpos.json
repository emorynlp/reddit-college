  "text": "My parents are from another country, and when I was applying to colleges I talked to my cousin who lived and said country and told him I needed to do stuff like debate and swim team to get into a good college. He looked at me like I was crazy and asked what that had to do with getting into college, and explained that universities in his countries only cared about your grades. Why is there such a substantial difference between the expectations of American universities and the rest of the world?",

                  "text": "This.  For example, UCLA gets 100,000+ applicants.  It doesn't take SATs.  How are you going to distinguish between 100,000 applicants mostly with GPAs in the 4 to 4.5 range from high schools all over the country and the world?  You need more data to separate out the mass of similar looking resumes.\n\nAs for why, I assume it's because top colleges think it's the right answer.  It gets them better students who keep paying tuition and donate after they graduate.  If it didn't work, it would be a lot easier to just have a computer do the work (which a lot state schools do). It's also more difficult to \"game\" the system.",

Oh wait--you were being serious?\n\nThere are some countries where the US is more competitive, but there are many more where it isn't. I live in Central Europe, and to get into university you apply directly to the department, which gives you an incredibly difficult test. And your grades don't count--because obviously As at one school do not equal As at a different school, even though in 5th, and 7th, and 9th grades the top 20% of students who have academic potential were filtered into state prep schools. Oh, and nobody cares if you were ASB president because it doesn't mean you are good at linguistics or history or nuclear physics. \n\nIn the US, there is always a university people can get into. It might not be Princeton, but you can probably get into Grand Valley State just fine. Not so here.",

      "text": "South Korea cares, a lot. You actually have to send proof of your extracurriculars with certificates and letters from people in charge and shit.\n\nBut to answer your question more directly, it's because American universities tend to be more \"free\" (because we invented freedom, murica!) for undergrads. If you apply to a European undergrad program, you are declaring a major. You are taking the courses they give you. You'll get a few electives but the vast majority are going to be dictated by the university. You're expected to arrive ready to go, no dicking around your first year. \n\nSo naturally they look at grades and don't really care about your other interests. \n\nMeanwhile, a US university can basically let you apply and do whatever you want. Sure, some require you declare, some majors have to be applied to directly, but you can literally just dick around 4 years and get a \"general studies\" degree if you don't major. \n\nSo it makes sense that colleges in the US would like to see what your interests are. Since they offer a buffet of options, they want to see what you're going to partake in.",

It isn\u2019t fair to the ones that worked hard for it. \n\nI\u2019m not against retaking standardized testing though; I\u2019d be fine if there was a buffer of half a year or a year between each test registration, but the superscoring aspect is absolutely ridiculous.",

      "text": "Antisemitism back in the early 20th century has a lot to do with it. Jewish students started doing very well on standardized tests, and in order to prevent the share of Jewish students in the student body from increasing, some elite colleges started using holistic admissions -- which allows them to be as subjective as they want. Legacy preference in admissions also emerged during this period. \n\nThis article explains it pretty well:\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/where-admissions-went-wrong/475575/",

I mean I'm in a few clubs and almost everyone in them drives, which costs so much that parents *definitely* have to be paying at least part of it as there isn't enough time in the day to be in those clubs and work enough to pay for the costs of a car. Debate had fees for every competition, with the ones doing the best needing to pay a TON of money to afford to go to nationals. Other clubs I'm in have not insignificant club fees.\n\nPlus, with letters of recommendation, what if you have teachers that don't like you for the wrong reason? All of my teachers love me right now, but I know of more than one that I'm *certain* would hate me if they knew I'm not straight and that I'm trans. It's not something that I can control, but I do need to legitimately consider if they could possibly know as it could affect my letters of recommendation. What if the teachers are racist?\n\nI personally wasn't very involved with extracurriculars for the first two years of high school. I was incredibly nervous, plus COVID made it even harder to get started. Maybe I'm just making excuses, I don't know. Even now, I could probably push myself harder than I am. But with things like the SAT and ACT, there are free resources to study for them. They may cost money, but they cost less than club dues often can, plus there are often lower fees for those that can't pay the full price.  It just feels like having so much subjectivity in the process creates a playing field that is far from level.",

But for mine, this thing that the US do is great \n\nFor some countries such as mine (Argentina), high school education is EXTREMELY poor compared to others in the world\n\n- The average of hours students spend in class per day are 6h\n- We don't have the chance to play sports/get into any sort of club for any type of art or other intelectual interest\n- We have mandatory courses, with the same difficulty for everyone at each school, and overall, you are taught a lot of things but not anything specialized of what you can possibly like. There are no extra-courses to be took, nor standarized exams.\n\nSo, in resume, the only way you can \"outstand\" from others is just if you do extracurrixulars activities. I don't know why US universities care so much abojt them, but for internationals like us it is the only way we can be correctly judged.\n\nFor example, I am writing this because I study English Language outside school, in school I actually study French, but the level is extremely poor I don't know shit. The average argentinian knows no more than a language. And to me, studying english is an extracurricular, not something I do at school",

      "text": "Because the grade scale for the American education system isn\u2019t standardized, in addition to the fact that high schools vary in difficulty. For example, my high school is a non competitive high school (but we are more difficult than the other schools in my area) and for us an A is a 93%. Other schools may be more or less difficult than us and their grade scale could make an A anything from a 90 to even a 95 if they wanted. Additionally, you have to factor in the fact that not all high schools offer the same types of classes. Some schools offer AP and IB, others just one, some a limited few, and some none at all. Some schools have inflated grades while others don\u2019t. Some offer college courses through the DE program and some are integrated into colleges to the point where they are considered a branch of the college. In short, the is no definite way for them to compare students that apply based solely on their grades if the context of their grades aren\u2019t the same. If they did do that, that would end up being unfair and it would favor the middle to upper class students who went to schools that offered those excelled programs and could also afford tutors to help them. \n\nHowever, factoring extracurriculars into the decision is a great way for colleges to see how motivated students are and what kind of students they\u2019ll be when they get to college. Someone who is involved in extracurriculars and still manages to keep good grades shows colleges that this student knows how to balance their time and generally won\u2019t struggle as much when they get to college. Additionally, extracurriculars can be close to anything and are generally accessible to most (if not all) students, so they are more forgiving of a person\u2019s circumstances.",
