  "text": "Currently at UCI as a first year and the school just isn\u2019t for me. I don\u2019t really like my major and there aren\u2019t many options I can switch to so I want to transfer to a private school like Boston University that have better programs for what I wanna do but how hard is it to transfer from a UC to a private school? or out of state school in general?",

      "text": "Not sure what \"hard\" would be but it takes some work and planning. There's the app process of course, and it's tiring waiting for results and uprooting yourself, and it's frustrating if you can't transfer over many credits and have to do an extra year of college. A good number do transfer from four years, including myself.\n\nWhether you have a \"chance\" depends on the school you're applying to and your college performance. It's also hard to base your chances on other people as transfer admissions are more subjective than freshman, to generalize it.\n\nThere's a lot to learn so I suggest in a transfer-related subreddit.",
