  "text": "I am an IB student from Mexico who\u2019s looking for financial aid to fund my education in a community college. I am a competitive swimmer and I\u2019m fluent in English. My grades have never been worse though. I have failed multiple classes in high school and rn I\u2019m barely getting by. Getting a scholarship is vital for me to get an education, since I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll end up paying for it myself. (Because of my grades) Can anyone tell me if I have a chance?\nTarget College: Heartland Community College. Bloomington, IL",
