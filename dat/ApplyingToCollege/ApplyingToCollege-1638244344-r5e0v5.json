  "text": "I immigrated to the US 5 years ago from Singapore, and some colleges require me to do the English proficiency exam even though I got a 790 on English Reading. For context, Singapore is an English-speaking country, and I've been fluent in English all my life. \n\nShould I contact the college?",

      "text": "In a similar boat but I sent my transcript which stated ive lived in the states for 4+ years so they waived my requirement. Tho I know a friend who's applying to a Florida uni that required her to take TOEFL or something even though she's been here for quite a long time now. Contact the college and have them waive it for cause you'll be graduating from a high school in the US. Worst case scenario, you'll have to take the Duolingo test or a similar one which I'm sure you'll do well in",
