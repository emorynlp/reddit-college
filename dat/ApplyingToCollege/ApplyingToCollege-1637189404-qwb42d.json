  "text": "I have no other significant EC's and I want to learn how to code. I have no background or any experience. Would it be possible to get it to a point where my skills would be noteworthy enough to put in my EC section or compete in competitions? I eventually want to make an app and other coding projects as well.\n\nNow, before you guys go freak out because \"I'm only doing this for prestige,\" \n1. I want to do this because I find it interesting, useful, and I hope fun. It's an interest first and \"~ec~\" second.\n2. I've always had an interest in modding and want to use it to make mods for the games me and my friends play.\n3. Even if it's impossible in the next year, I still want to learn to because I think it would be useful as a skill in general. \n4. I want to make something and make money off it. \n\nI just want to know the reality of if it will amount to anything or if it's impossible to improve that much in a year.",

No idea whether you will end up with some kind of EC that really impacts admissions, but you shouldn't let your life revolve around that.  \n\nLearning to code is a useful skill, and doing some of the things you are talking about will give you a better idea of whether majoring in CS, software engineering, or something related is right for you.",

      "text": "you dont have to be an amazing coder by the time you apply for it to be a valuable EC. Dedicating a significant amount of time to it is what makes it valuable, so I encourage you to begin, as not only do I think you will do well, but I also believe it will give you something interesting to write on your application. This coming from someone that didn't start coding until their junior year and got into a bunch of great cs schools including mit.",
