  "text": "My top school I want to attend is UVM (but haven't found out about that yet).\n\nI want to be a High School History teacher, for clarification.\n     So I've thought of doing a major in History, U.S specific, with a minor in Cultural Anthropology looking at North America (based on UVMs requirements for a minor, I could litererally only take the North American Indian society courses) since I'm interested in Pre-Columbian history. Now here is where I am unsure. I'm not going to teach without a Masters, since that gives a pay boost. I want to do an Accelerated Masters in History, but also enroll in a teacher licensure program, so that I can learn how to be a teacher before I just get a license and hop in. \n\nResearching UVM, it seems like their teacher licensure program is through an accelerated masters of arts in teaching, but I can't find anything about it on its own, if I could enroll after the Accelerated Masters, or whatnot.",
