      "text": "I do not know if it is the same at UT Austin, but U Washington specifies that they don\u2019t get the essay off the Coalition App unless you copy it into their section: \u201cPlease note: You must submit your essay and short response within the UW application questions. We are not able to retrieve your essays from the Coalition Essay section of your Profile. If you only submit your essays through the Coalition Essay section of your Profile, we will not receive them, and your application will be incomplete.\u201d\n\nBecause UT Austin only requires one essay, I am assuming you can use the primary Coalition essay, but may need to paste it into the UT section?",
