  "title:": "I'm a 29yo college dropout that wants to go back to school... any recommendations on which Atlanta-area college would be suitable?",
  "text": "I live 5 minutes away from GA tech though I'm sure they would laugh at the prospect of admitting me lol\n\nI'm 29, I got a decent-ish salaried job in operations management. I know there's various community colleges, as well as GSU. I just don't really have a good grasp on who would accept me. I'm super determined to go to school this time, it's been a good solid 5+ years since I dropped out and I've grown a lot, I just honestly don't know where to begin and feel a little overwhelmed.\n\nMy long term dream job would be an attorney, though that would be dependent on how hard I rock it once I'm back in school. I know it'd be extremely difficult for a dropout to ever find their way into law school. I'm thinking I just find a school that would accept me and knock out a Bachelors in Business. If I can use that pivot into law school, awesome. \n\nAlso this is a probably dumb question but am I still eligible for federal student loans if I dropped out previously? If it matters my credit is bad but I've never taken out student loans before, my previous college expenditures were out of pocket.\n\nI really appreciate any help I get. I'm very very unfamiliar with the university process. My memory of my previous college is pretty faded and even then it was a technical school with much more lax requirements",

      "text": "Hey there! I\u2019m in a very different situation as I\u2019m a high school student applying for undergrad, but I am in the greater ATL area so I have a bit of knowledge on this :)\n\nI\u2019m currently dual-enrolling with GSU; they have very flexible classes (online and in-person, multiple campuses\u2014one downtown and one in Alpharetta, one in Dunwoody too). I also know of Gwinnett Technical college, which is the community college local to me. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking to go into law, I suppose you could do 2 years at a community college and then transfer to a 4-year college. I know UGA (in Athens) has a specific pre-law track, but I don\u2019t know what the admissions process is like for non-highschool applicants (in terms of acceptance rate & procedure).\n\nI think you should be eligible for federal loans\u2014did you file the FAFSA when you were first in college? I\u2019m uneducated on how federal aid works beyond where it applies to me, but I think you should be able to\u2014I\u2019m not too sure, though. I also don\u2019t know how institutional aid would work in terms of scholarships; we have the HOPE and Zelle Miller Scholarships, but those are based on GPA and ACT/SAT score, so I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re applicable.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t much help, but this is as much as I know!",

      "text": "Hey there. I work as a fin aid counselor in the metro area. I used to work at Georgia State, and while it is a great institution it definitely feels like a big school and it can be difficult to navigate the administrative parts of the school. \n\nI currently work at a smaller school outside Atlanta which I personally prefer, but whether or not you want the relative \"prestige\" of GSU as a tradeoff to being enrolled at a very large institution. \n\nIn regards to your loan eligibility, since you haven't borrowed before, what you're going to have to worry about is Satisfactory Academic Progress, or SAP. The department of education has a few standards students need to meet in order to be eligible for federal aid, namely you must maintain a 2.0 GPA, and pass 2/3rds or the classes you enroll in. Depending on your GPA when you left school, and the circumstances under which you left you may or may not be meeting SAP, which would affect your ability to borrow.",

I wanna say was last in school in 2014, 2015 at the latest. \n\nMiscellaneous question: I have a few college credits but also have, of course, several failed classes. Do you know if I can just \"clean slate\" my gpa and start from scratch, or do schools typically make you transfer everything? I don't mind re-doing my freshman classes",

I don't work on the admissions side, but on the financial aid if you received any federal aid at any school, we can see that and discrepancies would have to be resolved. As long as the classes you failed aren't too numerous you'll be okay fin aid wise, but I do understand wanting a clean slate.",
