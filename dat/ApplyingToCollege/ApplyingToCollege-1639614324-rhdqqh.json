I know all your favourite spots.\nBut I guess I was wrong.\n\n\nNow you rejected me, I started thinking maybe you made a mistake. You know you can always get back to me. An email saying: \u201cwe made a mistake about your decision\u201d is enough for me.\n\nBut maybe I am wrong again..\n\n\nPlease don\u2019t judge \ud83d\ude42 it\u2019s been 22 minutes since I got my rejection and I wrote this genuinely from my heart",
