  "text": "I literally don't even know what I write about. You want to talk about a challenge in my life and how I've overcome it? I'm only 17, what challenge have I had in my life that I can write about. I'm no 4.0 1600 SAT kid that has also cured cancer. I'm normal, I don't have a super story where my robot stopped working halfway through a competition and I miraculously saved it and won the competition. Just no. You want to hear about my dreams and aspirations? I'm just try to get through each day. I dont have the braincells to think that far in the future. I just want to be a good person and help people. You want to me write about what I do for fun? I watch youtube and lurk on reddit. I dont research intergalactic substances. What do you want from me college essayyyyss. I'm just a normal kids trying to get through the day. I have no heroic stories. I can barely remember what I did i week ago.",

Have them dissect your own specific problem areas. In my experience, do not have other students read it over unless they are known for giving solid constructive feedback.",

The common app is pretty much a snippet of your life and a reflection from the event to show what type of person you are. The supplements depends from school to school, but they're more specific essays catered to the school like why us? How would you contribute to the community? and more.",

Don't sweat it, you actually don't have to have a major life event to write a personal statement. Even though I do have something serious that I could write about, I chose to talk about something super menial for my statement. The purpose of the personal statement is to show the school your values (family, friends, persistence, etc.). So take an object or a small meaningful event in your life and connect your values to it. :)",

They are relevant and they are powerful because they are specific to you. Don\u2019t ever discredit yourself because you feel otherwise. I applied for a few scholarships during my senior year of high school and I didn\u2019t earn any. It really got to me and made me feel like the essays I wrote weren\u2019t compelling enough even though they were true. I felt like as a result, who I was as a person wasn\u2019t deserving of any kind of scholarship. Eventually I realized that despite not winning any thing quite yet, it didn\u2019t mean my stories/feelings were not valid or worthy enough. SO don\u2019t feel like you don\u2019t have anything to share. Your life is unique and what you have to say and express matters even if you haven\u2019t quite wrapped your head around that yet!",
