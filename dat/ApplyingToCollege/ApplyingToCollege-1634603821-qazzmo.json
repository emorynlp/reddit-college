  "text": "I was wondering if any of you knew much about UPenn's CS program and if it's worth EDing to. I feel like my chance of getting in isn't good without an ED but I feel like with an ED I might regret limiting my options. Do you guys think an ED to UPenn for CS is worth it? Also it is the only school my parents will let me ED so it's either ED Penn or no ED. I am someone more interested in getting a software development job at big tech and not super into the research side of computer science for a career, although it can be interesting.",
