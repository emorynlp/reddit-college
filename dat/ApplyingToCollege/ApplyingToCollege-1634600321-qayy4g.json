  "text": "1. Boy Scout Eagle Project \nThis one is obviously a big accomplishment and I worked very hard and it taught me leadership and blah blah. I\u2019m not sure how well it will stand out since it\u2019s a big accomplishment for all those who do it.\n\n2. Buying a Laptop at 13\nSo basically I worked all summer doing odd jobs to get enough money to buy a gaming laptop BUT I later regretted it and it taught me a lesson about money and patience. I feel like there is definitely potential here.\n\n3. Unloading a truck at Walmart \nThis one is more a physical accomplishment and about perseverance, I had to spend five hours in a metal box in 90 degree weather to unload a truck while understaffed. I could do something with it but it is much smaller scale than the others.\n\nSo yeah thoughts would be appreciated",
