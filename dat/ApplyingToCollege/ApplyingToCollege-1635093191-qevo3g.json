  "text": "I know it\u2019s probably way too late to make changes, but I just realized that my college application essay is about a middle school experience. \n\n\nThis experience meant a lot to me and inspired my future career though, so I don\u2019t know how I should change my essay to emphasize \u201chey even though this happened in middle school, it\u2019s still saying a lot about me today!\u201d \n\n\nPlease let me know how I can communicate this without making huge changes? Any help is appreciated.",
