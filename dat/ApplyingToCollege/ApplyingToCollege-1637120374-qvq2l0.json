  "text": "Title \n\nBasically, on my common app and MIT app I said I was a National AP Scholar instead of an AP Scholar with Distinction. I've already submitted quite a few applications and I've fixed it on my current common app. Should I email colleges and tell them about this or not? I'll definitely be a National AP Scholar this year once I have taken 8 tests, so I am not sure what to do.",
