  "text": "I am an HS sophomore, also an international. There's really a 0% chance of me filling applications in my senior year. My parents don't support me. I am literally just trying to convince them from last 5 month. They are forcing me to go to a school in another city to prepare for the national unis examinations for my next two years. That school is a complete hellhole. They don't let you go out of their campus, they don't let you use your cell neither move in with a laptop or any electronic devices. I am realllllllllyyyyyy looking forward to apply as a CS major. And there's really a need of all devices to pursue my EC's. I feel very weak. There's no coming out of this situation. And I really don't like adjusting in my dreams until I haven't tried it once. I feel suffocated.",
