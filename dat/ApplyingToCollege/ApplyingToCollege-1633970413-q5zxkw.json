Two classes I\u2019m doing really bad at is Calc BC and Decathlon (our school has a class dedicated to decathlon since it\u2019s interdisciplinary and it\u2019s so strenuous). I\u2019ve had my calc teacher pull me after class multiple times to tell me that I should consider leveling down to AB Calc for the sake of my mental health, and I got such low grades that he had to call my dad about it too. \n\nDecathlon has daily reading and daily quizzes so since I\u2019m already pretty burned out, I skip out on a few and do average/bad on the ones I do take. Those low scores pull down my grade by a lot ;-; but for both classes, I love the community and teachers so I stick around",
