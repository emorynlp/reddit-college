  "text": "I just got an email to apply for it so I did ofc, and now I have a couple of questions:\n\n1. What even is this?\n2. I saw in some old posts that UChicago gives money for the National Recognition programs, but I can\u2019t find any evidence of this anywhere, where does it say that and how much money is it?\n3. If UChicago does give money for it, would it be worth it to update the financial aid office if I receive the award?\n\nThanks!!",

      "text": "1) College board run program for under-represented groups.  They have similar ones for Hispanic students, Native American students, and rural students. Mostly awarded for doing really well on the PSAT or on AP exams.\n\nThe big benefit of it is some schools reward it with scholarships - a lot of the schools that give big scholarships for national merit also reward students in this program.  Full tuition at ASU, enough of a scholarship to waive OOS costs at Texas A&M, a pretty big scholarship at Northeastern, etc.\n\nAt a minimum, it's usually going to qualify you for the kinds of scholarships that may make you rethink your safety options.\n\n2 & 3) As far as I know U Chicago doesn't offer money for it, but I would reach out to the financial aid office and ask.",
