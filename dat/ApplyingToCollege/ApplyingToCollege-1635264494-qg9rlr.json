  "text": "My teacher forgot to put the letter head and her signature on my recommendation letter. I had told her a hundred times that it was necessary but now she has already submitted it. Is there a way she can reupload the letter with the letter head and signature? And if not will this affect my application negatively? I'm really very scared, help me out, please.",
