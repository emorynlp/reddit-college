                      "text": "Going to school games definitely isn't a major event, but it's not odd either - you'll never be the only person there. The harvard-brown football game is definitely a major one that a lot of people go to, and this year a lot of people also went to the women's soccer game when they were in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\n\nI honestly haven't heard anything about frat parties but if you're looking for that type of vibe, a lot of the sports houses (I guess some of the sports teams get their own houses or something?) on campus usually have weekly parties - you can def just wander around Thayer street or something (like my friends and I have done!) and find a party or a big group heading to a party. First years are also are pretty big on throwing parties in the dorms, specifically Keeney, so you can usually find one there over the weekends with mostly freshman which is probably a bit less intense than the sports house-esque vibe. And the third option, which is my personal favorite, is kickbacks, which I feel like are the most common. But there is def party activity on the weekends! You just have to search it out rather than it be obnoxiously in your face :)\n\nAs for other social events, lots and lots of clubs are super easy to join and will have a lot of different events throughout the semester - I would def recommend joining ones that interest you to make friends and have more options for things to do. Some of the more common academic ones include the DUGs (department undergraduate group) which is groups of people who want to/are concentrating in the specific department (i.e. the Econ DUG) and you can get like advice for classes to take, just hang out and talk about your favorite subject, or attend the events that they put together. Then of course there's like an infinite number of non-academic clubs you can join as well - the club fair at the beginning of the year is definitely the best resource for finding some of the more niche ones, and word of mouth and social media help as well.",
