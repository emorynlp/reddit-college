  "title:": "PSA: Use your activities section to quantify the magnitude of your achievements",
  "text": "This has all been said before. I'm saying it again.\n\nI had a student who was a top, top, top global athlete in her sport. In her activities section she wrote, \"Attended San Francisco fencing academy for 4 years, fenced in national tournaments.\"\n\n(OK, it wasn't fencing, but you get the idea.)\n\nWhen I asked her just how good she was at fencing... Well, the \"San Francisco Fencing Academy\"  only admits 5% of applicants taken from a global pool of elite fencers.\n\nSo, the rewrite: \"Fenced at academy with 5% admissions rate drawing from global pool of elite fencers, yada yada yada.\"\n\nThe important thing here is that this rewrite gives readers a sense of the **magnitude** of your accomplishment relative to other participants.\n\nYou don't have to be in the 99th percentile to do this. Look for creative ways to quantify your achievements - pies baked, people served, hours logged.\n\nPlease, in the rush to submit, **don't overlook your activities section**. The activities section anchors the narrative you're building in your essays, LORs, etc. This is one of the places in the app where you should brag about the magnitude of what you've accomplished.\n\nThis may be obvious for some. But it's worth stating again so close to the deadline.",
