  "text": "I'm 15, and I would like to eventually become a doctor. I would very much like to go to Northwestern uni in Chicago, but it has a very low acceptance rate.\n\nMy question is basically what I need to do to help me be taken seriously when I submit my application, taking into account that I'm homeschooled.\n\nI have done many extracurriculars - I've done ballet for 6yrs, violin for 7, I did martial arts for 7 years and was in choir for \\~4 years. I also used to volunteer at the local food bank, but that was when I was very young so it probably doesn't count.\n\nI will be taking the SAT and maybe the ACT but I'm not sure.\n\nI'm pretty worried about this, so any comments would be very much appreciated. Thank you!\n\nNote: I will obviously be applying to multiple schools, but this is my top choice.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a homeschooled student too, and I\u2019ve considered applying pre-med. I haven\u2019t been through the college application process yet (class of 2023) but I\u2019ve done literally so much research. From everything I\u2019ve found: \n\n- Letters of Recommendation are really important at most schools, make sure you have a coach or teacher to write one \n\n- Take APs and take AP tests. Shows you can do the same work as kids in public school \n\n- Again for standardized testing, the SAT and ACT. Get good scores and prioritize taking one as a homeschooler, don\u2019t go test optional \n\n- Schools compare your ec\u2019s with the opportunities that were available to you. With what you put here, it sounds like you\u2019re already doing well with ECs though haha \n\n- Dual enrollment and lab hours. Lab hours aren\u2019t talked about a lot, but are required at most colleges. Taking classes at a local college will count towards lab hours. Also dual enrollment teachers are good for letters of recommendation\n\nGood luck! You\u2019ve got this. It\u2019s less impossible than it seems.",
