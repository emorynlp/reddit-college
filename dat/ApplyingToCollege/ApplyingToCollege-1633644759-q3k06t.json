  "text": "In my supplemental essays, I want to write about how I have always loved \"people-watching.\" I am just so fascinated by humans and could spend hours observing people. I wanted to connect this passion to my major. However, I can totally see this coming across as weird or creepy. What do y'all think?",

      "text": "Hey! I'm an avid people watcher as well and it connected slightly to my Major of Communication. I'd say it's only as creepy as you make it! Saying something along the lines of \"I unflinchingly watch people without their knowledge to gleam information about their personal lives,\" just sounds bad. Saying \"I got into Anthropology due to my fascination of humanity as a species, I found myself enamored with the day to day lives of people I was close to and would people watch at parks and restaurants. As I took in the person to person interactions in present day I began to wonder how our past related to it and ponder how those interactions would lead to our future, therefore, Anthropology became my passion.\"\nNot sure of your Major but I'm sure you can relate it.",

You want some degree of active agency to shine in your essay (I exist, I observe, I realize, I act). So if you people watch, does it change how you interact with people? Passive > Active. Then tie it back to how these lessons will serve you well in college.",
