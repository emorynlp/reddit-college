  "text": "Hey! So I\u2019ve been procrastinating my application to UCF because I have no clue what to write for the \u201cWhy are you interested in UCF?\u201d. I\u2019m an undecided major and the main reason I am interested in UCF is because it\u2019s in my state and it is a good school for me to apply to. I know people say that these essay questions (250 words) aren\u2019t suppose to be the basic facts about the school, but more so why you are right for UCF but there aren\u2019t any special qualities that I can think of that I\u2019ll add to the school. So any help would be amazing because I really need to turn in this application asap!!",

(Make sure to specifically mention which activities you wanna participate and why). You could talk about some kind of scholar or honors program available to all majors. And, as u/toyota2003 mentioned, you can talk about your different interests and how UCF is great for all of them.",
