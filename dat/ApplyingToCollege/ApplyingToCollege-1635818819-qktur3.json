  "title:": "What do colleges look for in academic work? What can I do to improve my application?",
  "text": "Hey, I'm applying to this academy thing - not technically a college but I think the same advice should apply.\n\nI'm a pretty advanced (not like fucking genius/prodigy but pretty good) student in math. I'm taking statistics and linear algebra, and I'm looking to get into machine learning. I've got an independent study set up with the programming teacher at my school, and I was working on some more foundational stuff this quarter, but I'd like to do something more practical/project based.\n\nWhat kind of stuff do schools look at? Is there really anything meaningful I can do, or am I at a point where anything I do isn't really beneficial enough? What should I be looking to do academically that can make me stand out? I'm a pretty quick learner and if I can figure out what I actually want to do I'm pretty confident in my ability to actually do it. Applications don't start until January so I've got a decent amount of time.\n\nAny help would be awesome, thanks :)",

          "text": "Hm, yeah actually I think so. I thought about it last year when I was looking to take calc but never actually did. I haven\u2019t really thought about doing a different course but that\u2019s probably something I should look into.\n\nI likely wouldn\u2019t be able to take anything until January though, right? Will they even be able to see the course if I haven\u2019t completed it by the time apps are due in March? I\u2019m not really sure tbh\n\n\n*I\u2019m also cringing as I think about the fact that I decided to self study linear algebra, I probably could have taken a college course \ud83d\ude2c that hurts to think about ngl. Literally didn\u2019t even consider it",
