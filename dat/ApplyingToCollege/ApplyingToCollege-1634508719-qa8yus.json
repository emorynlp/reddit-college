  "text": "My school counsellor couldn\u2019t accommodate me for applying Early Decision cz I missed the deadline to tell him by a few days. I\u2019ve completed my application and I just need a counsellor to add to my commonapp and review my essays a few times. Is it possible to hire a service like this? Or can I just apply without a counsellor? My deadlines Nov 1 so I need it done urgently ://",

      "text": "You cannot apply without your high school counselor's form being submitted to Common App. This is why high school counselors have deadlines. They probably have a full schedule.\n\nAnother administrator at the school could potentially also submit the high school forms, so ask around. A *private* counselor cannot do high school forms.\n\nYour high school counselor need not review your essays and probably isn't a good choice for that anyway. You can find that type of help elsewhere - there are private college consultants that charge by the hour.",
