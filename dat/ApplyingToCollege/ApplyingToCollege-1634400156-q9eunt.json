  "text": "Let's get straight to the point. I can't take a gap year because I'm from Kazakhstan where military service of 1 year is mandatory to all men (conscription). I need a gap year because I started thinking of applying to universities too late (this month). I had plans to improve my SAT score, pass my A-Levels and to take some time to write a kickass personal statement letter without rushing. Also, I made a very bad college list that I need to restart. I don't think I'll be able to meet the deadlines. I'm kinda stuck now, what advice can you give me on this?",

      "text": "If you do not have time to submit application, then you need this gap year. You can't go to any university because then you can only apply as a transfer student. This means that it is almost impossible to get a huge financial aid. What to do? You can get an exemption from the army if you continue your studies after school. 1) You can take any studying courses that give exemption from the army for this year 2) foundation year in any country (preparation for uni) 3) preparatory courses for admission to American universities in the USA",

          "text": "Because I will have to go to the army for a year after high school if I don't get into a university. As I've mentioned, I was dumb to not start thinking of applying to universities earlier and now I have very little time to start my applications. Even if I did try to dodge the army, it would be illegal and I could get in a lot of trouble.",
