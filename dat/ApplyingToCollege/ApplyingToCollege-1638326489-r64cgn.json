  "text": "Recently found out my parents are much richer than they made me believe  and are just very stingy with their money. They make me pay for everything. They also don\u2019t believe in college. I\u2019m on my own and I currently have 2000 in the bank saved for college because of my job. But I need to use more than 500 of it for speech and driving lessons. I also pay 85 dollars a month for piano. Other than piano and speech I have zero ecs. My SAT is 1520. With wealthy parents, garbage ecs and a job with crap pay, how screwed am I? Should I take a gap year and save up before college? What chance do I have at a full ride?",
