  "text": "I was planning to submit an art portfolio because I\u2019ve actively been involved in singing and stuff. I looked into what other people who got in had submitted and they were mostly classical or opera and anything but contemporary music. I did see one pop song but thats all. My question is that am I limited to classicy songs or can I sing more contemporary genres that I feel I sound better in?",
