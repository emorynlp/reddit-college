  "text": "I spent the last 3 years reaching to get into NYU. I attended numerous sessions, demonstrated interest, took the ACT twice to get a 34, literally ruined my health to get a 4.0 in my Junior year. And for what? Nothing. I legitimately feel like driving myself off into an ice cold river, but I digress, anything I can do to cope? I\u2019m frustrated and want to blame everyone around me, but I feel like it\u2019s all my fault too. I don\u2019t know how to react. This has screwed up my Christmas :/",

Earlies are only a tiny fraction of the total schools available and it's very possible you will get in somewhere even better where you'd be even happier. Some of the brightest, most accomplished kids in the world get rejected from their dream schools. I know a ton already. Eventually, though, their efforts will pay off.\n\nYou're only a teenager. Go have fun, enjoy Christmas, take a day off worrying about college. You're gonna get in somewhere amazing, it just takes time.",
