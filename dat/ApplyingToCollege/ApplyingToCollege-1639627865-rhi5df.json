  "text": "Hey, class of \u201826ers! I know this can be a very stressful time, with ED and EA decisions coming out and all. These are probably your first decisions. I wanted to share my college story with you all, because I think it might give you guys some clarity and peace of mind. I don\u2019t want this to come across as \u201cbraggy.\u201d \n\nIn October 2019, I applied to Brown ED. Two months later, I was rejected. Not accepted, not deferred, REJECTED. Flat out. To say the least, I was crushed. I felt out of it for at least 24 hours. I tried so hard on that application. Video, emailing AOs, interview, essays, etc. I really felt like it was the end for me. I had already submitted my other apps, so I couldn\u2019t take my application back and work on it. I thought I was going to get rejected from EVERYWHERE. \n\nSkip forward to January, I was admitted to UNC. I am from out of state, so I was shocked to have gotten in (~15% acceptance rate). It was reassuring, but UNC was not my top choice. Then, more rejections came. When I say rejections, I mean like 10 in a row. Then March 26th came! Ivy Day! I got rejected from 5 of them. Then, I opened my last two. UPenn and Dartmouth. Somehow, by the grace of God, I got into both. \n\nWhile that usually is the end of the story, mine took another turn. I couldn\u2019t afford either UPenn or Dartmouth. So, I decided to attend UNC. I was NOT excited to go. Of course, UNC is awesome, but the what-ifs of UPenn and Dartmouth really dominated my mind. I was very upset, and it broke my heart when I had to hit no. It hurt my parents too, because they knew how much I wanted it. \n\nFast forward, I am now a sophomore at UNC! I couldn\u2019t imagine myself anywhere else. It really is the perfect school for me. I love my friends, teachers, and school. If you would have told me in May 2020 I would be this happy at UNC. I would have told you that you were lying. \n\nI guess my point is: never assume you know what the outcome will be. It\u2019s hard to let go of control over your life\u2014letting the colleges decide whether they want you. You have to let go, though. You did the hard work. Try your best, and it will all work out. I PROMISE!! Even if you don\u2019t go to your dream school, college is a wonderful experience. It\u2019s cheesy, but college really is what you make of it. If someone hasn\u2019t told you, I am proud of you. You got this! Good luck!!",
