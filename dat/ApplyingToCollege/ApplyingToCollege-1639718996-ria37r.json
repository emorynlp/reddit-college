  "text": "I know that top schools generally don\u2019t like well rounded people.\n\nMy main ECs are trumpet in the marching band/concert band, robotics, soccer, president of a STEM related club, and STEM related volunteering.\n\nFor soccer, I\u2019m just the regular player who isn\u2019t the kind that will get recruited. JV 2 years and varsity for 2. \n\nBut for my other activities I have been good enough to get a leadership position in band (responsible for ~20) and I am the lead for software in robotics. As president of the club I grew it to 20 active members. I also have 200 hours so far in volunteering.\n\nSo basically I am not insanely talented in any of my activities, but good enough to get leadership and regional awards in my many activities. Does this still count as being well rounded?",

He's got good grades and scores, but what really excites him?  I can't tell.\"",
