      "text": "I think if you are to rank colleges via academics (and even that is sometimes subjective), the question should be why would this be relevant?  In the academic world, not many really care. If you\u2019re a professor, you go where you can get support for your research. If you\u2019re a doctor, you go where the environment is great for you and so on. I don\u2019t think it matters that greatly other than maybe for the 1% of the population that has a specific need. When I hire someone and I don\u2019t work for a small fish company, I find myself being just impressed with someone with a business degree from Indiana University or Miami of Ohio as someone who\u2019s from Wharton. \n\nTaking this back to the context of college apps, if you could go anywhere and money is not an option, sure, an Ivy League and fancy private school is nice. You don\u2019t have to fight to register for a class due to max capacity. The extra resources and smaller class sizes are nice.  However, can you a million times thrive with the right hustle and attitude at a regional, absolutely.",
