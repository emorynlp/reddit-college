  "title:": "A little mistake in transcripts",
  "text": "My counselor already submitted all my transcripts and while i was going through them today, i found out that there is a mistake in it.\nIn my transcripts for each year, both marks and grade for every subject is included. For my sophomore year, I got 99/100 in my Math exam which becomes A1 grade. However, due to some typing error i guess, it's mentioned A2. Moreover, in the same transcripts all the marks of other subjects which are ranging from 95 to 100 are marked as A1. And the official marksheet is also uploaded by school where the grade for math is A1.\n So should I email each University to let them know the mistake? Or will they understand it's an typo error? \nAdvice is appreciated.",
