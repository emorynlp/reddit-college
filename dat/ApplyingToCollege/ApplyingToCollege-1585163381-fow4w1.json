  "title:": "Ivy Day is the Anniversary of my Suicide Attempt, and this is what I want to tell you",
  "text": "TW: suicide, psych ward, drugs, arson, emotional abuse\n\nFour years ago today, I was spending my \"last\" twenty-four hours writing notes to friends and family, and silently saying goodbye to all the things I thought I'd never see again: icicles glistening under the sun. Trees. Honey-nut cheerios. Gel pens. Back then, I couldn't picture myself living another day, much less graduating high school, applying to colleges, or dreaming of a future. But somehow, against the odds, I made it. I made it through the bright lights of the ER, as doctors worked frantically around me sticking IVs in my veins and prodding my face. I made it through the psych ward, living with drug-dealers from juvie and eight year olds who tried to burn down their schools. I made it through months of crushing shame, my parents screaming at me with disappointment, and shrinks who told me that I was a lost cause.\n\nBecause here's the thing that I want to say to us--on the eve of Ivy Day, no matter what shit goes down tomorrow and how bitter and disappointed we are with your results--even if it feels like our worlds are collapsing, we'll get through this. This one's for us: for all of those late nights studying APs, IBs, SATs, and ACTs, all those days we were so worn-down from Sports and EC board nominations and friend drama that we fell asleep at our desks, all those moments we ducked into the school bathrooms and thought, *I can't do this*.\n\nBecause we've made it. We DID do it. We've already worked so unbelievably hard and have come so unbelievably far, and even if we aren't rewarded tomorrow, we've already won. Those flimsy paper \"regret to inform you\"s? They are NOTHING compared to what we've accomplished and how hard we've worked. They do not define us. They do not summarize four years of tears and sweat and grit. They will never know our full stories and how much we've overcome.\n\nSo this is the beginning of a lifetime, not the end of a journey.\n\nIf you get into your dream school? Congrats! But you're still going to have to work hard these next four. If you get rejected? Congrats! It's now a chip on your shoulder to keep busting ass. We are so young. We are SO young. We are seventeen and eighteen and nineteen and bursting with promise, and as long as we work hard, stay hungry, and learn as much as we can with what we're given, we're going to succeed and we're going to be happy.\n\nWhatever happens tomorrow is the universe's plan for you. Before you open that first decision, take a moment to reflect, to be proud of all you've done and everything you've become. No matter what happens next, you are ready.\n\nSaddle up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*update: I'm so moved by all of your comments and support! Feeling beyond grateful for the a2c community. ",

My goal in life isn't so much to attain wealth than to attain and create knowledge. However, not many colleges in the US specialize in the specific area of CS that I want to study, and the ones that do tend to be selective simply on the account that such universities tend to do more advanced research. I'm worried that I'm already at a disadvantage now and I won't have the connections and resources I need to prepare for grad school admissions. (I was already rejected from my ideal college choices.)",

                          "text": "No, automata theory (like finite state machines, Turing machines, etc, right?) isn't what I'm talking about. Compiler theory is probably a part of PL theory, but TBH compiler theory is more about language implementation while PL theory is more about language design. There's overlap, but there's also differences.\n\nWhat I'm specifically interested in is type theory, which concerns the classification of programs into \"types\" based on their behavior. Programs may only be combined in ways that follow the type system rules. From the point of view of CS, the goal of type theory is to reject programs that don't have a meaning while accepting the programs that do.\n\nHowever, type theory is also related to formal logic through the Curry-Howard correspondence, a big idea that states that a programming language is a formal system for logical reasoning: Types are formulas and programs are proofs. Thus, type theory is related to constructive math, in which each step of a proof has a computational meaning.\n\nType theory is also related to category theory, an area of pure math that characterizes mathematical objects via their relationships with other objects. Category theory generalizes constructions found across different areas of math by identifying them by their universal properties. The idea is that a programming language is an \"internal logic\" of a category. Right now, type theorists are investigating Homotopy Type Theory, which relates type theory to homotopy theory and higher category theory. I want to learn the math so that I can understand all the background knowledge about this.\n\nThe area that I'm interested is basically about topics like lambda calculus, functional programming, etc.",

Not long after he arrived, he decided theater wasn't for him and switched over to business. Then he decided in the last two years of his undergrad career to switch into engineering, where he took six classes a semester plus summer classes to earn the degree. Now he's decided to ditch engineering altogether, and several years later he's going into his first job as a computational biophysicist working to create models for cancer research. Undoubtedly, he's worked his ass off in the past couple of years, reading books day in and day out and stressing over difficult graduate-level classes, but his hard work and determination led him up to this moment in which he's finally able to settle down and realize what he wants to do for a living. It is never too late; even if you think it is, I assure you that if you keep pushing and never give up, life will eventually find you a place you can call home. It may be immensely circuitous as it has been for my brother, but it *will* eventually work out one way or another if you just keep at it.",
