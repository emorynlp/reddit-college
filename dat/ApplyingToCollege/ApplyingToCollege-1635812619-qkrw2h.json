  "text": "I'm not really an introvert or anything but I'm infamously bad at starting conversations with new people and it's usually really awkward. After a few minutes I'm fine but introductions have never been my strong suit. I'm concerned about this because I have my Harvard interview in 2 days and I really don't want to leave a bad first impression that I'm trying to make up for the rest of the interview. Any advice?",

How are you?!\" As if I've known them for a million years.\n\nWorks most of the time.",
