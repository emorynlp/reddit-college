Those people won't be competitive in applications for top schools.\n\nOut of those students applying for top schools, AP Scholar with Honors is comparatively common and AP Scholar with Distinction becomes more common too. I doubt \\*that\\* many people get it but if you look at the criteria it seems like something pretty easy for a competitive applicant for a T20 school to have.",

Meaning that by the time people actually apply for college, a lot of the 94% will move to the 6%. Also remember this does not account for schools that don't offer AP. So the % of people have ap scholar with honors by college application time is a mixed bag.",
