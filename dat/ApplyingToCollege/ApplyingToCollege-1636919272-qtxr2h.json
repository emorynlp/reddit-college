      "text": "U of Alabama. I got the \u201cCapstone Tour\u201d through the honors college, and it was ridiculous. They planned a day-long schedule personalized to my interests. I started off with an honors info session in the morning, then two engineering students gave me a tour of the lab facilities. I then went to talk to a biology professor (I\u2019m hoping to do biochem) and she told us a ton about her department. My parents and I had lunch with a current student in my intended major in the campus\u2019s main dining hall (food was good, too!). Then one of their tour guides drove us around in a modified golf cart and showed us everything and anything we wanted to see on campus. She took us to the rec center and let me check out the racquetball courts (I play competitively), and then to a sample freshman dorm that was nicer than many hotels. We finished off the day with an hour-long private interview with the dean of the honors college, who answered any and every question we had. \n\nAlabama isn\u2019t a perfect school, and the location is far from ideal from this city girl. But between that show they put on, and the phat merit scholarship they\u2019re offering (a full ride and then some!), I am sorely, sorely tempted. Out of all the schools I toured, there was nowhere else that made it so clear that they wanted me. Not going to lie, it\u2019s nice to be wanted.",

And it was the perfect length; the info session was 30 mins and the tour was like 80 minutes.\n\n\\-----\n\nEdit: William & Mary, U of Vermont, Champlain College, and UPitt were also great.\n\nWorst: Boston College and Tufts. (lol, they're both in Boston, that's just a coincidence though.)",

              "text": "sure! if youre looking for a very small school with a very pretty/nature campus, it's definitely the place for you :)  it's not too far from the big city Philadelphia, but it def gives that suburbia/away from the city vibe. Though it's liberal arts, they have good research programs and availability for research since they don't have a graduate school, and they have a very good pipeline of undergrad --> grad (and a good success rate on top grad programs). there is a pretty unique campus life, like if you look at the list of clubs offered there's like so many things that are out of nowhere but super interesting to do. When I had my interview with a senior at swarthmore, she was super happy and unlike any other college interviewer that i had for other schools (who were also seniors at the college). if there are specific questions you have, lmk and ill try my best to answer! in the discoswat program, they had a panel with students at the college talk abt their experience and most of them thought their experience was very good, but that the school could do more with support for BIPOC students (which made me doubt in applying lol since i am a poc but i ended up applying anyway). it's the only liberal arts specific school that im applying to even tho im very much a neuroscience/premed person, so that says a lot abt how appealing the school is, at least for me.",
