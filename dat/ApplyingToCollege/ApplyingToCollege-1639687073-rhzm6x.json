  "text": "I already submitted the FAFSA form with my mom's financials (my parents are divorced and she's the primary custodial parent), and then the CSS profile, again with my mom's financials. But now, schools like Northeastern require the CSS Profile from the noncustodial parent, AND the actual W2 form, tax returns, and schedule c. All that information was already given in BOTH applications. I feel fortunate that I am even able to provide all that information cause I can imagine that a lot of people applying for financial aid cannot even provide such info. This seems beyond excessive and only to make it harder to actually get any aid. Thoughts on the financial aid process?",

Sad I know but I know too many people who have been screwed over by financial aid offices and their assumptions.",
