  "text": "1. i should mark down my race as \"asian\" because i have some middle eastern/west asian heritage and colleges \"love asians\"\n2. i should just apply to 60+ schools and then go to whichever one i'm accepted to that has the highest ranking\n3. location/fit completely do not matter. US News ranking is the only criteria.\n4. my safety schools can be liberal arts colleges (even though \"those degrees won't help you\" because my mom believes liberal arts schools have no STEM degrees)\n5. the summer before senior year: \"work hard to get your GPA up\"\n6. i should write my college essay on my great-grandmother's incredible life story and all the struggles she faced in the 1940s\n7. or i should write it about how junior year was hard but i pushed through anyways\n8. \"oh! i know! you should write about the pandemic and how it made you want to be a doctor.\"\n9. \"i would like it if you went to UCLA\"\n10. \"wow UCSD has 30% acceptance, that's really high!\"\n11. i swam on the school team for one semester, she believes this should be at the top of my common app list because \"colleges love athletes\"\n\nlove you mama but not everything you see on facebook is accurate!!\n\nplease tell me i'm not the only one with a parent like this",

(Some) parents know things and have context their kids don\u2019t, and may be able to advise them against certain (arguable) missteps.  And having a frank discussion about finances seems wise. In my case, I was able to eliminate a whole slew of universities from the get go. Not only did that save me the wasted time of actually applying, but it spared me the emotional turmoil of getting my heart set on someplace only to discover it was beyond my means.\n\nOne thing I could have benefited from is someone clueing me in to the fact that high test scores only take you so far, and you do actually need top grades.  Also, I wish someone had urged me to spend more time researching and considering what careers I might actually find rewarding and meaningful instead of defaulting to ruthless practicality.",

      "text": "I'm a parent, and here's how I found my university:\n\nIn the days before the internet, students could go to the college counselor's office and look through an entire room of filing cabinets where she collected brochures and pamphlets from various institutions. 3/4 of them were photocopies of photocopies, and the originals were long gone. First semester of my senior year, I figured I should go look, so I trudged up there and plopped down in front of the filing cabinet labeled 'A'. As I sat there for an hour looking through the manila folders of photocopies, I realized this was stupid and pointless. At that moment, I happened to be holding the folder for University of Arizona, and I said fuck it. I took a photocopied paper application from the folder, filled it out, and had my transcript sent there. Months later after I had forgotten about it, I received a letter in the mail offering me full oos tuition and another scholarship that made housing almost free.\n\nAnd that, kids, is the story of how I went to U of A.\n\nThose days are looooong gone. Parents really need to understand how things have changed.\n\nI actually work at a university now, and I see firsthand how complex and arduous the current process is. I think high schools should have a mandatory class for parents of new freshman and again for rising juniors to explain admissions, fit, academic rigor, ECs, hooks, scholarships and financial aid, cost/benefit analysis of student loans/degree prospects, and the dreaded essays. No parent should ever utter, \"Back in my day...\" as a solution to a current problem. Ye olde days of college admissions have passed into the history books.\n\nTLDR Have your parents join A2C (or college confidential if they're afraid of reddit.) It's a whole new world out there.",

          "text": "First generation college student and parent here. Just wanted to say I love your post. I wanted to also add to your post that my old sister and I had completely different college experiences but similar regrets. \n\nMy sister went to a local state college as a commuter student. She paid for everything out of pocket with a part time job, book costs were her biggest stressors. Our parents talked her out of a medical career and insisted she major in business. She graduated with degrees in accounting and marketing, did some temporary office work, and ended up as a international flight attendant for ten years. She became a SAHM after she married and had her first born. \n\nI went to a UC campus, I threatened my parents that if they didn\u2019t pay I wouldn\u2019t attend college at all. They paid for everything but I had to come home on weekends to help them out with housekeeping and babysitting chores. It was stressful but I did graduate and in the major I wanted not the one they wanted. Career wise, I ended up in the financial industry for decades and then I moved to project management and technology roles. \n\nMy sister and I have college age kids now and when we reflect on our youth we wish we had done more and had more freedom. We spent far too much time doing house work, babysitting, and academics and too little time networking and getting work experience in our fields of study. We wonder if we had been boys whether the parental expectations would have been the same? Also our parents didn\u2019t understand how stressful college was and regularly called to share bad news, drop in unannounced, or make physical demands during finals. This just added to our stress levels and created unnecessary distractions. In conclusion parents ideas about college can be widely inaccurate and it\u2019s important to set healthy family boundaries early and often. Make time for networking and getting good work experience before you graduate to be competitive.",

          "text": "We're probably around the same age.  I remember going to the city library and leafing through some big book of college profiles (Fiske, Barron's, Princeton Review, etc.) and writing down schools that \"looked interesting\" based on the subjective description contained therein.  I had heard the names \"Harvard\", \"Yale\" and \"Princeton\" from popular culture, but the other Ivies were more-or-less unknown to me.  I knew about Duke, but only because of the basketball team and TIP.  Those books, plus whatever schools my peers were applying to, are where I got my ideas.\n\nLucky for me my flagship state campus was pretty good, and also very cheap.  Its \"application\" consisted of sending our HS transcript and SAT scores.  That was basically it.\n\nThings aren't that simple anymore, but they're also not as all-consuming as the average high-ability A2C poster portrays them to be.  You don't have to apply to 15 schools.  Heck, you don't have to apply to 5.  You don't have to target T20s.  For the majority of students their flagship state school is fine, meaning you may not need to care that much about ECs, etc. (depending on how strong the rest of your application is, obviously).",

Given the relatively strong reputation of my state flagship, the set of schools that:\n\n1. would admit me, and\n2. sent a stronger signal than my state flagship's, and\n3. were not drastically more expensive,\n\n...was more or less empty.  I was actually admitted to one T20 private, but it was cost prohibitive and tbh I wasn't that excited about it to begin with.  I also had a couple full-COA offers from flagships in nearby states (purely on the basis of my test scores), but there wasn't much to commend them (other than price) over my state's.\n\nIn the end I ended up applying to only three schools:  two T20s and my T40 flagship, which is where I ultimately matriculated.",

If your goal after college is to work at top companies, you need to understand that they don't just exclusively hire from T20s/HYPSM, they hire *anyone* who can pass their hiring bar.

Another important thing to do is to show that you are a critical thinker, show that you go a few steps above the norm to understand certain things and apply yourself. I\u2019m going to be a broken record but essay is extremely important. When it comes to challenges and expectations, be careful where you tread, marginalization and socioeconomic hurdles do matter but what\u2019s really important is usually about personal growth  and development. Also a lot of schools have an application fee so apply to all the scholarships you can, it never hurts to save 10-50k down the line",
