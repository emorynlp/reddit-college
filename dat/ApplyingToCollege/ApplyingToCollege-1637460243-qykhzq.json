I'm struggling with this question because if he is accepted to a school he has no intention of going to, then he is pushing someone to the waitlist. This doesn't really affect his life, but it can greatly affect their's. Some colleges admit students from their waitlist based on the ability of the student to pay. It benefits low-income students to be accepted on the first round because if they are pushed to the waitlist, they have a lower chance of getting in and will likely be offered less aid. Not generalizable to all colleges, but in 65 schools, there's bound to be a few at least. \n\nAnother thing to consider: these acceptance packages are basically trophies to him. There are just going to sit in his room, collect dust, and be thrown away. I don't want to go full environmentalist on this, but it just seems like a waste.\n\nConclusion: it's his right to apply wherever he wants. This is all my opinion. But I wouldn't go as far as to say that it doesn't matter at all.",
