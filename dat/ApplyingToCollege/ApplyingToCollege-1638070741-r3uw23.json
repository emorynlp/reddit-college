  "text": "Hey guys! I'm in 9th grade right now and I *really* want to go to Stanford, I've been on the fence about it for a while but I'm 1000% I want to go now and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get admitted to Stanford specifically. I don't have a GPA yet as the semester isn't over but I'm on track to have a 4.0, keep in mind though that my school doesn't have +/- grades, an 80.00 is considered the exact same as an 89.99 both GPA and report card wise, idk if Stanford calculates GPA differently.\n\nOther then taking practically AP class offered, having a really high weighted/unweighted GPA and not getting a rap sheet, what can I do today to have the best chance possible of getting into Stanford?",

Don\u2019t choose activities because you think it\u2019ll get you into college- chances are it won\u2019t and if you don\u2019t get in you\u2019ll have \u201cwasted\u201d your 4 years. Stop worrying about what colleges want to see and start figuring out what YOU enjoy and pursue those activities to the highest level you can. The college acceptances will come after.",
