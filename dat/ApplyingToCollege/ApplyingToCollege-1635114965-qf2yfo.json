  "text": "Hello all, I'm an international senior who is applying to the US this year for a pre med program. I really slacked off during my first 2 years of high school, since, until then, I was planning on going to college in the country I live in, but, as fate would have it,  I got the opportunity to go study in the US. I have a 2.98 UW GPA, but I take part in the IB program at my school with my higher level subjects being English, Chem and Bio. Would my IB background help counter weight my poor GPA in the grand-scheme of things in the admission process?",
