  "title:": "Princeton Interview!",
  "text": "I just had my Princeton interview. My interviewer was super nice and is from my town so I felt very comfortable with her. It lasted a little under 30 minutes (idk if that\u2019s normal or not) and the majority of the time was me asking her questions about the school.\nHere are the questions I remember being asked for reference:\n\n- why did you decide to apply to Princeton?\n- what are your favorite books/movies/tv shows and why?\n- what do you think are the characteristics of a good leader?\n- if you became president today, what are 3 issues you would address?\n- if you could meet one person, dead or alive, who would it be?\n- what extracurriculars have you taken part in high school?\n- what are some of your strengths and weaknesses?\n- why do you think the admissions committee should accept you?\n\nGood luck to everyone else applying early! This made me even more excited about the school even though I\u2019ll inevitably be rejected lololol",
