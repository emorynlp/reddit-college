  "text": "Hello, as I've started to begin my Junior Year, I have become more and more cognizant of my terribly shit situation. Btw I'm an International Student (Canada). My parents constitute a Triple Threat (Anti-Vaxx, Failing Business, Moving Out of the Country (Saudi Arabia :/) which basically means that my Grades 9-11 will look like this:\n\n\\- No In-Person School (No Advanced Class or Test, Sports, Clubs, access to resources or Guidance Counselor)\n\n\\- Unvaccinated (No access to any non-essential Public Service = Jobs, Gym, Libraries)\n\n\\- Moving Out: 12th Grade will be in Saudi Arabia - Weird Transcript + Can't do any long-term EC in Canada.\n\n\\- Strict Parents: No freedom of mobility (stuck in room). Also, wanted to start Investing as an EC but my parents called it gambling even though I got 3x return on my stock. So I can't use my own money for anything either.\n\nDue to stress from the aforementioned things, my GPA is rather low (2.5) but I know from now I can get near-perfect marks, which will equal to \\~3.5.\n\nI'm planning to start doing stuff in Grade 12 (Advanced Classes, National-Level EC's) but so much time has been wasted I lost almost all hope of remedy.\n\nI'm wondering if the academic checkers (whatever they are called) will understand my unique situation and I'll be given some leniency.\n\nThank you for reading this mess <3 and for advice.",
