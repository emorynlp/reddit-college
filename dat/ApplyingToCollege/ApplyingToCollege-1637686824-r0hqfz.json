      "text": "I'm a student there, yeah should be good, Though it is France so you have to do a master's after your Bachelor's before a PhD, and it's a double major, so you have to take Physics, CS, or Econ on top of maths. I would suggest you contact one of the teachers there to get more info\n\nI know some people went into pure maths, but not a lot. If you really want only maths, then it's probably not the best idea to go into a double major program though.\n\nBefore I applied, I went to see all the courses in each semester. You can see that on synapses . polytechnique . fr (don't know if we're allowed links on this sub) You can click on \"les formations\", Bachelor, and you can see the courses offered for each semester",

In terms of coverage, that would be the bare minimum for a pure math major at my local state university. That doesn't sound like a candidate for a top pure math program to me, but hey, I'm just a rando on the Internet.",
