  "text": "I was a swimmer at the school team (still am technically, but there are no competitions due to the pandemic so no practice), won 11 golds and a silver at the national level (international student btw) freshman and sophomore year. Then the pandemic hit, I got depressed and touch deprived and I coped by eating a shit ton of junk. Now I'm fat. Really fat. So the swimming is an EC that's pretty high up in my EC rank list, but you have a guy in the interview who looks like anything but a swimmer. How bad does it look?",
