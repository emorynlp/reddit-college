      "text": "Many of those schools are in high CS demand and urge students to apply early. Regular applications may find few slots available and higher admissions hurdles. Or even totally closed programs.\n\nI would look at the school\u2019s typical SAT scores and decide whether to send scores or apply TO, but would apply early wherever possible. See if you can find CS SAT scores - they are often higher than the school as a whole, for those admitting by major.\n\nIf you are deferred, you can send an updated higher score, if available, for RD. If you are straight rejected in EA, another 70 points wouldn\u2019t have made a difference.\n\nGeorgia Tech requires scores, so send them.\n\nCornell is EA, not ED, so only apply if you agree to attend there if accepted, and withdraw all other applications.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSample wording for early application:\n\n>The priority deadline for Computer Science is November 1. Priority means we will continue accepting applications after this date only if space allows \u2014 if you are applying after November 1, check the closed programs page on the Office of Admissions website first.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a first year at Georgia Tech and would highly encourage you to apply early. 1) higher OOS EA acceptance rate, 2) chance for scholarships, and 3) essentially 2 chances to get admitted. Lots of my friends were deferred during ea and got in during regular. It\u2019s a waste hit to apply ea for tech and probably most other non binding, non Ivy League schools.",
