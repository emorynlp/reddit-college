  "text": "I got into the college I applied to in ED but the aid I got isn't what I quite wanted. Can I get an extension for accepting their admissions offer not because im interested in other colleges but because I would like to see if I get better aid somewhere else? Or can financial aid packages be further discussed with the college?\n\nedit- \nfor context I am an international student and the package they have provided right now is about 80ish percent.",
