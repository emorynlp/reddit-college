  "text": "Yeah so I moderated for a game server for about a year and I became good friends with the server owner and I was wondering if they're someone I could have write me a college recommendation. I know server modding isn't a real job so I don't know if him writing me a recommendation falls under the employer category but I guess it falls under volunteer work right? This a dumb idea or no?",
