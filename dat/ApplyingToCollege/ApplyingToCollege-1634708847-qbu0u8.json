  "text": "(apologies in advance but I don\u2019t really wanna name specific schools here :0)\n\nman. I\u2019ve been thinking about this my whole life pretty much, but I\u2019m once again torn between visual arts (digital illustration) and STEM (biomedical engineering), and the two schools I have in mind are both places I would like to go... but afaik the STEM one realllly likes ED students and the art one I have a solid chance of getting into anyway. my college counselor said I probably don\u2019t have to worry about the STEM one either, but I\u2019m still concerned.\n\nThe question is whether or not I wanna ED to the school where I\u2019d be trying for biomedical engineering major. I\u2019m applying EA to the art one. Maybe I should just go with regular or a non-binding earlier deadline for the biomed engineering one??? I\u2019m just so hesitant. Pls help; advice appreciated",
