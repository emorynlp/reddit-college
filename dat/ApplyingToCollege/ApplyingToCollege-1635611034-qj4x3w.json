  "title:": "Talk about being unable to attend tuition in common app additional info",
  "text": "So I\u2019m from Asia, currently attending HS there. Where I\u2019m from has an academically rigorous education system and I\u2019m also attending the top school in the region. Competition is VERY intensive, and I know 70%-80% of my classmates rely on some form of tuition from tutors/organisations outside of school to maintain or boost their grades. The thing is, I\u2019m from a low-income family that couldn\u2019t afford these costly tuition fees, so I have to get by on my own. My grades are just above average at school, and getting tuition does often give people an edge in academics. \nHowever, I don\u2019t know if I should include this circumstance in my common app add\u2019l info section, because I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll be perceived as \u201cwhiny\u201d or just blaming something for my grades. So should I state it there?\n(Note: I\u2019m also first gen and from a single parent family, but colleges will know that elsewhere in my applications. But I just don\u2019t think those conditions show the full picture.)\nThanks in advance.",

      "text": "depending on your school profile.  if it's recognizably in a rich area where all the students probably invest a ton of money into tutoring, the unis will know.  AOs probably also know which countries have intense systems and a culture of tutoring.  but it definitely doesnt hurt to mention that your financial situation made it impossible to access help with academics.",
