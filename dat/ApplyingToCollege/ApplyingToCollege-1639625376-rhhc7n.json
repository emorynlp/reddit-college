  "text": "The next few weeks will be the biggest moment of your lives. You\u2019ll be accepted and rejected from numerous schools, and I just want to let you know it will all work out in the end. Receiving college decision letters can be stressful, and it\u2019s important not to beat yourself up over something you don\u2019t have definite control over. \n\nI was in your shoes the previous year, and received numerous rejection letters. I thought my life was crashing and burning; however, it only takes one acceptance to change that. Don\u2019t get your hopes down after your first rejection like I did-you still have more to come. \n\nI know all of you are going to do great things both in and after college, and can\u2019t wait to see what our generation can offer to the world. Merry Christmas and good luck!!!",
