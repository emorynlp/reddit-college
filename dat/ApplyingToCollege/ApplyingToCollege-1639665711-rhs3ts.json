  "text": "Hello everyone..\n\nI don't know where to start this... I'm a medical student who completed 5 years of medschool in a 6 years medical program (MBBS). Since covid-19 started i couldn't go back to the Country i study in to do my final year of a clinical rotations due to Borders restrictions (includes a full year rotation \"52 weeks\" in various hospital departments). \n\nI tried looking and applying to all type of universities, hospitals and colleges.. With no luck at all on finding a solution or getting accepted because simply I'm a student not a graduate, and i can't graduate before i complete this year in a hospital. \n\nIf anyone.. By any chance.. Knows a solution to this problem, I'll be extremely grateful for you.\n\nI'm so broken from the inside, anything that you know and could help, please reply to this or send me a dm or anything.\n\nI'm in need for this as it's been two years since i got stuck in my country.\n\nThank you so much in advance.",
