      "text": "So far haven\u2019t seen a comment suggesting this, the alternative. As a high school senior I imagine the rejections hurt feelings (if you were very interested in the college) and if not, pride nonetheless. \n\nBut I hope as you go through college, grow older, and mature you will not take rejections personally. All that a rejection is is \u201cnot the right fit at this time\u201d. (In fact, for high volume applications, it might just be bad luck). Instead, take the opportunity for the summer school as just another experience which might be fruitful. Or not, that\u2019s your decision, but consider it for the opportunity regardless, even if just for a second. \nIn 4-5 years if you are applyihn to grad programs and Columbia is one of the sensible choices for what you want, will you not apply just because they rejected you 4 years ago? Or if you do and get in, will you turn it down JUST because they rejected you 4 years ago? \n\nIt\u2019s not personal, don\u2019t make it. \n\nGood luck with the rest of the decisions, and college wherever you go!",
