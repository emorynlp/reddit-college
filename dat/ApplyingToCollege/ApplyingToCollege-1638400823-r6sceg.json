  "text": "Hey, I\u2019m looking to apply to Penn, I currently work at Penn medicine and love it. Would it be worth mentioning this in maybe one of the supplements asking about the community outside of Penn of course along with other things? I don\u2019t know how much correlation there is between the hospital system and the university. I am close with a few surgeons there that are involved in research if that means anything.\n\nThank you!",
