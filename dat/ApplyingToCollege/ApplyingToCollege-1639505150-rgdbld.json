      "text": "From prior stuff written on subs, i would say that its not worth it.\n\nThere are far better and cheaper institutions than Hult. In that regard, from the complaints listed it appears that they ask for an extreme amount of money for a degree with very little value.\n\nSince you have a TOEFL im guessing you\u2019re an international. I would advise you to check KU Leuven, and perhaps some other institutions in Finland and Sweden.\n\nIf you\u2019re really set in going to the US you could do a Reverse Chance me with a more complete profile\u2026",
