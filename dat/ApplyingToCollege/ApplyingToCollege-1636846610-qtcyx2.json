  "text": "I'm planning on putting NMSF on my UC app, which gives room for a pretty lengthy description of your awards, including what you did to achieve them. However, I don't know what else to put except \"I did well on my PSAT and now I'm a SF.\" Should I try to give a more in-depth description (e.g. how long I studied for, what the competition requirements are), or should I keep it brief and assume they know what being a NMSF entails? I don't want to be too vague and undersell myself, but I also don't want to come across as pretentious by providing a lengthy explanation for a relatively well-known award.",
