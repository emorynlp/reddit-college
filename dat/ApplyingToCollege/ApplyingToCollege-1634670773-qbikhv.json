I made them take the day off from college stuff and just chill/eat snacks/play video games. You don't need permission to cry or to have a bad day. Give yourself some grace and treat yourself with the same gentleness that you'd show a friend in the same situation. Sometimes we have to be our own caretakers. <3",

I have 2 kids in college now and I kept telling them it\u2019s okay to NOT be okay\u2026.the whole college application process is extremely stressful and overwhelming. Plus we\u2019ve had the pandemic to live through, another stressor. I feel for all you young people who were supposed to be starting to break away from your parents & forge your own way, and your wings got clipped by Covid. Please don\u2019t give up hope - and don\u2019t bow to pressure from your parents or anyone else. It will all work out eventually if you just keep trying. I should know\u2026 my home life was very unhappy\u2026.I failed out my freshman year of college.\nIt took a while but I got my act together, went back to college, and became a successful teacher and a parent to 2 kids who know they can count on me. \nI broke the cycle of dysfunction and you can too.\nGive yourself the love & care your parents should have given you\u2026.that\u2019s the secret to overcoming a bad childhood. This is kind of a long rambling reply, but this tiny portion of your life will not matter much when you grow up.",
