In my Midwestern community that is clearly not the case. My parents\u2019 friends have been calling and texting. Everyone I know has been congratulating me whenever they see me. My history teacher straight-up told me I was smarter than he was. I feel like a minor celebrity. It\u2019s a great feeling.\n\nIn other news, I won a really close racquetball match for my team, and my Mock Trial coach says that the southern accent I\u2019m trying to do for a witness role is convincingly Georgian. Also, someone told me this cute guy in my math class is acting like he has a crush on me, and now I\u2019ve been noticing that he\u2019s been hanging onto my every word, and laughing at my jokes when they aren\u2019t even funny.\n\nWHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE!",
