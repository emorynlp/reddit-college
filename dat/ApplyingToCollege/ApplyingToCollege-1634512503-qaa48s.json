  "text": "I went to the same school as my brother and he wasn't the best student(plagiarism, bad grades, etc), and created a lot of trouble for the staff, however, I was not attending the school when this occurred.\n\nFast forward to recently, after I completed my EA application and asked everyone for LoRs for one of the school's I really want to go to, I asked my parents to look over my application and they yelled at me for \"choosing\"(our school assigns counselors to students ccording to their last initial) a counselor to write a LoR for me who dealt with a lot of the issues my brother caused and therefore should hate me as well and will write a bad LoR as a result\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven though it wasn't like I had a choice about which person should write an LoR for me(ig I could've not asked initially since the school didn't require a counselor letter of recommendation, but some schools require counselor LoR so it's unavoidable to some extent), is it really likely that they would hold things I had no association with against me and possibly screw my chances of getting accepted to the colleges/programs I really want to get into?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough many teachers often call me by my brother's name from time to time, I am much different than my brother, I have never gotten in trouble with the staff, involved in various clubs, am fairly well known and liked by other people in my class, and I am a really good student (actually should have been #1 if it weren't for a transfer students who had come in with APs before the school even offered college-level courses; btw, IMO it is fucked up that it is possible for a transfer or other students of that range to be able to get Valedictorian and other titles and leave students who actually went to the school for its entire duration and taken all the hardest classes possible to get left in the dust but oh well). Anyways, what do y'all think?",
