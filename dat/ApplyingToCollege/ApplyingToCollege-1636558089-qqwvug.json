  "text": "Basically title. I am very close to my schools athletics manager, and he is willing to write great references for me. However, I\u2019ve heard from a couple of sources that your LoR\u2019s should come from a teacher in the STEM division and a teacher from the humanities division. Is there anything wrong (and could lower my chances) with getting a reference from a teacher who is not involved in academics?",
