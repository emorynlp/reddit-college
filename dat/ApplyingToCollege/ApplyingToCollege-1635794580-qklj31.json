  "text": "hey y'all! I submitted my MIT application last night, and the recommenders portion of the application said that no matter how the recommenders choose to submit their letters, I should put their info down anyway so they can match the letter to my application. I put my teachers into the portal, and I got an email from one of them asking if there was anything additional they needed to submit. They don't need to do anything extra if the letter is already submitted in Naviance or SchooLinks, right?",
