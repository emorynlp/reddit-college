Hell, I helped over a dozen classmates with high school work, that all got into Ohio State.\n\nIt had something to do with me not having some random prereq that I missed in freshman year, because I was an out of state transfer student in 10th grade (a shop or an art credit of some sort that honors students don't go out of their way to take).  They wanted me to fulfill it with summer school, then I would good to go.  LOL, I said \"fuck you\" to Ohio State and chose one of the other schools (and have been much better off for it, so it worked out well in the end).",
