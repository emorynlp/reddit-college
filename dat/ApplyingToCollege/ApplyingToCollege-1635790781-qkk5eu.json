  "title:": "Will not doing the optional essay for Purdue hurt my chances?",
  "text": "I\u2019m applying to Purdue and trying to get my essays done before the early deadline tonight, and am wondering if I really need to do the optional essay. Between my other required essays and my general overall profile (Full IB student, 3.94 UW GPA, am part of many clubs and on the board of a few technology clubs), I feel like I already have a solid shot so if it can\u2019t hurt me by not doing it I think I\u2019ll leave it. I\u2019m applying for CS btw.",
