  "text": "I don't mean about rejection/acceptance, but just the fact that we're going to college. \n\nIt all feels like it happened so fast. I didn't even enjoy high school as I am one of the loner kids. And then the whole pandemic made it flash forward even more. \n\nI feel like I'm at a decent point though, doing well academically and I have an awesome girlfriend that I've been with for a year. But even the thought that I'll possibly move away from her is really depressing to me. \n\nIt's just a little jarring and I wish it had happened less suddenly and at a better time for me. Anyone feel the same? :/ edit: lol I'm sitting here crying on the train",
