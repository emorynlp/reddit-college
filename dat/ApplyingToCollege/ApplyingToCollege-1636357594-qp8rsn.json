  "text": "I\u2019ve been hearing people have been getting interviews from Stanford. I sent my application out before the due date, I haven\u2019t been notified about a interview. Does this mean I won\u2019t get it, and if you do get one, does this mean they\u2019re interested? \n\nIf anyone knows, please let me know!\nBtw I live in Los Angeles.",
