  "text": "so my rea school (stanford) is releasing decisions later and honestly i\u2019m most likely gonna get rejected. i was at peace w the fact that i was gonna get rejected and was kinda excited bc i was going to see spider-man tmrw but guess what happened this morning. i got diagnosed w covid. my smell and taste is gone, i\u2019m probably getting rejected from my dream school later, and i can\u2019t even see the biggest movie of the year tmrw. currently loving life!! (also disclaimer: i am vaccinated so i don\u2019t feel as sick as i would be if i weren\u2019t but i still feel horrible)\n\nupdate: i\u2019ve officially gotten rejected i rlly cannot catch a break today i swear",

I\u2019m thriving here with both a great academic and social life which I likely wouldn\u2019t have had at Stanford. \n\nI believe in you OP, let me know if you need any other help in your admissions process this year.",
