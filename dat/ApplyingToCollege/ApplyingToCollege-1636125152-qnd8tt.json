  "text": "i know this doesn\u2019t really help with college apps, but i was curious on whether or not HSS is worth attending to get a feel for the campus and the actual experience in itself. i\u2019m fortunate enough to say that money and time isn\u2019t a huge concern for me in this case and if i were to apply, i would do the shorter option so i can still squeeze in some stuff for the summer.",

      "text": ">the actual experience in itself\n\nThe \"actual experience\" is not indicative of Harvard during the academic year. The only students on campus are those involved with HSS, and only a small percentage of them are Harvard students. Additionally, while some courses are taught by Harvard faculty, most are not.\n\nWhile there are valid reasons to attend HSS and pay a hefty price tag to do so, getting the experience is not one of them.",
