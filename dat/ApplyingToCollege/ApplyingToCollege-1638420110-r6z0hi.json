  "text": "Before anyone says that covid is not an excuse, let me just say: it is. in this case.\n\nOur final exams got cancelled because of covid, and we were graded on internals, which were absolutely biased. Entrance exams got cancelled as well. But thankfully i managed to get in a good college that DID conduct entrance exams, but its far away from home. \n\nThis is so unfair. People who never gave a shit about the good colleges are now enjoying their privileges. guess it does pay off to be a teachers pet. and please dont come at me with \"this is the real world\" \" life is unfair\", dude i know, but it doesnt help. \n\nHow can i get over something i have been looking forward to all my school life???",
