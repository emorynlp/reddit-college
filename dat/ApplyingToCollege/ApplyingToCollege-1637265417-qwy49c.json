  "text": "Hi so my Teacher Recommendation letters and Transcript shows up on my MIT application status page but an additional supplemental letter my coach did send isn\u2019t.  Is this just because the teacher letters and transcript are required while the supplemental is not so it doesn\u2019t show up on the checklist? Thanks",
