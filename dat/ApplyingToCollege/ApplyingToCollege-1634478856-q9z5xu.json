  "text": "How much do predicted IB scores matter for ED American universities? I\u2019ve read different opinions online and I\u2019m really dying to know. My school has a grading system (A*=4.3, A=4, B=3, and so on) with a predicted grade system. I\u2019m also from an international school if that helps. Thank you so much!",

If colleges do consider em, they\u2019re not going to make or break your application unless it\u2019s drastically different, and won\u2019t matter more than a semester report card. Ofc I\u2019m just a student as well so take this with a grain of salt",

      "text": "They actually matter quite a lot. It\u2019s the opposite w UK unis - they\u2019ll simply use your PGs to make sure there isn\u2019t a decline and you\u2019re on track w grades, but they give you conditional offers where you\u2019re essentially accepted as long as your final grade hits a certain score. The US gives you primarily unconditional offers, though, which means that they\u2019ll treat your IB PG as your final grade. It ends up being integral in your app as a whole. Just for context, I\u2019m an IB student in DP 2 this year.",
