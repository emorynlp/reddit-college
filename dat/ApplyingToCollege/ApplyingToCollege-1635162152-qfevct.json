  "text": "Greetings!\n\ni am applying to Cornell under the Early decision program. The deadline is by November 1, but my counselor has not yet submitted his recommendation. Will it be fine if he submits after November 1?\n\nI am also applying for financial aid, so is the deadline for CSS profile by November 1 too? I want to submit my CSS profile, but I cant quite afford the application fee. I have requested for a fee waiver by mail to the college,, but they haven't responded yet... What should I do?",

Even if you\u2019re an exceedingly strong applicant who they really want to admit, you will be deferred to the RD round so they can determine whether they can meet your financial need AFTER they have admitted all the need-blind domestic students and met those applicants\u2019 financial need.",
