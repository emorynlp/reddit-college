  "text": "asking for a friend (her parents won't let her use reddit)\n\nmy friend would like to apply ed to cornell, but she got a 1330 on her first sat. She ultimately got a 1550 after taking the test 4 times (1330, 1420, 1450, 1550) but since cornell doesn't do score choice, she is a bit nervous about how they will see her score. Is she ok or will it be detrimental for her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbtw she has a 3.95 and took coaching before writing all her sats (she just had a bad day, her dog died the day before the first test) she is also an ISEF finalist and is her school's MUN president (basically shes an amazing person and did a lot in high school)",
