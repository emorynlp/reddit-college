  "text": "I\u2019ve sent like 4 different applications to 4 different colleges. All of them I\u2019ve been accepted to. But I made a mistake on extra circulars. I assumed a lot of things and used an older version of my student resume :/ like, I wrote down I was a two year member of NHS ASSUMING I would get in this year. But I haven\u2019t been inducted yet. I wrote down I was a two year captain of the wrestling team ASSUMING I get voted to be the senior captain this year. But that\u2019s not even official and could realistically not even happen. Then, on top of that, I wrote down I was a captain of the football team because I honest to god thought I was. Turns out, my coach didn\u2019t think so (btw hurts to hear that) and told me not to put that after I already applied. After the season ended. Just, it\u2019s all honest mistakes and I have been emailing and calling schools the last two days and have practically lived in my counselors office and it\u2019s just been so stressful because I havent gotten anything back yet from these universities and just it\u2019s killing me because my applications could be revoked and what not and it\u2019s literally KILLINGFGGSG me\n\nWhat do I do now :/",
