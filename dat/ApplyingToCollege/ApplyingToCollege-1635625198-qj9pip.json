  "text": "i\u2019m not a low income student and my parents saw that the NPC said we\u2019re not likely to get any aid but i was still gonna do the FAFSA because it\u2019s free... then i realized last night that the CSS is also required for a lot of the schools i\u2019m applying to and that it costs monEY\u2014 if i\u2019m very unlikely to get aid, i don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it to spend money for the CSS. so is it ok to answer yes to the financial aid question on each college and just submit the FAFSA? would my admission chances be affected or would i just not get any financial aid?\n\nalso first post on reddit after lurking on here :)",

Your admissions probably won\u2019t get hurt but if you would get like $1,000 for sending it I would send it. The cost of the CSS is much lower than the application fee.",
