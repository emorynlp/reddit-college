  "text": "I am an indian student applying for intl admissions to uiuc through myillini portal this year. I have some questions about the process tho:\n\n1. Where is the place to self report my predicted scores? \n2. How do i invite my counselor on there to send my official transcripts and such to the UIUC?\n3. Since I am an indian student studying in the CBSE pattern, what do i put in the GPA section? Do i turn my GPA into the weighted or unweighted? BEcause on my trascripts it is only given as the final percentage.",
