  "text": "I'm sure the teachers I asked didn't hate me, but still sometimes I think that maybe I was too annoying or didn't participate enough in their class. I also keep thinking that those are the things that'll cause me to be rejected from all my schools even though that's dumb and probably not going to happen. How do you guys stop thinking about this kind of stuff? plz help ;-;",

I like my english teacher so I'll probably ask them to write it but I want to study stem and my math and chem teachers are terrible. Also one of my parents teach me physics(my favorite subject) but I can't ask them obviously.",

The worst they can do is bunch you in with the rest of the students and give you a less than subpar LOR; but that problem can easily be fixed if you have a presence in their class/they know you more personally than they would others.\n\nEither way, you\u2019ll be fine, you got this! I\u2019m sure they must have 2/3 good things to say about you\n\n(And if you feel like you don\u2019t, maybe reconsider who\u2019s writing)",
