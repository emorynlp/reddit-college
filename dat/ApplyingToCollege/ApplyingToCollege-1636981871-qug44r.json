      "text": "Some schools do legitimately fake the numbers. However, most do not need to since they can bias the number anyway.\n\nYou can define \"undergrads\" to just be students in the College and SEAS (but not General Studies nor Barnard -- even though all of these are in-class together) as Columbia does. You can also waitlist almost everyone, see who does not stay on the list (likely got admitted elsewhere) and then go through the waitlist and tell students they could get an offer... if they are likely to accept it. Thus you hand out far fewer acceptances, as Wash U and others do. You can even take students off of the waitlist according to who can pay -- because \"need blind\" only applies to your initial offers of admission. You can also encourage everyone to apply even though they are unlikely to get in (as UChicago and WashU do) You can even count even filling out an inquiry for information as the start of an application (and thus an applicant) as Minerva does.\n\nIf you want to admit students but not mess with your reported (fall) acceptance rate, you can do much more. You can admit some students in Spring (with a semester abroad first semester in which students are not officially registered and thus not fall admits) as Northeastern does. You can offer students transfer admission guaranteed if their GPA after one year is sufficient as numerous schools do.",

(Raise the denominator)\n-methods-\nHuge advertising/ direct mail campaign\nMassive merit scholarships, etc\n\u2018Easy\u2019 application process- no extra essays, no fees, no scores (in a normal year), waived LOR\n\nCan someone else verify if the \u2018pre-applications\u2019 I see floating around count as applications even if you don\u2019t follow through? I think they do. \n\nWorking the waitlist. Some schools do this for internal reasons- UNC has been known to hit the in-state waitlist to avoid getting penalized for too many oos students. Other schools use it similar to ED in reverse. Admit the students in your target range you think are most likely to come, then waitlist a huge number. Yield protection strategy. Tufts comes to mind. \n\nSpring admission or guaranteed transfer or admit to regional campus instead of main. Can anyone verify if \u2018Global Start/Global Launch\u2019 (first semester abroad) counts for this strategy? I know it helps with fall housing crunch.",
