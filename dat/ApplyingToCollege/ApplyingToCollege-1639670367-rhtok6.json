      "text": "Both of mine were 800. You don't have to write that much but if you have a lot you want to say, it definitely helps. Sometimes an essay is as good as it is concise. Really depends. The topics and length give you a good opportunity to flesh out what you want and why. They're looking for that desire. Happy writing!",

I think you should just focus on writing enough to sufficiently answer the prompts and forget about the limit. I\u2019m p sure they put that in so you feel like you have enough freedom to express your thoughts.",
