      "text": "Payment occurs before the app is actually submitted. Do not wait until the literal last minute - you WILL be late and then you will come here asking if it will be ok. (For most colleges, yes, it will be ok, but do you really need that stress when you can avoid it?) It takes time to do the little steps involved in submitting. There's an electronic signature page, where you need to check a bunch of boxes, etc. And of course payment. And, if the college's writing supplement is a separate submission, another electronic signature.",
