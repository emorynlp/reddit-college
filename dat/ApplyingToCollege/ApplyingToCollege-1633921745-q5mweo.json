  "title:": "Can someone help me with a scholarship essay?",
  "text": "Hello, I've been working on a scholarship essay and the prompt just says, \" Explain how receiving a scholarship will assist you in achieving your education and career goals. Please limit your response to 3000 characters (\\~500 words).\" \n\nI've been working on this essay for HOURS and have been able to condense it to 540 and 3,397 characters (with spaces). \n\nI am getting flustered trying to edit this more without losing the meaning. I'm hoping someone else's eyes can help me meet the essay limits. If you can help, I would greatly appreciate it!",
