  "text": "Hi guys so I\u2019m super upset my counselor forgot to submit part of my transcripts to all of my schools. It doesn\u2019t matter as much for RD but all of my early action results are now delayed/deferred to RD. None of my applications showed that anything was missing because they did receive half of my transcripts, so I couldn\u2019t have done anything before hand. Since this was an error out of my control it doesn\u2019t reflect bad on me but it\u2019s still super annoying and just another hindrance to this whole college process. \n\nI\u2019m obviously super frustrated but was wondering if I could receive some advice on how to handle this? I contacted my early action schools and talked to them on the phone just to clarify what happened/ask for next steps.\n\nI also got deferred to RD due to my incomplete app from Fordham. Fordhams one of my top schools at the moment and I\u2019m super bummed out about it. I\u2019m worried about the acceptance rate now and it being more competitive (even though it is a target school for me) since I\u2019m applying to a more competitive major at the Lincoln Center campus. \n\nOnce again any advice would be great. Happy holidays everyone and congrats to those who got accept ED/EA!!!",
