      "text": "Same boat here! I had my Barnard interview earlier - it was similar to a job interview except for the way they attempted to assess my learning style. Barnard asked about how I learn in/out the classroom - Columbia (CC, can't speak for SEAS) will presumably ask about the core. Good luck!! I'm nervous about mine as well.",
