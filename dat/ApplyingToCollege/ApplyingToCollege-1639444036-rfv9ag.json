  "text": "So, I'm planning to finish my college list in the next few months but I'm having trouble figuring out in which place I really am. I would like to know from you here where a person with a low GPA and good SAT can be placed. But before getting to this question, I'm going to talk a little about my case.  \n\n\nI study at a private school in Brazil, so as you can see I am an international student. I'm one of the best students in my class and I've never had problems related to grades or school in general, however, since I started making my college in the US list I've been having some concerns. Basically, my school's grading system goes from 0 to 100, and my semester grades usually end between 87 and 91. In my school, as in most schools in Brazil, any grade above 80 is generally considered to be good. My class has about 200 people and a person with an average grade of 91 is fully capable of being ranked among the best 10 in school, and the 1st one in ranking is usually no higher than 95 (my school has stopped ranking in the pandemic tho, so I don't know what my ranking is).  \n\n\nThe problem is that while my grades are good here, they're not that good when converted to an American GPA. As an international student, I don't have to submit my GPA in the common app, but it doesn't change much since I'll still have to submit my grades anyway. It doesn't matter if an 88 is a good grade here, in the US it's still a B, and a semestral grade based on test grades like that will end up in a below-average GPA. To give a better idea, my GPA at the moment is something close to 3.4, and I say it's close to that as it varies depending on how I calculate it (I'm really not sure about it since it does vary depending on the way I calculate it).  \n\n\nNow, about standardized tests. I know a guy with grades similar to mine who managed to get 1530 on SAT. I've taken two SAT practice tests now and I didn't find it hard, so I think with a little study in the next few months I may also manage to get a really good grade on it.  \n\n\nNow that I've said a little about my case, I would like to know: on a scale that goes from most people's safeties to dream schools, where am I? This is a question that has been worrying me a little lately. I don't know a good SAT score is enough to compensate for a not that good GPA, and I myself see very contradictory cases on the internet in this regard. I know some people might say it depends a lot, which I really understand as I'm not even considering any extracurriculars at the moment that I know matter so much.  \n\n\nBut at the moment, I would like to base this question only on my numbers because they often determine if your application will at least be read and if you qualify for that university.  \n\n\nSo, an international student with a GPA of 3.4 and an SAT of 1500-ish is in what range? Is it reasonable for me to apply to some of my dream schools or should I just focus on safeties? If you can answer this question with some school names as examples that you think I have a chance it would be really helpful\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f!",

      "text": "How much aid you\u2019re gonna need is gonna matter a lot as an international \n\nIf you can pay full or mostly full tuition at most places, you will be fine. A 3.4 and a 1500 (if you can pull it off) is very respectable, and while it probably won\u2019t get you into t20\u2019s (unless you have some crazy ec\u2019s like the guy who created the COVID tracker), you could have a reach shot at t50\u2019s and of course even better below (which are all fantastic schools). \n\nIf you\u2019re one of the assortment of internationals on here who are asking for full aid and have a 0 EFC you are gonna be in a very tough spot, you\u2019d have to look for LAC\u2019s that say they\u2019ll cover 100% of financial need and pray for the best. There\u2019s a Google sheet on here I can find that has a list of schools that are generous with aid for internationals if you\u2019re one of these people.\n\nAlso for the record they look at how you\u2019ve done compared to other people in your school, so they\u2019ll see that your 3.4 is different than other students 3.4",

      "text": "Don't try to convert your GPA in that way - the standards vary so much by school and country that you cant really make that comparison.  The admissions officer for your region will be aware of the grading system, and your school counselor can also provide info that puts your grades in the context of your school.\n\nIf you want an idea for safety school standards, Iowa State is a good example that's a major research university but isn't particularly selective. They publish what they consider the  equivalent to a US 3.0 GPA for most countries as a minimum standard - for Brazil, that's a 70% grade.\n\nYou shouldn't have much trouble getting into T100 ish public universities in the US (U of Arizona, U of Oregon, Arizona State, would be a few others), and can absolutely aim at schools like Ohio State, Wisconsin, Rutgers, Penn State (top 40-60 or so) or even at more selective schools.\n\nThis assumes you can afford the cost of attendance - if you need financial aid that would have a bigger impact on your list.",
