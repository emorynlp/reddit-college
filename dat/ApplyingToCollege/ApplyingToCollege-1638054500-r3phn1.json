  "text": "My birthday is coming up (on Monday) and it kind of sucks because both this year and last year it was overshadowed by anxiety. Last year I was taking the SAT less than a week later, and this year my ED decision comes out 2 weeks after. Birthdays were already disappointing for me but now they\u2019re stressful too and it\u2019s the worst feeling.\n\nLove my life\ud83e\udd2a",
