  "title:": "I have zero academic or athletic achievements and a 3.4 GPA. I\u2019m undecided as to whether I should apply for the spring semester or just hold off until the fall. Can I get some advice?",
  "text": "The deadline for the college I\u2019m hoping to get into (Texas State) is November 15 and once admissions are closed for the semester, they won\u2019t be open again until late summer for the Fall 2022 semester.\n\nI have yet to take my SAT or ACT and while I would prefer to the take the ACT, the next testing date isn\u2019t until November 30. There are, however, upcoming testing dates for the SAT, but I\u2019m reluctant to take it given that\u2014 for whatever reason\u2014I got a significantly better score on the ACT practice test than I did on the SAT practice test. I know it can\u2019t hurt to try and that I can always retake it but I\u2019d like more than just a satisfactory score as I\u2019m really hoping to win a scholarship. Furthermore, I feel like no matter how much I study, I just can\u2019t seem to grasp the concepts / formulas in regards to the math section. \n\nI have zero academic or athletic achievements and a 3.4 GPA so even with a poor SAT score, I\u2019d imagine my chances of being accepted are rather slim. \n\nWhat should I do? Should I just take the SAT and submit it so long as I get a satisfactory score or would it be best if I just held off on all of this until the Fall?\n\nI\u2019d like to add that applying to other colleges would be my last choice as I\u2019m reluctant to relocate and Texas State is the only college within driving distance (all others are at least 30 minutes away, and even that\u2019s on a good day). I\u2019m unsure if this makes any difference but their acceptance rate is 81% and their \u2018typical\u2019 SAT scores are 510-600 for reading & writing and 500-580 for math.",

Also if u were to hold off until fall that would give you a LOT of time to get ur sat scores up. Like 5 months time. You are above average for the average GPA admissions.",
