  "text": "I\u2019m an international student, and when I asked my school official for the name of the classes I\u2019m taking this semester (second semester), they said that the official course name is yet to be finalized and they couldn\u2019t provide that to me. However, I already have the name of classes I took in the 1st semester and most classes I\u2019m taking in 2nd semester are the same (but prob with slightly different name/suffix).\n\nSo, in my UC application and CommonApp, should I only list the name of classes I took in the first semester and explain the situation in the add\u2019l info? Or should I put unofficial name in?\n\nThank you so much \ud83d\ude0a",
