  "text": "Hey guys, I\u2019m an intl student, and my school gives marks on a 0-10 scale. When I was checking the \u201cofficial\u201d percentage to letter conversion, I found it to be quite unfair. Basically I\u2019m the 3rd best of my class and I have around a 8.5/10, which would give a \u201cB\u201d. I was wondering if I should convert it anyways or leave the grade as it is. I\u2019m just kind of worried how the universities will view my grades.",
