      "text": "it's usually a lot more chill than you might imagine! have a few thoughts prepared -- why you like their school, why you applied, and be ready to elaborate on some of your extracurriculars. also make sure you've got a couple of questions ready. besides that, the interviewer will mostly guide the convo and all you have to do is talk about yourself and your passions! good luck :)",

      "text": "Don't sweat it.  It's just a chat.  MIT ECs don't have any questions they are required to ask, and realistically the interview doesn't factor all that much into the admissions decision (I suppose unless you are rude to the interviewer or bomb it spectacularly.  But it really needs to be spectacular then). \n\nIf you've done any classes or projects outside of school, be prepared to talk about that, because this is something that can set you apart from the others.  If you have any visual aids, feel free to show things, too.",

      "text": "The best way to answer a question is with a story about yourself. Think of lots of little stories about you that represent who you are and what's important to you. That way you can pull them out as they fit the questions. DO NOT memorize them. They just need to be accessible -- like in a little invisible backpack!\n\nI just made a post about the interview.
