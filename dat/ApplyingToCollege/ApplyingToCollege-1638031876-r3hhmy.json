  "text": "Just had my MIT interview! It could\u2019ve went better but it could\u2019ve gone a lot worse! He asked two questions (tell me about yourself and why mit) and went just based off my answers. I couldn\u2019t fit in a lot of the things I wanted to say but I didn\u2019t stumble that much so W. I talked for about 20 min and then asked questions for the next 20 min. Idk I\u2019m glad it\u2019s over with tbh, sigh now can\u2019t wait to get deferred. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude01",
