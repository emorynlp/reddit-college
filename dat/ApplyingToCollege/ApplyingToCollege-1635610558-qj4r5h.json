  "text": "My kid applied to a school last weekend and got an acceptance yesterday. Applying to small, non T-50 schools is very different from applying to highly competitive schools. So there's hope for the regular folks going to regular schools, as opposed to the overachievers out there.\n\nGood luck to everyone, whatever kind of schools are on your list.",

I think a lot of the kids applying on this sub see the other people all talking about the T50 schools and end up feeling a bit inadequate.\nMany many people are just going to perfectly good middle of the road schools. Hang in there, I know it seems like the biggest deal on the planet right now, it's really going to be ok.\n\n-Parent of an average student probably going to an average state school.",
