  "text": "I just submitted my application to a UPenn through commonapp.\n\nNow what?? I'm at the document submitting phase, I think, but have no idea where to submit these or how to track my admission process.\n\nI have a lot of documents to submit (SAT, IELTS, CSS, transcript, and more... I'm an international student btw)) , and I'm sure there are some that I am not aware of right now.\n\nI went to the university website but there's no \"Portal\" like Canadian Universities have. If I send the official score reports, how do I know if the university received it?\n\nDo I start sending documents after I receive an email to verify that my application was received by the university?\n\nI am so confused and lost right now, I would appreciate your help so, so much...\n\nTHis is my first time applying and there's absolutely no one around me to ask for advice... except you guys",
