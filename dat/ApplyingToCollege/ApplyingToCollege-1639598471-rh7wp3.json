  "text": "I'm filling out the CSS form as an international applicant and it is very confusing. My parents don't know English so I'm filling it out and there are so many things I cannot directly translate/apply in my country. Thus, rather than getting the documents and writing an exact number, I'm filling it in with average numbers my parents have knowledge of, so it probably will not be the exact same with the numbers written in documents but close. Does CSS or colleges really ask for documents? I don't even know what documents to collect so I don't know what to do. Anyone applying from turkey pls tell me what you did.",
