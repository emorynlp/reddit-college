It is largely based on essays and scores at this institution though.\n\nYeah, that happens a lot for enrollment. I haven\u2019t had any issue since I have junior enrollment standing due to my dual enrollment classes, so my experience isn\u2019t really normal. That being said, it\u2019s great to have upperclassman friends for that reason. Classes fill up super fast: the whole political science department fills up during first pass (earlier, max 10 units of enrollment) and the easiest writing requirement class fills up during regents / senior pass, for reference. But I\u2019ve had no problem getting into all my classes.",

However, most people don\u2019t talk about their accomplishments - it really takes getting to know someone to figure out more about them academically. I never have felt pressured to pick up more activities on anything other than my own volition. When I talked about college apps with my friends, everyone was more or less unsurprised at what everyone said: even though some of us didn\u2019t have test scores, it\u2019s clear that everyone admitted deserves to be there. \n\nThat being said: When I was interviewing for the extremely competitive management consulting clubs (~200-300 applicants, 10 taken at most), I definitely noticed the competitiveness of the environment in group settings where you\u2019re basically meant to brag. I remember there was this girl that had worked with Steven Spielberg on a documentary, and just decided to throw that out there during the group interview. So definitely in that sense, some people do some crazy things.\n\nPersonally, college has made me enjoy life a lot more, and I\u2019ve been a lot more socially oriented than academically. It also helps that I\u2019m not necessarily in a major where GPA matters a lot: since I\u2019m in CS, I\u2019m only aiming for a 3.5 since anything past that is (tbh) a waste of time: the time is better spent working on projects. So I care a lot less about my grades than my premed friends for example. \n\nLet me know if there\u2019s anything I didn\u2019t answer or if you have any other question!",

In attending, I picked up pretty quickly what\u2019s consistently good and what\u2019s not, but I\u2019m a \u201cfoodie\u201d so I\u2019m probably a lot more  picky than others. A few things are always great:\n1) Seafood, anywhere. They prepare their seafood so well: seafood pasta, seared tuna, cooked salmon and trout, etc \n2) Steak: The brisket/tri tip is always good, and so is the normal steak. I\u2019ve never had it extremely over cooked or undercooked.\n3) Tofu: They cook their tofu super well, and the sauces are great. \n4) Pasta: 8 times out of 10, (and 10 times out of 10 at a specific dining hall, Epicuria/Covel), the pasta is great. Absolutely no complaints: reminds me of restaurant quality pasta. \n5) THE DESSERTS: they\u2019re absolutely godly. I\u2019m still mad that the shittiest (imo) dining hall has the best desserts.",

          "text": "thanks for your questions!\n1) personally yes. all my expenses are around $25k per year which is still astronomically less then a private institution of the same caliber. dorms and apartments off campus are a similar price as well, and ucla\u2019s tuition being so low really does make up for it. for me and my financial situation, a UC is the only T20 I\u2019d be able to attend. So again, yes. \n\n\n2) it really surprised me how normal everyone is. sometimes you can tell someone\u2019s academic accomplishment based on their instagram if they decide to post that, but largely, everyone\u2019s normal. for example, my roommate is exceedingly normal - it wasn\u2019t until i got to know him well that it was kind of explained how he got into ucla and ucsd with the shores scholarship, among other places. another one of my friends got into penn, usc iya, and a few other places. but everyone is really happy to be where they are and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any resentment about ending up where they did, even if they got into a \u201cbetter\u201d institution. nobody really talks about academic accomplishments; everyone\u2019s just there to have a good time and not stress out too much about their classes and schoolwork (at least the ppl ik). also the traditions\u2013undie run, midnight yell, roebling block party\u2013are all super fun and add to the student life (which is highly ranked for a reason). most of my friends were like ehhh i have work to do i don\u2019t really want to go but eventually if they go they\u2019re always like \u201cdamn this is so much fun.\u201d the campus is also pretty split into the residential portion and actual campus, so nobody wants to go between them if you don\u2019t need to. as such, there\u2019s a lot of walking: we\u2019re called the university of calves, legs, and ass for a reason. \n\n\n3) Super easy, as long as you have course space. You can take basically whatever you want and minor / double major in whatever you want.",
