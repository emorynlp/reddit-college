      "text": "There are two kinds of SAT tests.\n\n1. **SAT 1, the \"main\" SAT:** These are still very much relevant. It's just been made optional in light of the pandemic, as some students are unable to safely take the test. The exam assess your reading, writing, and mathematics skills over 4 sections (but it's one exam).\n\n2. **SAT 2, the SAT Subjects:** These are being discontinued. These were exams you'd have to take for some universities that asked for it. They were offered for many subjects, and you would have to choose which ones to sit (based on universities' requirements).\n\nThe organization responsible for the SAT is the College Board, and you should check their website for details like registration, dates, official practice papers etc.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs prsehgal points out, Harvard looks for a lot more than just good test scores. I do not recall the source, but people have said that many applicants have the test scores needed (IIRC, some 85% applicants have the test scores needed for Harvard), but they pretty much need to look at other aspects because their acceptance rate tends to be 4-5% (as of 2020-21). Look at the Wiki of this subreddit, and try to understand the system.\n\n**Edit:** Look at the free resources of the [College Essay Guy](https://www.collegeessayguy.com/) as well. He's well known in the industry, and I think you'd find his website helpful in understanding the system. In particular, if you're an international student (I suspect you may be), look at his section for that.",
