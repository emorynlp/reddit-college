  "text": "Hi I'm an international student who's applying to colleges in the US. I'm currently working on the common app but I don't know what to do with the course names in the education section. I select physics, fill in my level, but then it asks my course name, but isn't that just physics? Or 'Natuurkunde' like in my language, because that's what the subject is called here. Thanks in advance!",
