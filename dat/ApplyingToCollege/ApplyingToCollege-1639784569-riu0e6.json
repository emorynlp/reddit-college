  "text": "Hi,\n\nSo I just got deferred from ED school and with that, the college will now see my mid-year report. I have been a straight-A student in rigorous courses all throughout HS but am receiving a C as my final semester grade in AP Calc BC. I am taking 4 courses this semester, three of which are AP. While my weighted GPA won't change, my unweighted will definitely go down a little. How screwed am I and for other RD decisions will I be rejected because of this?",
