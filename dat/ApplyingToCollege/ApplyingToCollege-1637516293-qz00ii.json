I submitted my CV application already, and the word limit was 500. it says the same for the chancellor's scholarship, but there is also an activities graph for that.

Admissions offices like to see \"demonstrated interest,\" so if you ask nicely for clarification they may even observe that you are putting a lot of thought into your application and increase your chances of getting in.",
