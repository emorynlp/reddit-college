  "text": "Hi, I'm a senior who by the end of high school will have taken 9 AP courses (1 sophomore 3 junior 5 senior). Some kids at my school have taken 13+, but my guidance counselor still said my course load was \"Most Demanding\". Would this be enough for t20's/ivies?",

      "text": "No, but more so because I don\u2019t like your language. Is it \u201cenough\u201d for Harv\u2019s yard? No. Harv\u2019s yard sees grades and courses as a qualification to actually be admitted you need to convince them that you are an accomplished and semi-developed person through essays and activities. It\u2019s a soft maybe for t20s since it depends on what your counselor lets you take I would recommend applying to some t20s. The bigger question is the other classes, part of the \u201ccourse rigor\u201d question is not how many APs had this student taken but did they put themselves on the track to make the most of high school. So if your guidance counselor says it\u2019s good I would believe them and focus on essays and ECs.",
