  "text": "Would appreciate it if someone could give a very panicked girl some advice right now. This is a lot of writing sorry but thanks to anyone who bothers to read this.\n\nSo I am in the early college program for nursing. (for those who don't know it's where you take college classes for your junior and senior year) \nFor my program type, I finished all of the credits I needed for high school my junior year and then began nursing classes my senior year. The plan was to finish this semester since I would become eligible to become a CNA, graduate in the winter because I HATE this program, and work or volunteer for the semester i'm off before I go to a university. \nUp until now, I thought my semester gpa was a 3.3 which I was fine with as my overall is a 3.3/4.06W. With this program, I only have 3 classes this semester. I have two As and one C. What I didn't know until yesterday was the As are only 1 credit each and the C is 7 credits, which according to different gpa calculator websites brings my semester gpa to anywhere from a 2.4 to a 2.8. I was really shocked and have no idea what to do. I don't want to have Ws on my transcript but I am guessing the extremely low gpa in comparison to my regular gpa will be way worse. Dropping IS an option, a lot of other people in my program did it because it sucks super bad. I would still be able to graduate. I just really wanted to get through the semester so I could be a CNA and have no withdrawals on my transcript.\n\nIf you were me, what would you do? Would you stay and get the low gpa, but avoid the withdrawal on the transcript and get the CNA? Or would you just lose hope of being a CNA and take the withdrawals to save your gpa. If I do withdraw, what do I tell universities about this? Will they rescind me if they accept me and see either a super low gpa or withdrawals from the program? Thanks in advance for any advice :(((\n\nEdit: I can try my best but it would be very unlikely for me to get to a B as the class is all difficult exams and no other things they grade. No extra credit or retakes and it's been really hard for me to find help studying.",

      "text": "If your goal is to go to a 4 year college right out of high school it might be best to preserve your gpa, but then you won\u2019t be taking any classes at all this year \u2014 is that right? Most colleges want to see academic courses your senior year also, so I\u2019m not sure what your next steps would be. \n\nI suggest you sit down with your school counselor and go through your options with you. Where are you considering applying to college?",

I haven't asked how it would look if I withdrew from the program before the semester, I assume that wouldn't look great but probably better than a sub 3.0 gpa lol.\n\nColleges in applying to: ED Tulane (fingers crossed), EA umiami, virginia tech, vermont, boulder, umd, ohio state, miami in ohio, RD syracuse",
