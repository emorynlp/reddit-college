  "text": "Hi guys I applied ED to Barnard and I\u2019m an international doing the IB. I\u2019m freaking out about this because my portal says awaiting for first sem senior year grades. \n\nOn their website Barnard mentions that for internationals \u201cfirst sem senior year grades\u201d refers to predicted grades ( which my counsellor already submitted) \n\nMy school doesn\u2019t do senior year exams in aug-nov they happen in December from 1st to 16th. So should I mail them? Telling them that I can send them the dec grades in light of an acceptance/deferral? Or should I ignore this since my counsellor already submitted the required Predicted grades for international students",

Just tell em that your counselor submitted your predicted grades to Common App on 28th and they're still not showing on your portal. (Try to mail your regional AO instead of the main admissions office. I've found that that gets the work done much sooner. Also, be sure to mention your full name and Applicant ID, if given.)",

      "text": "Hey! ik this is kinda late but this happened with me as well...traditionally,  school counselors usually upload the predicted grades under the transcripts section since most schools are ok with it under either( transcript or midterm grades section)... so this wont really hurt your app as they'll go thru all the transcripts. our portals will continue to show awaiting under midterms even though the predicted grades fulfill the requirements.",
