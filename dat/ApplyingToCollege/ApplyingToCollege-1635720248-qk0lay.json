  "text": "I feel like this may just be a stupid question in general but I\u2019ll ask anyways since it involves one of my top schools.\n\nIm doing the Tulane app and im about to write the Why Tulane essay and the question essentially asks why did you choose to apply to Tulane. \n\nHonestly the original reason why I became interested in Tulane was that I had a massive crush on a senior last year and this was the school she was going to, and in classic teenage romance style, I had fantasies about going to the same school as her and wanted to make conversation with her about it.\n\nOf course now I have legitimate interest in Tulane but I wanted to know if you guys thought it would be inappropriate to use that story as a lead-in for the essay, where I explain all of my actual reasons why it\u2019s one of my top choices.",
