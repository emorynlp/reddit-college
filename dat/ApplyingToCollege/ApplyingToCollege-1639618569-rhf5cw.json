  "title:": "What to look for in a premed undergraduate program?",
  "text": "I am currently a senior in high school starting to make decisions about an undergraduate program. My stats are 3.95 GPA unweighted with 4 AP courses and 1360 SAT. I plan to major in biology on the premed track. What are some things to look for in a undergraduate program to maximize my odds of med school admission? Are there certain schools that prepare their students better for the MCAT? Are there research opportunities available at smaller schools? I am typically a student who likes to maintain a relationship with my teachers which has made letters of recommendation and questions much easier in high school. Lastly, are popular premed schools like university of Washington cutthroat and too hard to stand out compared to smaller institutions\u2014like the saying better be a big fish in a small pond then a average fish in a big pond. I am sure others have asked this question so feel free to link those threads. Also please suggest some popular premed schools that you guys would suggest I research. Thank you so much!",

      "text": "The answer to this question is the same answer regardless of what you are planning to study. Namely, the things to look for are the things that work for you in a school. \n\nIf having close relationships with your instructors is important to you, you do not want to attend a large research university, whether that is a public or private school. You are best served at a small state or liberal arts college. Contrary to conventional wisdom, research, internships, and everything else happens at those places to. And often the opportunities you have as an undergraduate will be more numerous and higher quality. \n\nOne other thing to be aware of - there is no such thing as a premed undergraduate program. Pre-med is just a set of courses that prepare you for a graduate program. You can study any major compatible with also taking those courses, and your choice of major matters far more than what school you pick. If you want to be a brain surgeon, for instance, you probably want to study neuroscience or a related discipline. Not all schools offer every major, or offer a major that allows you to study the subtopic you want to study. \n\nA final piece of advice - do not make your college decision based on your intention to become an MD. You need to get an undergraduate degree first, and being successful as an undergraduate should be your priority. The decision to pursue an MD or another graduate degree will be much easier and clearer in 3-5 years when you are applying for those programs.",

      "text": "this is post is perfect for me lmao same intended major same GPA and pretty close test scores haha. One think you\u2019re gonna wanna look for is a decent size or well known school. schools that are bigger tend to have more opportunities in terms of like internships and stuff and a well known school will be easier to get into med school. if you go to some small priv college with like 2000 undergrads the chances are the program isn\u2019t as strong and med schools could look down on that. Also look into the school, go to Q&A sessions or something and ask current students what the counseling is like. especially if you are looking at a bigger school look at the student to faculty ratio and the class sizes. Even if the school has a really good program academically you still want to be able to know ur teachers because a lot of times internships or research opportunities can come from them if u just ask ur prof if there\u2019s any spots in their lab. i\u2019m not sure what a good ratio is tbh but make sure the school has a good program in terms of academics AND counseling because making sure u have all the classes u need for med school and are prepared for the MCAT is super important. U went to a Q&A sessions for UMich and there was 2 AOs and one senior in pre med and i learned a lot about their program so see if you can do the same with your schools. Good luck!",

                          "text": "Larger schools advertise more opportunity, but it's not really true. \n\nInternships aren't something that universities control except through partnerships that they invest in. Some schools famously invest in strong industry ties, but these are just as likely to be small or large. For the most part, location in an urban setting means that students are better able to find internships with local firms. Location and institutional culture - not size - matter. \n\nThe other claim that large research universities make is that they provide more research opportunities for undergrads. While it is true that more research happens at these schools, these schools also employ (literally) thousands of graduate students, Postdoctoral researchers, and staff scientists to perform that research. Although it is possible to do meaningful work as an undergraduate at these places, you are just as likely or more likely to have access to impactful research at small schools where you are not competing as an untrained volunteer for positions normally held by paid professionals with graduate degrees.",

There are plenty of hospitals in the mid-sized \"rural\" towns that host universities. \n\nTo be clear - I'm not saying that you can't get a good or great education at a large research university. Many people do. It's just important to recognize that the narrative that large schools are better or offer more opportunity is how they *sell* and *advertise* their programs. It's not a lie, but it's also not the whole story about what makes a program good or desirable.",
