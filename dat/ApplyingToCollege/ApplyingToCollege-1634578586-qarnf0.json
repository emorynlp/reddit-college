  "text": "My school doesn't use Naviance. I've seen everywhere that people say the only two options for sending documents to colleges is Naviance or snail mail (physical mail), but is emailing them also an option? I've called some admissions offices and they all say this is an option.",

      "text": "If the high school does not use Naviance (or some other similar service), then you \"invite\" the recommender directly through the Common App - that would be the standard procedure. Then the recommender will receive an invitation email giving them access to upload to the Common App or fill out a form online.\n\nThis is not the same thing as a teacher emailing a document to the college themselves. If the college will accept an email directly from the teacher, you should confirm that with the admissions office. It is not the standard procedure, but might make sense for unique, case-by-case situations.",
