A few points.\n\n\n\u201cOver 80% of the cases are mild\u201d - that makes the whole thing mild? 3% death rate is massively high (30x higher than the flu) and I\u2019m not sure people are really comprehending that.\n\n\nFurther, the infection rate is 4-5x higher than the flu, and even higher for older folks, who are also massively more likely to be killed by it. Right now the order of magnitude rate (time it takes for cases to multiply by 10) is 13 days. 10,000 cases January first, 100,000 January 14th, 1 million January 27th; that\u2019s the pace things are going right now.\n\n\nAnd last, if all of this didn\u2019t convince you, do you think that every sport organization would cancel all events, losing out on hundreds of millions, simply because of \u201cthe flu\u201d?",
