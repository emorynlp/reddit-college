      "text": "What specifically is this question about? Both of those subjects are very close to each other. I would say to try every humanities-related EC that your school offers whether it\u2019s mock trial, MUN, speech/debate, newspaper, ethics bowl, etc. Then try to schedule things and take what your interested in.\n\nIf you really have to choose one over the other then I would focus on what you plan to make a career out of. This will help reinforce your devotion to that subject in essays that ask you what you plan to do with your life.\n\nAcademically, try to take as many advanced History and English classes as possible and take law or philosophy classes if your school has them.",
