  "text": "Applied Early Action to Fordham and thought it would be a pretty good school given the fact that I wanna do prelaw and I just got deferred. GWU releases ED1 results tomorrow and I\u2019m freaking the fuck out. I knew I was gonna be anxious the night before but this just threw fuel in the fire. If I don\u2019t get into GWU Idk what I\u2019m gonna do because I couldn\u2019t find a more perfect school for who I am and now my entire mental stability is in another realm of existence. Please help\u2026",
