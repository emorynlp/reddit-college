  "text": "I got a 1440 on both of my first two SATs, resulting in a 1470 superscore (720 EBRW from 1st attempt and 750M from 2nd). I'm taking it again next week because I almost nailed both sections but got two wrong on math and rushed on the grammar section. I'm satisfied with my superscore - it's just right on the 25% mark for my top reaches. If I don't improve my superscore next week, will my 1470 look worse since I didn't show an upward trend, or will they not even look at anything besides my top score when I send the report?",
