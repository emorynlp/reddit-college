  "title:": "My Story as a Poor International Student",
  "text": "Hey everyone. I hope you're doing well. I came here to share my story, but I want everyone to know that this isn't meant to scare international students or tell them that they don't have a chance at getting full rides at US colleges. \n\nI'm a victim of circumstance but also a victor. My parents are messed up, my financial situation is absolute shit, my life is just terrible. I managed to get a full merit scholarship at a private high school in my country four years ago and worked harder than ever. Got a 4.0 GPA, joined ECs, and was overall in the top of my class. I'm a great student. I'm kind. I'm active. I study with passion. \n\nI learned about US college admissions in eleventh grade and got absolutely hooked. The thought of going to the US, getting a liberal arts education, and studying with other like-minded individuals...I mean it just made me want to work even harder than ever. I worked and worked and worked. Come 12th grade. I had no clue how to structure my app. No clue what the requirements were. But I applied. I applied to 15 schools. Got 5 rejections and 10 waitlists. Me being the dreamer I am, I decided to take a gap year and reapply to the few ivies that waitlisted me. I redid all my essays, did new ECs, got new recs, changed everything and applied to Columbia ED. Andddd I got rejected. \n\nNow some might think that I might feel disappointed right now. I mean I just wasted an entire 3 years of my life chasing a dream that was never meant to be didn't I? But honestly, I don't regret a single second. Sure its been mentally draining, and shitty as hell, but I learned so much about myself and I feel stronger than ever. Living in my country and going to university here next year will be tough, but now that I've gained that strength, I know I can push through. And you never know, maybe I'll be in the US for graduate school. \n\nI guess my point is, things don't always work out. But be grateful. You didn't achieve your dreams but now you are stronger than ever. I mean, look at me. Rejections and failures have only made me stronger. Now, maybe I'll thrive more than ever in my local university. Maybe I'll graduate top of my class. Because failures only make me stronger. \n\nSo please, if things don't work out for you, its okay. Its going to feel like shit at first but this is only the beginning. There's so much light at the end of the tunnel. Have faith. \n\nGood luck with your applications everyone!",
