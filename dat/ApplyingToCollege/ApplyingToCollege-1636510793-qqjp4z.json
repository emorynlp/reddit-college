  "text": "I am a sophomore from India and will be shooting for T20s in 2024.\nAs I am taking my national curriculum (CBSE) and that too Humanities from next year (Humanities is considered to be a disadvantage for CBSE applicants according to the AMA by the LAC AO pn this sub) I want to show my academic competency by doing good on AP exams. Can you suggest which APs are easiest to self study, approx how long it will take to prepare myself for a 5 and what resources I should use?",

It's pretty well known that AP test of, say, Calculus AB/BC even with an year of regular AP Classes. I would have to study school classes and self study for APs side by side and signing up, paying 130-isd USD for them feels stupid if I physically cannot get a 4/5 and submit it.",

But I\u2019d advise you to look at which subjects are actually going to be beneficial to what you\u2019re looking at studying//applying for in the future. For example, a 5 in AP art history is a good score but if you\u2019re applying premed a 4 in AP Bio would have more weight since it\u2019s relevant to your indicated area of interest and shows that you\u2019ve gone beyond your school syllabus in that subject.",
