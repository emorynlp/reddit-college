  "text": "You\u2019re an international student. You applied to Cornell, and you were miraculously accepted. The first in your entire bloodline to be accepted to an Ivy League school. You also have a full ride government scholarship. You\u2019re beyond excited and happy. \n\nBut then your parents say you can\u2019t go. The USA is dangerous, wether it\u2019s crime, Covid, or past stories from relatives and parent\u2019s friends talking about their shitty experience in the USA. \n\nYou still want to go. Your future would be set. But your parents don\u2019t approve of you doing so, and will be willing to say stuff like \u201cif you go, you\u2019re not coming back here\u201d.   \n\n\nWHAT DO YOU FUCKING DO?",
