  "text": "You\u2019re an international student. You applied to Cornell, and you were miraculously accepted. The first in your entire bloodline to be accepted to an Ivy League school. You also have a full ride government scholarship. You\u2019re beyond excited and happy. \n\nBut then your parents say you can\u2019t go. The USA is dangerous, wether it\u2019s crime, Covid, or past stories from relatives and parent\u2019s friends talking about their shitty experience in the USA. \n\nYou still want to go. Your future would be set. But your parents don\u2019t approve of you doing so, and will be willing to say stuff like \u201cif you go, you\u2019re not coming back here\u201d.   \n\n\nWHAT DO YOU FUCKING DO?",

Don't give up your dreams for anything. It is difficult without parental support but even if you fail you can at least look back and say that \"i've tried\".

It is the only college my senior has applied to that I would say I would feel comfortable about him walking across campus in the middle of the night alone. I literally just made this statement earlier today. If your parents were to be on this campus in person they would be better able to understand how safe this campus is. COVID is an issue all over the world, and while it would be difficult to be in another country during a pandemic, at college age the risk of a serious case is very low - and is an issue anywhere you go. To be able to have a free ride for the quality of education you can get at Cornell is an absolutely amazing opportunity and I hope you will be able to take advantage of it. From a safety standpoint, maybe showing your parent\u2019s Cornell\u2019s Cleary Report will help them to better understand the low crime risk? https://www.cupolice.cornell.edu/campus-watch/annual-security-report/",

But if you go without your parents support, you will be on your own in a foreign country without any fallback. You won't have anywhere to stay over school breaks and you won't be getting any pocket money for off campus food, or any other basic life stuff that you probably don't have to think too hard about right now. So you will need a job, adding to your workload on top of a tough school. You can absolutely survive and thrive like this, but it will always be tougher than if you had your parents on your side, and therefore, a support system.\n\nSo, CONVINCE THEM. Show them just how good this school is. Give them the stats, show them your increased earning potential, show them just how little it's going to cost. Show them data about the area, anything, crime data. Prove that what they see in the headlines is not a full picture. If they think there is a better school for you, show them it is not as good.\n\nYour best resource right now is the school itself. Now that you have been admitted, they are on your side, they can help you fight this battle. Send an email to the admissions officers, send an email to a dean, send an email to the provost. Explain your situation. At the very least, you could pivot that into a zoom call between them and your parents. Think of it as a pitch meeting. Send them some of the questions and complaints your parents have so they are ready to address these concerns. Prepare responses yourself. In that call you and the representative can do your best to prove that this is the right place for you. Even better, if you can, fly them out. Take a tour, even ask for a personal tour in your aforementioned correspondence. If they can go there themselves, it might really help to be able to imagine their kid there.\n\nAgain, no matter what happens, I personally think this offer is to good to pass up on. But it will always be better if your parents agree. GOOD LUCK",

Now that your hard work is coming to fruition, they are realizing how much they'll miss you. Or they are projecting their own fears and uncertainties on you. They are saying things to make you doubt yourself because they doubt themselves.\n\nGo anyway.\n\nIf your parents love you, they will get over it. You have to do what's right for your own life, and honestly, you will be in an amazing position to provide for your family once you have this degree and job that comes afterwards.\n\nBe kind. Be firm. And go.\n\nI wish you all the best.",

And let\u2019s be honest, the United States is not exactly painting itself in the best light right now. And to add to that, if something were to happen to you, heaven forbid, your parents can\u2019t simply drive to you- you\u2019d be a literal ocean apart. If I were a parent, I\u2019d be devastated, truly. \n\nI think too often in this sub, we see how much parents are trying to \u201cruin lives,\u201d but parents worry. It\u2019s what parents do. Hell, I went to college an hour from home, and my mom called me nearly every day. (Latina moms, am I right?) \n\nSo this is what I\u2019m going to tell you, and this is coming from a place of sincere care for YOU- if you think you can sacrifice your relationship with your family for a potentially life changing academic experience, then go to Cornell. If you think you\u2019d be able to easily support yourself, scholarship and all, go to Cornell. Ultimately, your parents will want to see you succeed. But they will worry, and it is because they LOVE you. \n\nDon\u2019t take this decision lightly. But luckily, you still have months to decide. I wish you well.",

They tried to reach out their parents that it's the chance for them to see another world and be independent, they have been arguing for a long time. Try to find a person who knows what is studying abroad among your relatives or parent's friends, I hope they can help. By the way, parents always want their child be safe and full. What I say is try to talk, show them that \"you was born to study in Cornell\", show them statistics that only 1% of students got into Cornell with full scholarship. And maybe they will change their mind... \n\nHope that they will, because it's a big chance for you to reach out your dreams.",

Probably because I know what it feels to be in your position (not quite Cornell + scholarship but close). \n\nYour parents are middle eastern and their values are more or less like my family's (Muslim or similar asian family centric values). So your parents supported you for pursuing good things at first as they should logically. But now they're not for it. You know why? Because now it's all too real for them. \n\nYou will be leaving them. If you choose to accept this offer, you will be leaving them (and idk if you got a job in your country or somewhere overseas) for a long time. Your parents likely fear that you are on the path to leaving them forever. Right before my applications began, my parents were suddenly against me applying because now it feels all too real for them to be wanting to let go of me. \n\nThe way forward from this is not ditching your parents, or going the eurocentric and individualistic route as many will tell you here. It is the opposite. Talk to them and understand the place they're coming from. \n\nTalk about your dreams. Talk about your fears. Understand theirs. Show them that you will miss them too (it's getting a little cheesy for some of y'all but trust me, as an Asian, families are super important). But lastly, be mature and tell them that you understand what's happening, and that you are not being completely selfish in following your dreams. People have dreams. Tell them that you will make them proud. Pull the reverse emotional blackmail card. Remind them that you are not going away completely. They have nothing fear\n\nAnd please reassure them that Cornell is in the middle of nowhere, you will most likely be fine.",

If they're so scared from safety, maybe start educating them about the safety precautions taken at Cornell generally. Also, very likely that there is another student from your country at Cornell, perhaps consider asking if he could talk to your parents about their concerns. Just don't make this into a big fight, etc. just educate them as much as possible about their concerns and they'll probably end up supporting you which is evident since they were the ones who supported you in the first place.

      "text": "I\u2019m a Korean accepted to rice univ with no aid at all. I am also accepted to a prestigious Top 3 Korean university, which costs only $8000 a year. (Rice is $75000) My parents didnt want me to go to Rice because of both financial problem and dangerous situations that your parents worry about. However I finally succeeded in persuading them and now we are working all together to save money and prepare for my dream. \n\nI know US might be dangerous. Actually it is, compared to Korea where guns are not allowed. Also I know there might me some racists and I know there might be some discrimination I\u2019ll experience. I know that it\u2019s much safer to stay in Korea. \nBut, the most important thing to consider is your dream. If you got full ride, which is a much better option than me, there is no reason to decline the miraculous offer. Your parents\u2019 opinion matters, but you should always think that your future matters more. \nThe reason why I chose Rice was\n1. It was my dream school (for 3 yrs)\n2. I will try to overcome hardships by myself as much as I can, bc it\u2019s the school that \u2018I\u2019 chose, even though my parents didnt want me to.\n\nOnce you choose to attend Cornell, you take the responsibility. It is obviously a dangerous decision, but I think taking responsibility will be a good big step toward your independent & successful life.\n\nHope you make great decision for your future",

If I were a parent and my child, who's barely an adult, says they're gonna go to the other side of the world to study on their own, I'd feel the same way too. Hopefully, they won't feel this way too long. I definitely think you should go as you seem to be set on going.",
