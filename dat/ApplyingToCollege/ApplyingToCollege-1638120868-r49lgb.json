  "text": "I know that college interviews don't really mean anything and are just based on availability, but getting one from my dream college is giving me too much hope :( especially when I don't think my stats and ecs are good enough. Man, now I'm just nervous as heck for nothing since the ik interview isn't gonna help my application much anyways",

I mean, I think it went pretty nice yet it reinforced my anxiety and the whole 'what if' thing so bad. I HATE IT ((((",
