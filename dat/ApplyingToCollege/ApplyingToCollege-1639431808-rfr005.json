      "text": "After your acceptance, you'll get an I-20 form, using which you'll go to a US Embassy or Consulate and apply for an F-1 Student Visa... Actually getting an approval will depend on how well you do in the interview and if the interviewer is satisfied with your documents... As for other countries, you'll need a lot more than a SAT score to apply elsewhere - check r/IntlToUSA for posts on this topic.",
