My friends who were ED1 were all accepted within a couple days of this as well (\\~ +\\_ 2 days). It's highly probable they've already made a decision, although it's possible that they are really hung up on you and would consider this.",

I am an interviewer and got my first assigned RA candidate 5 days   \nago.  With regards to EA candidates, those interviews are now all over.\n\nAnother said that EA candidates that were not interviewed (about 800) are put in the RD pool.\n\nSo I suspect this is part of the RD interview process and your EA application was evaluated without an interview.\n\nIf you are deferred to RD, it's absolutely not just a formality.",
