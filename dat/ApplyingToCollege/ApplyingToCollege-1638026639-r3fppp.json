  "text": "not me picking apart every little thing \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nbasically, i applied early *decision to a university, and they asked me last week to send in first quarter/trimester grades asap, even though they aren\u2019t needed until january (my school follows a two semester schedule). so i ended up having to send in the grades that i have so far.\n\nthe grades are also not that cute (depending on your definition) but not terrible. i have 3 b\u2019s in three of the hardest ap classes out there (ap calc bc (80), ap lit (88), ap chem (88)). i have a\u2019s in everything else though.\n\nis this a good sign or am i tripping?\n\n\n**Note: My EFC is like 90k, so I doubt I\u2019m getting much aid. Idk if I\u2019ll need to see a financial aid package beforehand.",
