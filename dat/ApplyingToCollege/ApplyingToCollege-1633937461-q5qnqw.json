  "text": "Not sure if this is a really dumb question, but I'm international... so bear with me :\")\n\nI plan to apply for BU's Presidential and Trustee scholarship by submitting my application on/before December 1st. However, I will have only taken the SAT once (Oct. 2nd) before this deadline. I plan to retake the SAT on the December 4th testing date, but I'm not sure if this score will be useless. I'm really worried that I won't get a great score on the October 2nd SAT\u2014would I be able to send in my December score somehow even if it's after the deadline for Common App and the Presidential scholarship essays? I'm not really sure how the whole process works, sorry if this sounds dumb.",
