  "title:": "Failed the 2nd semester of a class because there were only three grades taken, should I include this on my Common App?",
  "text": "I'm currently a senior who's just about finished filling out the Common App.  In 11th grade, I took Law I and II (one semester each).  I also completed the entirety of my 11th grade year virtually due to covid.  For Law I, I received a 100/100 average, but the 2nd semester only three grades were taken (I believe that in-person students received more grades), one of which I had turned in late and received a zero.  My average for the class that semester was a 35/100.  This caused my overall average for the 2nd semester of 11th grade to be a 77.  Every other semester of high school, I had an average of 90 or above.\n\nWould it be reasonable to me to include this in my App? If so, would it best be included in the additional information section of the writing portion?",
