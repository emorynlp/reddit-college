  "title:": "Can we please take a break from thinking about our dream colleges and talk about the astronomical cost of college?",
  "text": "Before I start, I'm sorry if this disrupts your Reddit scrolling experience, I just think it's imperative, and for many of us, it's an issue we'll almost certainly face.  \n\nThe best place to start is the base cost of attendance (tuition, room and board, fees, fees and more fees, etc.) Most 'elite' or high-level institutions cost between $50,000 to $75,000 a year (looking at you NYU). You'd think with industry competition (aka other colleges existing) the cost wouldn't be so high. But why tf has the average cost of a college degree increase 140% (YES 140!) over the course of ONLY the last 10 years??? The rate of inflation is \\~2.5% or less. Have we fed into a social stigma regarding education from an elite institution? And that without it you are nothing? Have we quite literally given them a monopoly?; catapulted by government subsidies (oh, let's get to that later). Have they made us think that without it we are nothing? To all of these, I give a resounding YES. \n\nIn a sense, the colleges might be right. At some schools, you *will* have better opportunities. But in the end, it's what you make out of the chances you're given. So while going to one of the highest level institutions is beneficial in some ways to your future-self, paying it off will be a pain in the a\\*\\*. My parents, who are in the working middle-class, are still paying off loans from 20+ years ago, when college was that much cheaper and more 'affordable'. Although part of this might be financial inexperience from when they were younger, it's still shocking. It leaves me afraid. \n\nTo put my personal experiences into perspective, I know college will be so so so expensive. You might think this because my family has an overflowing amount of cash on deck, but no. We don't live lavishly, we don't spend very freely, we live normal lives. We're in the gray area of financial aid. Not low enough income to receive significant financial aid, not high enough to be able to pay in full. I can imagine that for most, if not all, middle-class families, the cost is devastating. And for the most part, these are the people that will be applying to these schools (around 80k-160k income somehow results in a 60k EFC) Bulls\\*\\*t. And in a state, like California, where 80k is hardly liveable in a city like San Diego, college is near unaffordable. Think about how many brilliant minds have been/ will be barred from higher education because they couldn't/ can't afford it. Although Questbridge and other significant scholarship opportunities are front-running change when it comes to an affordable education, they are limited and obscure to many. \n\nI thought I had a lot more to say, but I ran dry. I think the skyrocketing cost of a college education should be enough to raise some eyebrows.  I'm afraid about how I'll be able to cover it. Some of you out there might be too. We need to be advocates for improving this situation, and not leaving the next generation to suffer. We can't let colleges essentially control our finances for the rest of our lives. I want there to be change, but I don't even know where to start going up against $5 billion, $10 billion $40 BILLION dollar endowments. Maybe this was a rant, maybe not. But it just doesn't sit right with me the amount of money some of these schools are sitting on and how they're still screwing over so many students. It needs to be better. That's it.",

You can pay them back by studying something you love and finding some modicum of success with it. Stay in their lives and let them celebrate with you.

I also massively boosted my income in the last few years and effectively screwed my kid out of financial aid.\nA couple of things, your parents should have a grasp of their own finances and shouldn't be putting helping you out over their own retirement savings.  I have a number in mind of how much I can assist each year and I've been upfront with it.  \nThat number means I won't be able to travel as much, eat out as much, that I will have to budget more and occasionally go without.  And I am totally OK with that because I adore my kiddos.   Don't feel bad if your parents are willing to do the same.  It's a JOY to do this for your kids not a burden.  Us parents have had 18 years of experience of putting our kids first.  \ud83d\ude02\nSo many posts here are of a**hole parents who are withholding money out of spite or trying to control their kids after they have become young adults.  If your parents aren't that way just thank them for whatever it is they offer without guilt.\nI totally worry about the debt my daughter is taking on.  I'm also worried about her getting into one of her dream schools and spending so much time studying to keep up her grades that she doesn't stop to enjoy the experience.  \nSo my advice is to not feel guilty. Just make the most of it, enjoy the experience and tell your parents you love them.  <3",

But when the majority share of students don't get into unis that give out aid on the level of Princeton and Harvard, that's where the problem is. And this issue might be overlooked because most all of A2C consists of super high-achievers who end up at institutions that give out great aid because they have the money to do so. So while it might not apply to some people here, the issue still persists. And I certainly agree state schools are great, cheaper options! Germany, however, has made uni affordable, while maintaining tax rates similar to that of the U.S.. And the education over there is still fantastic, producing scientists, award winners, scholars, and world leaders. Culture is different, of course though.

              "text": "The vast majority of universities are non-profits that theoretically should not be driven by profit.  And I think if they wanted more profit, they could get it.  Need-blind admissions policies and not basing financial aid on merit\u2014which are both policies at virtually every top college\u2014are not exactly great for profit.  Consider the fact that only 5% of applicants get into most top schools; there's more demand than supply, so colleges are doing us a *service* by not raising costs even more.\n\nThe exorbitant cost of college is caused by the fact that society feels that it is willing to pay that cost, and colleges want to take as much as we are willing to give them  because they need to fund financial aid programmes and expensive research (and renovations and amenities, but the theory is that those have a high ROI in that they invite demand and improve the quality of life which correlates to better education).  We complain about how insane the cost of college is, but then we still find a way to pay for it, whether through inordinate amounts of debt or by demolishing our parents' savings.  When more people in this middle-class, who isn't wealthy enough to pay $70k per year per kid without a second thought, but isn't poor enough to qualify for aid, opt for state schools over HYPSM, or the wealthy class decide that prestige isn't worth it, that's when the costs of HYPSM will be driven down.",

The higher your rank, the more applicants will apply, the more selective you can be, the higher your ranking, etc. However, student cost is not a part of the rankings. So colleges have no incentive to maintain low costs, especially when raising costs could help them with raising their ranking. So in a way, yes students themselves contribute to the high cost of colleges by giving a shit about what a second rate newspaper says, but for profit colleges can go fuck themselves. They\u2019re fucking predatory and the scum of the earth.\n\nAlso for anyone who wants to listen, the prestige of your undergrad education plays little to no role in how much you\u2019ll make as an adult. There are some exceptions of course, like law/business/finance where it influences it quite a bit. As long as the college you go to has a relatively strong alumni network/chances to network and do research/internships in your field, you\u2019re going to be fine. More than fine.

Many colleges have good programs that, if you take advantage of your opportunities, will get you far.

But in my opinion, the reality is that if you have the chance to go to college for cheap, that is almost always going to be more helpful and cause less stress in the long run than allowing yourself to be crushed by mountains of debt under the guise of prestige making your life easier.\n\nAgain, just a little rant/thought, anyone who goes to a prestigious school, you deserve it and should be extremely proud of yourself.",

All I've seen in this thread is the suggestion of price controls, which are really a lot more difficult to implement than you may think.\n\nOne of the key difficulties is the following: How do you know what is affordable to consumers and economically profitable (i.e. the accounting profit exceeds the opportunity cost) for firms (lest they drop out of the market)? This sounds silly but is quite important. After all, consumers would like to pay as little as possible and firms would like to make as much as possible. And you can't simply ask them. It is difficult to come up with a single rule--there is incredible heterogeneity, both consumer- and producer-side, in the education market.\n\nWe all want less expensive stuff, though this kind of information-dynamism is challenging for a government to actually go out and do. No country has been successful in setting price controls for private nonprofit colleges without significant enrollment changes.",

      "text": ">At some schools, you *will* have better opportunities. But in the end, it's what you make out of the chances you're given.\n\nDon't EVER underestimate your in-state flagship. The programs across the board are solid at most in-states, and they are usually quite large. This means you can get into research, take classes in many subject areas, probably find internships, etc. If you do well academically and do research/internships, I don't think a degree from a flagship is going to be an insurmountable thing that will ruin your life. If you think like that, then it will be.\n\nFor perspective, getting a college degree from the 430th ranked college in the US puts you as a graduate of a school in the top 10% of all colleges in the US. If you're on A2C, you clearly take school seriously enough to get into a T-430.",

This is what your parents are paying such an exorbitant price for. Malcom Gladwell covered this in an episode of his podcast - Revisionist History. The episode is called Food Fight. He contrasts the lobster dinners at Bowdoin with the spartan buildings and living conditions at UC Berkeley. If you visit a private school campus and some flagship publics, you will see constant construction of gleaming new facilities. Students are paying for this with their parents' tuition dollars.",

I was accepted to a college a few weeks ago and I was so excited to find out that at the very least I'm going to college (It wasn't my top choice so I was happy). \n\nYeah, I shouldn't have said that.  \n\nI looked at what they gave me for financial aid.  It's still over $30,000 a year and that's just about half of what my dad makes.  I can't afford that without a ton of loans (which I want to avoid as much as possible of course) and there's no way I can ask my parents to pay that.  I knew that the college was expensive but that was still quite a few thousand more than their net price calculator said.  \n\nHonestly, I'm starting to regret applying ED to a place now because I'm worried it's going to be way more than what their net price calculator said before and then I'm screwed.  I guess, if anything, I'll just shell out the money and transfer later. \n\nAs for now, community college for a couple years is looking better and better.  At least I can afford that.",

MIT and Harvard are the outliers, not the norms, so even if one wanted to argue that 50k+ tuition is worth it for MIT/Harvard, for most schools it really isn\u2019t worth it to pay 50k+ a year compared to the colleges in other countries that are way cheaper. I think it\u2019s especially ironic that this happens in the US, but it also makes the most sense too. College is sewed into the American dream, it represents the idea of advancement, that if you work hard, you can go to a good school and get a good job and have a good life. College is not just economically important, it is also culturally important. As such, it\u2019s a bit ironic that in the US, college is pretty unattainable for some families without going into a lot of debt, even if you work your butt off, because of the crazy price. However, it also makes sense because if something is in higher demand, companies can charge more for it. People in the US really want to go to college, and even if they complain, many will still pay the crazy high prices even if they go into debt because they really want to or feel like they need to go to college. It\u2019s a big oof.\n\nEdit: that and no parent wants to have to tell their kid that they can\u2019t go to Harvard because they can\u2019t afford it. It can feel like you\u2019re failing your child. Many that are immigrants come to the US because of the American dream, and the desire for their kid to have a better education and a better life. Imagine how crushing it would feel to not be able to send your kid to Harvard even if they get in because you can\u2019t afford it. I know parents that prioritize their kids college fund more then anything else, including their own retirement. It\u2019s a double oof.",

He\u2019s not too studious so he knows he\u2019s not going to get scholarships, so me and my older brother made an unspoken agreement not to break our dad\u2019s bank. I actually really like the school for how straightforward they were with all the financials, didn\u2019t even need to send the fafsa in to get my scholarship. I\u2019m going to grad school anyway so at this point it doesn\u2019t really matter the prestige of my undergrad.",

When it was more affordable, it really was more affordable. It was in line with wages. The skyrocketing started happening when costs overwhelmingly increased faster than inflation. And for my parents, that's why I noted inexperience. Maybe it wasn't the right thing to do, and maybe they didn't manage their finances as best they could (which I'm sure they didn't).

I do, however, think it's deeper than wanting to be the best college. It stems from money (doesn't everything?) that's where the issue lies.  At what point can we move on from only worrying from a fiscal standpoint and establishing reasoning in a necessity for intellectual vitality in our next generations, as our fate might quite literally depend on it. It boils down to moving away from the finances and into the potential of some of these students and staking your ground in them not as cash cows, but as innovators and forward-minded citizens. Universities should claim students not because they are the ones that can afford it, but because they see the potential to create serious, tangible change. And your argument is circular because right when you try to escape the financial argument, you find yourself right back in it. Greed, money. \"Stretching the aid system\" -- define this please it's a bit confusing. Stretching it will only allow these schools to further take advantage of it, no?",

                      "text": "Does your sister go to NYU? I cannot tell you why your sister is paying 70K as fin aid goes much further than yearly income. Assets go into it. Savings go into it. A good school won't make you pay more than you can afford. Once again, your view on it seems a bit naive. Case study: every College that has a lower tuition like 20K. If your sister wanted to go to an affordable school, she would've gone there; there's a reason she chose the 70K school and why your parents agreed to pay the money. That school wouldn't be what it is without the massive tuition. Good Colleges don't expect you to pay what you cannot pay and they will make you pay the maximum amount you can possibly pay.\n\nYou said it correctly, everything stems from money. Money is the reason most people are going to college. Money is the reason the government is functional. Money is the reason, despite it being a burden, you can pay 70K. However, money is not synonymous to greed. I know it's easy to look at these colleges and be frustrated.\n\n> At what point can we move on from only worrying from a fiscal standpoint and establishing reasoning in a necessity for intellectual vitality in our next generations, as our fate might quite literally depend on it?\n\nMaybe at the point when money doesn't matter anymore... which is not any time soon. \n\n> It boils down to moving away from the finances and into the potential of some of these students and staking your ground in them not as cash cows, but as innovators and forward-minded citizens. \n\nHow do you move away from finances? You cannot move away from finances and run a College. Finances are essential to a college as I explained in my post and the massive tuition is how they can offer aid and tap into the \"potential\" of these students as \"innovators\".\n\nHow do you suggest Colleges reduce tuition while offering financial aid for students who can't afford it, maintaining their labs, paying top professors, financing world-class research and building and maintaining their dope campus and student services for the sake of students?",

Moving away from finances in terms of affordability, not funding or whatever. Of course they need the money! That much is obvious! But the massive tuition is hurting the middle class! It's killing them! The rich the afford it, the poor cannot. And middle can do what then? Colleges just say \"they too can afford it\". Not true. For me, coming from a middle-class family, the amount we have to pay will tie us down for years unless I can cover it immediately out of college with a well-paying job, which isn't a given anywhere. I know, they need a lot of money to maintain and upgrade their facilities. But the ones getting screwed over are the ones who can't afford it but are treated as if they can pay in full. As for solutions, it's such a tough call. Take Germany, for example, they've done well with its higher education model, at least. Initiatives established around the country have allowed education to remain affordable, all while maintaining taxes similar to that of the U.S. I'm talking 250 POUNDS a semester? Germany has a similar economy, a proportional population, and affordable university education, even for the best in the country. LMU Munich is cheap. And I mean cheap. Yet they've still produced magnificent beings. There are solutions, but they're quite complex.",

How many Universities in Germany costing 250 pounds are on par with Northwestern? None! once again, your sister could have gone to a cheaper university and become a \"magnificent being.\" Don't you get my point that your sister CHOSE Northwestern? ASU is cheap and a better school than LMU Munich; she could've gone there for $11,340 \u00b7 $29,430 if paying full tuition. You're not being screwed over if you're choosing to go to an expensive uni when there are cheaper high-value schools.\n\nThe real people here being srewed are the people who have no choice but to attend an elite school cause they can't afford cheaper schools like ASU who don't give good aid.\n\nLike you said, there are solutions that are complex cause no solution in the real world is a straight line.",

Please take a short while to read that again.\n\nAlso, what's your point? I think we both may have spiralled out to the point that we really don't have points.\n\nMy points at this time is that:\n\n A Uni like Northwestern will charge you the maximum they believe you can pay. This system is not perfect but it is better than when Colleges charged lower and expected everyone to pay. Finances are complicated at times and it can be hard to get them to understand that. If your sister did not get good aid to Northwestern then it means one of three things:\n\n* You can pay it without wiping out your life savings.\n* Your situation is very complicated and they were unable to properly take that into account\n* You really didn't try hard enough.\n\nYour sister chose to attend Northwestern and pay 70K instead of attending ASU and paying 20K. Many people can't even afford the 20K and have no choice. I'm not saying there isn't a problem.

      "text": " It is no news that the cost of College has skyrocketed at a rate far above the rate of inflation. However, it is way more complicated than Harvard bad. In the early and mid-nineties, a good college education was a luxury for rich kids, middle-income kids willing to bankrupt their parents and low-income kids willing to bow to student loans forever. However, this began to change in 1992 with the introduction of the FAFSA which made federal student aid a million times more accessible for students.\n\nTop Colleges saw this and decided to cash in, instantly pushing the limits of federal aid (I know this may seem bad but just give me a sec). Colleges aren't a business in the sense that they want your money; they're a business in the sense that they want the greatest, bestest, most respected College. They do this by attracting the best students, building the best buildings, having the best research and hiring the best professors. What do the best students love the most? The best professors! What do the best professors love the most? The best research! Where is the best research done? The best buildings! All these are interconnected but still bound on cash. College, wanting the best of it all and requiring the most of money pushed the limits of what the government could cover without burdening the students... until they broke it.\n\nThese Colleges got what they wanted though. They got the best students who got the best professors who got the best research done in the best buildings. When these Colleges realized that they had broken FAFSA and that it wouldn't just cut it, they expanded institutional aid and birthed wide-spread need-based aid. This means they were able to keep costs astronomically low and/or proportional to family income, essentially continuing to milk the rich and the government while properly supporting low and mid-income students. and no, you aren't too rich for fin aid and too poor to afford College (unless you go to NYU); good/top colleges give aid proportional to income and other factors and do not have strict cut-offs for aid.\n\nThe downside, however, was the cost at other lower schools. You see, while these top schools were greatly advancing and building the best building, hiring the best professors and all, the lower Colleges had to catch up before being left behind in the Stone age. The dilemma was this: They couldn't massively increase tuition as much as top colleges as they didn't have half as much reputational leverage but they still needed those massive bucks to stay competitive. Because of this, they increased tuition but not enough to be able to properly support low and mid-income students.\n\nThat is my take on the issue. If you really really want to make a change, lobby the government to further allow room for the stretching of their fin aid system, decrease the tuition at public colleges and finance them backstage or go to a top college, get super-rich and establish massive colleges for students attending regular colleges. That's my plan!\n\nI'm open for discussions. Please be civil and tell me if you agree or disagree. I'm open to learn and teach.",
