  "text": "Okay so this is my profile's summary-\ngrades: 90%+ throughout\necs : developed a drama app,started a cs ngo that partnered with rural schools, stanford ulo,nyas,started my own merch, president school's drama club,youtube channel(cs) 3M+ views,actor for a ngo for fundraising,cs internship.\nact - 31(superscore)\nessays n lors - epic (reviewd n edited by a yale student)\n\nSo im an Intl majoring in CS with an efc of only $13k .\nSeeing the results of intls last year I was really freaked out and scared. Since I needed tons of aid, I researched for a small lac that had decent ranking and was generous with aid to intls.Thus I EDed Bennington college to be a 100% sure of maximising my chances of getting aid.\n\nNow the problem is that I've been telling this to a lot of people and the majority thinks of me as stupid since i did not follow the ED to a reach/target trend. They tell me that my profile was really good and I could have had a great chance at much better unis than Bennington. I still have time to convert my ED to a RD. at Bennington and do ED somewhere else.\n\nI would like to hear what y'all think I should do. Please help.",

      "text": "As the other commentor said, there are no safeties for intl students like us but also technically speaking, EDing Bennington is actually a very smart decision since you have a high likelihood of getting in during ED. You can back out of your ED agreement by simply withdrawing your app or emailing the admissions office and asking them to change your round from ED to RD though if you feel like it.",
