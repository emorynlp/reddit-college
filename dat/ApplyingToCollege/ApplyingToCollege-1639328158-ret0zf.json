  "text": "Someone at r/northwestern asked if an NU student would do an AMA here so I figured why not.\n\nSome things about me:\n-I was a bio and global health studies major and studied abroad in Mexico\n-I was pre med and just got into medical school! \n-I lived on campus for three years and have an apartment this year\n\nI loved my time at NU so send any questions my way :)",

          "text": "It was fantastic! It\u2019s a very popular major at Northwestern but the department only has about 6 professors, so all the classes fill up fast since there aren\u2019t that many each quarter. If you\u2019re a declared major, you get first priority into those classes and you can usually get at least one. My favorite class was with Dr. Sera Young who developed the globally recognized scale to measure water insecurity (you can google her to find some of her papers, she\u2019s literally amazing).\n\nI was also fortunate to study abroad before COVID and one of the reasons I chose the GHS major is because you are required to study abroad. In Mexico, we took cultural field trips every week and went to over 10 museums, my favorite being Frida Kahlo and Diego Riviera\u2019s house! There are 5 or 6 other public health abroad options through NU and they are popular as well. You can also get it approved to choose your own program through another school.",

You just have to decide what\u2019s most important to you, but I think you can definitely get over the weather here if you really want to come!",
