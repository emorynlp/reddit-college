Drink some water, snack, take a nap. I promise you most everything can wait until then. Once you're refreshed, do some stretching and then sit somewhere you can make a list. \n\nOn the list, put down what needs to get done first. If you still want to make the EA/ED/etc. deadline, then start with a few bullet points of things you want to highlight in the essay. I think College Essay Guy (look it up!) is good, and probably others here on Reddit & this community will be great resources to check out.\n\nThe most immediate and important thing is to make sure health is taken care of. Since we're on this sub, you may want to \"power through it\", but I promise you your work will be so much better. You can do it! Let's get through this together. :)\n\n\\-love,\n\ninternet stranger",
