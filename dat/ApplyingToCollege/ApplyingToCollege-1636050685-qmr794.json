  "text": "I applied to Purdue, UVM, URI, IU etc all OOS, and I\u2019ve heard either that they are need blind or more overwhelmingly that they are need blind in state and need aware out of state. Specifically with Purdue, is it need blind or need blind for only in state students?",

      "text": "PSA, public universities tend to offer *little to no need-based* financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more.\n\nSome of the schools you have listed may offer merit scholarships to out of state students. I'm fairly certain that need-based aid is unlikely from most of them, including Purdue.\n\nRun the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.",
