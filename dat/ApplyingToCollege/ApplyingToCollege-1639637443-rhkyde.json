  "text": "i'm a junior and i've lived in california for basically the last decade so i have in-state tuition for UCs and CSUs. though my family got a spot through an employer's lottery (?) it's gonna take an eternity for green card so i don't think i'm going to count as a permanent resident by the time of applications. i don't know if it matters but i'm ORM ethnicity-wise (asian) but nationality is less common (not asia haha).\n\ni think i'm stuck in california because my parents won't support me if i go out-of-state/private for a non-T20. which is reasonable since why pay 80K a year when CA state schools are the same caliber and cheaper? to be clear they would only help pay for prestigious schools/CA publics.\n\nit's a little disheartening since before i realized i would be counted as an international i was pretty excited looking at LACs and other state schools. i know pomona doesn't regard international status for all CA residents but it's also a top LAC so not easier to get in than a T20 uni.\n\ni would call myself a pretty good student :) but not good enough to guarantee T20s or big merit scholarships so do i have any other options?\n\nso far my choices are:  \n\\-ivy-league level need-blind schools (not viable)  \n\\-T20 at full-pay (not viable)  \n\\-UC/CSU in-state (best imo)  \n\\-cc then transfer to UC (back-up plan for above)\n\ni know the smartest decision would be to stay in state, especially since i want to go to law school afterwards and the goal is the least debt possible from undergrad. i like california and i wouldn't mind college here but i'm still a little hopeful that there's other options out there. any ideas? thanks!",
