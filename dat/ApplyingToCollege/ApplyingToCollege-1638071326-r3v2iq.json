  "text": "is reporting a 3 score of an AP exam hurtful, or is it worse to not report? i wrote in my additional comments why my grades weren\u2019t great in 1st semester of 11th grade which is when i took APush (i got a C that semester)\u2026 so i cant tell if reporting the 3 shows that i\u2019m more capable of passing than what my self-reported grades reflect",
