      "text": "I agree with the above poster who said give your parents time. It's been a really tough as a mom whose kid is in another country with a closed border all this time. I haven't seen her in a year. However, we talk almost every day and I love the pics she sends of her house and school, and thriving. I might not have let her go had I known it would be impossible to see her all this time.\n\nYou'll totally thrive in Montreal too, but your parents just don't know that yet. Start to ease them into it by sharing pics of Concordia from their website and Google maps, point out how close it actually is in the grand scheme of things (Montreal is a major airport, so there are flights all the time!) Don't be aggressive about it, but do slip Concordia into conversations occasionally. Ex:\n\nThem: \"what would you like for dinner?\"\n\nYou: \"Montreal smoked meat on a bagel sounds great!\"\n\nI'm just kidding, but ykwim. Also, montreal smoked meat IS great. There's nothing else like it. Food and necessities are also really cheap there.\n\nGood luck!",
