  "text": "Hi, my dream is to go to film school or double major in film and become a director one day. What would my course load look like in high school? What are some related ECs? \n\nI\u2019ve always thought of myself as a stem kid (trying to survive ap chem rn) but I want to pursue my passion and it is risky since I\u2019m already a junior in high school but I know it\u2019s worth a shot. \n\nAny advice/experiences are helpful!",

Most top film schools still consider grades as they want to know you can handle the rigor of film classes and their general core",
