  "text": "My first college acceptance!!! I want to learn more about WPI, especially from anyone who attends/has attended/knows someone who does/did :) \n\nI live about an hour from Worcester, so I have visited multiple times, but wasn\u2019t expecting to be able to go because tuition is quite high so didn\u2019t let myself look into WPI that much. The application was free so I took a shot at it. But I did get in and the offered fin aid package is pretty good, so...yeah! :D",
