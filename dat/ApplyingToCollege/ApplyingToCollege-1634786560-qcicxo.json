      "text": "I did BME as a pre-med and I'm applying to med schools now. It's fantastic training. But like u/strict-special3607 said, it ain't easy. I had double lab most quarters to be able to complete pre-med and engineering on time. I didn't have a stellar GPA after undergrad, but I made up ground with my MCAT. That said, I wouldn't change it for anything. You'll be a better problem solver and you'll see medicine differently than traditional pre-meds.\n\nI did BME at Dartmouth, which also adds the element of liberal arts to BME and pre-med. Again, I think liberal arts is another good component of pre-med training. What you want to study (e.g. tissue engineering, biomaterials, design, etc) will help determine what makes a school good for you. Duke, Vanderbilt, UMich, Georgia Institute of Tech, and WashU also all have really strong BME, to name a few",
