Will it make any difference?",

Absent that, you\u2019re asking the school to accept \u201chope and slim chances\u201d as payment for the rest of your tuition.\n\nIt makes no sense for a school to accept someone who does not have the means \u2014 through a combination of in-hand assets and sure aid \u2014 to actually attend the school.",
