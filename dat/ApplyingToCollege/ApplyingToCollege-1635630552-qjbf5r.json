  "text": "Hi guys! I\u2019m applying to schools this semester and I can\u2019t help but constantly worry about the withdrawals on my transcripts. I have 2 EW and 2 W, 3 of them was for one course which I\u2019ll explain below for those who are interested, and the other one (EW) I withdrew from because I lost a family member and it was too hard for me to deal with school and my personal life. Basically, I was informed by other students and faculty members that withdrawals don\u2019t count against you, but some have told me that\u2019s in the case you have 1 or 2. I just can\u2019t shake it out of my head that this could be a problem in my application and I won\u2019t get accepted anywhere. Is there anyone who transferred and got accepted to their universities with several withdrawals? Also, some applications provide an option to explain situations, should I go out of my way to explain my withdrawals?\n\nExplanation for 3 withdrawals:\nI had a prerequisite course I needed to take and started it during Spring 2020. However, due to the pandemic my advisor recommended I drop it and take it again since the transition from in person to online was too difficult to the point where the professor took out half the assignments from the syllabus and was incredibly unreasonable. Over half the class dropped and I decided to take it at a community college over the summer. I waitlisted for a professor I really wanted to take but was informed she would do a raffle to choose two students on the waitlist. Because I was worried so wouldn\u2019t get chosen, I enrolled in another professors class. However, I did get chosen and decided to take it with her. Because of this I dropped the class I was enrolled in with a W. Once I withdrew I enrolled in the class with the professor I originally wanted to take. However, I found out that some of the schools I\u2019m applying to does not accept that course and the professor informed me that she is teaching the same course but would be applicable at all schools im applying to do I dropped with an excuse, leaving me with an excused withdrawal. I guess it could have been avoided but it happened and now I am left with 4 W/EW.",
