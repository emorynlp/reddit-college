          "text": ">  teaching quality is meh (most transfers miss the quality of their CC, if that tells you something)\n\nThis is a steaming hot take. I took dual-enrollment classes at a CC before starting undergrad and Cal and CC classes are not even in the same universe of rigor and quality. Mind you, I took literally all the \"advanced\" math available in a CC (diffeq/linalg). Lol, my fucking intro EE class at Cal covered more diffeq in the first couple weeks than the CC diffeq class did in an entire semester.\n\nI think these types of takes come from CC transfers who miss how easy their CC classes were ngl.\n\n(tbf though, my friends who took dual-enrollment at legit state schools like ohio state/CU boulder also felt the same way after coming to Cal, so it's not an indictment of CC classes).",

And my local CC is pretty well rated; not quite a feeder like De Anza or whatever, but still quite good. Kind of meaningless to say \"oh yeah, you can get stanford/cal profs to teach you at a cc\" when thats only true for a literal handful of them out of the thousands of CCs in California.",

Idk about you, but most people who go the CC route don't exactly have the luxury of choosing the exact CC they go to lol. And if you do have the luxury of choice (i.e. can afford to move and live in the expensive parts of the state with the best CCs), it usually is better to go to undergrad directly. \n\nTransfers (unfortunately) do usually get the short end of the stick compared to freshman admits. I can only speak for my field/major, but it's definitely harder to develop a network and make the best use of the opportunities available at a university. CS/EECS transfers from CCs generally have a lot of trouble at Cal, and I heard it was rough in other fields as well.",
