Others let them know their merit scholarship offers within a couple of weeks.\n\nBecause you don't have to make a decision until May 1 they aren't typically in a big hurry if you aren't an ED applicant.",

      "text": "The FAFSA and CSS don\u2019t open until October 1, so any rolling schools you get accepted to before then obviously cannot give offers. It usually takes few days minimum to fill out the forms (much more if your family situation is complex), then they don\u2019t start the FA until acceptance is likely, so it can be awhile. ED schools usually give offers at the ED date; EA is likely to be delayed.",
