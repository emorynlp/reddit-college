  "text": "I selected **Molecular and Cell Biology,\u00a0B.A**. in my UC application and it displays this:\n\n>You are selecting an intended major; Letters and Science does not admit students directly to majors. For more information on applying to declare this major upon admission to UC Berkeley, please visit the Berkeley Guide ([http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/](http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/)).\n\nI read the website but am still confused. Can anyone explain, please?",

      "text": "I am a current freshman at berkeley. Basically, admitted students are not admitted into the major directly, but into the college their major is in. Biology is taught through the college of letters and sciences. So, if you are admitted and your intended major is biology, you will be admitted into the college of letters and sciences. Only after you take classes in the biology major at berkeley can you then APPLY to the major itself. This actually is the case at a lot of schools, where you will be \"pre-enviornmental sciences\" or \"pre-biology\" at schools like UCSB. Berkeley just explains it differently. Hope this helps and good luck!",

              "text": "Not really, especially not for biology. If you decided you wanted to major in CS you might have some trouble. But essentially you just can\u2019t declare until you\u2019ve already done a chunk of your required classes but for most majors there\u2019s not a gpa requirement to declare. Don\u2019t take my word 100% tho Bc I\u2019m in the College of Chemistry and we start out with out majors declared.",
