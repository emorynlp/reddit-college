      "text": "You need to define middle class.\n\nIf you can spend $30k/year or so for total cost of attendance, that is pretty doable. Lots of public schools can get into that range with merit aid for international students - maybe not ones with huge international reputations, but decent schools.\n\nIf you are trying to spend like $5-10k a year, the school is losing money meeting that need. They need to value having you as a student enough to take that loss over having no student or providing aid to a domestic student.",
