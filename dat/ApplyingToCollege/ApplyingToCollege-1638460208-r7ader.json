  "text": "As I write this post, I'm eating my home-packed lunch at my desk at home. Long story short, I may have covid and I was sent home because my family got it. I had plans to do things tonight as my ED decision is coming out. Now my night and next few weeks will get colossally worse or it could even out? Ah, what a time we live in!",
