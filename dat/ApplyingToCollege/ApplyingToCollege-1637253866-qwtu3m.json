  "text": "My **1320** sat score breakdown is **730** Maths and **590** English. Would this gap of 100+ score between the two parts be a problem for an international student? Drexel's sat on average is **1200** so my composite is way higher. Intended major: Comp Sci.\n\n**(Also, my English proficiency test is already waived)**",
