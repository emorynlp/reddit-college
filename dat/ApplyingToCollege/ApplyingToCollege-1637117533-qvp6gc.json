  "text": "I was applying for fall 2022 and the applications are due end of this month. I was looking at this page and it says the following:   [https://i.imgur.com/pTiyOiQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/pTiyOiQ.png)\n\nI only did one year (freshman) of 4-year college when I attended UCI over 6 years and dropped out. I did 31 credits total in quarter system of that year. Since then, I have accumulated over 100+ credits (semester system) at my local community college. Question is, do I apply as junior or senior level?",

      "text": "I think technically you can apply at senior-level since your community college credits alone qualify you as senior-level. However, I'm not sure how that might affect your chances of going to the campus/program you want. If you're more concerned about getting in, it may be possible to transfer junior-level and then transfer credits? I have no idea how this works tbh",
