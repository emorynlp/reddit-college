  "title:": "Common App Transcript Question",
  "text": "If I apply using the common app, will my high school automatically send my transcripts to the college?  I asked my counselor and her answer didn\u2019t answer my question  - she said one she sends a letter of recommendation, she\u2019ll send the transcripts.  But I also applied to colleges where she is not sending a letter or recommendation.  Does the common app \u201ctrigger\u201d something that makes the school send the transcripts without human intervention?",
