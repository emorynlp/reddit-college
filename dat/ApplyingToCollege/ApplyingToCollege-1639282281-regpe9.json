          "text": "1. Honestly I had 2 big reasons. One, the trojan network. I'm an international student and I had still people from USC in the country. That speaks volumes to the kind of reach the USC brand has. Secondly, the kind of resources USC has to offer is something worth mentioning. I'll be honest, Dornsife has resources but they are so scattered that it's difficult to navigate them. But if you're applying to Marshal or Viterbi, it's a much better scenario. \n2. The student life is pretty cool, there's always something going on so there's never a dull moment. You can do just about anything you like, there's always parties going on somewhere or the other, as long as you got a good gang going, life's gonna be good.\n3. It's been the best 4 months bro, I've grown so much. Cause honestly this was the first time I've lived alone outside of home, so far, life's been good to me.",
