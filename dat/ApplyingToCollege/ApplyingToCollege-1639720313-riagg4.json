  "title:": "Don't Overanalyze Your Early Results",
  "text": "You worked so hard on that early application and hyped yourself so much, only to get hit with a deferral or rejection.  Now you're questioning everything:\n\n- What did I do wrong?\n\n- Do I even have a shot at all of these other colleges?\n\n- Should I even go to college at all?!?  What were these last four years even for?\n\nTake a step back and breathe.  This was one or two results, not your only chance at success in life.  So you should respond purposefully and rationally.  \n\n**1.  Relax.**  Rejection and deferral are by FAR the most common outcomes for students applying to highly selective schools.  Don't take this as an indictment on your application, your college plans, or your identity.\n\n**2.  Focus.**  Channel this ~~desperation~~ nervous energy into the things you can control rather than spiraling into self-doubt or surrender.  Take a few days to process everything.  Then focus on finishing the semester strong, finalizing some of the projects or initiatives you've been working on, crafting a quality LOCI, and doing your best on your RD applications.\n\n**3.  Stand firm.**  You will question yourself after not getting admitted.  You'll wonder if you should have tried a completely different approach with your essays.  The answer is almost always no, especially if you feel they were a compelling and positive representation of the best you have to offer.  The best way to explain this is with a story I've shared here before.  Two years ago I had a student who I thought had an awesome shot at Stanford.  He was straight up rejected REA.  I started re-reading everything, looking for what we did wrong and I discovered...nothing.  So we stayed the course and sent similar application materials to all of his RD colleges.  He was ultimately admitted to ~10 T20 colleges including Harvard and Yale.  The obvious conclusion is that Stanford missed.  By staying true to himself, this student really did maximize his chances and the strengths of his application.  Review your essays, edit them mercilessly, but don't burn it all down because one school didn't admit you.  Don't overanalyze a single data point.\n\n**4.  Remember that this is not the end.**  Early deferrals and rejections are why God made Regular Decision.  Even if that doesn't work out how you hope, you always have more opportunities to get the education you want and set yourself up for success.  You can apply to a rolling decision college, take a gap year, enroll elsewhere and transfer later, or consider colleges outside the US.  No matter what happens, by May 1 you'll have a much clearer picture of what your future holds, so focus on that instead of your dreams deferred.",

Especially for those questioning their essays.  . .  but it is worthwhile visiting the essays just to look for authentic voice, intellectual curiosity, showing not telling since some time has passed since first written.   That is just part of the drafting process.  Love this post.",
