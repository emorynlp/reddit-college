  "text": "I\u2019m a Canadian student who\u2019s trying to study in the U.S. I took a gap year because I wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted to pursue, and I also wanted an opportunity to further develop myself outside of school. I\u2019m currently working two jobs, enrolled in an online programming boot camp, and took a trip to Europe for a whole month by my lonesome. I\u2019ve also got some volunteer work set up after the New Year, but I\u2019m being very picky about how I articulate this in my essay.",
