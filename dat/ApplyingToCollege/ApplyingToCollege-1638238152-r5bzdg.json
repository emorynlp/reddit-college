  "title:": "UC App - Which year to input summer class after 9th grade",
  "text": "I took Art in the summer after 9th grade.  \n\nOn the UC App, should I report the Art class:\n\n(a) in the 9th Grade 2018-2019 Summer and check the box \"I took summer courses after this grade\" \n\nor\n\n(b) in the 10th Grade 2019-2020 Summer and check the box \"I took summer courses after this grade\" ?\n\nCurrently, I put it under Option (a) - 9th Grade 2018-2019 Summer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPer UC admissions website, I know \"summer after 9th grade count as 10th grade\" for GPA calc but that doesn't mean I need to input the \"summer class after 9th grade\" in the 10th grade year on the UC App(?).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttps://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/gpa-requirement.html\n\nFrom the UC admissions website:\n\nClasses taken during the summer after 9th grade count as 10th grade; classes in summer after 10th grade count as 10th grade; classes in summer after 11th grade count as 11th grade.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks!",
