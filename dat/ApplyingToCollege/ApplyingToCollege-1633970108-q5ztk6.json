  "title:": "Overwhelmed International Looking for Resources",
  "text": "Hello. I am an international needing full aid and all of a sudden the thought that I might not get into any schools is scaring me. I\u2019m mostly applying Ivy because I need the aid but I feel so underqualified when compared to wealthier international students. English is not my first language and I can\u2019t afford good editing resources like Grammarly Premium, so I\u2019m scared that my essays won\u2019t be good enough. I don\u2019t have a lot of support from teachers (my school doesn\u2019t have a counselor) because they don\u2019t know anything about the US college process, and I am first gen so my family hasn\u2019t been much help either. With deadlines approaching fast it feels like everything is falling apart and I don\u2019t know what to do. Are there any good counseling or essay editing (similar to grammarly) resources out there that I can use? Thanks!",

You don't need grammarly for a editing, the free version is enough for simple checking but if you feel paranoid I would use prowritingaid.  \n\nYou can go on collegevine for essay editing from a professional.",
