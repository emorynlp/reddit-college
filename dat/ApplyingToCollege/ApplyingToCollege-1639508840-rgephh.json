  "text": "Hello, I have submitted my application and paid the fee for a PhD Application at UT Austin, but I haven't yet received the MyStatus email asking me to upload the transcripts. It has been 12 hrs since I paid for my app, I am doubtful that even if I do get the email, my transcript will be under review and will cross the deadline of 15th Dec. Do you guys know if transcript remaining in review stage after deadline has passed, automatically rejects my app?",
