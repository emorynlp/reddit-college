  "text": "im getting lots of mixed opinions on this- should this be used only in the case of absolute necessity, or can i use it as something akin to that of the additional information section? like some stuff i did in my EC's were a reaction of covid, but also i dont want to use a space to talk about that if its supposed to be used to describe like bad cirucmstances that impacted preformance. help sdlkfjsdlfkj",

      "text": " No. That section is specifically intended for people who have serious circumstances like they got sick and were hospitalized for a month, parents lost their jobs, etc. Covid happened to everyone, so colleges understand that EC\u2019s were changed and online school impacted everyone\u2019s grades. Don\u2019t waste your time and energy writing something that isn\u2019t going to help your application :)",
