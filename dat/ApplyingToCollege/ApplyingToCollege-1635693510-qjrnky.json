      "text": "Berkeley, as a school, is generally more highly regarded and difficult to get into.\n\nIn terms of how \"good\" the Chemical Engineering departments are, any estimation of that is likely going to be based on the research output of each school's faculty, which you may not actually care about as an undergraduate.  That said, Berkeley is more highly regarded.  (But it's close; both are top 10).\n\nWith regard to a specific research area, e.g. nanotech, it's possible one or the other has more research going on.  Can't help you there.  At that point you may want to figure out who the big names are in that particular field and see which, if any of them, are at Berkeley or Texas.",
