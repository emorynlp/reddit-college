  "text": "CA competitive school student, 3.7 GPA, 35 ACT, 7 APs, good ECs (founded non profit, part of varsity team etc). \n\nTrying in T25\u2019s business school but they are all reachs. As UC does not take ACT, all top UCs are reach too. I want to get into tech industry as Product Manager and ideally want a program which is a combination of business and CS but all those programs have limited seats and super competitive. So I am thinking of doing major in one and minor in another. My counsler suggest going out of state is not worth it if you do not go to top college. So I am thinking I should apply for non T30 universities in comp sc. But as soon as I do that some of them become target, rather than safety for me as their CS admissions are super competitive e.g. UIUC. \n\nShould I try to CS in some non super competitive UC (riverside, Merced, Santa Cruz, not sure I will get in Davis) or should I go so out of state to some school like ASU, University of Pittsburg or Oregon State University? What are good out of state (from CA) university\u2019s for CS where I can get in based on mu profile? If apply to ASU, is there Berret Honours program worth it or I would be better doing 2 majors (cs+business) than doing that honours?",

That degree would lead to limitless possibilities. You could also pursue a minor in design. You could do this at Syracuse University (I\u2019m an admissions rep), and I think you\u2019d also be interested in our Invent@SU invention accelerator.",
