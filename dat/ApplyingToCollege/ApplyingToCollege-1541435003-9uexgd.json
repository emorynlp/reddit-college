  "text": "This doesn't affect us seniors (thank god) but starting next year they're gonna require students to register for AP tests in the fall. For most people, if they get into an early school, they will only take the tests that that school accepts for credit, but I guess the College Board wanted to put a stop to that. They're using the excuse that it's so \"students can commit to CoLLeGe-LeVeL wOrK early in the school year\", but I'm pretty sure we all know the real rea$on\n\nEdit: Here's a link https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/about-ap/news-changes/ap-2019/why-are-we-making-changes\n\nEdit 2: While we're at it, just a reminder that the College Board's CEO made $1.3M in 2009, and nineteen of its executives make more than $300,000 a year. [Here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Board#Criticism) some other fun stuff about how great the nOt-FoR-pRoFiT College Board is",

It was the General Freshman comp class everyone takes but it counted as a 5th year of English which schools like Cal Poly prefer. \n\nThey found CC classes to be a lot easier than AP, less time consuming and the high school allowed them to only take 4 classes so they were able to accommodate the college classes. \n\nWhen it was time to apply for internships they looked great because they ad over 40 units of college credit when they started college.

It doesn't cost them money, but they don't want to do anything different because it is more work for them. \n\n>If a student takes a class at the CC, the HS is not paid for the time the student could be taking the class back at the HS.\n\nThis is not true in California. I don't know how community college is funded in other states. My kids took 6 classes at high school and one or two community college classes. By the time they were juniors the school allowed them to only take 4 classes on campus and gave them time off for CC classes. In California kids in grades K-12 can take classes at the community colleges for free or minimal fees. ",

I don't even know if I'm gonna fucking pass these classes at this point, let alone if I want to take the AP test for over $100/each. It completely screwed me out of one AP test that I was going to self-study for, Calc BC, since it rushed the entire process and it was already too difficult trying to navigate everything else... there's also like a fucking $40 late fee barely a week after the deadline had past. I _highly_ doubt that CollegeBoard (or my high school) suffered any financial losses or threats by a student paying their fees less than 10 days after the \"deadline\" (which I doubt is actually a deadline but rather some arbitrary date they stamp on there). \n\nEvery single AP teacher of mine hates this new system. And not because it's new and is just taking adjusting to... but because it's flatout robbery. Like, the deadline to drop out of a course without a W (aka the grace period) barely passed a week or two ago... meaning that people, at this point, don't even know wtf they're doing at this point of the year, yet they're being forced to pay hundreds for a test months away. \n\nAt this point, I just wanna tell CB to fuck itself and then take all duel-enrollment or cc courses, but they know that's not realistic. \n\nJust to be clear, I did try warning some of you guys that this was gonna happen lol (for the people whose schools aren't doing the trial).

Only students enrolled in K-12 get the fees and tuition waived because Community College is subsidized/funded in the same way as high school and elementary school. So just like a kid in junior high can go to high school to take advanced mathematics, a student in public school can go to a public community college to take a class. \n\nIf someone graduates early from high school though they have to pay the full tuition. So if you submit a concurrent enrollment form to your guidance counsellor with all of the classes you want to take, they sign it, the principal signs it and you send it off to the community college. Then when it is time to enroll in classes you should be able to do it. If you contact the teacher ahead of time explain you are a HS student who is unhappy with AP education (college teachers usually think AP is garbage) and you were wondering if they ever have people drop from their classes, would it be worth trying to add. They almost always agree to add HS kids because they do the work and get good grades. \n\nI like the online courses, my kids preferred attending the classes in person and loved that the classes would only meet once a week for three hours, or every other day or twice a week depending on which time they picked. So they didn't have to deal with it every day like high school and the work load was a fraction of what AP work is. \n\nOne of my son's friends only got a 4 on the AP calculus test. UC Davis made him take their calculus because he was an engineering student. If he had taken the class at a CC it would have been transferable. Some CCs have wintercession classes in January. My son took an online Anthropology class in three weeks, got an A and it was transferable. He even enjoyed the material. ",

Any student who is interested in studying hard and learning the material will do regardless of when they commit.  Adding extra pressure right from the start of the class is unproductive and could be detrimental.  It is far better to allow a student time to learn as much as they can and if they feel they've mastered the material then they can take the test - to force the issue benefits no-one but you.  Many students, myself included years ago, took AP classes for the material and the extra point on UC admission in addition to the credit.  In fact, my parents suggested that I not transfer the credit because by taking the normal college-level classes students can ease a bit into college rather than skipping to more difficult classes right away.  Your own research indicates only a single additional 3+ score (3.3%) - not enough of a benefit to justify the expense and stress.  I urge you to consider the students and not your bottom-line.\n\n==",

If a college is not close, the school has to provide space and time to the student to take the class either online or as taught by a qualified on-site teacher.

UChicago does accept credit for a 5 on AP statistics, but only for general education math credit. However I plan on majoring in STEM (specifically physics) so that general education credit will be fulfilled by my major coursework anyway, meaning that the test would not provide me anything of value. However I'm also applying to UVA, which does award credit for a 4 or 5, meaning that if I were to go to UVA, the test would provide me with credit. \n\nUnder the current system, at least at my school, I have to sign up for AP tests by January 31st. This is after decisions for UChicago come out. If I get in, then I can safely elect to not take the AP Statistics test.\n\nHowever, under the new system. I won't know whether or not I got into UChicago until after the test registration deadline. This means that if if I decide not to take the test, that's a gamble saying \"I'm confident I could get into UChicago\". For the vast majority of people in my position, including me, that is a *terrible* gamble to make, so we're strongly incentivized to pay the registration fee in case we get rejected.\n\nEven worse, if we decide to hold off on deciding until after we get decisions, the College Board makes us pay an additional $40 for each test that we sign up for. And to top it all off, if we sign up for a test and don't show up, even if that test provides no value to us, we have to pay an additional $15 for not taking the test. We're literally better off going to the AP test and writing \"FUCK COLLEGE BOARD\" into our bubble sheet and doodling on our free response pages than we are just skipping the test to go to school.\n\nMultiply that by all the tests that we'd have to take, and you can see how this would add up.",

Kids hadnt figured out yet if the class was even right for them and you expect them to pay for a test they wont take till right before the end of the school year? In previous years I had students not realize the class was for them (its a big work load and a lot of reading, so if your in a lot of extra curricular or have a job or family obligations it might not be worth it). My AP who was doing the harassing kept saying it was to encourage the kids to commit to taking it, but it felt like a money grab 100%. Dont get me wrong, i like the class, and i love History. But those tests arent cheap and they are still kids trying to figure out what is right for them. All right, off my soap box.",

Made 32k/yr.  Went to grad school, spent more money, and after another 2 years, graduated from grad school with Honors. Made 42k/yr.\n\nMy husband, fucked around in high school, took NO AP COURSES, was a straight C student. Ended up getting into a small community college,  that was so easy he was able to work full-time as a Home Health Aide AND graduate with a Biology degree in 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA! Went straight into Medical School. Now makes over $500k/year.\n\nMoral of the story. When you\u2019re 35, nobody gives a shit if you took an AP course, or if you graduated from a \u201cgood college\u201d. The only people that name drop their Alma Mater after 30 are Politicians and Douche Bags. \n\nIt\u2019s all about this: What did you do with it? People want you to believe that AP courses and big name universities = success. It\u2019s the biggest lie of all time. Do not give into the lie!!!\n\nDo your parents, and yourself, a huge favor. Calm the fuck down. Enjoy high school. Go to a cheap college. Get good grades. Then go out into the world and make your mark.  \n\n",

They often have to take AP tests  on the alternate date.  (School travel off the road system is usually several days by ferry or plane, not just a late bus back from an away game).  If you have to register for a specific date *before* a spring season is set, I could see that being problematic.",

Most counselors won\u2019t tell you that honest truth (mine didn\u2019t) and only tell you about loans. The things all students should go for are outside scholarships! They save lives and can greatly reduce the amount of debt you have.\n\n- AP classes can be (and for me were) a waste of time. Most of the time the credits will not transfer over and even if they do (if you care about your education) you will find that it is better to retake those classes at whichever Uni./College you attend. They teaching styles and information could be vastly different as to what you learned in high school. The best alternative to this is taking courses at a local Uni./College.\n\n- SAT/ACT scores are important, but as we see now schools are moving away from simply judging you based upon test scores. Of course Ivy leagues will still weigh them heavily into consideration but YOU DO NOT NEED TO GO TO AN IVY LEAGUE TO GET A GOOD EDUCATION. I cannot stress this enough. There are hundreds of schools in America that are just as good (if not better) then some of the Ivys. \n\n- Last and certainly not least; make sure you visit as many of the schools you apply to before attending as you can. I understand that for some that is not necessarily possible, but if you can you should. Many of my friends are already emotional and educational wrecks because they didn\u2019t really find the school that was right for them. Always take a tour and make sure (if possible) to meet with the head of the department or some of the professors. WHAT YOU PUT IN IS WHAT YOU GET OUT. You will not always get along with everyone, but it is extremely important that you give everything your best effort.\n\nP.S. (Make sure to go to school for the reasons and degrees you want. At the end of the day it\u2019s your life, so do what makes you happy!!)",

I felt that people who had the opportunity to take post secondary classes in high school and gain college credit with them were ahead of the pack. And it seemed to be less of a hassle to transfer post secondary credits to college than making sure all your AP credits counted. As with AP credits, it seemed like there was a lot of stipulations for the credits to count. And the whole paying so much money just to take this exam really is the cherry on top, and now with this new nonsense of paying for far in advance! Wow. Unbelievable.  I wish post-secondary opportunities were more widespread, bc I really saw the benefits of it in college with my peers when I had to go the AP route due to my school not allowing post secondary (private school).

Tuition here is a just little less than 4 grand per semester as well, including all  student fees (bus pass, dental care, athletic fee, etc).\n\nHonestly the US post secondary system is beyond stupid.\n\nEdit: Apparently Universities in Quebec tried to hike tuition fees but students protested and actually got it cancelled.

I had no input as to what I wanted to do other than which AP class to take instead of another. In junior year due to scheduling issues I was unable to take APUSH and i was blamed for not trying hard enough(I still took 4 other AP classes that year and went to school 7-3 pm). \nIn my senior year I took all AP courses (one did not have an AP exam but was an AP course equivalent). I did not have a 7 am class because I had already taken both morning AP classes and I was ridiculed by my parents for not taking a morning class. \n\nOut of the 11 AP classes, I passed 9 exams (credit for 10 because I passed Calc BC but not AB). \nI took the SAT twice and ACT and got a 2010 and a 29.\n\nAnd at the end of it all? I went to community college (because I didn't get into UCLA even though I got into UCSD as a biology major). \n\nDid it all go to waste, all the money and effort? Absolutely not.\n\nThe hard work you put into the class and studying and preparing can greatly help you in future exams. Because of all the SAT practice and AP exam practice I became good at reading information, understanding it, and answered questions about it under a time crunch. This is greatly beneficial for you in a university because exams can be much harder and require a lot more depth and understanding. I know for certain that some of my peers who transferred from community college and never took AP classes that they struggled in these test taking and critical thinking applications. And at the end of it all I am still able to graduate earlier than my peers as I had huge credits from AP courses and community college courses.\n\nEven when I was forced to take these classes and exams albeit in a different way, it does not go to waste, even if the situation is shitty, I highly recommend all of you to take AP exams, regardless of what College Board does. \n\nTL;DR its not the end of the world and being forced into difficult circumstances at the end of the day can improve yourself. \n",

Gonna have to spend money to get in just like anything else. If you don't like the price then send your precious child to a trade school or to the military and then they can get thier free college. they'd probably be better off anyway since they're just going to slack off and not go to most of thier classes anyway.",

Most students who skip a class because of AP scores end up lost, confused, and struggling in the next level up. Focus on finishing *HIGH SCHOOL*, deal with college when you are **ACTUALLY IN COLLEGE**. I got into my college of choice just fine without all that shit (currently transferring elsewhere but that's neither here nor there).\n\nFocus on the here and now, where you belong. What may come, will come, as will what follows, in due time.\n\nEdit: also, take the SAT in the spring of your Junior year and again the next Fall if need be. That's it, that's all you need to do. Similar for the ACT if you need that.",

It's also going to decrease your chances of failing in your first year. So you can hate it now, but once you're there you'll appreciate it. ",

      "text": "It is unfortunate, but it is not really a surprise. My mother and I had a hunch this would happen, and it seems like it is. The shift from regular schooling to having students take college level classes has been happening for awhile. Sure, it's more pressure and money to take the exam, but it is just how education is evolving. There are more things a student has to do to get ahead of the game, and now the College Board is capitalizing on that in order to make them mandated instead of optional for, as you said, money reasons. I am more curious of what more students will have to do in later years in order to stand out. Probably will be what I am doing: enrolling into community college programs during the school year or summer break to get an associates degree early.\n\n[EDIT]\nThis is really getting downvoted? Honestly guys, this is hardly a big deal. It ain't a lot of money like /u/1millionbuckss said, the only real issue is what you will do after this. Accept it, education is changing and you just have to roll with the punches. I know everyone has been wanting to shit on college board lately from the SAT to this, but there is just nothing you can do. Downvoting me will not make this disappear, and cursing them out gets you no where either.",

          "text": "You're misunderstanding the reason that people are upset. Before, if someone got into a college early through EA or ED, they would only sign up for the tests that that college accepts. Now, since the College Board is forcing us to sign up for the test early in the year, we have to sign up every test that we think we might want to take, even if the school we end up going to doesn't accept them. Then, they charge an additional fee if a student isn't present at a test that they signed up for, so if a student decides it's not worth the trouble to take the test because their college won't accept credit from it, they'll have to pay more money.",

              "text": "I did not misunderstand. Yeah it sucks you will have to pick everything early, but is that a really a bad thing? It forces the student to actually set reasonable goals (reasonable as in if they will actually put the work in) and research early on in their education (more than, since EA and ED are early decisions already). Plus, you do not even need to buy into the APs if that is an issue. You can just go to community college if you do not want to give the college board money. But then again, you'll still be paying a lot more than just doing APs. All in all, I do not like this this change as much as the next person, but I just rather pay attention to what I should do next rather than complain.",

Sure, it does force the student to commit to taking the test, but that also means it forces the student to pay an extra $90 for something that may not benefit them. And early decision/Early Action schools come out after the AP sign-up deadline, so electing to not take a test because their ED school doesn't take it is still a huge gamble, especially considering that students here on /r/a2c tend to ED to the most selective schools in the country.\n\nBesides, it's not like the AP test is the only thing keeping a student motivated. AP classes still have grades attached to them, which for many is a bigger motivator than the test itself.",
