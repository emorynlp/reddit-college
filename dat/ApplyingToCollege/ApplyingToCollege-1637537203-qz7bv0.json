  "title:": "Messed up GPA scale on common app?",
  "text": "So I was wondering how big of a deal this was. On the the common app, it asks what your GPA is and what scale your school uses. I put that I had a 4.42 wGPA, but the scale as 5 instead of 4. I also have my class rank as 4th though so I assume if they see those together they will understand. I don't think there's anything I could do at this point about it, but even if there was, is it really that big of a deal?",
