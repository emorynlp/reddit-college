  "text": "Idk if I\u2019m allowed to post this here but it\u2019s been on my mind lately and it\u2019s related to college. I\u2019m 17 and a senior. All of my friends have had their first kisses and almost all of them have dated someone. I\u2019ve never even held hands with a guy yet I keep finding out more and more of my friends have had sex with people they\u2019ve never even dated. I\u2019m happy for all of them but I can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019m just weird. Like will I ever be able to kiss someone when I get to college if I haven\u2019t yet? I just want a bf that I feel comfortable around and I feel like that\u2019s not gonna happen in college if it hasn\u2019t happened yet",

Before that I had literally never hugged or held hands with a girl I liked, and you can forget about kissing altogether LMAO. \n\nI had spent a couple years wanting to be in relationships but not ever being in a relationship, so I was forever alone^(TM) with no end in sight. I figured I'd be alone until my parents fixed me up with an arranged marriage, so in the fall of senior year I decided that I'd just be single and work on myself. And after a couple months of that I fell into a whirlwind romance with my best friend, and here we are now. \n\nOur first kiss was AWFUL. Bad doesn't even begin to explain it. But do you know what happened? We laughed and gave it a bit of practice, and now we're pretty good at it.\n\nPoint is don't sweat it. Just work on yourself, and sooner or later you'll find that person that makes you feel whole. And it won't matter to them if you're a bad kisser, they'll work with you on it. Who knows, they may be an even worse kisser than you, and then you'll have to help them out :)",

College is where the real mingling happens, so don't be down :)\n\ntl;dr The longer you wait the better you'll first kiss will be!

DW, i'm sure we'll figure it out :) I have heard that college guys aren't much different than high school guys but I recently saw a reddit post of people where people who didn't start dating till after college shared their stories and they were able to have really great experiences. You got this!! Just don't forget that no mans is better than the wrong mans. You deserve amazing things fam :)",

      "text": "I kissed a few boys in high school. 2 out of the 3 were awful. Eeek! One was a slightly older boy but he lost interest in me quickly since I was a virgin. All in all those first kisses meant so little I almost forgot I even kissed anyone in high school. Never had a boyfriend. Boy, prom was boring with no date! Luckily, I went to prom with 10 other single ladies. Then at 19 I dated a guy from work for a few months. It was an awful relationship really as we were so mismatched but I lost my virginity to him. He moved on. What a waste but I learned what I didn\u2019t like! I went over 2 years without a date. I was so lonely. But I met another guy at work and just fell head over heels. He didn\u2019t feel the same but I casually dated him for almost a year. Then I slept with a few more guys but those relationships didn\u2019t really go anywhere. I swore off guys for a year after all that! I had only slept with 5 guys by 23. Lol So I just worked and went to school. I\u2019m kind of shy so it was hard to date, but somehow I met a guy...who really liked me a lot. I just really fell for him too. It just happened. That was almost 3 decades ago and our oldest child is a senior about to choose a college, hence why I found my way to this subreddit. No offense, but so many of you in A2C are so precious! Anyway, he\u2019s in the same boat, op. We don\u2019t talk about it, obvs, but I wasn\u2019t born yesterday! He\u2019s so good looking and smart and I feel for him for not having those relationship experiences. He wants a gf and I worry he\u2019s lonely, but he\u2019s so dang picky! My best advice for you all is to not have a list of traits for the perfect guy or girl, or only date to look for a husband or wife. Go out, join clubs or a sorority fraternity, risk rejection and just introduce yourself to people. Just date for fun. You\u2019re in control. Make out if you want to, don\u2019t have sex unless you want to. Be safe, but you have to make yourself available. Don\u2019t try so hard either because the harder you look the more guys can tell you\u2019re desperate for a serious relationship and that is like wearing a guy repellent suit. Ha! The minute you stop looking for \u201cthe one\u201d options appear without you even realizing it. Looking back I wish I wasn\u2019t so picky and dated more for fun and not in hopes of finding a boyfriend. I wish I smiled more and I certainly wish I had more fun. Oh, and getting drunk doesn\u2019t help matters! FYI!! ;) Be safe kids, have fun, make lots of new friends and get a good education! The more you have going on in your life the more attractive you\u2019ll be, so get some hobbies and that degree!",

Most of the guys in highschool are immature anyways. I've been in some romantic situations with a few different guys throughout high school but I knew that I didnt want to have my first kiss with someone I wasnt 100% sure about or when I didnt feel comfortable and ready. Just know that if you havent had it isnt a negative reflection on you. Rather it could be positive in that you know your self worth and you that you are strong confident and independent to not fall for external pressures and only do what feels right to you.",

What other people are saying is all valid, importantly don't focus on societal \"timelines\". \n\nI myself, have still never kissed anyone or been in a relationship. Those weren't anywhere in my priority list for a long time. I have however gotten my degree early, paid off all my student loans (35-40K total), and advanced in my career. My mental health has improved greatly and my self reflection from that work has helped me form deep bonds with the people I consider my friends. \n\nThe rest of the responses are more on point, and please don't take this as discouragement. Or advice. Just that you shouldn't feel bad about being on one path and wishing it was another. And that it's never too late to cut through to a path that is a better fit for you. \n\nI feel anxiety over not having any relationship experience by now. What calms me is knowing that anybody that holds that against me probably isn't someone I'd want to date anyway. Have empathy for all. Hope this helps.",

It\u2019s completely normal and do not rush things over. People who have kissed or are in relationships are not always happy I guarantee you that, especially the ones that dated many. It\u2019s too long to explain, but the short version is that you don\u2019t need to be others, just continue with your life. Needing a partner should be an extension of your life, not someone that is essential. As long as you\u2019re happy then a partner is an addition to that happiness, not the whole thing. Just focus on your studies and it\u2019ll come by itself. Looking for a serious relationship is way better than randomly dating and hooking up with people as this causes so much trouble in your life IMO.",

I had had a girlfriend by that point but it was like a middle school relationship where we were \"dating\" but not really. Going into college, I didn't know what would happen and feared nothing would. It did eventually happen and I dated someone for a year and a half and I learned a lot from it.\n\nIf I can give any advice, if you want to be comfortable with the person you date, find them in places you are comfortable. Do things you like doing and that allow you to express yourself and you'll find people that will understand you better because they share that interest. And don't sacrifice your boundaries for anyone. This is really easy to let happen with your first relationship. The inexperience tells you to be relaxed and forgiving because you don't want to be a hard ass but boundaries are healthy and necessary. Boundaries keep you from being hurt. If they care about you, they won't want to hurt you and will respect your boundaries. Keep in mind, boundaries don't just mean sexual thing, but say if you have a strict sleeping schedule and are in bed by 10, that's a boundary and they need to respect that.",
