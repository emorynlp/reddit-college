  "title:": "why do people think applying ED is bad?",
  "text": "i\u2019m EDing to a top 10 school (duke)\nmy friends were shocked when i told them and asked why i would lock myself in. i overheard a lot of kids in my grade saying they would never apply early decision unless they had bad stats and it was their last resort. they are all applying regular to keep their options open for better schools. \n\nmy mom also said that if i get in ED, i should not tell anyone i got in until the regular decision results come out since my peers would assume i only got in because i applied early and think that i\u2019m not actually smart enough to get in regular. i also have a sibling currently attending so they\u2019ll assume the legacy+ed combo means i have no merit? she thinks it won\u2019t even be the slightest bit impressive if i tell anyone i got in early.\n\ni know i shouldn\u2019t care what others think, but it\u2019s honestly so tiring \u2014 why is there such a stigma against applying early decision if i know i want to go to a certain school? anyone else have a similar experience?\n\nalso why do so many people at my school not apply early at all, like not even REA which doesn\u2019t even force you to attend the school? is it just an ego thing, are they lying, or is it related to financial aid?",

The idea that there would be any need/value for them to lower their standards during the ED round defies logic.",

      "text": "The main reason to avoid applying ED is that you don\u2019t have a top choice and would like to see what your aid packages look like before you commit.  Or, perhaps you didn\u2019t have a chance to visit your top schools or delve deep into your majors of interest.  Applying EA gives you a chance, once application season is over, to spend a little time researching the programs at your favorite schools to see which one is the best fit for your particular interests.\n\nBut I\u2019m writing primarily \u2014 as a parent\u2014 to tell you that I\u2019m very sorry your mom is preemptively undermining your achievement should you get into Duke.  Anyone who has a true favorite college and can afford that college is leaving cards on the table if they don\u2019t apply ED.  It would be foolish NOT to up your chances by applying ED \u2014 it\u2019s simply a matter of declaring that XXX college is your top school.  It\u2019s the ultimate demonstration of interest. Your mom\u2019s view is akin to saying you should skip an offered interview because it might give you an advantage over an applicant who chose not to interview. That\u2019s nuts.\n\nGetting into Duke is impressive, period.  It doesn\u2019t matter if you applied ED, have a legacy connection, or amazed a soft-hearted admissions officer by saving a herd of wild alpacas from destruction.  Duke admissions does not conduct pity parties.  If you get in, they wanted you.  If you get in, celebrate your good fortune, tell your friends, and recognize that the college application process doesn\u2019t always bring out the best in parents. Very best of luck to you.  Enjoy ALL your acceptances and rest assured that you\u2019ll very likely have a terrific college experience no matter where you go.",
