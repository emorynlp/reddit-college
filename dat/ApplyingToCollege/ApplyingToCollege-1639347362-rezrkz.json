      "text": "There are different kinds of full rides because of the different kinds of aid available. The two main categories are merit based and need based scholarships. Merit scholarships are the ones you apply to - the instructions for those will be on the college's website. If it's an external scholarship (like QuestBridge), you apply through their platform. Some schools will even automatically consider you for merit scholarships that may also be full ride as long as you apply.\n\nNeed based scholarships are based only on your family's financial condition. If your family's expected financial contribution (EFC) is $0 as judged by the college, you could effectively receive a \"full ride\" to that school.\n\nFor most people, merit scholarships are the best way to receive a full ride to a school. Keep in mind that these scholarships are very competitive!",

      "text": "Full ride usually means a non-need-based scholarship that covers the full \"cost of attendance\", i.e. tuition + room and board.\n\nThere are also non-need-based \"full tuition\" that only cover tuition.\n\nUsually when you apply you're also considered for these scholarships.  Sometimes there is an additional application, but not always.  It varies by school.  Often you're required to apply by the \"Early Action\" deadline, or before some priority deadline.\n\nTypically, in order to win one of these, you need to be in the very top cohort of applicants to a given school.\n\nThere are also hybrid need/merit scholarships.  These are usually awarded according to the same criteria as non-need-based, but have financial need as a prerequisite (which results in a smaller pool of students being considered).\n\nSome schools will give you your merit award with the acceptance letter, others send it a few weeks later.  Highly competitive (\"full ride\") scholarships often require finalists to attend an on-campus event, which includes interviews.  Those are usually during the spring.  So, in that case, you wouldn't find out whether you won until after you attended that event.",

      "text": "Often \"full ride\" (as mentioned, traditionally refers to a *merit scholarship* covering tuition, room, and board), is confused with *need-based* financial aid that \"meets full need.\" Schools that meet full need will calculate how much you need, based on their own formula.\n\nFor domestic students, for *need-based* aid, you can google a list of colleges that meets full need. Many colleges also offer need-based aid but might not promise to meet full need. Run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.) Federal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow. Larger loans require a parent signature and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow.\n\nIf the need-based estimate does not make the college affordable for your family, then look for merit scholarships. Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves. Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college.\n\nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: [https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/](https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/); see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family.",

      "text": "That entirely depends on the school, and there is no fixed answer here. Most private schools, particularly schools with FA policies that are need-based, will review a financial statement from all FA applicants (a FAFSA and/or CSS), and if the applicant has an income which may require a full ride to afford, they might receive one if admitted. Albeit, many other schools may not give.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost schools which follow merit based FA/scholarships will have some form of requirement which certain applicants may meet and therefore get a 'full ride' if the merit scholarship is one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome schools, mostly state schools, may also have honours programmes which may give full rides -- most of them have a separate application process on top of the normal admissions process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's a good wiki article on a list of schools in the US which are need-blind for FA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need-blind\\_admission",
