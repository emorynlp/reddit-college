I haven\u2019t left my house in well over 3 months because I have been to busy applying to colleges, working, and watching oomie zoomies. I have spent so much time in the same chair that the cushions has worn all the way down and now there is just a wooden panel. What are some of the best things that I can be doing outside that doesn\u2019t not involve social interaction and do not take more than 30 minutes (I still have a bajillion sups to write)",
