  "title:": "Can we ban predatory college admissions counselors from this sub?",
  "text": "If you've been on this sub and r/chanceme for long enough, I'm sure you would have seen certain admisions consultants commenting on posts, feeding into students worst fears by giving them terrible advice and then subtly plugging their own services as a fix it all solution. It's incredibly predatory and goes against everything this sub stands - being a safe place for kids (and sometimes parents) who are all going through the same grueling college admisions process to help each other out.\n\nWhile it's true that some counselors on this sub like u/admissionsmom are doing a great job moderating the sub and helping us high school students, I can't help but feel terrible for all the kids who get taken advantage of by the ______ of the world (don't want to name drop but I'm sure most people know who I'm talking about). Like  which legit college counseling service provides \" 10$+ Chance Me services\" and gives feedback like \"if you go test optional your application will be thrown out\"? What a pathetic joke \ud83e\udd21\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude24\n\nAnd you know the worst part is? The people getting taken advantage of are usually low or middle income students who can't afford proper counseling services and instead get sucked into this nonsense of a slightly cheaper alternative. As a sub, we have a duty to band together and call for this kind of predatory behavior to be banned.",

I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they mean well, but their advice is so incredibly flawed; this is my worst experience with them:\n\n\\-----\n\nLow income applicant needs full financial aid and makes a post on r/chanceme. On their list is UMich, UCLA, and UC Berkeley.\n\nOP is not a resident of Michigan or California, and because UMich and UC schools don't provide any financial aid to OOS students, it'd cost OP $69,000 a year to attend.\n\nSo, I commented \"You should cross those off your list\" and provided some other schools for OP to look into, like UT Dallas, which is great for CS and would be in-state & affordable for OP.\n\nIVY BROTHERS replied to my comment saying \"Stop telling OP to approach life with a defeatist mindset.\"\n\nI was in shock. Like are you f---ing kidding me? \"Defeatist\" for telling a low-income applicant to not apply to a school that would cost them $69,000 a year?

I guess the proofreading and making sentences more clear was okayish but the advice they gave me was 100% objectively wrong (and I'm saying this AFTER verifying it from an admissions officer that the advice they give me was absolute BS). \n\nHonestly, I'm not really fond of paying $100+ just to get my essay slightly reworded and given bad (and very wrong) advice. \n\nThe worse part? I'm a low income student and cannot afford to hire someone who actually knows what they're saying now that I already dipped all my money into the BS service to save maybe 10 dollars.",

It pisses me off to no end that people will exploit others for financial gain. Especially young people, who have less experience and are only able to go by what others tell them. They're vulnerable.",

      "text": "Ok this is a take from someone who used their services. \n\nSo I used 1 essay class with them. To be honest their services were quite so-so for the amount they charge. In terms of helping me with my essay, they helped me think of a decent hook (didn\u2019t end up using but was still quite unique) and take out a bit of unnecessary information. Both are quite knowledgeable and try their best to help in whatever way the can. I think the biggest thing to keep in mind is they are both students. They are just trying to get by like anybody else. I think this post is a bit too harsh and there\u2019s a bit of unwarranted hate but I see where you\u2019re coming from. Tbh I too dislike the  test optional (respect if u like it tho) so I didn\u2019t really find a problem with that. A thing I really liked is they tried their best to be accommodative with their prices as I\u2019m low income. In the end they aren\u2019t that bad as you make them out to be but I def see why some of their comments may have spurred a bit of controversy.",

I get the impression that \"professional\" admissions charlatans put up these posts everywhere to boost demand for their \"services\" in general.  \"Chance me\" stuff is particularly hilarious... looks like middle aged losers on a power trip pretending to know something special and probably pleasuring themselves imagining the young girls and boys yipping for their invaluable advice...",
