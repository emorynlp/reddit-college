  "text": "Had my Harvard interview recently, and here are some of the questions my interviewer asked me:\n\n1. Tell me a little bit about yourself. \n2. What will you do in the future?\n3. Why homeschool?\n4. What does homeschooling look like for you? (I'm currently dual-enrolling for most of my homeschool classes at a local college, and the interviewer asked a lot of questions about the college classes I'm taking)\n5. What is your social life like in homeschool?\n6. What are you doing to do after college?\n7. What other schools are you applying to?\n8. Do you have any questions for me?\n\nHope these questions help y'all, especially for any homeschoolers here! I didn't really prepare much for the interview since the interviewer wanted to meet within the next two days after I got the email. The interview was pretty chill and I kinda just said whatever came to mind.",
