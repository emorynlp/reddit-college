  "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI\u2019m currently in a very fortunate/unfortunate position where I receive no need based aid from colleges, but my parents are able and willing to cover my college costs regardless of where I go.\nBecause of this, I was wondering if I should indicate that I require need based aid from colleges? I\u2019ve heard that some colleges give slight preference to full pay students cause they can\u2019t give aid to everyone. \n\nThanks for any help!",
