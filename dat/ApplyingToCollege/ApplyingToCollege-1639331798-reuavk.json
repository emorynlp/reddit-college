  "text": "My school uses Maia Learning to submit LORs and other required docs on the Common App. My counselor submitted all my LORS and transcripts for all the schools I'm applying to before I've submitted my Common App and supplemental parts of the application. The \"Teacher evaluations\" now say \"Submitted\" on the \"Recommenders and FERPA\" section of the Common App.\n\n1. Does that mean my college counselor has finished sending everything and doesn't need to do anything else now that it says \"submitted\" on the Common App? I wasn't sure because my counselor is new and they said that I have to send in my Common App first (which I can't finish before winter break starts) before the system allows her to officially send all the docs.\n2. \"Teacher evaluations\" on the Common App includes the teacher evaluation form and the LORs too, right?",
