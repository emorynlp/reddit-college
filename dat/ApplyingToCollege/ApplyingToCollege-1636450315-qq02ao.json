  "text": "I\u2019ve seen some crazy numbers on this sub, and I\u2019m wondering as a senior how many you really need. For context, I\u2019ve taken about 7 APs (1 sophomore , 3 junior and 3 senior) and 3 honors (1 freshman, 1 sophomore, and 1 senior). My school doesn\u2019t have much honors. I also have 1 dual enrollment at a cc for my art cred. I\u2019ve seen on sites that you should generally take 3-4 ur junior and senior year, but how does this hold up? I also got a 1580 on my SAT and have a 3.8+ UW.",

      "text": ">How many APs do u really need to get into a t20.\n\nZero, if your school doesn't offer them.\n\nIf your school does offer them, then it depends.  A maximally difficult schedule in the five core areas (language, math, science, social studies, foreign language) usually yields around 10.  Various online sites recommend \"7 to 12\", \"10 to 14\", \"8 to 12\" and \"minimum of 8\".\n\nSome report that the average student enrolled at Harvard took 8.\n\nIf you take so many that your grades suffer or you burn out, then that's \"too many\".\n\nHere's what a maximally difficult schedule would look like at my kid's school (in terms of AP exams):\n\nLanguage:  Lang/Comp, Literature\n\nMath: Calc AB, Calc BC\n\nSS: World History, U.S. History, Gov+Econ (semester each)\n\nScience:  two (take your pick, taken Jr. and Sr. year)\n\nLanguage: Lang/Culture\n\nThat's 11 in the core areas w/o any additional taken as electives.  I suspect adding more would not move the needle much, excluding situations where a course is directly related to one's intended major.  (If you want to study CS then definitely take the CS exam, e.g.)",
