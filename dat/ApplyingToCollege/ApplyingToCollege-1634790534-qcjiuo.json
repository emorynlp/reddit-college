  "text": "I need to add courses from outside of school (e.g. BYU, UC Scout, Community College) on the application. I've taken multiple classes from these institutions and have already sent my transcripts from these institutions to them. Despite this, the \"Other Courses,\" part of the CommonApp doesn't allow me to list these schools. How would I go about self-reporting these on the CommonApp? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI appreciate any help, and thanks in advance!",
