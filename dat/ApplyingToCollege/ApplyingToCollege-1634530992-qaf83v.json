  "text": "I selected yes Hispanic/Latino for ethnicity but I just left race blank, like I\u2019m visibly not white but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to select Native American. I know this probably sounds paranoid but I\u2019m just wondering.",

      "text": "Most Hispanics are a combination of white, African and Indigenous (the US census definition of Native American includes central and South American indigenous people).  In the Common App you can select all, none, or a combination. There is also a text box that pops up so you can explain any affiliation so that you are being transparent. But it is fine to identify as Latino and leave it blank,I don\u2019t think adding the race below impacts much as typically once you select Hispanic, you fall into that \u201dbucket\u201d for federal reporting regardless of having multiple race categories. Hope that makes sense.",

      "text": "Some schools and business get tax breaks for hiring different types of people and so the checking of the boxes helps them meet those quotas. . For example in the disability section if they\u2019re filling their slots for folks who fall into that category. They may start reviewing resumes that have anything in the disability box area checked before reviewing the folks that have left that area blank.",
