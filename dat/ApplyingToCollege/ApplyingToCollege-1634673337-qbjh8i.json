          "text": "Iowa & Iowa State have good engineering programs, especially Iowa State, I may be biased though. Depends on what major you are going for though. I'd say Iowa State over Iowa for ag, environmental, mechanical, computer. Iowa over ISU for biomedical. The others idk, may be equal. I'm in ag engineering, where ISU beats Cornell. \n\nBut they are definite safeties. Automatically accepts based on RAI, a simple equation. Most every C student can get accepted automatically. If not, you just have to write a short essay on why you want to go to university. If you can take out a loan, you go to Iowa public universities.\n\nShort note, our legislature is trying to take away tenure & \"protect\" conservative students. I don't know if it'll affect engineering departments too much, but just an FYI.",

No losers in that bunch; they're all amazing and among the best in the world. Between academic ag and industry, North American agriculture is pretty amazing: GPS-enabled tractors optimizing fertilizer by the square foot based on prior years' data on yields (scanned on-the-fly at harvest) and weather -- with big data forecasting on the back-end. I was shocked when I learned how high-tech and data-intensive modern ag can be.",
