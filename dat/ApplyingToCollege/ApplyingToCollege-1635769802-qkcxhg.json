  "title:": "Should I reapply? And where?",
  "text": "I applied to college last year as an international student without the SAT (COVID, yay). I applied to 16 colleges and was rejected from 11 (waitlisted at 4). It was basically like having every anxiety dream I've ever had come true. It really, really, really sucked.\n\nNow I'm reapplying to universities in the UK this year because I ended up not taking the offer I had there last year and I'm considering whether I should reapply to the US at all? I've got okay grades (3.48 UW GPA/ 4.18 W) with some mitigating circumstances for why they dropped off a bit in my sophomore year. Based on practice tests, I think I'd score >1380 on the SAT, I've got decent extracurriculars and good LORs. My personal essay last year may have been a bit too personal lol but the balance between meaningful and TMI is also really personal so I don't know.\n\nBut being rejected last year almost sent me into a depressive spiral and I'm just not sure if it's worth doing it all over again when the only thing that will have changed is a) I'm applying to fewer colleges, b) I'm applying with my SAT and c) I'm currently doing courses at a local university (one of the best in my country tbf).\n\nIf I do reapply, I want to narrow it down to 5-6 colleges so that brings me to my second question. Based on this list of colleges, is there anywhere I have a shot at with these stats (they don't need to be safeties, just not all reaches):\n\nAmerican University, Boston U, George Washington, Penn State, NYU, UCSD, USC, UVA, Bryn Mawr, Mount Holyoke, Colby, Fordham, Boston College\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: also, I need to decide in the next two days which is why I'm so stressed about it :))",

                  "text": "Well the others in the same category is because I think the SAT might improve my chances. I turned down BU last year because it would have cost me 80 000+ per year and that just wasn\u2019t doable. This year I\u2019ve got better funding sources + I\u2019ll be applying for more scholarships. BU is pretty much my dream school so I just don\u2019t want to give up completely yet I guess",
