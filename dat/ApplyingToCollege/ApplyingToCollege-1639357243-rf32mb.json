I prefer to stay in-state if possible. Don\u2019t care abt sorority/party culture too much. Preferably somewhere with at least decent to large sized city (like has its own chick fil a at the least). Or even somewhere very close to a large city. Preferably left leaning. I want to go into some kind of computer adjacent field (comp sci, web design, etc. not sure exactly what though). What schools might be good places to apply? \n(white, bi, female)\nstats:\n\u2022 1160 pre-sat\n\u2022 only extracurricular is that I\u2019m going to be a summer camp counselor\n\u2022 over 4.0 weighted gpa (not sure of exact or unweighted)\n\u2022 I have been the treasurer of a club during my sophomore and junior year (likely senior year as well)\n\u2022 have over 900 hours of customer service work (fast food specifically) experience.\nedit: to fit the requirements of a reverse chance-me",
