I asked for LORs, but have just received one, my essay is nowhere near done and the only part I remember is empty on my common app general info is awards because I\u2019ve procrastinated it. But I haven\u2019t done the colleges questions, essays, gotten my documents (intl ppl need to translate them) and so more, like taking an English proficiency test. You\u2019re good, keep calm, breathe a bit and get to work. You\u2019ve got this!",
