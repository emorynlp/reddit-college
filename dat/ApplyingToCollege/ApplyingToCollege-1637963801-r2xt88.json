      "text": "At my school, we read in whatever order we personally find most intuitive. At the few schools that practice Committee Based Evaluation, they split the components between two people. You can find descriptions of that style in articles about CBE.\n\nMy order is usually: transcript & HS profile (if you don't know a school well, you might have to toggle back and forth a bit), counselor items (SSR, rec letter), teacher recommendations, and then the student's application. The student's part is me saving what can be the most entertaining part for last. I love the essays. \n\nSometimes I start with the student's app and read up to the essays (so ending with the pages that show activities), move through the school documents, then finish with the essays. The essays are sort of like dessert, if that makes sense. :)",

      "text": "i think the process depends on the school, but i think they first look at ur initial demographics such as where ur from, intended major, legacy, siblings applying,etc. then, they look at ur school profile to get an idea of ur course offerings, where u lie within ur graduating class (such as like top 10%). once they get an idea of ur school, they look at ur transcript to see if ur on par with the most rigorous course offerings and if u succeeded within them. depending on the university, they will also probably recalculate ur gpa if it\u2019s a part of their process (such as uga). after, they cover the rest of ur demographics such as test scores and ec\u2019s to see if u will get past the preliminary stages of admission. if u move forward, they will most likely move on to ur personal statement and supplemental essays, however, even if u may not meet their academic standards, they will probably still look at ur essays since it\u2019s still a major part of the admissions process and a killer essay can help ur chances at admission. at this point, they will review anything else u included in ur application and come to a decision that they will share in front of an admissions committee to see if they all agree, disagree, or are somewhere in the middle. again, this process may differ from school to school, however, i think this is the general process that most of them will follow despite some slight changes.",

      "text": "I am only speculating because only a true AO would know, but I think you can apply some logic to it and get a pretty good idea. \n\nObviously easy information gets processed first. SAT, GPA. Demographic info. That's an easy filter and would probably be where I'd start. \n\nThen if you passed those first parameters I think I'd open up your resume and see your ECs. Again, this is easy info to digest because a resume is straightforward.\n\nAnd then if you've kept my interest, fine let's read your essays or your rec letters. That would take longest so it'd make sense to do it last.",
