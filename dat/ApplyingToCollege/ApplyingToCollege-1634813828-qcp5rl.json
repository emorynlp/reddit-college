  "title:": "Does an unbalanced SAT score matter?",
  "text": "So I took the SAT for the second time in August and got a score of 1430 (780EBRW, 650M). I was super happy with this and decided not to take the test again. Now, though, I have started looking at the 25th-75th percentile of SAT scores for the colleges on my list, and I have noticed that my score is a little unbalanced. My reading score is putting me above the 75th percentile at most schools, but my math score is sometimes putting me below the 25th percentile, although usually it\u2019s within range. I\u2019m pretty bad at math and applying to colleges as an English major, so my question is: How much does this matter? My overall 1430 puts me in the range (sometimes barely) of my schools, so will they really care that it\u2019s a bit of an unbalanced score?\n\n\n(For reference, I am likely applying to Amherst College, Barnard, Brown*, Mount Holyoke, Oberlin, Smith, UCONN, UVM, Wellesley, Wesleyan University, Williams, and Yale*)\n\n*I know I have no shot at the Ivy Leagues, my parents are just making me apply there",
