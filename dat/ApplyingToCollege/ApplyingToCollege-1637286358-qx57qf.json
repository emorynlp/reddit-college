  "text": "Are there any other international students who feel completely and utterly lost with the Common/ Coalition app? I literally have no clue how to feel out some of these questions.\nIs Alevel part of secondary school? \nI have no idea how many students were even in my graduating class or my rank. \n\nAm I totally going to miss out on opportunities cause I\u2019m procrastinating putting in my information? \n\nAlso how do interviews work for college? My regional university just emails you to say \u201cyou\u2019re in\u201d with a physical letter later.\n\n:(",
