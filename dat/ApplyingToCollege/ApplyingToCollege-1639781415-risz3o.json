  "text": "Hi everyone, my friend and I are sitting down and typing this post to express how wonderful and atrocious our time on A2C was. This subreddit has provided an outlet for all of our emotions, both good and bad; we have found comfort in the posts of our brethren. Yesterday, I was admitted to Brown, and my friend to Cornell.\n\nBefore admissions, we would constantly go to this one coffee shop and sit for hours, wallowing in our despair and anxiety. We would scroll through this subreddit, grasping for any news about our decisions. Now we are sitting at the same coffee shop, listening to merry christmas music, and reflecting on these past four years.\n\nFor the first time in a long time we feel pure unadultrated joy. We have an unprecedented amount of free time LOL. We are manifesting a happy ending for the rest of class of 2022. Your hardwork will not go unnoticed, and trust that you will end up wherever you are meant to be. As cheesy as that sounds, I KNOW that all the effort you put into your applications in the next two weeks will be worth it.\n\nThanks for a rollercoaster of a year!!",
