I think many people in our situations think they aren\u2019t college bound\u2026especially if they came to a subreddit like this. I\u2019ve had more B\u2019s than C\u2019s either way just APPLY!",

      "text": "Don't beat yourself up. 2.7 is a nice solid C+ and will get you into a lot of schools, depending on your Extracurriculars, course rigor, and other character traits.\n\nCommunity college is a great option so definitely consider it, either for an associates degree or as a way to improve your grades and transfer to a uni. But there are also great film schools that have higher acceptance rates. Off the top of my head: Central WA, Chapman, Loyola Marymount, Central Michigan, Emerson\n\nAt the very least, there are 4 year universities with near-100% acceptance rates, such as UWyoming and UMontana. \n\nYou're fine. 2.7 shows you worked to get through school, but maybe you just needed motivation. Prove that film is your motivation in an essay.",
