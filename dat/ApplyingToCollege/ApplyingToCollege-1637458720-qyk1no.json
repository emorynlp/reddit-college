  "text": "i've been looking into application requirements for some colleges recently and I noticed a lot of them want 4 full year courses (for example Northwestern). The thing is, my school only has 4 full year courses, and the one I would be taking senior year I just know would destroy my mental health. \ud83d\ude43 So I was thinking I would take 2 one semester courses during my senior year. Would this have a significant effect on my applications or am I overthinking this?",
