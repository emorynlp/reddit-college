      "text": "Nah, you\u2019re a freshman. It certainly will lower your chances, but they won\u2019t be zero. Most colleges allow for more leeway with freshman year grades, plus it\u2019s only the first semester. (Has the semester already ended?) \n\nAn upward trend is beneficial, gpa from one semester doesn\u2019t completely tank overall gpa, and if it\u2019s a short lived dip you can explain it away with extraneous circumstances, so long as you improve from now on. \n\nPlus, prestige isn\u2019t as useful as people think it is, and a lot of amazing schools (depending on major) accept people with <3.0 overall GPAs (with good other sections of the application)\n\nYour school might also have a system to replace failed grades with equivalent courses taken online/over summer. Try asking your counselor about that.",
