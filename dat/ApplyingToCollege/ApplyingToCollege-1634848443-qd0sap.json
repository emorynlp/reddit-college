  "text": "I'm an intl student. Taken O Levels (8A+) and A Levels (2A+ and a predicted score of A for the upcoming exam) with an SAT score of 1420. School grades are also straight A+ throughout high school.\nI've got normal ECAs, have done community service before and leading the project for another one in the upcoming months, co-founder of a soccer club, into cricket and badminton, have done coding courses by my own online and got certificates for it too. I've also hosted an MUN, done some school function and ceremony hosting too. \nI'm really not sure of how to tackle my university list. Everyday I'm in doubt over my list and constantly go through it, searching for anything better on the net. I'm paranoid that ultimately I'll not get admitted into any desirable university. \nConsidering my profile, what do you reckon might be a university that'll look at me and say, 'This lad has a solid chance here'? Preferably no LACs.\n\nAlso a side question:\nWhich gives you a greater boost? ED or REA?",
