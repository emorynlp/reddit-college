  "title:": "Can I use TikTok as an EC/Activity",
  "text": "I have a tiktok account with over 160k followers and over 10 million likes. I generally make high quality videos (but I do make more low effort ones that are more just trends). Would it be bad to use this as an Extra Curricular activity? \n\nMore that a few of my videos have required editing in adobe after effects/premier pro. I\u2019m applying for computer science so I\u2019m not sure if adding this as an extra curricular would be wise. I do spend a lot of time on it though. Also if I do should I include my account handle?",
