  "text": "For anyone unaware, a captain\u2019s practice are just practices run by students in the off season of a sport - no school factuality are allowed to act as coaches. \n\nI was wondering if when college application time comes around if I\u2019ll be able to count that time in my hours of that activity? \n\nIt\u2019s a pretty heavy schedule so I just want to know before I commit myself to it, or if I could be doing something else more useful with my time. Obviously, being able to put something on my college applications isn\u2019t the only reason I\u2019d want to do something, but it\u2019s something I definitely consider lmao. Thank you!",
