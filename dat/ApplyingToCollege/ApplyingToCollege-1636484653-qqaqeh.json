  "text": "We are very very lucky to have a lot of inherited wealth. I know that. \n\nAs my daughter is applying and getting into colleges, I keep getting emails about her having not filled out her FAFSA applications. The problem is, my wife and I don't want to disclose that info. They seem to call for very specific documentation and descriptions of our assets and net worth, and we don't want to share that stuff, especially with colleges she might not choose to attend. \n\nDoes anyone know whether FAFSA is required if you're lot looking for any kind of aid?",
