The hard truth is that financial aid is based on parents\u2019 ability to pay, not desire to pay. \n\nYou should definitely discuss the situation with NYU. But you should also be applying to colleges which don\u2019t require the CSS Profile (we\u2019re talking thousands!) This advice assumes that your father is your non-custodial parent (meaning you don\u2019t live with him.)",
