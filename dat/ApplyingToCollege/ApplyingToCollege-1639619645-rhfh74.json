  "title:": "Reflections from a current Penn M&T student",
  "text": "Here are some things that I've learned so far at Penn:\n\n\\- M&T students are honestly some of the most incredible people I've ever met. They're so motivated, and some I know will wake up at like the crack of dawn for their passion projects and are so invested in it. It's honestly insane.\n\n\\- The classes are actually hard. If you slack off for a week, it's really hard to get back on track. Engineering intro classes honestly are the worst and are driving me absolutely crazy right now.\n\n\\- Penn has a pretty campus. I never did a campus visit, and my first impression of Penn was honestly kinda lackluster. I thought the mix of modern and old buildings was kinda ugly and overall wasn't very aesthetic. However, I've really come to appreciate how pretty Penn's campus is, especially during the fall and winter. I think the super hot humid summer was not the best first impression. Also, I didn't like how \"small\" Penn's campus was, but I find myself getting my daily steps in walking back and forth on campus because Engineering and Wharton are on different sides.\n\n\\- Party culture is big here. There are always things going on throughout the week and you'll never run out of things to do. Work hard play hard really exists. People I know will go out multiple times a week and pull all-nighters all the time to get stuff done. And they get it done.\n\n\\- Penn's favoritism for Wharton is real. They have nice fancy modern buildings and only Wharton students can book study rooms in there. The building where I have my math class has mold problems. Also, Wharton splits freshmen into \"cohorts\" where they plan bonding trips every once in a while and give you free food. The majority of Wharton kids don't have classes on Friday, and the classes are the EASIEST. I spend like an hour a week max on my two Wharton classes.\n\n\\- Penn is very pre-professional. Yes, I knew this going in and it was one of the reasons I chose Penn. However, I was not expecting coffee chats to be the \"norm\" and walking around seeing people in suits all the time. In addition, the standard for pre-professional club applications is several essay questions and 2 interviews.\n\n\\- The food here is meh. I've been to the dining halls like once in the past month because the food is so \\~bland\\~ and I can't bring myself to walk in the cold for it. The food trucks here are amazing and cheap though.\n\nThat's about it lol, I'm gonna get back to finals prepping \ud83d\ude14",
