  "text": "I went to my old high school (graduated 2017 had to do mandatory service so applying now). I live in a country which doesn\u2019t really apply to US colleges. \nMy principle said that we don\u2019t have any form of a school profile, we have nothing to really describe the school in an official form. She has nothing to upload in its stead. \nWhat should I do? This is out of my control and I have no idea what to do",
