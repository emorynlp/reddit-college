      "text": "tbh\u2026 getting rejected is not something you can really cope with immediately (especially if its your \u2018dream school\u2019). \n\nThe first few weeks are (unsurprisingly) the hardest ones and even afterwards its just a very slow process. Perhaps its not even something you will \u2018accept\u2019 (in the sense of moving on and not feeling any sort of regrets/sorrow) to a full extent anytime soon (I know my rejections still ache). In that regard, it is correct that \u2018no matter what happens, you will be _okay_\u2019 but you should know that \u2018okay\u2019 does not really mean being the same or feeling indifference\u2026\n\nWith that in mind, please give yourself the time to process what has happened and know that it\u2019s okay to feel sad, not wanting to get out of bed etc.\n\n(I am sorry if I am making a big fuss about such \u2018champagne problems\u2019)",
