There are some schools that are probably in the \"safety\" category for you that have CS programs more highly regarded than Rutgers, but not \\*that\\* much more highly regarded and they will probably cost substantially more.\n\nHere are some ideas.  Not sure whether some of these should really be considered safeties, but worth investigating:\n\nWisconsin\n\nPurdue\n\nUC-Boulder\n\nUMass\n\nVirginia Tech\n\nTexas A&M\n\nMinnesota",
