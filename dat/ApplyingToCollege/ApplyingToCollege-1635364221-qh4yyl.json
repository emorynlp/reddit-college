  "text": "Hi y\u2019all, I kind of have a dilemma at my house rn.. So basically my mom is trying to get into work and she\u2019s trying to learn how to do automation using Java and Selenium (basically automatic software testing using Java) but she doesn\u2019t really understand programming so instead of her learning on her own (english isn\u2019t her first language), I help walk her through Selenium while learning it myself which eats up a good amount of my time (i\u2019m taking 6 APs rn). I can manage my APs and have nearly all A\u2019s there, but I can\u2019t do that many extracurriculars bc of this. Would this be considered an ec?",
