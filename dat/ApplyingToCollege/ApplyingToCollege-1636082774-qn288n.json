  "title:": "Is it okay if my history teacher is my main LOR despite me applying as a STEM major?",
  "text": "I'm applying as a STEM major and for my LOR, I'm asking my math and history teacher. I had both teachers for 2 years. However, I am much closer to my history teacher. She even reached out to me about writing my LOR. She is also a much more passionate teacher. I just know that she'd write the better LOR. Would it be okay if she was my main LOR? Like for schools that only require one, I use her instead of my math teacher, despite her not being a STEM teacher?",
