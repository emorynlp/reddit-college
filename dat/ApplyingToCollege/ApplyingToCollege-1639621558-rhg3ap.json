  "text": "Hi guys! I was thinking about applying to a liberal arts school, but my parents think that they're worthless. I'm majoring in Economics with a minor in international relations and thinking about pre-law.\n\nWould I have trouble finding a job due to the liberal arts college background? As in, would a company generally prefer someone with a non-liberal arts background to a liberal arts background?",

      "text": "Liberal arts colleges are some of the most prestigious and well respected schools in the United States. \n\nThe only worthless schools are those that lack accreditation or are for-profit. The schools your parents are thinking of are the large research universities. Because these schools are much larger, they tend to be more well known, but that doesn't make them better. Not in reality or in the perceptions of employers. \n\nThis will especially be true if you study an academic field like economics, where the typical career path is to obtain a graduate or professional degree before entering the work force.",

Sometimes I feel like I fucked myself by going to Berkeley and no one is going to hire me( IK it is a top school I just have a lot of delusional anxiety) I rlly hope I am not at a disadvantage during the hiring process because I went to a public university.",
