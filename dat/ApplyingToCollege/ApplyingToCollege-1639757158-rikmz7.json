  "text": "I'm 25 now and I'm kinda bummed that, if I do happen to get into a college, I'll have missed out on all the fun college experiences like frats, partying and clubbing. It sounds so dumb but I'll literally just have to just study and *possibly* do extracurriculars if it's not weird to have an older dude floating around.",
