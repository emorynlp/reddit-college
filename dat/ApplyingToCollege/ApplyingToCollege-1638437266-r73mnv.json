  "text": "I wanted to ask my math teacher for a letter of recommendation. Unfortunately he left the school the year I graduated. And I have taken a gap year so now when I'm applying to colleges, he is no longer a part of the school. I emailed my school coordinator asking if he can still write me a lor, but she said no. Is there any way around this cause I really want him to write my lor as he knew me very well and I had really good relations with him.",
