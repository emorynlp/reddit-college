She basically lived with a family for 6 weeks and did volunteer work in the city where the family lived. \n\nIf you live in the US, it could be worthwhile to look into The U.S. Department of State\u2019s National Security Language Initiative for Youth (NSLI-Y) program if you\u2019re into learning languages. \n\n[https://www.nsliforyouth.org/documents/site_30/category_2492/NSLI-Y_2022-23_Application_Press_Release.pdf](https://www.nsliforyouth.org/documents/site_30/category_2492/NSLI-Y_2022-23_Application_Press_Release.pdf)",

It\u2019s only for languages important for national security which tend to be less commonly taught in the US, so no Spanish but lots of Chinese, Arabic, Russian, and Hindi. I didn\u2019t go abroad due to COVID, but it was a great experience.",
