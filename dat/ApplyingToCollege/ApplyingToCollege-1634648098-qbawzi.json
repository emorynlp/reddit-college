  "text": "I emailed Amherst and they didn't get bact to me yet. Asked in r/amherstcollege too but no response. Asked a senior at Amherst and she's not sure either. The website doesn't make a distinction between the computer and the paper based tests for IELTS but does so for Toefl and says that they accept both versions of Toefl. They just say IELTS and don't mention if accept only the paper based one or both for this one. Please help, it's a bit of an emergency :(",

      "text": "According to me, the computer based IELTS is accepted because both computer and paper IELTS have the same difficulty level. The only difference is that one is done on computer and the other is on computer. If the college makes no distinction between the two, it probably means that both are accepted.",
