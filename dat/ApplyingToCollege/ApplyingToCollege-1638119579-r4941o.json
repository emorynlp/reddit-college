I wear sweatshirts from colleges my siblings attended and colleges my siblings visited and bought merch from, but no longer want since they chose a different school. None of the schools have an acceptance rate lower than like 45% so I\u2019m not like walking around in merch from the ivies lol. Other people on this post seem to think the merch is low quality, but the merch I have is literally the comfiest stuff I own so I can\u2019t not wear it. Is it ok or is it weird??? \ud83d\ude2d",
