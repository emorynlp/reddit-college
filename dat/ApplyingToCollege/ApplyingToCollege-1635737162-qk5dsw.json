  "text": "I'm in need of a lot of aid, and the NPC for Syracuse brings down the cost to about $8k per year without loans or work study. With those it brings it down to $0. However this is just the NPC and its not garenteed that I will get this much aid. Assuming I get accepted, can I back out if they don't give enough aid? Would I be blacklisted from other schools?",

      "text": "Yes - if the amount of aid they provide isn't close to what their NPC indicates, that's a valid reason to back out.\n\nIt might not be exactly the same, but the whole reason for the net price calculator is to give you a realistic estimate.  This isn't just some nice to have thing that schools offer - it's something they are required to do by federal law. The numbers you are seeing are supposed to be based on what students in a similar financial situation received last year.",
