TBH, I would advice staying away from such topics altogether, because you can't know which side your AO leans towards, and even staying \"neutral\" may work against you if the AO feels very strongly one way about the issue.",

I specifically stated that I was left leaning and such however I made it clear that I was still open to conflicting views. I wont go into further detail but as long as you present yourself in a respectful manner and don\u2019t say something that someone could label you as bigoted then you will be fine. They didn\u2019t ask us to talk about difficult topics not expecting us to talk about something difficult.",
