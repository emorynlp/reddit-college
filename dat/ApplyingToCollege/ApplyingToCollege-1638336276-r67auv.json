  "text": "Got an invitation for an interview with a current Yale senior \"due to limited alumni availability in your particular area\" (quoted from email). So does this mean basically every applicant in my area (international) is getting similar emails? Or did I lack information in my application and they need to know more about me? \n\nI'm so sorry for overthinking everything but it's college apps",
