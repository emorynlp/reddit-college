  "text": "they keep throwing it into completely unrelated conversations like \"haha, \\[college\\] is getting a good one this year\" or \"remember me when you're at \\[college\\] later!\" they do it in group conversations too so now everyone knows what school i applied to when i wanted to keep it lowkey and i rly regret telling them. i know it's harmless but during decision week, with my stress levels so high, it really grates on my nerves. when i've confronted them and asked them to please stop they defend themselves with \"but they'd be stupid to reject you\" (bruh :// that's not for you to decide) and/or \"it's just a joke calm down\"\n\nam i overreacting?? if not how tf do i deal with this",

It\u2019s their way of appreciating your skills so try not to over react. They don\u2019t mean any harm. You only have a few more months left with them. Try to enjoy them.",

      "text": "I see a lot of people brushing this off as well-meaning, but if you've specifically asked a friend to stop sharing information about you and they refuse, that's not okay. Healthy friendships aren't like that. \n\nThis friend seems to think that *they* get to decide what information of yours should be shared publicly. Be mindful of this when you consider telling them private things in the future.",

      "text": "Not sure why others are telling you to just deal with it/be happy about it. You've made yourself clear to the friend so it's completely understandable to be upset - making your private information public shouldn't be up to them. Maybe you could talk to them in private and emphasize that it's great that they're optimistic, but please keep it quiet just for this week?",
