  "title:": "Not taking enough AP\u2019s at a top high school?",
  "text": "I go to an extremely competitive/top ranked public high school. AP classes generally are extremely hard and I didn\u2019t take many throughout high school. My school makes the classes much more difficult than the actual curriculum so students almost always get 4s/5s on the AP exams, and I am admittedly lazy and didn\u2019t really want to have to work so hard. Of the few APs I\u2019ve taken, I did get those scores, but again I didn\u2019t take many (Around five out of like the twelve total that are offered). Will colleges care that much? I\u2019m applying mostly within the top 30-15 ranked colleges for reference.",

      "text": "Definitely report the 4-5 AP scores. It shows that you can learn effectively without a lot of practice. Depending on the college, you might still get dinged on rigor for your transcript, but tbh it\u2019s too late to do anything about that. You\u2019d want to show AOs that you spent your extra time really well.",
