  "title:": "Need help about a Letter of Recommendation Concern",
  "text": "Hey guys I have a quick question, I finally got my last letter of recommendation and I\u2019m set to turn in my Early Decision. However, my tennis coach was the one who did the reccomendation, and he came from Argentina to play tennis here in the USA. However, I\u2019m worried if formatting is an issue because I don\u2019t think he wrote it double spaced, MLA, and there may be a few grammar mistakes. I don\u2019t wanna dismiss the LOR just off that because I\u2019ve been playing with him since I was 4, so 13 years, but if it comes down to it, I will if formatting matters that much. Any advice? \n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind but some of these colleges are those 10-20% acceptance rate ones I wanted to put him on.\n\nThanks",

Formatting and grammar mistakes isn't going to ruin your chances as long as it does not impose difficulties on reading these letters. They will know it's your tennis coach and they will not expect the most refined piece of literature.",

Only waiving rights to read letters before application shows the letters are truthful.",
