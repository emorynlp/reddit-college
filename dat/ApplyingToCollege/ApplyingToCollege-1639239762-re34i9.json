  "title:": "Regarding Grade Inflation",
  "text": "Kind of a discussion because I want to see if any other schools have this. \n\nMy school has crazy grade inflation, I\u2019d say. The average weighted average is probably a 98-99 (we don\u2019t do UW). That\u2019s the average that goes to schools. Does it look bad if my average is like 101-102 knowing that my grades are inflated? (highest it could be is like a 103-104 weighted, factoring in normal classes and years without AP being offered) Will colleges actually be looking at that? \n\nAlmost all of the AP teachers in my school make sure that everyone has a 90+ average in their class - so it\u2019s almost impossible not to get a weighted average of below 99 (1.1 weight). Do any other schools do this?",
