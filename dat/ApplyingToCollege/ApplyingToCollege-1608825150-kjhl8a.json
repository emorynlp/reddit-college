On the day Brown applications were due in for Class of 2017, I was struggling to figure out what I really cared about for Brown. Sure, it was a great school, and ya there's this \"open curriculum\" thing, but do I *really* care? I ended up Googling \"Brown gaming club\" or something like that, and found an article from earlier in 2016 about how there's a gaming club that's just getting started. As someone who played a lot of games, I decided, word -- I'll use this for my \"Why Brown\" answer. Talked about gaming / the internet for like all of my essays for Brown, and wrote them the day of... and it worked out (along with a major amount of luck)!\n\nTL;DR: Don't write your essays the day of, but *do* Google anything and everything you're interested in, prepended by the school's name -- I guarantee you you'll find unique things about the school, or at least interesting things that you like!",
