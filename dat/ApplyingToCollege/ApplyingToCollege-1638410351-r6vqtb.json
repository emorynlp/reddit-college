  "text": "Hey guys\n\nMy Northeastern portal says 4 of my IDOC forms are not recieved, but in my IDOC portal through CSS it says all 4 were processed and recieved by the institution like 20 days ago. Is this happening to anyone else? Should I be worried if my IDOC portal says I have no more required documents to send and the ones I did have been processed? I'm not sure when or if I have to email someone.",
