  "text": "Like any international student, I\u2019ve always believed that my chances at top US schools were really low and that my stats weren\u2019t up there. I\u2019ve always had my eye on Cornell, but dude, that\u2019s an Ivy. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m getting into an Ivy. Ever since I made my college list, I was like, \u201cNo ivies, oh that\u2019s a T20, oh that\u2019s a T10, nope nope\u201d. \n\n2 months ago, someone made a post about submitting their ED application to Cornell. \n\nI made a comment, congratulated them and talked about how I really want to apply, but I didn\u2019t think I stood a chance so I wasn\u2019t even gonna try.\n\nThat was when 2 people made a comment and motivated me to apply. They were right, I didn\u2019t have anything to lose, why not go for it? Fine, guess I\u2019ll try. I\u2019ve always wanted to do it anyway, might as well experience opening a Cornell decision for the first time lol. So I did. I applied and put my absolute heart into it.\n\n\nThe first word I read was \u201cCongratulations!\u201d. I was completely in shock. I screamed and called at my parents who came running thinking I\u2019m dying or something. I still can\u2019t believe it honestly, but this truly shows that miracles happen and way more often than you all think. My advice is to apply to that school you think you have no chance at. That school you applied for and you think you have no chance at? Well, you do have a chance. Just believe in yourself, as corn(ell)y as that sounds. Let this post be the \u201ccomment\u201d that you\u2019re gonna link at the end of your post where you\u2019ll talk about your acceptance<3. \n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for those comments, my life right now would probably be different and still very stressful. Forever grateful. \n\n[comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/qhzic5/i_just_submitted_my_ed_app_to_cornell/higcn6y/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)",

An engineering from Cornell and an engineering degree from any state school are gonna get you roughly the same starting salary(give or take 10%). Maybe finance is a bit different - you may be able to place into an IB from an Ivy League, but probably not Cornell. Anyways, what I\u2019m trying to say is that as long as you\u2019re going to any reputable school with a reputable degree, it\u2019s all the same.",
