  "text": "I checked my common app before submitting REA to Stanford and noticed that i forgot to include a course on my most recent year courses. I had already applied to 9 schools before realizing this error. When I contacted my guidance counselor, he said that it\u2019s fine as when they see my transcript they will see that I am taking the course currently. Do you guys still think I should email the admissions officers for the schools I submitted to? Thanks so much!",
