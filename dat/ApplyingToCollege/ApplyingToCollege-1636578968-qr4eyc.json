      "text": "So an example of this is like in India, they have board exams. If you had those, then you would check \u2018yes\u2019. In Canada, they have final exams, but those final exams are not worth 100% of your grade, so they don\u2019t determine if you can advance to the next grade. So if you lived in Canada, you would answer \u2018no\u2019. Hope that helps.",
