  "text": "Found this neat poll from a Yale subreddit where 250 REA applicants filled out a poll of whether they got an interview and their result. Seems that getting an interview means deferred or accepted and no interview is more likely to be rejected or deferred. Obviously this is a super small sample of the 7k applicants but some insight nonetheless\n\nPoll: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/yandle/comments/ke30qt/acceptance_interview_received_poll/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",

They said they always asked the applicants to\nEmail them when they found out their results. There was this one particular kid that they thought was amazing and basically said to the office \u201cthis kid is brilliant and a perfect fit and you\u2019d be mad not to take him\u201d and he still wasn\u2019t accepted. So that\u2019s when they stopped.",

That\u2019s why I think you kids should prepare and do your best in interviews and be conversational. Unless you mess it up, swear, don\u2019t show up, show zero people skills, you\u2019ll be all right. It\u2019s ultimately still in the hands of your regional Admission Official vouching for you and hope the committee gets persuaded by your AO.",

I was sharing this more about what getting an interview might mean (not how it actually goes) since Yale has a *supposedly* different way of selecting who gets one.
