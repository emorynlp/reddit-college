Idk anything about Noah, but I know in the past there have been child actors, homeschooled their entire decadent life, who then somehow end up at Harvard or any other Ivy.",

Nepotism is a real thing and happens at universities, but I doubt this is the case.",

          "text": ">ah has shown academic capability (which i feel like he has), his ECs are AMAZING. there are less than maybe 20 child actors who are more famous/have a more successful\n\nYa but in those few examples, don't you think that lowering the general academic standard to appreciate those successes is unfair to students who literally balanced and excelled across the board? As a college, your primary goal should be ensuring that the candidates they admit are capable of handling course rigour and are a good fit for the community. I understand how child actors would be a good fit, but I don't think that warrants overlooking academic standards. Again, I'm sure Noah is smart and has done well in school, but examples like yours (the kid that made the COVID tracker) is really what my argument is focusing on. To use holistic admissions processes to overlook primary academic candidacy is, in my opinion, a bit unfair.\n\nEven with recruited athletes, there's usually a significant academic standard to be upheld - if you had a young Lebron applying to Harvard with a 1400 he'd likely be rejected no matter how good he is at his particular field.",

To them, balancing things \"across the board\" is less impressive than having a huge boost in one field, particularly if it's something not even teams of professional adults have done, because well-rounded but not 'outstanding' (think Nobel Prize, worldwide impact) individuals are much more common than you'd think.",
