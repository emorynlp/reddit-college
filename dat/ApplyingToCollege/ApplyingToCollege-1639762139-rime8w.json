Idk anything about Noah, but I know in the past there have been child actors, homeschooled their entire decadent life, who then somehow end up at Harvard or any other Ivy.",

          "text": ">ah has shown academic capability (which i feel like he has), his ECs are AMAZING. there are less than maybe 20 child actors who are more famous/have a more successful\n\nYa but in those few examples, don't you think that lowering the general academic standard to appreciate those successes is unfair to students who literally balanced and excelled across the board? As a college, your primary goal should be ensuring that the candidates they admit are capable of handling course rigour and are a good fit for the community. I understand how child actors would be a good fit, but I don't think that warrants overlooking academic standards. Again, I'm sure Noah is smart and has done well in school, but examples like yours (the kid that made the COVID tracker) is really what my argument is focusing on. To use holistic admissions processes to overlook primary academic candidacy is, in my opinion, a bit unfair.\n\nEven with recruited athletes, there's usually a significant academic standard to be upheld - if you had a young Lebron applying to Harvard with a 1400 he'd likely be rejected no matter how good he is at his particular field.",

You can take \"hard\" courses through virtual programs. And they usually become more complex because there's no teacher, just lessons typed out, so you have to teach yourself on top of everything else. Someone killing it for four years of high school can't be an end-all-be-all requirement because then so many kids would be discounted. I have Asperger's and was moved down in classes because of my struggles. Then I lived with a bunch of different families and got exposed to the stimulation of academia. I started taking AP classes in my latter years of hs and have done incredible. It turns out that more challenging classes were the solution to my learning struggles. Not having the same course load doesn't show that I have less potential than you. It shows that my path to success was a little bit less guided than yours. Understand the implications of what you're saying, please.\n\nThird, no offense, but if one can take APUSH (even if it's through a virtual learning program, because apparently, that's so much easier) while having their DMs piled with death threats, is there any chance that getting a B in linear algebra will send them into a depressive spiral? Whatever you have handled is most likely minuscule to what a public figure has dealt with. That's not a negative on you, just a positive on them. \n\nFourth, if Lebron had his leg cut off and had to quit basketball, he would've had a damn good chance at Harvard. We're sheltered. We get to learn in a controlled environment. He, and other public figures, don't. They do things that have real consequences and impact the world, unlike getting a 97 on a Calc Bc semester exam.",

By him taking a spot at a school with under a 10 percent acceptance rate he ABSOLUTELY is taking spots from someone much farther down the socioeconomic latter who could have benefitted FAR more from going than the cost of him not attending. As for others, they absolutely shouldn't have attended the colleges they did as well, as they are taking spots from people who need these chances to build a new life. The boy can GET an education, just NOT at somewhere that comes at the cost of excluding someone's potential life.  There are thousands of colleges in the US, and they are absolutely free to attend those! If a multimillionaire applied for a PPE loan let's say and got it, would you be upset?

Why should he be concerned with the interest of other kids, **strangers** that are not yet economically liberated? It is in human nature to concern yourself with your **own** interest, and at most, about your loved ones' interests. Not some stranger's interest, unless he has a certain value to offer that you deem acceptable. Did Noah's action take away those kids' opportunities? Sure did. Is it realistic for us to expect Noah **(a human being looking to maximize his benefit)** to sacrifice his chance for a kid that has never done anything for Noah? I think not, unless you want to create this utopian society where all individuals are concerned with all the needs of the other 7 billion, everyone is a saintly benevolent angel. It doesn't really matter what Noah already has, if there is a way for him to gain, he would take it, no shit. There are circumstances where it is mutually beneficial to cooperate and take the interest of both sides into account - this simply is not one of them. The only way for this to change would require us to take a look again at individual freedom - at what point do we force people to give up their gain for the common good? I think the US has found its answer, and it is not likely to change any time soon.",

That's how the US society functions: you pretend you care about those less advantaged, then proceed to take more for yourself at their expense anyways. Look at all the higher ups in the US and you would see this pattern. All I'm saying is, it is not realistic to obligate someone to be selfless, regardless of their activism. You can expect them to, but prepare yourself for a lot of disappointment. Unless you want to actually change the system, well, you do that as Congressman, President, or Secretary of Education. Not by acting all woe-is-me on reddit.",
