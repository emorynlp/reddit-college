  "text": "(\\*\\*for a school)\n\nI just got deferred EA from Drexel University (one of my safeties), yet the acceptance rate is nearly 80% and my GPA / SAT scores are above the avg.  I was certain I would get in.\n\nDo schools ever defer people because they know you won't attend their school and will chose another school over them? My friend shared that he got deferred from his safeties but got into Yale.",

It also shows my GPA in comparison to them and it's higher than the range of GPAs of people accepted. \n\nIt's weird but I don't really want to go there so no big deal thankfully!",
