  "text": "**Location:** I prefer to go someone near or in a big city, definitely not something in a very rural area.\n\n**Region:** I am from northwest Ohio and would prefer to go south or east, the west coast is just a little too far for me.\n\n**Major:** Debating on either Entrepreneurship, Marketing, or Finance\n\n**Curriculum:** I would like for the college to be challenging and be worth while. I also hope that my classmates help push me and it could somewhere I can network\n\n**Costs:** Doesn't really matter if its a good school\n\n**Stats:** 3.646 GPA\n\nWhite Male\n\n2 AP classes\n\n9 dual enrollment college courses\n\nEvery other class is an honors class\n\nVery strong essay that talks about me not applying myself fully my first two years of hs and I talk about how I really started trying these past two years.\n\n9 EC - all very solid.\n\nThank you in advance!",
