  "text": "Fuck NYC\n\nFuck all the terrible memories I made here \n\nI don't like myself\n\nI don't get along with my family\n\nFUCK HIGH SCHOOL JUST FUUUUCCCKKKK IIITTTT\n\nFuck this cringey, embarrassment of a life I lived here. Screw the loneliness, isolation, just all of it. I would be lying if I said one of my biggest reasons for getting into college is to just pack my shit and leave this place behind because I am so over everything here. Just want to pack my shit and restart my life somewhere else, by myself, completely on my own. \n\nAs much as my anxiety is telling me everything is pointless, I didn't do enough, and I will get rejected from every college I apply to. College decisions just need to hurry tf up. Just need that ONE singular acceptance letter and I will be over the moon.",
