      "text": "Your academic record is very strong. You may want to consider applying to some colleges where you\u2019ll be a strong candidate for both admission and merit scholarships. (Note that colleges that reject the large majority of their applicants often do not offer merit scholarships.) Keeping your out-of-pocket costs down for your undergraduate education might be helpful since you\u2019ll need to pay a lot for medical school.",
