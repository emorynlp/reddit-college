      "text": "No one who goes to CMU would call it cutthroat. In fact it is the opposite. You will only read this on A2C. \n\nSome people are stressed but it is mostly self imposed. Some people seem to pride themselves on it. This happens at lots of places.\n\nYou will, however, find at CMU lots of nerds who love what they are studying and doing and are not embarrassed to talk about it. However, it is infectious and my favorite part of CMU.",
