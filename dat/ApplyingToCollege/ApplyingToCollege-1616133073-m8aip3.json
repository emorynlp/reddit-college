  "text": "Asians don't face racism. When I was six, the only Asian kid on scholarship in an international school made up of white students, I choked back tears when they asked us to divide our skin tones into \"Light\" and \"Dark\" as part of a history unit we were taking. It sounds crazy, but I remember it like it was yesterday - brightly-lit classrooms and my knees pressed against my desk and cheery kids' posters on the walls.\n\nI put my name under the \"Light\" section anyway, drawing weird looks from my classmates. After the bell rang, the teacher took the slip of paper with my name on it - the name of a brown indigenous kid of Chinese descent - and slapped it under the \"Dark\" section. She didn't know I'd seen her.\n\nAsians don't face racism. When I was eight, quietly slurping down soup in a Boston restaurant, a white mother with a crying child pointed to me and said to her daughter, \"If you don't behave, you'll have eyes like her.\" She hadn't known I'd heard her.\n\nMy mom pressed her lips together.\n\nAsians don't face racism. When I was eleven, we lost our land. It had been ours since time immemorial, but there were weak judges and corrupt officials.\n\nI read the report. My grandfather was implicated as a violent indigenous man of color, who toted around guns to threaten the poor, civilized landowners, who utilized his military experience to demand and frighten.\n\nHe walked with a limp. He was ill with cancer. He now lived in a more urbanized area, at the request of his only daughter. He died two years later. I dream of that place by night - the wild tall grass and the birdsong and the gleaming sun. By day I mourn, and think of how I can save up my scholarship allowance to buy it all back.\n\nAsians don't face racism. At fourteen, I made a CuriousCat for the first (and last) time. I'd just begun to follow my friends and favorite singers on Twitter when my secondhand iPhone 4 pinged with a notification. I was thinking about fun asks I might've received, only to nearly drop my phone upon reading the first. I won't go into details. There was a lot of bullshit regarding what he wanted to do to me, as an \"exotic Asian girl\". I no longer identified as a girl. He didn't care. He liked that I had skin \"like caramel\" but \"Ch\\*ng-Chong eyes\", and he liked that I was thin and petite and easy to throw around.\n\nI hated him. I haven't made a personal Twitter since then.\n\nAsians don't face racism. When I was fifteen, a Chinese friend of mine accused me of \"cultural appropriation\" for celebrating the Lunar New Year. She told me repeatedly that I was \"too dark\", \"too large-nosed\" to be Chinese. My mother has a Chinese surname.\n\nA few months after, while I was on a research trip in Vienna, a bunch of white teens dumped their trash on my McDonald's table. I wanted to chase after them, I really did.\n\nI stayed at my seat.\n\nWhile writing college applications, I've always wondered at the boxes that ask me to tick my race, and pondered over questions that asked for my cultural background. There is so much I could write about - being accused of shoplifting, constant questions of where I'm \"actually\" from, feeling alienated by Asian communities for not being \"Asian\" enough - but I haven't written about any of them. I don't owe admissions committees my stories, and neither do any POC.\n\nBut it stands - regardless of whether we share our stories or otherwise - racism exists. And it isn't only confined to Western settings, or solely perpetrated by violent racists - silence and microaggressions promote racism. There's a huge amount of reckoning to be done, in warring against the racism that Asians face on a day-to-day basis and calling out the anti-Blackness and colorism within Asian societies. The two are not mutually exclusive.\n\nTo all the POC who have felt ignored and unsafe within the subreddit due to a downright shitty moderator, I hear and stand with you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE**: Thank you so much for your kind comments and the awards. (Quick warning: I do not know how to use awards, but thank you all the same!) I'll be turning off notifications for this post, but if anyone needs to talk, my inbox and chat are always open. I'm always down to listen or discuss anything under the sun.\n\nRegarding more personal questions about my essays, my university, and my identity that I have been receiving privately - I can't promise that I'll answer them all due to confidentiality, but if anyone has more individual inquiries for me regarding my stance on related subjects or any of the aforementioned topics, I'll do my best to answer them.\n\nI cannot speak for all Asians and indigenous communities, more so other POC, and will thus leave further discussion of related issues to those whose voices must be amplified, as I've said my piece and don't want to take up more of anyone's time. Much love to everyone and best of luck with all your future endeavours, college-related and otherwise! x",

It is just acknowledging that prejudices exist and we all suffer in varying degrees from the same system of outright oppression or microagressions. Have some empathy inside you man. I am sure you have it bad but I am also sure someone has it much worse that you. But that doesn\u2019t and never will diminish or devalue your experiences, even by a little and nor will it make others\u2019 sufferings more special than yours. \n\nIt is only together that we can help each other grow out of our insecurities and fight racism as an idea. Extend a hand. Be considerate. Be kind. That\u2019s all it takes.",

                      "text": "I think the problem with racism and racist individuals isn\u2019t that they hate Asian people, or Latino people, or Black people; I think the root problem is that they hate anyone that isn\u2019t like them. Basically just anyone that is different. Is it possible they have different degrees of hate for different people? 100%. Is it possible that Black people have faced harsher, more violent racism in America than some other ethnic groups? 100%. \n\nBut if we want to try to move towards a better world where racism has been largely or completely eradicated, I think the only way we accomplish that is addressing the root cause of the problem. If we proceeded to try and \u2018stop racism\u2019 by addressing racist acts only after classifying them into \u2018who had it worse\u2019 categories, then I think racist ideas would just transition to the next group until *that* groups\u2019 racist targeting has been addressed, then it would move to the next group and so on and so forth. \n\nI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m right about any of this or anything, but from my perspective, the best way to combat racists is to speak up whenever you see anything happen. Is someone getting lynched worse than someone getting made fun of for their skin color? Absolutely. Does that mean you should *only* speak up when something like a lynching occurs? Absolutely not. Address racism on every level, every time. \n\nAgain, this is just an opinion and I would love any additional insight into how this opinion is perceived, or any advice in general.",

I grew up in low income areas and it's a completely different story compared to the middle class suburbs I live in now. There needs to be a specific level of privilege beforehand to actually see palpable support of these traits. To all those lower income people that struggle with daily lives and have low graduation rates (especially since SE Asians unfortunately get lumped together with East Asians), these views that discrimination gets downplayed don't benefit them at all. \n\n> it sounds tone deaf and privileged\n\nI'll be honest. You either sound like you want to settle for something less than equal, less than fair rights, or started off with the privilege of being middle class enough to not experience these things or understand the depth of how skewed reality is. I understand there will always be a cultural divide between east and west and the perceptions of each other, but it's still not right to treat people as less than human, less than equal, and for those that need it, equity.\n\nEdit: The main takeaway? Don't compare struggles. Don't look at your own experience to justify the experience of others. Treat each other with the same level of respect and don't settle for any less than that.",

As a student who was bullied throught out elementary school by various ppl for various reasons, it started by some kids making fun of me for being brown, and I didn't have a single friend in elementary school, I was going to school in a place where almost everyone hated me. But I am grateful for the kind and open people that live, where there is bad there is also good. Thankfully I was able to be taught this lesson at the right time. By the end of HS I was able to find myself friends who stuck up for me, as I'm a more quiet and don't wanna get into arguments guy, when someone passes insulting comments. I told you all this because we need to find ourselves the right people. Hope you are in a better place now, good luck to you and OP.",

Throughout school the amount of kids who called me and my fellow Asian and Muslim  friends \"t3rrorists\" was astonishing. My dad, who was born in the US and has always lived in the US but is South Asian, literally gets stopped every time we travel back to the US for no reason. These are just two examples of so many. There is so much racism towards Asians (wherever in Asia they're from), yet it is normalized and not called out nearly enough.

As another south East Asian Muslim, I have faced an unbelievable amount of discrimination not just from white people, but also other URMs. I mean most people have no idea how it feels to have your parents be called inbred goat fuckers, or for people to constantly call your prophet a pedophile. It is unbelievable. At least many of us asians stand in solidarity with PoC in their times of need. For many of us south East Asians, we have no allies. No support from anyone. Instead we get brigaded on subs like this and our problems are dismissed because they \u201cundermine the issues of other URM\u201d.",

I said \"Huh? Scented candle. I need a candle\ud83e\udd28\" and she didn't help me and said \"oh go there\ud83d\ude12\" pointing out at an isle which I went there and didn't find what I was looking for. Why did she assumed I need a sanitizer? And even if I need one, she's being rude.\n\nI also took physics class. The students there frequently shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" and \"InshaaAllah\" including the guy who sat right beside me. I look at the other Muslim student in that class and see him unbothered so I was too scared to speak up about how I was so uncomfortable. Later, my host sister who's  a Middle Eastern, told me that someone asked her to say \"Allahu Akbar\" and when she ask \"Do you know what's the meaning of it?\" They said \"That's what the terrorist said before bombing\". Another guy from that class asked me jokingly \"Are you a terrorist?\" Then, I changed my class.\n\nMoreover, on the other day, when I walk out from another classroom, there were two girls screaming like crazy \"RUNNN RUNNN AHAHHAHA\" as if I were a terrorist they should run away from. I was so confused because I just came out the room to go to the bathroom. I left them loughing so loud behind and another guy approach me and said \"Sorry my friends are racist\".\n\nAlso, an old lady said to my host sister, who gets a confession from a boy in her first day of school, to \"just wear hijab and boys will be scared\". Or said how silly people wear hijab while swimming. She said those in the car which I was also there sit in the back seat.. and yap, I wear hijab and we were going to go swim at a lake. Guess what? My hijab-swimwear picture get posted on the monthly newsletter\ud83d\ude0c\n\n\nHowever, those are just small parts of my exchange year. Thankfully, there were many more kind people that accepted me.",

Some ppl at the school quickly messaged me personally saying that they will take me to try cake as I must have not had cake before, it was pure ignorance but I have never been so baffled before. \n\nA dude came up to me at school as spoke Alien language, I smiled and asked him what he was saying. He said, \u201cAsian language\u201d with the most innocent face I have ever seen. I explained to him that there is no such thing as Asian language, and I personally spoke Thai. So he asked me where is Thailand, and I thought American probably learned a lot about Vietnam, so I used Vietnam as a referenced point to describe where Thailand is. He cut me off and said that, Oh so you are into Vietnamese men then. \n\nI took a chair dancing class with my host mom. It looks like some kind of like sexy dance - but it was at the gym - so mostly workout type of dance. I jokingly said, what if someone takes a video of me and send it to college. She said, people are still using cable in Thailand, they won\u2019t see it.\n\nWhat I faced are the little things, but still. It was not racism but pure ignorance, and I believe that American exceptionalism is at play here. \n\nAs an asian, I am afraid to be studying in America next September. The whole race got blamed for a virus. Do you think it even makes sense? But before you ask me why I would come here again, let me tell you that I still believe that America still provides great education and I also got a scholarship from the Thai government to study in America. And most importantly, I believe that not everywhere in America is like what I have experienced.  People I have met think that people who get scholarships are weak and poor and they would rather pay for anything instead, including college. But sadly, most of my friends that I met that year are not going to college and multiple of them had gotten pregnant.\n\nIt is easy to assume things when you have just seen one side of the story, but as ppl living in this century, you should now realize that there is more than one side of the story, the world, people, culture, it\u2019s complex.",

Dark Asians and all the ones in between exist too.I'm sure that almost all Asians, or current generation at least, are aware of this. However, some people act as if Asians can push a button and decide for the Asian community that \"racism is resolved\". \n\nBarring the fact that they think an individual can change the opinions of the whole, there is an inherent issue with the thinking that people \"deserve punishment\". I don't like bringing up social justice, but it's a widespread thing where people dish out punishments or revenge despite it being very unhelpful. If punishing criminals won't reform them, why believe that racism will fix racism?",

It is ridiculous... These are the best students you could hope for, and we are actively trying to keep them in Australia, but acceptance rates in 2015-16 compared to 2019-20 are noticeably different...\n\nThe preconceptions around what these students are like, and discrimination based on the countries they come from seems quite obvious to me - as someone who has to write references, answer questions, verify results, et cetera.

I was only 9 but from that day forth I became embarrassed of my culture and background. \n\nI never recovered from those little moments and now seeing people doing fox eye trends or making kpop their personality without understanding what Asians had to go through makes me upset. And I also hate the fact that mainstream media only talks about East Asians. There is NO representation or acknowledgment of south/southeast Asians. I hate that. Stop Asian hate applies to ALL Asians, INCLUDING the racism towards south/southeastern Asians within the East Asian community. I'm so tired of this. I feel like I'm 9 again.",

In the time I\u2019ve been here, my city has never had reported news about police aggression particularly towards black individuals, much less violence like many unjust deaths we see on the news.

OP, i may not know you at all, but this post resonated deep within me. i hope you\u2019re doing alright nowadays... i always worry about my other fellow asiana n family/friends especially after the rise in asian hate crimes following covid... i hope you\u2019re doing well, op.",

We had Orientals in our school and living in the neighborhood (I know, but they weren't Russians, Iranians, Indians, or any other \"Asian\" group).  One of my best friends was 2nd generation from Japan.  I NEVER saw any racism against Orientals.  I joined the Air Force and spent 3 1/2 years in Japan, Viet Nam, and S. Korea.  Talk about racism?  I was treated like crap, mostly behind my back when they didn't know I spoke Japanese.  Racism is normal.  Birds of a feather.  You probably felt it against your tormentors.  That doesn't mean you attack other races just on that basis, but it will always color the way you interact.",
