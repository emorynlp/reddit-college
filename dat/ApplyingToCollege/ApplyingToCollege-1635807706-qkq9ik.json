  "title:": "Is having spent too much time on games and devices a good overcoming challenge essay topic?",
  "text": "I use to have this issue of playing games all the time after coming home after school during middle school and early freshmen year of high school, do you think that it's a good challenge essay topic? As I look through websites about writing this type of essay, they say that you shouldn't write about challenges that are very popular(such as getting a bad grade or not doing good during a sport game). Do you think this topic is seen often by AO's? My grades skyrocketed after I stopped, and I did get interested with more EC's, so the rest of my application does correlate with it as well. I feel that this is one of the biggest challenges I've ever had, but I'm not sure if I should write about it if it's too common.",

      "text": "Overcoming any sort of addiction is generally a taboo college essay topic because it makes you a riskier choice; video game addition is less risky than other addictions in that readers will be less likely to think you're dangerous/a liability, but more risky in that readers will think \"lol what a loser.\"",
