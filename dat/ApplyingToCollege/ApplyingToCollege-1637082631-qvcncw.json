  "text": "I applied REA to Stanford November 1st, and the priority deadline for aid was November 15th. I submitted my FAFSA on time on the 13th, however, I accidentally indicated the number of students in college in my household next year would be 2 instead of 3 because one of my sisters is going to graduate\u2019s school and I didn\u2019t know that counted. I just made the correction now and it won\u2019t process for a few days. Since the deadline was the 15th, and my first submission was before then but my correction is after it, will they use the FAFSA I submitted beforehand when making a financial award decision? I\u2019m worried because there\u2019s about a 3000 dollar expected difference in EFC and that\u2019s a lot. \n\nThe only plus side is that on my CSS (which I submitted on the 13th) I correctly indicated 3 and specifically said my sister would be in Graduate\u2019s School.",
