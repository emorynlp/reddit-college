  "title:": "PSA: Deadlines are only *mostly* dead. Nearly all of them have built-in grace periods.",
  "text": "Nearly every deadline in college admissions has a built-in grace period to accommodate all the weird random stuff that happens in life - natural disasters, system outages, power failures, impromptu & uncoordinated DDOS attacks due to every procrastinator hitting the servers at the same moment, credit card issues, etc.\n\nThat \"built-in\" part is important - it means that the system accepts applications automatically without any manual intervention, and often without even annotating that it was received late. As can be said in other areas of life, do not presume upon grace. But you also don't need to freak out over being a few minutes after the deadline.\n\nIn fact, if you meant to apply early somewhere with an 11/1 deadline, and you woke up today with a feeling of existential dread because of yet another failure, just go ahead and try to apply.  I've heard of cases where the grace period is several days - and the worst thing that happens is you get pushed to RD.  Deadlines help admissions offices stay organized and on schedule, but a little flexibility costs them almost nothing.  Since they are actual humans, they try to be understanding and accommodating whenever they can.\n\nOne more point on deadlines, [which /u/UvaDeanJ posted a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/qhmr8l/deadlines_are_for_applicants_not_counselors_and/), is that they are for applicants, not teachers or counselors.  If your LORs, school report, or transcript are not in by deadline, you're probably ok unless the college specifically says they must receive everything.\n\nTwo other sources for this:\n\n1.  Yale said this same thing on their most recent podcast episode.\n\n2.  [Here's another old post by an AO at a highly selective college saying the same thing:](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a90w5k/a2c_faqs/)\n\n>Q: What has to be in by the deadline?\n\n>A: Only YOUR part of the application (Common/Coalition application, any supplements) has to be in by the deadline. If your transcripts/recommendations/scores/etc arrive a few days after when school is back in session, that's not a problem. We understand that our deadline falls right in the middle of your school's holiday break.",
