  "text": "No this is not a joke. Yes I know it's not Shitpost Wednesday. I'm (quite literally) a certified moderator on Discord. [Proof](https://imgur.com/oNLW4ou), excuse the blocking out of details.\n\nI'm kind of at a loss for other awards to toss on my Common App so I'm really considering listing it, but I'm worried it'll sound stupid. As far as I know, only \\~700 people on the platform of over 350 million people have it. So like, 0.0002%. I'll probably explain a bit more about it in the Additional Info area. I'll say something about how it's \"only awarded to those who show exceptional leadership and community skills\" or something like that.\n\nIf you have any suggestions on how to make this sound less stupid or want to warn me against doing this, thanks.",

I think there's two servers, one for users 18 and above, and one below. As a recipient are you aware on the process to receive the badge ^(as the official Discord website doesn't mention much about the process)\n\nFYI: Reddit also has a similar certification program known as [Mod Certification](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/pl3ka2/mod_certification_programs_are_open_for_testing/) and is much easier to receive than the Discord alternative.",

If you pass and are 18+, you\u2019re put into the Discord Moderator Discord (DMD), while if you\u2019re 13-17, you\u2019re put into the Moderator Mentorship Community (MMC). Become active for at least three months in one of those servers and you may be eligible for the badge",
