  "text": "two people from my school just got into stanford, one of my best friends and a guy i\u2019ve known since 4th grade. i\u2019m sobbing right now and i can\u2019t stop because i\u2019m so proud. it\u2019s crazy how we can be surrounded and supported by all these amazing talented people for years in our lives, and grow up with them and go to their birthday parties and make memories, and it\u2019s just such a euphoric feeling to see them achieve what they deserve and what they\u2019ve been working hard for all these years. i\u2019ve watched these friends wear stanford merch for years and talk animatedly about the specific classes and professors they want to work with. i remember sophomore year i went to my friend\u2019s house and they were literally building a rocket in their basement for fun. cheers to them, and there will be more to celebrate in march!

      "text": "Good on you, man. You are a great friend. \n\nI think it should be said that every generation nurtures and produces great people. And it doesn\u2019t always have the same pathway involved. \n\nI\u2019ve combed this sub through all kinds of emotions, feelings, and heartache. But to be honest, a school won\u2019t define you. What you do is what defines you.\n\nTrust me. There are a lot of talkers out there talking big game. But do they do? Do they truly contribute to society (and do so without the expectation of fame and glory)?\n\nEveryone one of you going through this college process should remember what you\u2019ve done to get here. Not getting into a particular college should not erase all of your accomplishments. Don\u2019t let it. \n\nBe you to the 1000th degree regardless of where you end up and who says what about what you can\u2019t do. It should piss you off (not sadden you) when a school can\u2019t recognize your worth. \n\nShow them. Show yourself.",
