Now, if someone wants to do engineering, they\u2019re probably shooting for something like MIT, since that\u2019s the best school for that. But Cornell is still a very strong choice. Out of all the ivies, Cornell engineering is considered the strongest, and the main thing about ivies for many people is (apart from the perceived \u201cold money prestige\u201d) the good financial aid. For a good chunk of people, Cornell engineering is cheaper than other top engineering schools like Berkeley, which is expensive for OOS, so it is a very good option for those who can pick it.",
