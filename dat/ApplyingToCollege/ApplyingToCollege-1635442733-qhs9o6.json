  "text": "What exactly constitutes as Research? For instance, is doing a research project as part of my school curriculum considered as Research? Like here in my school (Indian, CISCE board) or in all schools under this board, we need to do projects which, in the Humanities stream, basically becomes a dissertation. Especially in subjects like Sociology or Political Science. My point is, can those be considered as Research? Since I am basically doing them under a teacher, and every one of us do projects on different topics, so none of the topics are similar. Can anyone please clarify?",
