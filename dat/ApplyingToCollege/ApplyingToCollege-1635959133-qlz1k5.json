  "title:": "To juniors and seniors who haven't applied yet: these are tiny but important details about the Common App I didn't know before applying to college",
  "text": "I went into senior year with a pretty good grasp of the process because I had older friends, but some of these things were really important and I figure the application process will be less time-consuming/mistake prone for you if I tell you upfront. \n\n1. After you pay, there's a button that you click to get back to the common app and actually submit your application. Sometimes you have to scroll down to look for it, so make sure you don't forget to do it. \n2. Every school sends you an application portal. They usually come about 1-3 days after you apply, and you can check whether they've received all of the required materials there. Sometimes you can miss a requirement, so it's important to check your email even after you've applied. \n3. There's a PDF review before you turn in your application. The easiest way to avoid making tiny errors like formatting is to review it before you turn it in. Even if you're procrastinating, I'd leave about an hour to look over the review just in case you have a bunch of tiny errors to fix. \n4. Testing requirements differ for every school. I had to spend an afternoon looking up all of them for the different schools I applied to. Better to do it early, so that you can email the admissions office if you have any questions.\n5. There's a grace period for your counselor to send materials and LORs. Pretty cool but I'd suggest that you try not to get into the position where you have to worry about it. \n\nThose are the ones I can think of. If anyone can think of any more, please comment them down below. This list may be completely useless, but I hope it helps someone. Cheers, and good luck to everyone during application season!",
