  "text": "So I submitted my sat score to UMD 10 days ago and I\u2019m not sure how I should check if they got my documents. I haven\u2019t finished applying on common app and I think I\u2019ll do it close to the nov 1 deadline. It takes 2-5 days to get the portal for tracking my application and seeing if my materials were received. Is there any other way to check if they are received before I even applied to make sure there\u2019s no last minute confusion?",
