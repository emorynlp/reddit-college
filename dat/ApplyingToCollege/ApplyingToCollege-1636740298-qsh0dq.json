      "text": "Because ED demonstrates tremendous interest in a school and ups your chances a good deal more than EA, especially when a school has both options available. For many of us EDing, it\u2019s actually the opposite of what you suggested, we have a specific range of reach schools we\u2019d love to attend regardless of which but may not necessarily have a standout \u201cdream\u201d school, and so we ED to any one of them that we see ED potentially taking us through admissions. The best argument for EA at least in my view is probably if you need financial aid, so it\u2019s best in your interest to leave your options open and gauge both your academic and financial situations. Even then, ED agreements are not binding if you cannot afford to go, so I still see EDing with other EAs as the best early strategy.",
