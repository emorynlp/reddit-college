      "text": "Hello! New Zealander here, in NZ universities also begin in March. The school would most likely have an academic year of March-November so you\u2019ll most likely graduate in November (or maybe December). \n\nThen after that it just depends on how long the course is\u2014if it\u2019s 4 years (8 semesters, or maybe they use a trimester system), then you\u2019d graduate Nov26 if you began in Mar22. \n\nHowever if you\u2019re in USA doesn\u2019t this mean the school begins before you graduate? Just curious :)",
