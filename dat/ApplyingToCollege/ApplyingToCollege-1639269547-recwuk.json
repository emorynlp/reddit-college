That\u2019s not to say my work is easy though, but it tends to go by pretty quick when you develop good habits.\n\nOther than class work I fill my time with extracurriculars. I\u2019m president of a philosophy research club on campus, I\u2019m on the squash team, and I\u2019m doing research at Booth under a finance professor, so those usually round out my time. maybe 30-35 was a bit under: it\u2019s probably more like 40-45ish per week, not including classes/office hours.

I'm doing the Data Science track for Econ, which is arguably the hardest one since it's more quantitatively focused, and my classes are very tough. In addition, I'm pretty sure I bombed the Abstract Algebra final I took a couple days ago for the math major, but everyone feels that way and honestly you get used to it. The classes are crazy hard here. Everything you've heard about UChicago being hard is true and then some, and then double majoring kind of compounds that. But ultimately, it's very doable, just takes a lot of studying. I've had to completely overhaul my study habits from high school, which was hard at the beginning I can't lie. But I love what I study so it's all good. Something like 1/4 of each graduating class is double majors if that gives you any meaningful context\n\nI really like the annual Latke-Hamantash debate. It's where they get two highly esteemed professors to have a public debate about which Jewish food is \"better\", the Latke or the Hamantash. It always ends up being super funny since you have, like, 2 insanely acclaimed professors from 2 fields somehow relate the debate back to their fields of expertise, so they end up talking about theoretical physics or modern philosophy or something. It's a good time and the university community really comes together around it. It's a very \"UChicago\" tradition though, if that makes sense haha",

Doing Math/Econ, do you feel like you still have the opportunity to take classes in other (related) fields? Do you feel like the math + econ track is narrowly focused? \n\nI ask cause I originally wanted to do politics and economics, but looking into it more it seems like doing econ at grad school kinda requires you to take the equivalent of a math major. That's alright with me since I really enjoy math and have loved it doubling up with stats and calc this year! However, I also really want to study politics and maybe philosophy in some capacity. \n\nDo you feel like doing econ/math is restrictive in terms of what it allows you to study (in the future? Do you have any optional classes or is your schedule packed between the two majors?Obviously you can only speak to UChicago and thats fine, just wanta know whether double majoring will totally lock me in to quantitative econ or whether I could still branch out into political analysis or philosophy! thx",
