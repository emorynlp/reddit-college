  "title:": "Graduate student for letter of recommendation?",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently a freshman in college trying to declare for a major that\u2019s really competitive during Fall of 2022. I\u2019m trying to see if I can get close with a professor in order to get a good letter of recommendation (plus being close with professors is generally a good thing anyway).\n\nI\u2019ve been primarily going to office hours with the instructor for my Math class this semester, but the instructor is actually a graduate student and not an actual professor (it\u2019s normal for graduate students to be leading certain discussion classes at my university, but I don\u2019t know if this is the case for the main lecture like in my Math class right now). I haven\u2019t been attending office hours regularly for my other two classes, one because of a time conflict and another (this sounds really bad) because I just haven\u2019t really thought about it up until now. I\u2019ve visited my math instructor\u2019s office hours almost every week since school started in August, and it\u2019s to the point where she recognizes my face (as long as I\u2019m wearing the mask design I always wear I think). \n\nWould receiving a letter of recommendation from this instructor be valid for when I apply to my major, or would I need to start getting close to someone who\u2019s an actual professor and not just a graduate student being an instructor?\n\nExtra info: The graduate student is a fifth-year doctoral candidate, and this is her third year being the primary instructor for the math class I\u2019m enrolled in. She even has her own website within my university\u2019s math department",
