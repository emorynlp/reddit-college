All I can think of for a personal essay (my top school requires \u201covercame an obstacle) is \u201cwhy I was quiet despite being an extrovert, when I realized that was wrong, and that I\u2019ve improved over the years\u201d, which is the only real obstacle I\u2019ve overcame but seems very basic.\n\nIs it better to try and find a non-cliche topic/a non cliche way to portray it, or should I just make a good, albeit cliche, essay?",
