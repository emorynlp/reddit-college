  "text": "I\u2019m an Asian female junior and I interested in STEM but I suck at math problems used in math team (like the ones on the AMC). I want to go to a STEM school so I feel like I should be doing more extracurriculars for it. I do other clubs where I tutor other students in math, Computer Science club, and am part of an organization that fixes computers. What other extracurriculars should I look for or should I try to improve my math skills and compete?",

      "text": "You already have math team tutoring, CS club, and fixing computers. That should be enough. Math team is still a nice EC for math skills and you are likely learning more than you think you are. You could also look at your school's robotics team if they have one, though honestly you've got four STEM things already.",
