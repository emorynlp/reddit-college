      "text": "The course designators are going to be specific to your community college, but calculus is generally considered more rigorous than introductory stats and is the one I would take if you are going into any kind of major that requires it. \n\nRigor is always viewed in context of what was available to you, but it's pretty common for students applying to those selective colleges to take AP Calculus BC as seniors - that's roughly equivalent of Calc 1 and Calc 2 at a community college.",

Also, do you know if taking a foreign language class last semester senior year fulfills the requirement for colleges that want 3+ years even though when I apply there will not be any grades. It is a self report of classes on the commonapp. Thanks",
