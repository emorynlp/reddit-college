  "title:": "Both my best friend and I got rejected from our top school.",
  "text": "Yesterday, both of us logged into the Stanford Portal, only to be greeted with two rejections. \n\nFor me, it was a dream I've thought of since 3rd grade that just... Disappeared. \n\nWe both thought we had at least a decent chance - we worked our asses off, doing what we can (despite covid seriously messing up a lot within my area) and submitted what we could. It didn't matter. \n\nAt first, it didn't really hurt - 90%+ get rejected after all. I just thought to keep going on the next schools I have listed. \n\nAs I kept thinking about it though, I'm wondering. What else could we do? Make more connections? Find other opportunities? Who knows. \n\nI've seen quite a few stories saying \"my best friend got in and I didn't\" with varying responses, but in a way it hurts more seeing both of us get rejected with all that we did. \n\nJust a little rant on what's going on, guess it's time for the next ones.",

      "text": "One thing that got pointed out in an interesting college admissions video I saw: sometimes you have done enough, but it\u2019s just the numbers game, and there\u2019s a high chance that if you applied 10 times with the same application, you would get accepted with the exact same application. What this says is that even if you\u2019re an ace student, it really does come down to the luck of the draw. There\u2019s hundred\u2019s of applicants just as qualified who also had that rejection, and probably some accepted with that same level. It\u2019s good on you to move on, because it\u2019s not a statement on your character anyway. \n\nWith that said, care to share your stats? The specifics can sometimes indicate where strengths or weaknesses are",

          "text": "I guess some stats I have: 1570 SAT, 4.0 unweighted. Ranked 18/385 but it's because i was taking classes at an accredited community college which lowers overall ranking (as opposed to AP). My friend had basically a bit higher across the board (1600, 4/385). \n\nI guess in the end of the day it's just one school, there's other schools out there who will take me and I'll take that chance\n\nEdit: not sure what it means to share stats btw so let me know if I should share more",

From there, it\u2019s on to your EC\u2019s, LOR\u2019s, and essays. If you want to share your stats there or thoughts on them, feel free! Those parts are determiners. Big ones.\n\nAlso, how about Supplementals?",

Might have been an internship too, which could mean lack of interest. Ran an event for over a thousand members, was in good standing, got good letters. \n\nI don't want to share too much about my essays, but I believe they were unique, if not in message, than in structure - each one was a story from something I learned or experienced.",

It really depends on where you put in stuff, and whether you did it for the college or yourself. They want to see that the passion isn\u2019t forced, but a part of you. Other than though, it is simply that luck of the draw",
