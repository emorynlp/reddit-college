  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI applied to UCSC, UCSD, UCI, UCSB, and UCR on November 20. I received an email confirmation from UCSD, and UCI, saying that they have received my application, but I have not received any confirmation email from the other UCs I applied to. I am really worried, because tomorrow the application for the UCs will close. Is anyone else in the same boat as me?",
