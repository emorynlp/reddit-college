      "text": "Every school is different. The first place to check is the college's website, usually the deadlines page, to see if they provide a decision date or timeframe. It could be anywhere from mid-Dec to beyond Feb 1. Often there will be a \"by\" date, as in, the latest date to expect a decision, even though the school often releases decisions prior to that date.\n\nIf the college didn\u2019t post a firm date on their admission website, as time gets closer, keep an eye on their social media for updates. Sometimes colleges post an actual date a few days prior.\n\nSee last year's thread to try to determine when last year's decision date was, just as a guestimate. (From the drop-down menu up top, 2020-21 ED/EA.)\n\nAt some point, there will be a spreadsheet in this subreddit, probably linked up at the top.\n\nHere is a handy chart https://www.collegekickstart.com/blog/item/class-of-2026-early-decision-and-early-action-notification-dates",
