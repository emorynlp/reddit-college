  "text": "Why not let ED apps be due \\~10.15 so that decisions could be released by \\~12.1 instead of in mid-December?\n\nFor those admitted: no need to do extra RD preparations in vain for two more weeks.\n\nFor those rejected/deferred: can write RD essays without distractions during the first two weeks of December.\n\nCurious.",

      "text": "They probably want to give the applicants as much time as possible before the ED deadline so that they may put their best foot forward - many of these schools have been doing this for years now, so they have a good sense of the timeline involved.\n\nAs for working on RD applications, nobody is stopping applicants from working on them while they wait for their ED decisions - I realise it's not ideal, but it's the next best thing.",

      "text": "Most college counselors hate deadlines in October (looking at your UNC and UGA). Some high schools don\u2019t go back until after Labor Day so there are huge swaths of the US that struggle to get all of the documents/requirements in time because six weeks isn\u2019t a lot of time considering everything else counselors are doing during that time. Nov 1 is much more manageable.",
