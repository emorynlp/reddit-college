Another piece of information that could be helpful would be asking them to add your application number and full name on the letter if you are really worried about this",

              "text": "It depends on the teacher. But seeing that all season, they are super busy, they will likely write a generic letter vs addressing each college individually. As someone who has written LOR for grad school students and transfer students, I didn\u2019t have a ton so I addressed each school individually. It\u2019s not required. When you go into common app and you apply to College X, your teacher that you request LOR from will get a link via their email you provided. They would then follow the instructions on the link and then upload the LOR PDF and submit. That\u2019s about it.  \n\nIt would be a good courtesy to let your teachers know in advanced that you will ask them and about how many schools you will be applying to. Give them a lot of lead time.",

I know the reg common app account you just submit the email of the recommender. What does your counselor say?",
