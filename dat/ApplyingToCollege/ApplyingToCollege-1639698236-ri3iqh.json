  "title:": "Is it better to take an elective that's relevant to your future major or an AP that's unrelated but carries a grade boost & credit? For example, if I want to study politics & i'm already taking ap gov, is it good to an elective called \"law studies\" or take an unrelated AP like AP Human Geog or APCS?",

And how rigorous is the law studies course? If it\u2019s a stront course that follows ap gov, That can be more helpful than any AP",
