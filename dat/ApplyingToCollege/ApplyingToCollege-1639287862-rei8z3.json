  "text": "if there are any humanities majors on here that would like to share their application process (general stats, ECs, honors) and their current college experience, that would be massively appreciated.\n\ni've been searching on here, chanceme, collegeresults, etc, for info but i feel like these subs are a little more STEM+business heavy.\n\nthere's a few majors in particular that i'm interested in like linguistics, history, philosophy, english, anthropology and it would be cool to see what ECs would help explore these fields and the sort of material that you actually study in college.\n\nthanks!",

              "text": "I actually took an awesome anthro class with a teacher from my school who did her PhD in Anthro, so that really made me intrested. I took some sick anthro classes over the summer at my local community College too. I'm straight going to state school, already put down a deposit and everything. I'm full pay at any high tier private and I'm fortunate enough that my parents can manage those costs but it doesn't make sense given my goals to either go into law or do a PhD, both of which aren't undergrad prestige focused. Probably going to double major in sociology just because I find it intresting and I have enough credits already to make it work in four years.",
