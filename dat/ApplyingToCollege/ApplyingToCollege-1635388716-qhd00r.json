  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI literally just found out Dartmouth asks for a peer rec. How important is this for admission? I have somebody I think I could ask but I'm a bit confused about how this all works. Does my counsellor send in the rec for me or is it through common app?",

When I applied, I asked my best friend to write it. Get someone who knows you well and can speak to your character as an individual. The whole point of this is for the AOs to be able to see who you'll be as a genuine member of the class, not as the hyped up person you are in teacher recs",

It's all through common app you just put in their email as an additional reccomender. \n\nIf you are applying Ed, ask asap. This really isn't much time for them (my friend took a few weeks but everyone is different).",
