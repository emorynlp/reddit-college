I don't remember my 'stats' but they were not that good.\n\nBut you know what I didn't do? I didn't let those people get to me. I worked my ass off in college and used every opportunity I got. I learned as much as possible and stayed humble. I am now starting my first job out of college making 100K+. The name of my college did not get me this job, my gpa alone didn't, no internal references either. My work ethic did. Never ever give up. Never think you are not good enough. ",

This comment made me feel 100x lighter. \n\nAs a senior in high school, I\u2019m struggling to accept the fact that even though I busted my ass for good grades, going straight to a university isn\u2019t and never has been a good option for me. I\u2019m looking into going to a community college and a transfer to a 4 year. It\u2019s discouraging because this entire year I have been telling myself that all of the hard effort I\u2019ve put into getting a decent GPA has been for nothing, because all you need to get into a CC is be alive lmao.\n\nBut what I\u2019ve come to realize is high school shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a competition for a college acceptance. I\u2019m desperately trying to change my mindset, so I can fully take advantage of my free education while I can. \n\nI\u2019m taking difficult classes this year. Not for a gpa boost, but to be able to get a head-start for difficult courses in college. Having some knowledge about physics before taking the course when it costs thousands sounds pretty chill.\n\nWork ethic can get you there and beyond. Fuck the numbers \ud83e\udd1d",

Insurance and retirement savings are not cheap things and are worth a ton.\n\nHealth/Life insurance can only go so high, probably 10K. 401K matching doesn't usually go over 5%, so even on 100K salary, that's 5%. So so far for a 100K salary with good benefits, you're looking at under 15%. Where the heck does the other 25% come from?\n\n>Once you get into base pay of 6 figures you are not talking about people with 4 year degrees. Generally that is the realm of doctors and lawyers, not interns.\n\nAgain, you are making a sweeping claim with no evidence that is simply false. In high COL areas, 100K is par for the course for developers, starting salary for a CS bachelors. This means SF, NYC, Seattle, Boston, and maybe DC/Chicago. It does of course scale as you leave urban centers, but OP is pretty clearly in one of those urban centers, and even smaller cities still offer salaries consistently hitting 100K.\n\nTake a look at the Bay Area specifically:\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/salary/explorer?countryCode=us&maxYearsExperience=0&minYearsExperience=0&regionCode=84&titleId=9](https://www.linkedin.com/salary/explorer?countryCode=us&maxYearsExperience=0&minYearsExperience=0&regionCode=84&titleId=9)\n\n[https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Software\\_Engineer/Salary/936e3c99/Entry-Level-San-Francisco-CA](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Software_Engineer/Salary/936e3c99/Entry-Level-San-Francisco-CA)",

And I\u2019m speaking from personal experience.\n\nWent to an ultra competitive public school sending majority of our Top 10% to T20 schools. To stay with-at minimum-on par with these near geniuses, I took AP Physics and Euro my sophomore year (I also skipped a grade in elementary school so mind you, I\u2019m 14 learning about momentum and The Enlightenment). Well, I got a 3.15 UGPA (got a C- in physics and Bs in every other class except spanish) my first semester sophomore year after getting a 4.0 freshman year. Well fuck me. I got a 3.57 UGPA the next semester. Copped 3\u2019s on both exams-barely.\n\nWell fuck that noise I fixed my shit. I worked my ass off junior and senior year and after multiple college rejections I\u2019m lucky enough to I say I am a Vanderbilt freshman. I\u2019ve learned how to study, how to challenge myself, and everything in between. \n\nI\u2019m not the smartest student. I lack a natural work ethic, and a natural drive. I\u2019m not naturally talented like others on this campus. You wouldn\u2019t look at me and be like \u201cWow I wanna be him.\u201d But I keep improving, and hard work will  bring me my successes I\u2019ll tell you that.\n\nYou may have figured out late that you have things to work on, but it doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re literally still in high school. Don\u2019t let your failures define you, instead, let how you work to fix them  do that.\n\nSo yea, here\u2019s to us B- students.",

Junior year first semester was so bad had multiple C+'s in all my AP classes, but second semester I bounced back and started getting B/B+'s and now senior year its almost all As. I just wished I could've got my shit together sooner. ",

          "text": "Came here to say this. I graduated from high school a couple years ago with a 3.4/5.0 GPA (so mostly Bs, a couple CS, and As in my easy mandatory classes), 24 ACT, and 1650 SAT (when it was still out of 2400). Missed 2 years of high school because of a health thing and it showed. Graduated at or near the very bottom of a super high achieving year (23/64  students went to T20 schools). Only qualified to take 4 AP classes and failed every one except English language for some reason. \n\nI went to a local college and worked my ass off for a year. Spent time tutoring and getting tutored. Did a lot of volunteer work. Filled the really glaring gaps in my education. Frequently spent 16 hour days working and studying. Learned to become persistant about learning from my mistakes. Left that school after a year with a 3.93. \n\nEnded up transferring to a T10 school, studied computer science, got an amazing job which earned me 90k my first year out, graduated with honors, moved to my dream city, and never looked back. It sucked and I didn't get to do a lot of typical college partying and socializing but man was it worth it. \n\nI always felt like such a dumbass in high school and more than once was told by teachers I should never even try to go into STEM because I was too bad at math. I'm still bad at math but it's actually not actually a super core skill, and one that time, effort, grit and in my case proper treatment for undiagnosed ADHD can help remedy. And hiring people always love a great underdog story. ",

As for GPAs validity as an indicator of a students academic future, it\u2019s extremely variable. Some high schools have hella easy classes and others have hella strict teachers and hard classes. Even within one school, 2 teachers of the same subject can vary a lot on how they dole out grades and knowledge. For instance, I took ap world my sophomore year, and there were two teachers. One super strict who gave a lot of homework and didn\u2019t teach at all, while the other was a chill dude who just lectured for daily grades. I got the super strict teacher, and likely mastered the content of the class as well as, if not better than, the students who got the easy teacher, but my GPA ended worse because of how the grades were handled. Things like the sat, on the other hand, are nationally standardized and regulated (even tho the sat cucked me cause I took the June sat and got 1 wrong on math and ended with a 770).",

                              "text": "Depends. At least at my school, teachers are given a decent amount of room to make their own grading policies (there are still school-wide standards\u2014e.g. midterm/final exams being work ~10% of your final grade each). Some of my teachers grade effort and participation, and some don't. Most of my teachers that care about that will make the grade weigh zero, so you'll get a grade but it doesn't actually do or affect anything. As for attendance... I've never had a teacher grade me for attendance. My school has an attendance policy that basically states how many classes I can miss a semester until I lose credit for that class, but individual teachers don't really grade that. It definitely would affect your relationship with the teacher, but you wouldn't get a grade for showing up to class or not. The only exception is that I've had some classes (gym and electives) that will have a daily grade (e.g. a 50-point grade for participation/effort) since there aren't really any assignments, and often if you're absent then you'll receive a 0 for that day.

I graduated high school with a 3.1 GPA in 2009. I went to a small liberal arts college. I busted my butt doing extracurricular activities and internships while in college. Once I graduated college, I went on to start a career in politics making much more than the majority of my friends that went to top tier colleges.\n\nI remember being in your shoes 10 years ago exploring the college scene. Beating myself up for not pushing myself more. Here's a tip that I didn't know until I became a hiring manager for multiple offices. Unless you're pursuing a career in STEM, the name of your University doesn't matter. Even within STEM it matters very little. If you decide to pursue a Master's or Doctoral degree. That's when it matters. Even when applying for those programs, past your Undergraduate GPA, the tier of your University doesn't matter either. ",

In Sophomore year, the biggest thing holding me back was AP Mandarin, which I barely passed on. In Junior year, I took most of the hard classes (2 APs), but didn't get any A's except in two classes. I just don't have that strong of a work ethic or a drive to do something until the last minute.",

      "text": "I got As Bs and Cs throughout high school, and failed my AP Calc exam. I had some really good grades and a great SAT score and some... not so great grades.  I just couldn\u2019t get the motivation to work on the things I wasn\u2019t interested in.  That brought me a lot of stress in high school and when I was waiting for college acceptances, and while I got rejected from every single one of my dream schools, I also got into UCSB, UC Davis, Boston U, University of British Columbia, Brandeis.  Pretty good schools.  I didn\u2019t attend any of them because I took a year to travel, study, volunteer, and learn a language, and then drafted to the army in my parents\u2019 country.  Now I\u2019m getting discharged and on track to free college (because I volunteered to draft) in that same country... with a lot more confidence and life experience.\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is that time and distance have shown me how unhealthy and obsessive the college race is in the states.  I remember when all my worth seemed dependent on my acceptance to Brown.  In the same class that my friend got accepted into Brown, I got rejected.  I was crushed.  But I don\u2019t envy any of my high school friends now.  At the end of the day, whoever looks for experience and opportunities to learn, will find them and succeed. And though I\u2019m only starting uni the year that my class graduates, I know I\u2019m much more ready to take it seriously, much more focused on what I want, and that I will have a good career the same as anyone else... just without debt.\n\nSorry for the long post.  Just the uni you go to really isn\u2019t the end all be all of existence.  Y\u2019all are doing great.  It\u2019s hard to prioritize your grades above almost everything else, and it seems like that\u2019s what\u2019s expected of us.  But outside of that world, it\u2019s all just meaningless numbers.  It\u2019s ok that you gave fun more time than your peers with good grades.  That\u2019s called work-life balance.  \n\nGood luck to everyone :) ",
