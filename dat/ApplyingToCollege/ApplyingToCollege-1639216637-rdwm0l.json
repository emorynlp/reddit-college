  "text": "I am a current college student working as a tour guide for my school. A prospective student emailed the visitor center to compliment my tour and it made my entire week. If you are one of the people being nice to your college guides, thank you!! We really appreciate it; it\u2019s a bright smile in a sea of anonymous faces.\nGood luck on applications! Maybe I\u2019ll see some of you on campus.",
