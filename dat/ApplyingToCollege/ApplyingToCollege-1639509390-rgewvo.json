  "text": "I just found out today that one of the schools I applied to Early Action is a private school. I also applied, Restrictive Early Action, to Harvard.\n\nHere's the problem: Harvard's REA program doesn't allow for the applicant to apply to other private schools before Harvard's decision letter comes back. I basically just broke this rule by applying to a private school early action, and I have no idea how to fix this.\n\nI tried calling the office today, but their phone line was closed. Does anyone know what kind of consequences I might face for this mistake? Also, does anyone know if I can fix this by just rescinding my application to the other school?\n\nThanks a bunch!",
