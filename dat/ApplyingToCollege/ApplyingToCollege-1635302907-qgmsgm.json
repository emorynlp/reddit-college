  "text": "Hey everyone! I\u2019m currently working on my Brown Supplement:\n\n**Brown students care deeply about their work and the world around them. Students find contentment, satisfaction, and meaning in daily interactions and major discoveries. Whether big or small, mundane or spectacular, tell us about something that brings you joy. (200-250 words)**\n\n\nI chose to write about a unique extracurricular I have. I helped organized and am captain of my schools Varsity Esports team that is recognized by my states sports league (the same people in charge of football, soccer games etc). Is this a risky choice? I have it listed on my extracurriculars, honors(from winning first place) and now writing a supplement on it. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s unique/good enough or a waste of a supplement. I would love to hear your thoughts.",

Will you always be the captain of your school\u2019s e-sports team? Will it bring you joy in ten years? Is it an integral part of who you are?\n\nThey want to know \u201cwho you are\u201c rather than \u201cwhat you\u2019ve done.\u201d",

          "text": "I\u2019m not hyping up my status as captain though, in fact I don\u2019t believe I mentioned I was the captain in my essay. I talked about the community I built around the esports and the unique interactions I have with people globally in tournaments. I also say I wish to contribute this at Brown since they don\u2019t have a very large competitive esports team as of now. But again i did start this last year so maybe I should focus on something I\u2019ve done for longer?",

What it means to you. How it helps define you. Working with your hands, combining simple ingredients into something that brings people happiness, nourishing body and soul, etc, etc,,",
