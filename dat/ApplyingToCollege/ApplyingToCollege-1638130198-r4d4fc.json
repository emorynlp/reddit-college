Some schools only require self-reporting until you are accepted and commit. Then they will want the scores. \n2.  For AP, it may not always be strategic to mail the scores to the school asap (I can\u2019t think of a school that requires scores mailed til you are admitted). You may want to take the class again\u2014better college instructions, better shot at a high GPA, refresher before being placed in an overwhelming upper division class.",

You would need to send the official scores, matching your self-reported, if you enroll.\n\nSome schools require official SAT scores with your application. You send them at the time you apply.\n\nAP scores are mostly the same, though I don\u2019t think anyone requires official AP scores with application (one used to, don\u2019t know if they still do). Even if you don\u2019t use AP scores for your application, you can still send when you enroll to earn credit.",
