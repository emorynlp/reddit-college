  "text": "Hi! I\u2019m a sophomore in at Rutgers University, New Jersey hoping to transfer to UCSD or SDSU (I\u2019m a resident of California). I\u2019ve done some research and I know that UC\u2019s prioritize California Community Colleges and I haven\u2019t seen any info like that for CSU. Despite knowing that, I\u2019m still going to try and if anyone has any advice or has been in the same situation please feel free to reach out, it would be really helpful!",

      "text": "Admission to these schools is based largely on completing a specific set of prerequisites with a minimum GPA. One reason it\u2019s easy to transfer from a CCC is they have contracts with the 4-year schools about which classes \u201ccount.\u201d You can see those on assist.org for any CC and any UC/CSU. Looking at that may help you figure out if you have met the GE requirements and the others you need to get in. Transferology using Rutgers to UCLA as a proxy might help too. \n\nSD is tricky for GE because it depends on your college, so I\u2019d just research that hard and also see if you can qualify for IGETC through a CCC with just a class or two.\n\nLooks like for UCSD in addition to GE you need Gen chem 1 & 2, calc 1 & 2, bio classes that cover organismic and evolutionary bio, micro economics (and they\u2019d like macro 2) and they\u2019d like physics mechanics. Most of these will have obvious Rutgers equivalents. But if you are missing something you probably won\u2019t get into UCSD even if your application is otherwise good. One benefit of switch to a CC in January is that you could, for example, take a bio class you know will count. You could try transferring in your Rutgers classes and AP credits and see if you can easily complete IGETC which covers GE for transfers everywhere in the California public system. And you can tell colleges in January you are enrolled in these 4 classes that will for sure transfer which might boost your chances.\n\nIf you don\u2019t get in this next round, you only need an academic year and 60 (planned for spring is ok) semester units to get guaranteed admission to UCI/UCR/UCSB as a TAG student and 30 total CCC units to get that CCC transfer priority status. You could apply next September for fall 2023, finish up the classes you need by Christmas and maybe do Americorps or an internship/gap semester from January. https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/transfer-requirements/uc-transfer-programs/transfer-admission-guarantee-tag.html\n\nYou might also have a very solid shot at admission to UCLA or UCI through a CCC TAP certified Honors program. https://admission.ucla.edu/apply/transfer/ucla-transfer-alliance-program  https://honors.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2019/10/HonorstoHonorsFlyer_2019.pdf\n\nUCSD I think has guaranteed admission programs through some San Diego CCs in a program called University Link but there are income limits. https://admissions.ucsd.edu/transfer/universitylink.html\n\nIt would have been smarter for you to stay in Cali and apply from a CC next month than going back to Rutgers for this semester, but what\u2019s done is done. If you want to switch into a UC, I would indeed come back because you can have an unlimited number of CCC credits and still apply as a Junior transfer but there\u2019s a max of units from 4-year colleges. https://admissions.ucsd.edu/transfer/application-requirements.html  \n\nPlus why pay for out of state tuition and freeze in NJ if you don\u2019t need to. That Stuff Yer Face sandwich shop is delicious but it\u2019s not THAT good. \n\nI used to teach at a little private college near Rutgers - it\u2019s a great school with some amazing programs but I wouldn\u2019t have paid OOS tuition for that. We now live in Cali. My daughter wasn\u2019t too happy with the UC options she had when she applied as a freshman and after doing a ton of research she opted to go to our CC and use those special programs to increase her chances. She had a ton of AP credit that knocked out most of her GE and a bunch of prerequisites so she applied to TAG about 10 days after starting college. The following April she was accepted to all top 6 UCs. She is finishing up at the one nearest our house, and it will only take 3 semesters. She has been living at home because with Covid dorms were hard to get into so the total cost of her degree will be under $25k. \n\nCalifornia has a great transfer system and it can work out well for you even at this point. The TAG program and other guarantees mean that if you just take all the prerequisites and get decent grades, you aren\u2019t risking anything - except, in your case, maybe time.",

          "text": "Thank you for your post, it has a lot of good info. I\u2019m just worried that if I do transfer to a ccc back in SD so last minute, I still won\u2019t be able to get into the school for fall 2022 and my goal is to get in for next year. But I see you recommend still enrolling into a ccc because it would better my chances. I\u2019m just afraid I would risk losing my opportunity to get a degree from Rutgers in case I don\u2019t get into UCSD if go to a ccc. I am talking to someone who seems to have been in the situation as me, they got into UCSD this fall as an OOS University student and they are a California resident. That definitely gives me hope that I could do it too, but the odds are still low for me to get in.",

              "text": "Depends if you have all those prerequisites and they line up nicely with the requirements on that list. Gen Chem is pretty straightforward and so is Econ but the bio looked hard to match - it required 3 classes at my local CC instead one just 1 at UCSD. If you have pretty closely matching classes and, say, a 3.6 I\u2019d give you an excellent chance of getting in from Rutgers. \n\nBut you know, going home doesn\u2019t mean giving up Rutgers. You should be able to fill in a withdrawal/leave of absence form in late December, take CCC classes for a term and apply to re-enroll later with almost certain readmission if you change your mind and/or don\u2019t get in. You can transfer your CCC classes to Rutgers the way you would, say, study abroad classes, and most should at least count as electives. Taking CC classes (perhaps in summer) is a good way to cut tuition costs at any college if you know the credit will be accepted. \nhttps://sasundergrad.rutgers.edu/degree-requirements/policies/leave-of-absence\n\nMy daughter actually was unhappy with the limited classes she was able to get into her schedule and the limited opportunities with everything online last year so last minute she opted to take a leave from her UC and do prerequisites for the grad programs she is interested in at a CC. Those classes don\u2019t necessarily help her graduate from her UC because they don\u2019t fill major requirements but they did give her senior status. In your case, classes should count as elective credit and may fill Rutgers requirements if you pick classes carefully. My daughter applied for readmission a week or two before registration for the next semester and it was a smooth easy process that just cost $20. I\u2019d assume it would be similar at Rutgers but you should do what she did and talk to a counselor first.",

                                      "text": "Yeah I think they will admit you based on course titles and then evaluate the classes thoroughly using syllabi later. What about the major prerequisites? \n\nMy understanding for UCSD is that they want to see everything on the \u201crequired\u201d list and then the \u201crecommended\u201d classes can break ties if two applicants are otherwise equal. I would guess the essays help some but that prep work being done is a big factor in UC transfer admission in general. And it\u2019s fair because if you don\u2019t get in because you are missing classes you can just take those and reapply the next year. My impression is that it works similar to SJSU\u2019s system: https://www.sjsu.edu/admissions/impaction/program-supplemental-criteria/program-impaction-transfer-coursework.php\n\nWhen my daughter applied to UCSD it was a not particularly competitive major and they just said \u201cas many of these classes as possible\u201d - no firm major prerequisites. Looks like the one you are interested in has a firm list. So I\u2019d encourage you to plan to have the chem and calc series and at least one Econ class done by June. Those are all straightforward and should transfer.\n\nWhen my daughter applied she was shooting for a 1-year transfer with TAG and she applied to the top 5 UC schools. Admission prerequisites were different for each. She applied as sociology for UCLA and Berkeley because the only firm prerequisites were intro to sociology and stats (after admission she took the last 3 prerequisites over summer and fall and switched into her preferred major in January - but she knew this was possible going in). Davis also was mostly just GE and I think for most majors Davis will literally admit off GE and GPA. Rumor is that only B/LA/maybe SD read the essays for transfer admission and the rest go by the grades/prerequisites compared to others applying for the same major and use the essays mainly for scholarship decisions. Making sure my daughter\u2019s schedule would include all the required classes for all the programs at those 5 schools was complicated and knowing a mistake could mean an extra year in CC, we hired a private admissions counselor to go over the course map she had developed with a CC counselor and I had double checked. Neither of us were super impressed with our 30 minute meeting but she did notice a potential problem with a nitpicky issue that could have been big. I really thought the ebook she used to sell online about transferring into a UC was fabulous though. Some really great tips. That was her main focus, UC transfers, and she has worked with enough students to know what works and what doesn\u2019t. You might want to check out her website and possibly hire her for an hour for tips. The book had a whole chapter on OOS college transfers. She has decided not to update it anymore but most of it is still accurate and it\u2019s only $3\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/How-Transfer-California-Community-College-ebook/dp/B013FBFK46/ref=sr_1_1_nodl?ie=UTF8&qid=1438805401&sr=8-1&keywords=How+to+transfer+to+a+UC\n\nHere is her website\nhttp://cacollegetransfer.com/about-ca-college-transfer/",
