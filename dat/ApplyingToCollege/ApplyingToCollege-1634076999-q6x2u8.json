      "text": "With those stats I believe you can definitely add Iowa/Iowa State - both solid schools with welcoming campuses and Alabama as target schools who are very willing to give merit aid to OOS students (as long as you don\u2019t mind the location too much), maybe UIC (bit of a commuter school but right in Chicago)/Seattle U (underrated) for very urban places that will be under 40k before room and board - Seattle will cost more but 92% of students get financial aid so they can probably get you to a number that works if admitted - UPortland, UDenver, San Francisco, UHouston\n\nThere\u2019s more if I really looked, and some of them are a higher prestige than others, but with your budget and SAT there\u2019s a lot of schools that you have a realistic shot at, along with some safeties if you don\u2019t mind going to directional schools",

But I have a lot of recommendations if you are looking on the west coast.\n\nThe west coast doesn\u2019t have many \u201cIvy league\u201d schools. Which, if you\u2019re like me, doesn\u2019t matter because I\u2019m not that dedicated to having the best essays, best extracurriculars, best private counselor, and best everything else to get into a college that accepts 2% of applicants. \n\nThe colleges I want to go to are what many on this sub would consider safeties or targets lol.",

                      "text": "Alright!\n\nSome of my target schools in California are pretty much any of the UCs except Berkeley and Los Angeles (which are waaay more competitive). My personal favorite UCs are San Diego and Davis, but all are great. They all have different pros and cons. For example, Davis is close to the state Capitol for all those pesky political science majors. \n\nThere\u2019s University of San Diego, which is great if you want the urban beachy vibes of Southern California. University of Washington is another school I would attend in a heartbeat. Both have an acceptance rate of ~50% and are quite urban. \n\nThere\u2019s the University of Oregon and Oregon State University, and Portland State Univeristy which are all pretty easy to get into with 80-96% acceptance rates. \n\nI would just google \u201cUSNews top colleges in X state\u201d and that will give you a good idea of what colleges are in each state.",
