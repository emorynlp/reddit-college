  "text": "So I'm a potential F1 visa international applicant from Canada. I just submitted my UC app to Berk and UCLA last night, but I may have accidentally clicked a box that said \"I am seeking financial aid\". The problem is, I can't tell if this was a figment of my imagination or not, because reviewing my application, no section asks about financial aid.\n\nHowever, we all know about financial aid and how it affects your application at need-aware schools, on top of the fact that I dont even need financial aid? My family income is waaay above what qualifies for the blue and gold program. Nor do I qualify for any aid designated for US residents. Just a complete brain fart on my part.\n\nSo what I'm asking is does anyone remember if there was a box to be checked on the UC app asking for financial aid? And if I did mistakenly click this, should I email UC admissions and tell them this is not the case? What should I do?",

              "text": "The common app, yes, because some colleges on the CA provide need-based aid to intls, and most of those colleges are need-aware too. But the UCs don\u2019t provide any need-based aid whether one needs it or not (if you\u2019re intl/OOS), so I can\u2019t see a purpose for such a box on their app. If you\u2019re concerned, you can email the individual UCs about it.",
