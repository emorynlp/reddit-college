  "text": "I was looking through my common app and I realized I reported I was doing AP Micro first semester rather than AP Macro and vice versa. Will this count as academic dishonesty and will it drastically affect my chances?? Also, do I need to contact all the colleges I applied to about this?",

      "text": "I don\u2019t think so. In my school AP Micro/Macro is all just a full year class and I don\u2019t even think they people in it really know if they\u2019re starting in micro or macro. it\u2019s technically two different classes but most places it\u2019s treated as a full year course. I wouldn\u2019t look too much into it but if you want a second opinion, call their admissions officer and see what they say. You can\u2019t unsend an email but asking a question can\u2019t hurt. The one time i called to ask a question they didn\u2019t ask my name or anything so they had no idea who i even was. So if you\u2019re really stressing call and ask and they\u2019ll tell you whether or not to email, or they might even be able to do something on their end for you.",
