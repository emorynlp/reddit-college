  "title:": "Question about FAFSA",
  "text": "I think I messed up with my FAFSA. I recently graduated from high school and took a semester off before starting college. I plan on starting in January 2022, so I waited till this October to fill out the FAFSA, because I heard it opened on the first. I filled out the 2021-2022 form, which I now realize has actually been open since October 1 of 2020. Do I now need to also fill out the 2022-2023 form for when I go into my second semester in the fall?",
