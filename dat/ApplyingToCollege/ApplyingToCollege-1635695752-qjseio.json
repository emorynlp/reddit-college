  "text": "I have two teacher recommenders, but two of my schools only allow for one teacher recommender, and one other recommender. Would it be ok to add my second teacher recommender as an other recommender, given the type/relationship \"other\"? \n\nFor context the two schools are Purdue and NC State. I couldn't find anything on either school's website about it.",
