However, I\u2019ve been recently considering not applying cuz I\u2019m Jewish (not that religious & ppl prolly couldn\u2019t tell I am) and my fam doesn\u2019t rlly want me to go. I think it\u2019s probably religiously tolerant to other religions but they do make it very clear that they\u2019re the \u201cThe Jesuit University in Silicon Valley\u201d lol\n\nDo y\u2019all think it\u2019s fine or should I pass on applying?",

IIRC, it doesn't have a campus Hillel, but rather shares one with neighboring colleges.   \n\n\nWhether or not you feel \"out of place\" as a Jew will be highly personal and you SHOULD VISIT/ TALK TO STUDENTS. I remember when I was 17 and toured Brandeis as a non-Jewish student; I definitely felt completely out of place.",
