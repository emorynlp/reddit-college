  "text": "I feel so burnt out already because of so much things I went through this year. College apps and a bunch of AP\u2019s, and on top of it im having a lot of issues with friends and relationships. I hate my life rn and it\u2019s not gonna change until I get into college. I feel like this college app process is also contributing to my bad mental health. Even if I know this process should be something I need to think positively, it just doesn\u2019t work for me right now.",

      "text": "I don't know what the specifics of your situation are but for friends: If it's a two way arguement, be as direct and honest as you can. Otherwise tell your friends you want some time to yourself ro figure things out\n\nAs for college, don't stress yourself too much. If you've taken APs you'll get into decent colleges and it's not the end of the world if you don't get into harvard. The stress will end up affecting your grades and application anyway (and your health long term). \n\nthat doesn't mean quit, but you should focus on getting everything organized and then focus on a balance",
