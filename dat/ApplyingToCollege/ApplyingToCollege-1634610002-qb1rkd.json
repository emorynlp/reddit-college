  "text": "hi! so i took the sat with essay (a mistake lol) and am using that score to apply to colleges. i'm worried that colleges won't accept my sat score because of the essay based on the wording of their policies.\n\nfor example, northeastern's says: \"Under this policy, students may choose to not submit standardized testing or may choose to provide results from the SAT or ACT (without essay).\"\n\ndoes that mean i can't use my sat score because i took it with the essay? or is it just trying to say that the essay isn't required?\n\ntysm in advance :)",
