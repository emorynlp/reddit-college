  "text": "I've been told that UCs consider your grades/classes you take in the context you're in (i.e. a private school student might take a lot of APs, while low-income students may not live in an area that offers many of them).\n\nHowever, because OOS students don't send in a school report as part of their application or in the form of a recommendation letter (at least as far as I'm aware), the only factor UCs have to assess your UC GPA is simply the number of AP classes you got an A in. But without context information, isn't the UC GPA basically worthless?\n\nHow does UC \"consider the context\" for OOS students without any type of school report? Or am I missing something?",
