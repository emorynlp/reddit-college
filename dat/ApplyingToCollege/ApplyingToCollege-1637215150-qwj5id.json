  "text": "I know I shouldn't calculate GPA myself to give to the colleges if my school doesn't do so but I want to see where I'm sitting compared to everyone else. All the college admissions averages are in GPA.\n\nI took IB and honors classes through hs. How should I weigh them for my weighted GPA. I used some online calculators but am getting an extremely high WGPA in the 3.8-3.9 range and I don't think my marks are that good. I think they weighed the IB courses too much so I want to know how other people's schools do it. If your school doesn't have IB, you can just inform me of how it weighs AP.",

      "text": "Weighted GPAs are somewhat meaningless for this reason - there are many, many way to weight course, yielding many different answers. Honors at 0.5 and AP as 1.0 is common, on a typical 4.0 scale, but far from universal. I\u2019ve heard IB can be weighted like AP, but I\u2019m not familiar enough with them to confirm.\n\nAs an illustrative point, my daughter currently has a 5.208. At some schools this is higher than possible. At others it may be average. Outside of her school and her weighting process, it has little meaning.",
