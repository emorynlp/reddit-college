I don't mean to dishearten you, I'm just trying to be practical and say that it's ... hard to actually get recruited as a player for a team sport if you're not actually going to have a team in the gap year. Maybe try to shift to sports which don't require a team to enter a competition? Like maybe badminton,tennis or chess? I wish you the very best and hope everything works out. You can always pm me !",

There's nothing to loose but athletes don't become great players in a year, there's years and years of training that's put into becoming an athlete of a level which is recruiting worthy. Especially with a sport like bb, where there's no shortage of domestic players I guess? Good luck either way, hope everything works out!",
