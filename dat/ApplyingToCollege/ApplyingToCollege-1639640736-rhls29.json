  "text": "my grandpa got hit by a car last week, stressful time in my house, and long story short some very poorly prepped for finals have resulted in two very sexy B pluses in ap chem and ap calc bc. these are my first ever Bs. i was deferred from stanford rea, so those grades are going to be on my transcript. obvi no one is an admissions officer, but this is like a sort of significant dip, am i fucked for RD?",

      "text": "Seinor year grades don\u2019t matter nearly as much as all the other years, and those are both extremely hard classes. Like the hardest APs out there and AOs know that. Honestly you are not fucked at all. If you want, you can explain on your application that you had a personal family tragedy right before the end of the semester, and the AOs will understand. Stanford won\u2019t defer you unless they are really sure you are a top choice, so a small slip up as a couple B+ grades won\u2019t ruin your chances. Plus the regular decision round is much less competitive, and you must have had a great application for them to keep you in the running. I hope your grandpa is okay!!",

      "text": "First, I\u2019m sorry to hear about the accident, and I hope your Grandpa is recovering well. Second, this is not a significant dip in grades. Plus, generally speaking, Bs in those two classes are very respectable. \n\nAll that said, you need to make sure you\u2019re applying to colleges in regular decision with a range of admit rates. Don\u2019t focus solely on colleges which reject 80%+ of applicants. Be sure to apply to at least some colleges which admit 50%+ of applicants where you\u2019ll be a strong candidate for admission and merit scholarships.",
