  "text": "I misreported that I had dropped the second semester of AP Calculus AB and had a NM on the transcript, and had taken the class on an online institute in my junior year. I put the grade that I got in the second semester of the online course (an A) in the school section, and forgot to report the NM as well. This mistake doesn\u2019t have an effect on my UC GPA, so what should I do next? I am worried that this might get me rescinded if I get accepted to any of the schools, and my top priority are the UC's are they are in-state.",
