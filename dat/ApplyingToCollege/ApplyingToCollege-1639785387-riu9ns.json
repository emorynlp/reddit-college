  "title:": "How do you improve your application (in general) after getting deferred?",
  "text": "I applied to Upenn (ed) and Uchicago (ea)-- ended up getting deferred from both schools. This makes me think that my application needs areas of improvement for reach schools. How should I approach my other reach applications (so that I could be more competitive)?\n\n- This is what I have looked upon so far: \n\n1) revisiting my common app essay: I ended with a note about what i am planning to participate in the future -- ex: if my hobby was playing chess, I said how iam preparing for a chess event that will be administered by the school\n----- this 'event' got confirmed by the head teacher the end of last school year, but he never gave me an update till this day. \n\n (maybe this was one cause of my deferral --since it's not solid but an idea) \n\n2) supplements \n- I wasn't confident about my penn essay, but I truthfully liked my chicago essay. (I don't know how I feel about supplements anymore)\n\n3) stats\n-- except for senior year grades, I think iam done with the stat part \n-I submitted a decent score (99percentile but not perfect score)) \n- I didn't submit any ap tests (maybe this was one flaw)  \n\n\n4) extracurricular \n- I had one strong extracurricular with a portfolio \n- student council president \n- other small jobs I took (part time) \n\n5) Major\n- Nursing/science pre-med major\n(Maybe because my ec did not match my major)\n\n\nThank you!",
