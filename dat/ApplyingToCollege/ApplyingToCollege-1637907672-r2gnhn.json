This is directly from my friend.\n\n\u201cit was about my favorite shows, if i would want to take advantage of non-stem classes even tho i\u2019m premed, my relationship w my sister, living in [home], courses i want to take at harvard, and half of the zoom was just me asking him questions about his time at harvard\u201d\n\n\u201cand he asked me what he said he loves asking everyone he interviews - what would your sister/friends/family say about you if you weren\u2019t in the room or something like that\u201d\n\nBasically, there\u2019s no rhyme or reason. I\u2019ve read in the past about people just getting asked about their activities. It can really be anything about your application. In the case of my friends interview, it seemed like he was trying to assess her personality the most because her alumni interviewer wrote some real nasty and rude things about her (he was basically borderline racist in his interview report), so she\u2019s pretty sure that\u2019s why she got her second interview.\n\nAlso be sure to prepare questions for the admissions officer. It\u2019ll show that you\u2019re actually interested in the school and just have a normal conversation, joke around and try not to be tense or too formulaic. \n\nAll of the admission officers are REALLY sweet and nice. Like I\u2019ve talked and visited with both of my admission officers and gone out to lunch with them (this school year after I was admitted) and they told me they\u2019re always looking for the best in people and simply trying to give all of the files they\u2019re reading the best chance of getting in.\n\nLike in my file, my admission officers only noted the really strong and good parts of my file. They\u2019re looking to make you shine and are your advocates in this entire process. If you\u2019re AO is going out of their way to interview you, it is a good sign for sure and I believe people who get second interviews are admitted at a rate of around 60% given past data.",
