  "text": "Location/Region: Ideally the college/university would be in a city or suburb (easy access to a major airport is nice), American or British schools, the warmer the weather is year-round, the better. From California, UCs are affordable, but out of state options are completely viable.\n\nMajor: Chemical Engineering\n\nGPA/Test Scores (optional): 3.83 unweighted (All of the Bs are in english), 1600 > SAT score > 1500\n\nCurriculum: I don't like schools with a core curriculum. A little is fine, but the humanities are not my strength and I sort of dislike doing work for those classes. If AP credits can be used to skip most GE or Core requirements, I'm fine with there being a Core/GE requirements. Ideally, the school is rigorous, but has both a collaborative and competitive feel. \n\nSize: Larger schools would be better. (ChemE is somewhat of a niche major, so I wouldn't want to go to a school where there are only 20 other students in my year since some classes would only be offered in the fall/spring and being behind a semester could put you behind by a year)\n\nCosts: High cost isn't a dealbreaker, but cheaper is better. Ideally cost of attendance without aid is less than 50k-60k per year, but higher is fine. Schools with merit scholarships would also be awesome. \n\nSchools you're currently looking at (if any): \nSafety: ASU, UC Riverside\nMatch: UC Davis, Santa Barbara, Irvine, San Diego\nReach: UC Berkeley, UCLA, USC, MIT, Stanford\n\nAdditional:  If the school isn't Stanford, it must be ABET accredited for ChemE. 4+1 masters programs, study abroad, and a school that pushes students towards industry and grad school (not grad school and research only) would be nice. Robust internship and career support programs are also a plus. Ivy League schools are on the table if someone can explain why those schools are worth 35k+ more per year than UCs for engineering.",

      "text": "I'd look at Georgia Tech as a school that really offers what you've listed.\n\nColorado School of Mines is good, could possibly offer enough merit aid to be cost competitive, and Denver area isn't as cold as the midwest or northeast, but it isn't warm year round like a lot of CA is.\n\nHard to beat the UCs though - they are great if you have in-state tuition.",

      "text": "Hey! I'm also applying as a Chemical Engineering major.\n\nDefinitely keep ASU on your list as a safety. It's great for Chemical Engineering. And of course the UC's- the tuition is quite nice for in-state students.\n\nAlso, for the whole internship thing, maybe check out Drexel? Their co-op programs are quite nice and from what I've seen, they give decent financial aid. Also, same for Purdue(maybe as a reach school though)\n\nSome other schools that come to mind are UIUC, University of Delaware, Colorado School of Mines, and CU Boulder(I love their senior design course, in which students work with industry liaisons to create solutions to problems, some things students did in the past were things like polymerization processes, prosthetics, etc)\n\nJust some suggestions.",

          "text": "Thanks for your suggestions.\n\nI\u2019ve actually cut ASU in favor of Cal Poly Pomona or USF (national merit full ride) for my safety school because Phoenix weather seems miserably hot.\n\nI\u2019ve added Colorado school of Mines since it does have good scholarship opportunities, but some out of state schools like UIUC are expensive and don\u2019t have good merit scholarships. Purdue overenrolled by a ton this year and that got it knocked off my list. University of Delaware is great for ChemE, but there\u2019s a chance I could switch to a slightly different major and Delaware isn\u2019t exactly great at much other than ChemE. Drexel is fine, but I would probably prefer a safety like Cal Poly Pomona rather than a private school across the country.",
