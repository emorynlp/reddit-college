CS majors spend nights working on machine problems (programming assignments), while non-engineering majors are partying.\n\nThere are a lot of international students from China and India so if you like Asian food it can be a big plus.\n\n2. I heard it gets worse after COVID, but when I was there i think it\u2019s very safe, just like other college towns.\n\n3. I could remember we have a big ACM club. Yes, they do.\n4. CS is very competitive, <10% acceptance rate, CS+X is way easier to get into. CS+X can take the same classes but probably doesn\u2019t have the Co-op options CS engr has. If you apply to CS+X, do mention your interest in that X subject.\n\n5. Quality of the courses might not be the best, but UIUC does offer a very wide range of technical electives. You can pretty much find a class in any CS topics. This is very rare in other schools. \n\nOpportunities are tons, but to get the best out of it, you need to work really hard to outcompete your peers.",

Every year a few folks get into MIT/Stanford/Berkeley/CMU for PhD. It depends on which graduate program you are looking into. PhD programs are significantly harder to get into than Master\u2019s. You will need to be top of the class (at least a 3.7+ to pass first round of screening) and have extensive research experience.\n\n3. Yes. I spent 2 years doing research, and my experience was great. I was very fortunate to be advised by a top professor in my field that loves his student. Whether professors are approachable is more of a case-by-case thing. Well established professors are often more selective. In general I would say there are tons of resources at UIUC but you will have to work hard to utilize them well.\n\n4. People are generally nice and easy to get along. Party isn\u2019t a thing in Engineering/CS.\n\n5. Gender is probably close to 50:50. Race is like 50% Asian 40% Caucasian. 1/3 are international students (mainly from China and India). Many OOS students from California and surrounding Midwest states.\n\n6. Easier by a considerable margin, but not sure how much. Most people are nice, pretentious jerks are just a tiny % of people. CS+X are treated the same way as CS engr externally, so no disadvantage when applying to jobs/grad schools. CS+X does not get the 5 year BS+MS/MCS option, but it\u2019s not that difficult to apply if you do well in school. Also CS+X might not be able participate in City scholar which is a Co-Op program in Chicago. Can\u2019t confirm this though.",

          "text": "1. Overall UIUC probably offers more resources in CS, but it\u2019s more competitive to get those resources at UIUC than at Cornell. I would say less in per capita due to the size of the department. If you are a top student you will end up fine at both place, but if not you will probably be more well off at Cornell. Regarding internship I heard companies often have a hiring quota to achieve diversity in hiring at each school, so let\u2019s say even if Google hires 30 interns from UIUC, and 20 from Cornell each year, it\u2019s more difficult to pass resume screen at UIUC since as a CS students you will have to compete with hundreds of CS+X students, ECE students, and masters students. I have done multiple FAANG internships during my undergrad and grad school so I could verify this based on my observation.\n\n2. It\u2019s basically a job. Being a PhD student is extremely stressful. It\u2019s only worth it if you value intellectual pursuits (and interesting opportunities) more than money ($1 million opportunity cost) and levels. It\u2019s also very risky (average PhD students at top schools could still achieve very little and attrition rate is high) but it can be very rewarding (professorship, or starting successful startup) for a small group of people. Doing undergrad research helps you build up foundation knowledge and research maturity, so you could become more productive in PhD, but it doesn\u2019t make your PhD faster. I would say doing undergrad research for the purpose of exploration.",

      "text": "Sorry if this has been already asked, but how does CS + X differ than CS when it comes to acceptances chances? I know that they might be in different schools, but is CS + X program considered on par with entering other UIUC non-eng majors? Or does the reputation of UIUC cs drive up difficulty? \n\nSpecifically, I'm look at CS + Econ/Stat/math vs \"normal\" LAS majors like quant. econ or statistics",

Btw, I'm instate and my public, not super competitive highschool sends around 70 kids to UIUC each year with an acceptance rate of around 65 percent. If you don't know, thats completely fine as its such a general question.",
