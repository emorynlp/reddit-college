  "title:": "5 Most Overdone Essays and How to Avoid Them",
  "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nBased on your feedback, it seems like a lot of you are curious about what the most common essay structures are and what are topics to generally avoid for top schools. You know, I\u2019ve always found it fascinating how rapidly the admissions process changes every year, and how behind the general public is at catching up. The essay advice I see online now is about 5-6 years late. It\u2019s 2019, nobody\u2019s writing about dead pets or mission trips to Africa anymore.\n\nThe following represents some of the essays that I have found to be the most overdone ranked from most common to least. One disclaimer I want to make is that essays, while vital, are not the only factor for a student's success. \n\n**The Most Common Essay Structure, Period**\n\nThis essay outline has become the most popular over the past 3-4 years or so. I\u2019m not sure why, but it goes something like this:\n\n1. First standalone sentence that\u2019s supposed to \u201cgrab the reader\u2019s attention\u201d I guess. *The electricity in the room was palpable.*\n2. Following that, the first narrative paragraph explaining/revealing the context and situation. *Got it, so you\u2019re at your state debate tournament.*\n3. Montage paragraph describing your journey from the beginning to this moment. *You joined your debate team and were elected team captain.*\n4. Jumping to the present and wrapping up your story. *Hurray, you won an award and/or placed well.*\n5. End with a personal takeaway that doesn\u2019t look any different than the last hundred essays I\u2019ve read about your sport/club/instrument. *You weren\u2019t confident in yourself initially, but now you learned to accept yourself and are thriving as a result. You were scared to be in a new environment, but now you feel comfortable and have assimilated into a new team.*\n\nNow fundamentally this structure makes sense and performed well years ago. It builds suspense, it weaves in and out of time like an action movie. The problem I find is that many of these essays 1) follow this structure exactly with no variation and 2) have nothing of substance to say. It gets tiring. Instead of having exactly this outline, I would recommend that students try to build upon this or use this as a launch pad.\n\n**First-World \u201cWoe-is-Me\u201d Essays**\n\nNobody\u2019s writing about dead pets anymore, but the general idea is still showing up. Many middle-class to upper-class students make the focal point of their Common Application about issues they face that a reader is just not going to care about. The larger problem is that students will write about these mundane problems with complete and utter sincerity. Examples include minor maladies or ailments, \u201cfinancial issues,\u201d difficult teachers etc.\n\nThere are two problems with this approach:\n\n1. You\u2019re operating under the assumption that gaining sympathy from your readers will help you gain an acceptance. This is not going to be true when you are in these social classes. Exceptions do exist, but only for applicants with extreme familial and financial situations. Most of you writing these essays do not originate from such a background.\n2. We\u2019re not stupid. Students will often write about financial inconveniences or having a lack of educational resources even though they grew up in a nice, upper-middle class suburb with a solid school system. We can generally tell what your income is based on your activities and we know your region from previous cycles. At best, your reader is confused about your story and background. At worst, they think you\u2019re exaggerating your circumstances.\n\nGenerally, writing about difficulties you\u2019ve faced is completely doable as long as you have something interesting to say and can relate to your reader. I just don\u2019t want to read 650 words about how hard it was growing up with braces, especially when millions of children across the globe don\u2019t have access to dental care.\n\n**\u201cQuirky\u201d Essays with No Substance**\n\nI blame all those wacky viral essays on Business Insider (the most useless site ever) or whatever.\n\nIf you ask anyone in this subreddit, everyone \u201cknows\u201d that it is important to be unique and differentiate yourself. What makes you special, what can you bring to campus etc. The problem is that many of these essays tend to focus more on \u201cHey look at me, I\u2019m different!\u201d rather than having something substantive to say.\n\nThe core issue is that students tend to come across as inauthentic. Being genuine and sincere in your essays is one of (if not the most) important things colleges look for, and writing about oatmeal or staplers or some other random object really makes me question whether I like you or not.\n\nSo that\u2019s the logical reason. From my experience, sometimes admissions officers just won\u2019t like you because you come across as plain weird. You might think your Hearthstone Twitch channel or yo-yo skills are cool, but a lot of readers just won\u2019t care.\n\n**Tragedy**\n\nUnfortunately, tragedy is very common. I\u2019ve read hundreds of essays about friends\u2019 suicides, parental deaths, abuse, bullying, assault etc. The issue from an admissions perspective is that 1) there are so many similar ones that it\u2019s difficult to differentiate you from others in the pool 2) generally, you spend the entire essay talking about other people rather than yourself 3) students often have nothing new or innovative to say about said tragedy. I know this is unfortunate, but this is just the nature of seeing these essays year after year for a long period of time. People don\u2019t care about sob stories anymore on American Idol either.\n\nPersonally, I think that tragedy, if included, should not be the focal point of your essay. Weave it into a larger structure, and make it more about yourself and how the circumstances you faced have changed your perspective. Plenty of students nail this part and perform very well in the overall process as a result.\n\n**Food/Recipe essays**\n\nThere\u2019s two common food essays I\u2019ll see:\n\n1. Metaphor using a particular recipe (lasagna, dumplings etc.) to highlight an applicant\u2019s different qualities through layers or steps. This one\u2019s more common, and just lazy at this point.\n2. Recipe or special food that has been passed down in the applicant\u2019s family (usually grandparents) through cooking together\n\nThis surprised me when I first started reading applications, but it makes sense\u2014regardless of culture or class, everyone loves food.\n\nLastly, a lot of you have asked me about the Costco essay that \u201cgot\u201d a student into 5 Ivies. Look, if you are not also a Hispanic + African-American applicant like her, then I would not consider the essays or resumes of those who are as an appropriate resource. Use previous applicants to your advantage only when they match your own profile. Personally, I thought the essay was a fun read, somewhat refreshing albeit a little insincere and flowery, and would not consider it in the top tier of essays I\u2019ve read.\n\nAnyways, hope this was helpful. I really liked a few of the other suggestions (what exactly does \u201cfit\u201d mean at an elite school AO, common myths etc.) and really wish I could include everything. More coming in the future!",

And unlike most other components in a \u201cgood\u201d essay, the whole \u201cstart with something grabbing\u201d is an easy thing to implement regardless of skill level in writing. \n\nThe problem actually isn\u2019t the first sentence, it\u2019s that people are awkward in wielding it. The sentence is too dramatic for what they\u2019re describing. The wording is odd. It introduces a scene which is then abandoned. \n\nAs long as you can use that technique properly, it\u2019s a good technique. You do have to open your essays *somehow*, just don\u2019t try to make that first sentence the most profound thing.",

She implies a social conscious without characterizing herself as SJW.  The essay checks off all the boxes admissions officers are looking for while maintaining a level of genuinity and through a narrative that is fluent and interesting.\n\nNow, all the essays that spawned as attempts to mimic this style generally do come off as cliche.",

There are certainly emotions evoked (not sad != not emotional). Sure, it's not a perfect essay and doesn't rival quality of great literature, but in a blank-slate format of a Common App essay under the confines of a very low word limit she does a phenomenal job. This essay is far better than the ones I wrote and any of what I've read on this sub.\n\nThis essay reads far more genuine and purposeful than the mountains of essays from the prep schooler whose life was changed forever when they went on a mission to Latin America the summer before Sr year.",

Even if it is, I doubt that this formula was completely unknown before. The quality of the essay isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s not worthy of significant praise. What I got from the essay is that she is intellectually curious and a bit quirky with the Nutella question as an example. But that\u2019s it. I\u2019m not an admissions officer or anything of the sort, but I would think that many other students would be able to convey something similar. With that in mind, my emotions towards her is mostly still indifferent. No, she doesn\u2019t have to make me cry, but I didn\u2019t feel any relatability to make any deep emotion like sadness possible. With such little words available, a connection has to be made quickly to give a good first impression. Relatability is the most effective way in making a connection, which this essay lacked in my opinion. Maybe the relatability is subjective: the reason why you think this is a good essay, and others like myself the opposite. Our different experiences is probably why our viewpoints on the essay fundamentally clash one another, and makes this argument a moot point",

What would you recommend? Are there alternatives? Could I make up a story if it was well written, and just include a disclaimer like \u201cMy life is pretty uneventful so here\u2019s a sample of my fiction writing.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure many students have the self-awareness to realize that their life\u2019s great struggle or victory is not that significant or interesting but they have nothing else, so they\u2019re stuck describing that as dynamically as they can.\n\nThe whole thing strikes me like the Q and A section of a beauty contest. Everyone dreads it, including the judges, but they go through with it anyway because that\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been done.",

          "text": "I have read a lot of essays and a few have stuck out to me.  One of my favorites was from a student who lived in Iraq for their first 13ish years.  They wrote about walking to school and hearing bombs, seeing soldiers, etc.  How they hoped everyone in their family would make it home ok.  And even weirder how their family wanted to move to the country that was bombing their home city.  It was very unique and offered some good perspectives, plus it was extremely well written.\n\nMy other favorite was from a student from rural Michigan.  They didn\u2019t have much going on because there wasn\u2019t much happening in their small town.  They wrote about working at the movie theater and how it helped them come out of their shell.  Nothing special about the essay but it was something they were passionate about and it was done well.  They knew their life was rather uneventful compared to many but they wrote about something they were passionate about and enjoyed.  That came through in the essay.  It also wasn\u2019t written like \u201cI was shy and got a job at the movie theater forcing me to interact with people.  It changed my life and made me a better person\u201d, the overly flowery life changing essay.  They just wrote about what they liked about working there, the challenges, and the people.  It felt sincere.\n\nEssays are tough because there tends to be a lot of emphasis on writing the best one or the most memorable.  Really students just need to write a real one.  \u201cI went on a mission trip to Africa and saw true poverty, it changed my life.\u201d  No, no it didn\u2019t.  You have true poverty in your close big city of Minneapolis.  \u201cI went to teach them but they taught me.\u201d  Bullshit, you took pics with kids and you\u2019ll forget what you did in 2 years.  \u201cMy biggest failure was not making the varsity team.  I picked up the sport 2 years ago and was devastated when my practice didn\u2019t pay off.\u201d  Really?  2 years?  The essay doesn\u2019t have to be some big life changing event boiled down to 500 words.",

This is important to realize early on so you can focus on trying your best rather than overstressing about the result.\n\nTest scores reflect a single day. As most people have experienced, sometimes you just have an off day or are for whatever reason unable to focus, and your score would be bad and \"look bad.\" Meanwhile, the kid next to you who actually never came to class or did any homework gets the same grade on the test because he just guessed his way through it. \n\nA GPA, on the other hand, reflects an entire year's worth of effort. Putting effort into assignments, showing up to class, overall participation, and of course normal tests (since I'd assume the original use of \"test scores\" refers to APs, SAT, and ACT, etc.) affects the GPA. \n\nA 2 on the AP Psychology test might look bad, but having a 65% in the AP Psychology class (not including the AP score if it gets weighted into the final class grade like at my school) looks even worse.",

It really does matter how you write the essay, and how you portray yourself in doing so.\n\nMy first drafts probably had all of what he said was bad about these essays, and those things didn't make it to my second draft. I removed a lot of details about the actual struggles and made it much more about how I chose to handle them. Also, I see many people telling others not to focus on education/learning so much in their papers, but I did the opposite and did alright. There really should be an aspect of sincerity in whatever you choose to write about, because believe it or not, that will come through to whoever is reading it. \n\n I'm not sure if what I'm saying is helpful, so let me know if you'd like more information or for me to clarify anything.",

Maybe people did discriminate against you for being white or Asian, but that just doesn't play well.\n\nI'm curious why you lumped Asian students into this statement. I agree that it's tasteless for white students to speak about their brief experiences with prejudice when minorities applying alongside have experienced real racism with long-lasting effects, but I don't see how this can be extrapolated to Asian students. Many Asians can and do experience legitimate racism all the time. And of course, it's not exactly similar to the kind of racism that black applicants face, and neither is exactly like the kind of racism that Latinx applicants face, but I don't think we should be in the business of comparing the racism that minorities or ethnic groups endure, or quantifying it and claiming that obviously one is worse than the other -- especially at an individual level.",

Then in the latter half, I tried to just say that I know AOs judge as the human beings they are, and I don't necessarily fault them just for that... but the way _you_ talked about being weird or unusual seems overly critical and hostile beyond whatever clemency you get for being a normal judgmental human and all.

Tell us the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the \u201cwhat\u201d. Essentially this is asking about the motivations and passions that led you pursue these activities. So for a STEM kid, it could be the motivation to get more girls interested in coding that led them to make fun videos about key concepts for their AP CS class. \n\nThen there is another whole body of advice that says tell us something completely \u201coff-resume\u201d. Which I interpret to be about highlighting some personal character trait that is unrelated to anything you did. So for instance, this same STEM kid would write about how classical music is the perfect lens to their soul. \n\nWhich is it? Either or? Both?",

It's *okay* if you haven't experienced a personal tragedy or don't devote half of every day to a non-profit. Only *you* can tell your story and there is an immense value to that people forget. In the college process, people spend so much time trying to come off as unique by\u2013paradoxically\u2013imitating other people and they forget that the best way to be unique is to just tell their story. I know for some people, this might mean revisiting some of those essay topics that have been done a million times. But I believe that even if *your* topic isn't the most unique if you are truly writing your essay because of the value it has to you and not to look for sympathy or approval from some invisible AO, your essay will be wonderful. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd, honestly, this applies to your whole application too. If you are a freshman and you don't care about community service, that is okay. It is important to serve your community, but there are a million ways to do that, and not everyone will feel \u00fcber passionate about spending their weekends at a soup kitchen or food bank. Don't be afraid to carve out your own niche. You don't have to play a sport or an instrument if you would rather do anything else. It's important to just let your heart guide you. Try the things you want to and drop the things you don't like. And when it comes time to apply, don't be afraid to showcase your passions. Don't just give AOs what you *think* they want to hear, because the odds are such that a million other kids think they want to hear that too.",

      "text": "  \n\nThe electricity in the room was palpable.\u00a0\n\nKnees shaking, palms sweating, I spared a glance at the crowd, bloodthirsty and ready to feast on whichever team relented first. Yet I love this fear, this tension.\u00a0\n\nI looked above, at the bold white rafters bearing upon their shoulders the weight of the luminous chandelier, and then below, where its soft glow brought out the faces of my ever supportive team. In each face I saw fear and resolve, eagerness and apprehension. No, the journey had been not so easy and not so light and not so nice, but neither were we - finally ready, after years of harrowing practice, to compete at the state debate tournament. And it was going to be exciting and exhilarating and all worth it.\u00a0\n\nAs captain of the debate team, my journey has been far from easy. It began in freshman year of high school when I realized I had screwed myself over. Selective mutism, why did it have to be back? Frustrated, a fundamental lack of understanding in my mind, I decided to take the path that all shy students probably took: debate team, because what else was I supposed to do? I'd rather not spend hours at home mindlessly reading through periodicals and books, doing unethical things online in the process, figuring out how to just *interact*\u00a0with people.\u00a0\n\nSo I joined the debate club, and my first speech was terrible. However, as my voice filled and enlarged the room, I realized that the fear led to the thrill, which became like a calling. And so I continued, despite the new environment, to compete in teams and tournaments and do all that I could to make my formerly small voice heard. Debate became a realm in which I was neither experienced nor comfortable. It was simultaneously one of austere simplicity and aesthetic intricacy, of departure from the abstract and immersion in reality, of intense emotion and flowing expression. It was the realm of the endless exploration, in which I grasped for ideas that could mean nothing and everything.\u00a0\n\nIndeed, because I'm actually a troll and know nothing about debate, I'm just going to say that I won the award now. Exhausted, I beamed at my teammates as we huddled, cried, cheered, and expressed our gratitude towards all that had converged to make this miraculous feat possible. But mostly, we were proud, because in that pin-drop silent last moment, when eyes widened and time seemed to move slowly, we were overflowing with fulfillment and emotion. It was only from randomly copying other essays and stuff that I was able to accomplish this. Thank you. I'm a major procrastinator and terrible shitposter, so please downvote me.",
