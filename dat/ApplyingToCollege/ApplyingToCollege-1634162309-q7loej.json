  "text": "I really want to get into NYU because it\u2019s close to my home, amazing diversity and a great education that have two majors that I want to apply there for (music & vocal). \n\nI went on their website and did a lot of research but want to know the audition process recently. I really want to know what you can do for the audition to stand out more so the administrator will most likely pick you. Usually in this field, people are really competitive and have the same motives as me so I would really appreciate the help so I can get in. \n\nThe things that I know are required for NYU performance art major is: \n\n-have a minimum score of 3.5 on SAT\n-have a minimum score of 3.69 for GPA\n-audition \n-resume\n- a short three clip videos of you singing or playing a specific instrument for your portfolio \n\nI really love this school and any information about the audition process will help me out so much. I\u2019m in junior year so it might be me thinking too much but I would like to be prepared.",
