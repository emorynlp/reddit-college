  "text": "It's due tonight.  I went to summer school at a different high school, so I added that as a school I went to then added my one class (Health). Since that's not the school I go to, I don't have a GPA, class rank, or counselor. The SRAR portal is highlighting it in red as a warning because I left that stuff blank. Should I repeat all the info from my actual high school or leave it blank?",
