      "text": "For SNU (and I'm sure for Yonsei and Koryeo) you must take the TOPIK and present your official score to admissions officers. You have to be at least at TOPIK level 3, but honestly that isn't enough, and you'll most likely have to take Korean classes in the university ([this link says more about why](https://studyinkorea.wordpress.com/2013/08/12/korean-proficiency-why-topik-level-3-is-not-enough/))\n\nYonsei does have an international college called Underwood where you don't have to present a TOPIK score (all classes are taught in English), but choice of majors is limited and it's a bit more competitive for internationals. \n\nKorea tends to place much more importance on test scores than ECs compared to the US, so if your SAT/ACT, IELTS/TOEFL, IB scores are not up to par then you'll have a tough time. Solid ECs and a good personal statement will help, but they won't be able to compensate for mediocre test scores.\n\nOn the bright side, standards for internationals are lower than standards for domestic students. As long as you have a 3.5 GPA or higher, a 1400 SAT score or higher, etc, you'd have a solid shot.",
