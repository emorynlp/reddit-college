  "text": "During COVID, my(17) parents had to work from home 24/ 7 and I am comparatively older than my siblings(10 and 8) where I had to take care of their meals, set up their online schooling, and make sure they were on task and working on their schoolwork. I'm not sure if this is something I should include. My grades weren't really affected or anything like that so I'm not sure.",

              "text": "Well, first, this isn't just additional information, this could be an EC on its own. One of the options on Common App for ECs is like family responsibility or caring for family or something. \n\nIf you don't want to list it as an EC, putting it in COVID additional info is fine too. I don't know that it'll necessarily make much of a difference, but the worst case scenario is that it has no effect, since it's not like it can hurt you.",
