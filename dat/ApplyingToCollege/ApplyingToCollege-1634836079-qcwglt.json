  "text": "Thinking of transferring to Cornell but not sure if its worth even applying. I'm a sophomore at another private institution in NY with a **3.755 GPA** (3.93 psychology major gpa), psychology major. Is it even worth applying? I think my GPA might be too low for their A&S school since I know psych can be quite competitive. I was also a pretty average high school student (3.4 GPA) but did extracurriculars and lots of hours, would my high school transcript affect my application? ",
