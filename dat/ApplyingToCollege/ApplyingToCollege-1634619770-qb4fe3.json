  "text": "So I am a bit confused and can't seem to find this information online. So both ASU and Pitt have honors colleges (Barrett and Pitt Honors respectively) but when do you apply for them? Can I apply for ASU, wait till I get my decision letter which should come in 2-4 weeks due to them being rolling admission, and if I get in, submit my Barrett application by one of its deadlines? And then be notified if I got into Barrett by the notification period determined by which Barrett deadline I applied to? Basically what I am saying is that I want to be able to submit my ASU application and receive my decisions rly quickly to ease my anxiety of getting in somewhere but Barrett has these other notification periods and I am afraid I'd only know if I got into ASU by later than December. And I guess same question for Pitt, can I submit my Pitt application first and then submit my Pitt Honors College essay if I get into Pitt acceptance? \n\nLol sorry if I didn't express myself clearly or if this is an obvious question",

      "text": "1. You need to have ASU ID credentials in order to submit the Barrett app. You should submit the general ASU app ASAP to get these. \n2. Aim to submit a complete application for Barrett by Nov 1. In order to do this, you need to send off requests for letters of rec. You do this through the Barrett application directly, which is why you need to submit the general ASU app ASAP. \n3. You complete the Pitt Honors app on the general app itself (at least, on the Common App you do). You\u2019d need to contact the school to see if it\u2019s possible to apply later after submitting the general app.",

I understand you need to submit the general one first but I won't be able to submit the Barrett application by Nov 1 anyway so I wanted to know if I could just wait for my ASU acceptance first",

It says you'd need an ASURITE ID to submit the Barrett application which seems to be given to everyone who applies for the ASU general app, not just accepted people.",
