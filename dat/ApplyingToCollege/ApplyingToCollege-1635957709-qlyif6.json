  "text": "So my stupid self forgot to notice that Rice doesn't give any application fee waiver for international students. It's the only college on my list where I have to pay for the fee. So, even though it's fruitless ig, I wanna know if Rice gives any fee waiver whatsoever. Because with paying the CSS profile fee, registering for the SAT and then sending the scores, I am more than broke.\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\udc80",
