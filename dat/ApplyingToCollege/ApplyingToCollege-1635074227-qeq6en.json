  "text": "Hello everyone! I'm an international student applying for financial aid at Princeton,so english is not my  first language. Thus I have problems with understanding terminology or special words.Basically, I don't get what 'class' stands for in Princeton's non-filer statement. Is it my grade in high-school or years I'm applying to college?(Like Fall 2022 or how they say it?)\n\nThanks in advance for any help! I'll appreciate that!",
