  "text": "Hey guys! I'm an prospective engineering student who has three big projects that I've worked on from the past three years. I'd love to show them off in the form of a maker portfolio. I reached out to all of the colleges I'm applying to, and most of them said they'd accept one in the form of a pdf. Now, I've seen some examples, like the ones that Tufts posted ([https://admissions.tufts.edu/apply/first-year-students/school-of-engineering/](https://admissions.tufts.edu/apply/first-year-students/school-of-engineering/)). My question is, what software should I use to create a pdf similar looking to the ones that Tufts posted as an example? I've been looking online for a while now and couldn't find any concrete answers, even from this sub itself. I've seen some mentions of slideroom, but most of the colleges I'm applying to don't have connections to it so it wouldn't be wise to rely on it.",
