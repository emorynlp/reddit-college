  "text": "4 years of working my ass off + 3 years of also working my ass off even though grades didn't even count then. 1 mentally damaging admissions cycle. 1 pandemic. 0 personality. \n\nI'm graduating in a couple months, and for the first time in my life I won't be freaking out about grades. So how do I plan to celebrate this?\n\nBy filling my brain with the most mindless FILTH I can find. A work of literature so absurd even my gifted-honors-kid-burnout self can't find a single rhetorical device in there nor will I feel tempted to try. A work to make Dickens weep. A work to make me FEEL something after the whole college admissions process, whether it be disgust, shock, confusion, pity for Robert Pattinson, or the desire to define myself by who I ship a YA character with. \n\nThat's right. I'm reading the entire Twilight series this summer like I'm a socially awkward middle schooler who can't play sports to save my life. Join me, hate me, laugh at me. It's MY pandemic post-graduation hot girl summer and I will rip apart every word Stephanie Meyer has ever written until my mind heals from the past seven years. See you on the other side.",

Fruits Basket on Hulu, The Dragon Prince on Netflix (same writers from Avatar: The Last Airbender), also Alice in Borderland on Netflix is really good but also dark at times hehe.
