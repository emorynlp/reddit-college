  "text": "Hey there guys! I need help deciding my future with college and maybe y\u2019all can help me lol!\n(I am a black senior male in high school)\n\nStarting out freshman year I had a 0.66 gpa (not joking). I was a complete mess\ud83d\ude02.I fought with teachers, didn\u2019t care  about school at all,played Fortnite like every day and also watching Netflix like 24/7.   Basically I got  a reality check from my parents which caused me to change my view on education. I ended up having an extreme upward trend in terms of my gpa. (2.6 gpa sophomore year, 3.67 junior year and as of right now in my senior year first semester I have a 3.86! To be honest, I was just lazy and never cared about education and once I started to put effort I succeeded highly. \n\nNow it\u2019s senior year!!! Time flew very fast! My gpa is a 2.71 with no test scores but I\u2019ve taken 4 ib classes. I\u2019ve applied to some schools like university of oregon, arizona state, oregon state, University of Portland and Portland state so far. I haven\u2019t even heard a response from any of them yet but I also might just saying fuck all this and just go to community college! Yea I might miss the \u201cCollege experience\u201d but that\u2019s temporary lol. I\u2019m planning on majoring in nursing and knowing nursing is a pretty hard major, I think it would be much better starting 2 years cc then going to a UC. \n\n\nWhat do you guys think?\nAny help is appreciated!",

As for whether or not you should do CC, you should check what the requirements are for transfer at the UC you want to attend, since some schools do it based on how many years you've been at another institution and others do it by how many credits. If it's credits, just check if you think you will have completed all those classes within the appropriate time.",
