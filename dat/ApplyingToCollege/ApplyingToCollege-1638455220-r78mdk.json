  "text": "I want to study CS+statistics further at college.\n\nBut I quit my high school due to rape(of course I was a victim), and my country doesn't tolerate women to study more than high school-- which means studying abroad is my only option.\n\nI got college-ready GED scores and 1400ish Sat scores. And I have pretty decent ECs! Are there any countries that are generous for GED students?\n\n+ I also apply to a bunch of LACs and colleges in the US. The reason why that I ask of European universities is I just want to get away from this freaking Asian misogynist culture. (for me and pretty many Asian countries, most of the rape&killing woman criminals are sentenced for no punishment because it\u2019s his first crime... But hello?? The murdered women lost their life???)",
