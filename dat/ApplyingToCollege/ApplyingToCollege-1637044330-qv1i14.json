Saying \" I can't wait to grow up so I don't have to wake up early for school anymore\". In the reality, as we grow up, we start to see the real world. The pressure is on our shoulders to succeed. I already had goals and planned out my life for myself and saw being an adult as better than being a kid. At the same time, I hate seeing people like family members go on a new chapter in life. It sucks seeing my grandmother pass away but I know she is safe and probably dancing to Elvis music lol. Part of me will always cherish my childhood and friends, teachers I had throughout my life. I will never forget it. I honestly wish I could go back and relive my childhood. Mostly my teens years too. I never experienced an average teen life, most of my teen years were depressing and lonely. Now I see that becoming an adult will lead to a new chapter in my life and I know things will get better.",

However, with college, there's time to experience things that will bring u joy and find that this new chapter will also bring beautiful experiences and memories!! <33 Everything's gonna be oki and things do get better as u stated !! <33",
