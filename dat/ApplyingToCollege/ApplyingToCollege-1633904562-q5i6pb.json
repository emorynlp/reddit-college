  "text": "I have a question, and I\u2019m having a hard time finding an answer just through google.\nFirst off, my high school gpa is abysmal. I (20f) graduated high school with a 1.7 gpa. I struggled a lot in high school, between frequently relocating and dealing with a number of unmedicated mental illnesses, getting my work (particularly homework) done was a struggle. However, when I did complete my work I always marked high, and had exceptional test grades, but not turning in my daily work killed it for me. \n\nI am now looking to continue my education, as I\u2019m in a much more stable place mentally and in life. I know if I were to apply directly to a university, my application would be the laughing stock of the admissions office. For that reason I\u2019ve chosen a local community college to pursue my two year associates degree. \n\nMy question is, if I were to achieve and maintain a high gpa, which I know I\u2019m more than capable of, would it be possible for me to be accepted into and attend a reputable university? My ultimate goal is a PhD, and the school I\u2019ve always wanted to attend is extremely hard to get into, with an 8% acceptance rate. I worry it won\u2019t be possible with my high school gpa.",

      "text": "Once you have a college GPA (after approximately 30 credits or so), most colleges won\u2019t care about your high school GPA.\n\nBut before you start taking a bunch of classes at CC, you should talk to a few (not just one!) 4-year colleges that you may want to transfer to. Ask them how and which classes at the CC will transfer to your intended major at the 4-year college. And the advice can\u2019t be just \u201ctake chemistry.\u201d It has to be something like, \u201cTake CHE 171 at the CC and that will count as CHE 150 at University X.\u201d",
