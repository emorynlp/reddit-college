  "text": "I\u2019ve taken the SAT and did not do as well as I hoped, but I have no more fee waivers. So, I want to take the ACT (because I have a fee waiver), but the dates are all in December. I want to apply REA to an Ivy, but i\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s better to go test optional now or wait until December and try my luck with RD + ACT.",
