  "text": "I decided today that I\u2019ll be going to my state school (bad) over Harvard (good) and here\u2019s why:\n\n- At state school I\u2019ll get to feel superior over my fucking useless classmates\n\n- I\u2019ll get to tell everybody there that I\u2019m in the honors college \n\n- The merit scholarships are great! I get to take away a scholarship away from a poor kid!\n\n- It\u2019s a bigger community, more people for me to tell about my Harvard interview\n\n- I didn\u2019t get into Harvard",
