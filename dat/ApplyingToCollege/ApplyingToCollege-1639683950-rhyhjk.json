  "text": "Sorry if this doesn\u2019t belong here, but I\u2019ve been paying off my financial aid for a few years now. My confusion is this: I was using the Post 9-11 GI bill, so all of my tuition should have been covered. I was attending a state school (SDSU) and I believe I was considered a resident. Is there somewhere that I can go and ask about previously awarded financial aid from years ago?",
