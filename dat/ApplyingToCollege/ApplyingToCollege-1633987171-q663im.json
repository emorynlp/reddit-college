  "title:": "Questions about submitting self-reporting AP scores in Common App",
  "text": "I have 2 questions about self-reporting AP scores in Common App.\n\n1. Should I self-report AP scores of 3? I know the general rule is to submit 4s and 5s and not to submit 1s and 2s, but what about 3s? If it helps, I got 3 scores of 3, which were in World History (9th grade), Seminar (9th grade), and Research (10th grade), and I'm applying as an econ + CS/Data science major.\n\n\n\n2. Is it a big deal if I say that I plan to take an AP exam, but then I don't? I'm not sure whether I'll take the exams for 2 of my APs this year. I probably will end up taking them, so I'll list them as exams I'm planning to take, but is it a big deal if I decide not to later?",

You\u2019re not committing to actually taking them, you\u2019re just saying that\u2019s what you plan to do as of right now (so you have wiggle room to change your mind).",

If you self-report a score in Common App, doesn't it go to all the schools you apply to meaning you can't pick and choose?\n\nRegarding #2, thanks! I'll list that I'm planning to take all my exams then, which is probably what I'll end up doing anyway.",

              "text": "You can edit your common app between submissions. If you want some schools to see your 3s and not others, you can just add the 3s before you submit some apps and remove the 3s before you submit others. Just be very careful about checking whether there are any 3s on your application before each submission!",
