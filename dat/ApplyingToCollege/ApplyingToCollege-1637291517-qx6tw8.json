  "text": "I feel like I was to hasty in committing to a school. I thought this was my number one, and I got a great merit scholarship. However, I just got accepted into another school that also gave me great aid and I am starting to feel doubt. The second school is not as prestigious but its located somewhere that I have always seen myself living and would also be happy. I feel confident in my decision yet sad for the experience that I know I have lost. Im moving across the world, so there are obviously gonna be changes, but will I be happy there like I would be at this other school? I guess its too late to know now :(",
