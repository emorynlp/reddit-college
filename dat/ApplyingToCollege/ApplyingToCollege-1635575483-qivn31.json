  "title:": "Question about Umiami TOEFL scores",
  "text": "Hey everyone, \n\nI just applied to the University of Miami EA and in the admissions portal it says that I still have to submit TOEFL scores, though I did self-report them in Common App. Does that mean that I have to send the scores to them officially or how does that work? (International Student btw)\n\nThanks for your help :)",

      "text": "Hey! You will have to submit official scores. They don't consider self submitted ones. However I know they can waive this requirement if you have an A in an AP English class or more than 660 on the SAT Reading and Writing section. Maybe for some other reasons too, but I am not sure, you should check their website.\nAlso  I applied EA to University of Miami too. How long did it take for you to receive the login information for the applicant portal? I sent my application 2 days ago and I am still waiting.",

What current high school students may be unaware of is the history, that official reports were required prior to admission by virtually all schools, for decades, until just a few years ago.\n\nIn other words, official reports are the default requirement unless the school explicitly says that they accept self-reported scores.",
