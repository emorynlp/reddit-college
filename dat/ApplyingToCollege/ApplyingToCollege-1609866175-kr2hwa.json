  "text": "I get it, but the fact that people post stuff on here talking about how they knowingly let people manipulate them and destroy their mental health for absolutely nothing makes me so mad for y\u2019all. \n\nIf you\u2019re posting, you recognize what you\u2019re doing is wrong. Please just cut them off instead of posting.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be like the 2nd part of the A2C cycle complaining about a new trend of posts but this stuff is actually harmful behavior and y\u2019all need to stand up for yourselves.\n\nEDIT: To clarify, I don\u2019t mean to victim blame and I apologize for sounding rude. You\u2019re all worth so much more than you think. Standing up for yourself is more than just a matter of maintaining your integrity/academic success, it\u2019s a matter of self respect. Y\u2019all got to start appreciating yourselves for who you are and that means not doing things that destroy your mental health like allowing yourself to be manipulated.",

Chances are, if you haven't before, you're going to start working, calling your own doctor, paying your own fees, learning how to do things your self without being able to go to your parents for you. You're going to have to make good decisions. You're going to have to learn how to make sure people don't walk all over you, *because they will.* That one post about that guy who was about to withdraw the op's application to a T20 so he could have a better chance getting in and still had the audacity to call them crying to edit their essay? Tell him to go fuck himself. People are already willing to screw others over for their own benefit, and that's just something we need to learn to navigate for our own betterment. This is *not* me saying be a jerk to every one around you. God no, please the world would be better if everyone were a bit kinder. But like, sheltered or not, that's exactly why the post is saying what it is, we need to learn to be better and make better decisions for ourselves, because you'll have to sooner or later.

I want these people to win in the end, however, they leave the situation being worse off WHILE still aware that they could've changed things for the better. You know your friend is bad, so dump them, man. Dump your boyfriend. Find solace in the people who care about you, not those who make you suffer. I mean, at a certain point, a person can't be your friend anymore when they're sabotaging you so much. If anything, they're your enemy pretending to be your friend. Kinda reminds me of \"keep your friends close and your enemies closer.\"",

People like that are never sorry, they're scared the consequences of their actions might negatively affect them. The girl whose boyfriend made her write his essays? I know people like him are abusive and manipulative, but *please* get help. Literally chances are if he gets in, he'll leave, and if he doesn't, he'll blame her.

Once my grades became under control the actual act ceased but I still am paying the price for the experience 6 years later. \n\nOf course I realize that many have had worse experiences and many milder but the core of it is often similar.

If that\u2019s the case, they should be dealing with their mental health issues first (if it\u2019s that\u2019s bad), not applying to a whole bunch colleges. \n\n(I don\u2019t want to sound cruel. I suffer with depression too, but I\u2019m at a point where I can cope with it well. I did my applications on my own.)",
