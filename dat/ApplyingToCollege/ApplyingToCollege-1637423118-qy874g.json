  "text": "personally i think it went great. we were supposed to only talk for 45 minutes and we ended up talking for 65 minutes. he said i was very qualified and we discussed my academic and social life. he also gave me some fun stories he experienced at Harvard which was really nice and we were able to connect with our families. surprisingly, i really wasn\u2019t nervous at all which i think helped me a lot. it was honestly like having a convo with an old friend although the old friend was decades older than me:)",
