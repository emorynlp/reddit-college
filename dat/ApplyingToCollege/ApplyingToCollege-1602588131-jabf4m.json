If you manage to do this, you'll have less problems waking up early. Use that time to exercise and freshen yourself up. That way you're not starting the day directly into Zoom school\n(Or whatever you're using) and will have more motivation. After that it's all about avoiding distractions and maximizing break-efficiency, which is what I like to call squeezing in extra work or assignments in between classes or even in classes.\n\nAlso, take schoolwork breaks to focus ONLY in whatever you're passionate about. That shit restores your energy and motivation like crazy. \n\nHope that helped :)",
