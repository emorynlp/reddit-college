      "text": "It won't. I've read 3-4 cases like this from a Stanford AO and they very explicitly said the authority of your LOR doesn't matter. It should just be about yourself. A person I read about got a student who submitted a LOR from Ryan Reynolds and was deemed as very unimpressive. \n\nIf Joe Byron knows you well and can very clearly outline your achievements and character as a student, then feel free! But if you're asking him BECAUSE he's Joe Byron, you're making the wrong move. All the best!",
