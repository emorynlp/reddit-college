You can even mention some made-up bullshit about having trouble with your email lately, so it gives the vibe that hey, maybe the school sent you an email and you just didn't get it. \n\nThey'll check their records, attempt to contact the interviewer, realise what has happened, and sort things out for you. You don't have to be the bearer of bad news or look insensitive to the issue. They get to be informed of what's happened and hopefully sort out any other candidates that person was supposed to interview. Everyone saves face. ",

It's not like they would have posted a cancelation of your interview somewhere that would be indexed by Google, so there's absolutely no way you can explain you Googling their name without seeming a bit obsessive about this person. \n\nI mean, we all stalk people on Facebook, but it's taboo to *admit* to it or to admit to knowledge that could only be gained through Facebook stalking. You don't go and ask your crush about something you Facebook-stalked about them. \n\nIt's basic decorum that if the source of your information is super dodgy, you must either find a plausible and socially acceptable excuse for having that information, or you need to pretend you don't have the information at all.",

You don't know their sister or any of their friends, and you never would have found out about that wedding except by stalking this person. You had to go to considerable effort to find those photos, and cannot reasonably explain it away as you \"just stumbling\" on it. They're just too far off the beaten path, and no one wants to stick around and hear a weirdo give their excuses. \n\nWhen you meet them, do you go up to them and immediately strike up conversation around their sister's wedding? Do you comment on the flower arrangement? \n\nThat's what it's like if you bring up a funeral that you really have no reason to know about. You can't just say \"oh I googled them and found out online\". It's very personal information that is not meant to be significant to anyone other than family and friends. Just because it's posted publicly doesn't mean it's posted *for* the public, and it definitely doesn't mean that you get free pass to bring it into conversation without being introduced into it. ",

Googling your interviewer is discouraged but a fact most people would tacitly encourage. For a casual conversation, there's no reason I would talk about their sister's wedding unless it was brought up. For the interview, I would ask about an interviewer's job experience.\n\n\n2) Facebook stalking is different from seeing pictures in your feed. Seeing events of friends/ friends of friends is the whole point of Facebook.\n\n\n3) You can definitely say you found it online because the thought process makes sense. \"I arrived at the interview, there was no show, so I googled them up in case I could find more information, and found out that they passed away\". \n\n\n4) It's true that things posted publicly aren't posted for the public, but obituaries are posted for the public.\n\n\n5) This isn't a conversation: it's a request for help from paid professions sent through email.\n",

Having only just attended a funeral for a close family member myself, I can tell you that funerals almost always happen within 7 days of the person dying, and usually sooner, so this dude died very recently. The only reason the university would know is because (a) his death was a massive event that made the TV news and the front pages of the newspapers, (b) members of admissions staff were incredibly close friends of his and were invited to the funeral themselves, or (c) his family notified them. It should be noted that (c) is so incredibly unlikely that you can immediately scrap that from the list of reasonable possibilities. OP didn't watch the news of this guy's death on TV, so that's only going to leave (b), and that option is also incredibly unlikely. In all likelihood, admissions does not know that he has died or has only very recently found out if they *do* know.\n\nSo when you throw shade on the university for not rescheduling, I need you to understand exceptionally well who it is that you're actually throwing shade on: **his grieving family**. \n\nMost interviewers are reasonably young alumni, so this death was probably unexpected and sudden. You're not going to get many geriatric interviewers. He probably has older parents who are now grappling with the loss of their child and who, in all likelihood, have no idea he was taking interviews or are otherwise consumed by their overwhelming grief right now. There's a lot to organise when someone dies, especially when it's sudden, and it's too soon for the family to be expected to deal with trivial, meaningless shit like a bunch of shallow, ungrateful HS seniors who only care about how this all affects *them*. \n\nWhen someone dies, the family and close friends have total claim over attention and sympathy. OP has no claim. If they *dared* to express even a sliver of the thought you laid out, that'd probably be grounds for immediate rejection because it is just such an unbelievably shallow thing to believe. OP needs to tread very lightly, otherwise they'll cause exceptional offence, and then they would have been better off submitting an essay where they praised the KKK.",
