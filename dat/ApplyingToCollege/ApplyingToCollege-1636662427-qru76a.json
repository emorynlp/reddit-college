  "text": "Is teacher evaluation and a letter of recommendation the same thing orrrrr??? Because why do some schools on common app be like \"counselor recommendation required\" and also say \"teacher evaluation: 0 required, 1 optional\" then have their max letter of recs on Naviance be 1 \ud83d\udc80. Like what if I wanted to ask a teacher AND my counselor?? Am I just dumb or is their a way around this? HELP",
