  "text": "*this may seem naive and ignorant, so bear with me*\n\nToday I saw 3 kids I know get into Duke, UPenn, and Princeton. I\u2019m super proud of them and they are super deserving of it, but that\u2019s not where my problem is. Seeing them get into these prestigious colleges just makes me think the one I got into is insignificant (UVA). I question myself saying \u201ccould I have done better?\u201d and \u201cDid I limit myself?\u201d. I know I\u2019m not qualified for those t10 schools, but it just makes me think. Thank you for listening to my rant, and please don\u2019t take this as egocentric or naive. I don\u2019t mean to come off that way",

I have the same sort of thought, I definitely could have shot higher but I liked Miami University and that\u2019s where I\u2019ll go. Either way, you will end up having opportunities, these big colleges have resources and your experience at college will be different from your friends\u2019. You will still find your group of friends, the major that fits with you and all that. Don\u2019t think bad of yourself, what ever school you go to will work out",

You\u2019re being appreciated as much as you appreciate the school and that\u2019s all we can really ask for as admits at the end of the day!

It\u2019s about how you make the most of the opportunities given to you there. It\u2019s natural to wonder given the nature of those around you (especially the person who got into Duke. He seems like a stud), but know that UVA is not an insignificant school by any means, and you are just as fortunate as them to go to such a great school. Please do me a favor and stop thinking those thoughts cuz all it\u2019s gonna do it make you less proud of yourself and drive you crazy. PS, I guarantee that if these kids didn\u2019t make it into these schools, at least one of them would\u2019ve gone to UVA :)",
