After a year he finally let me change it to Computer Science.\n\nBut now that I\u2019m transferring, I really want to double major in Animation or Sequential Art and in Game Design or Game Programming.\n\nI\u2019m applying to other schools for computer science but I want really to go to art school and have a couple of art schools on my list. \n\nI already added SCAD to my list.",

I love the support they have for HOH and deaf students.\n\nAgain this is a case of me not scrolling further down past Computer Science. I used to have a giant list of colleges and I would just check to see if they had Cs and their transfer requirements and then add it to my list. \n\nRn I\u2019m overhauling my entire list. I\u2019ll add RIT to the Game/Animation side of my excel workbook!",

      "text": "Champlain College would be a great school for you to look into. They have AMAZING game design programs; it's a small school in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, and it's strangely geared towards game design and animation. (Not necessary geared toward it, but for a school of its size, it's pretty unique.)\n\nGreat location with so many outdoor activities to do nearby. Burlington is a perfect mid-size college town, with UVM super close. Beautiful campus and friendly students.\n\n[https://www.champlain.edu/academics/undergraduate-academics/majors-and-programs/game-design](https://www.champlain.edu/academics/undergraduate-academics/majors-and-programs/game-design)\n\n[https://gamestudio.champlain.edu/](https://gamestudio.champlain.edu/)",
