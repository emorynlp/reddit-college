Bitter as hell so I get it with caramel macchiato or caffe mocha. \n\nAnything less I just get a Red Bull. I had a big addiction to it in freshman year and then realized it stopped having any impact on me, so I took a break from it and my body responds to it normally again. \n\nI feel basic as hell now with my caffeine intake preferences.",
