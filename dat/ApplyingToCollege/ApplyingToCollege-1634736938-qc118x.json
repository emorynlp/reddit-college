  "text": "This might just sound lame but can baking as a hobby qualify as an EC? Never started a club or anything but I sold cookies to my neighbours, family friends and among my family members. No prizes of any sort, no certification, no written proof I can show to my College Counselor either. Can I write about that in my EC lol",

              "text": "I mean, my best bet would be to write about something already mentioned in the application only under the circumstance that I am creative enough to repackage the same thing as something more appealing or it has had major life impact on me. However, I do understand that my creative flow can be different than yours which is why I would suggest going with what you think is right. Think that you could create a draft for a baking essay & see if it's better than the one you've chosen? Go for it. Think that the current essay is the best you could do? Absolutely, go for it. However, might be worth to show the AOs that you have a broad range of interests? If the STEM major is something like engineering, baking can show how constructive you are. See? There's so much you can do with it. Best of luck :D",

I'm already a business owner (stickers,apparel, phone cases, bags, all graphic designs I sell on products for charity) and a web developer (full stack, applying for a CS major anyway) but I'm not ~actually~ confident enough to really sell my baked goods. I'd do it if it wasn't for a shortage of time and limited resources but for now I don't know how to package it + get any reviews on my \"business\" lol. Thanks for your response!",
