  "text": "Hi guys! I\u2019ve applied to several colleges already and I\u2019ve received acceptance letters from most of them but my question is if I can accept some of those acceptance offers so I can have more time do decided on which college I want to attend? \nI\u2019m still trying to figure out which college I want to go to and I want to have more time to decide, but I\u2019m afraid colleges might pull out their decisions regarding my admittance to the college :/ \n\nI would really appreciate the help and thank you friends!",

      "text": "College acceptances should have a date by which you need to reply, and those are almost universally May 1.\n\nYou certainly \"can\" accept them, but that requires a financial deposit that you will lose if you decide not to attend.  There's almost never a reason to do this. If ever.\n\nAny of the reasons that would cause them to rescind an offer, which are few and severe, won't change because you're accepted their offer",
