  "title:": "Is an International Studies (IS) degree worth it?",
  "text": "Hello! I am a graduating student applying for colleges and I\u2019m thinking of taking up International Studies Major in Japanese Studies/Chinese Studies/Southeast Asian Studies (not sure which one yet)\n\nI am passionate about history and culture, as well as the political and social affairs between nations. More importantly, I have made it a goal to not stick around in one place for long periods of time and be able to speak in at least 4-5 languages in my lifetime. I think that IS is the perfect degree programme for me, but I have researched intensively about it and I keep seeing people online say that it\u2019s not a very useful degree. Needless to say, it has been making me anxious for the past weeks.\n\nI know what I want to do in the future, but I just want to know if I\u2019m shooting myself in the foot with a restrictive degree or is it not as bad/useless as other people make it out to be? I think I also have to mention that I want to become a language teacher abroad (ESL) but I still have quite a bit of time to weigh my options.\n\nAny insights are appreciated. Thank you so much!\n\nTL;DR: I\u2019m thinking of taking up an International Studies (IS) degree and I keep seeing people online say that it\u2019s useless. Any testimonials? :(",

      "text": "Hmm...\n\nI actually have a pretty good background for this question, since I've taught English abroad--and am still doing that essentially--while also having briefly worked in a career field that IA is tailor-made for.\n\nIA/Area Studies tends to be good if you want to work for the State Department or related agencies or businesses. But on top of that, the one thing that will impress the most is language skills. It's not beyond the abilities of most college-educated Americans, with some reading, to discuss relations between Mongolia and North Korea; very few, however, would be able to read Mongolian and North Korean press and talk to diplomats from Mongolia or North Korea in their own language about those issues.\n\nFor teaching English, study English. Not TESOL. Maybe pick-up a certification if your school offers it, but study a full-fledged English major. TESOL is like the lowest-bar certification that backpackers will pick up to teach abroad. If you want to teach at good schools with good colleagues who have studied English Literature at the premiere university in their country, you'll want to come across as someone who knows the ins and outs of English literature--someone who can talk about Modernism and Romanticism to the advanced classes. Very often at good international schools, the beginners will be learning with local teachers who can teach them English grammar and explain the differences between English and Korean, for example, and the higher level students will learn with the Native English teacher.   \nNow, on top of studying English, there is that aforementioned thing that will help immeasurably: study the local language of where you want to go. Because, it's quite possible that he majority of teachers at your foreign school will not speak English or not speak it well. By knowing the language, you are much more attractive to the administrators hiring you and you will be accepted by your colleagues. You won't be the weird foreigner who's a pain to make conversation with at lunch.\n\nFrom my experience, what work best in these fields are (in this order): \n\n1. Local language. Good for IA-type jobs and for teaching. Learning a foreign language will also help you understand how English works, so you can teach English. \n\n2. English Lit. Separates you from the backpackers who want to teach. You will be qualified to teach at the best schools abroad. \n\n3. IA. Good for State Dept. type jobs, but even with those being great with foreign languages is as much of an asset as an IA degree, because language skills are valuable. (Caveat: If you work for the State Dept, the State Dept will train you in the language where they are sending you--so you may have studied Korean and then be sent to Egypt. But... being fluent in a difficult language shows that you can learn foreign languages well and that you won't be hopeless when they want to send you to Hungary. So having mastered a tough language--through a major in that language or through IA/Area Studies--is very attractive.)",

          "text": "Thank you so much! After further research I found out that International Studies is indeed not a suitable degree for me as I really envision myself to be a multilingual language teacher. I think I will be applying instead for an English Language degree and then get foreign language electives. Thank you again for your advice!",

      "text": "As I'm sure you can understand, your question is an *incredibly* broad one, and one without a single correct answer\n\nI'd check out this video on studying IA/IR/IS [https://youtu.be/Cht6Prkee-U](https://youtu.be/Cht6Prkee-U) for general stats on earnings and employability \n\nWith that said, from my personal experience studying IA at one of the top IA schools in the US, you should know going in that an IA degree generally doesn't come with too many hard skills, and that if you want to do anything of note in the field, you'll need to network and intern throughout college (or just be OK with not making any significant amount of money) \n\nIA is also a very academic and prestige driven field, and I'd keep in mind that connections *really matter*. Don't take out tens of thousands in loans to go to a random IA program where professors and alumni aren't tapped into the field, *especially* if your goal is to become an ESL teacher. You don't need an IA degree for that.",
