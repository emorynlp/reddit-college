  "text": "Hi, so I\u2019m an international student, and I just got an email from my AO asking me for a second interview. I\u2019m terrified of the meaning of this. Apparently, it could mean that the admissions office has compelling reasons to accept me, but they need more. Has this happened to anyone else before? What else could it mean? What advice could you give me?",
