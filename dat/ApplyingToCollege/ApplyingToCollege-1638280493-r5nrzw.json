      "text": "This sounds great--obv each art school has its own flavor of artist statement. The only elements I might tweak: \n\n1. In para 4-5 perhaps mention what you will bring to USC specifically.\n2. USC's artist statement info doesn't mention this specifically, but you might want to reference pieces in your portfolio (para 3, but only if it fits your narrative about how you got where you are).\n\nBreak a leg, artist!",

That gives me an idea of what they might be looking for.",
