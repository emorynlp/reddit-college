  "text": "Basically the title. It\u2019s common knowledge in my school that our first ranked student is a major cheater. It seems as if she has a lot of luck because (1) she plagiarized her whole English paper, got caught by the teacher, but never got in trouble (weird cause usually when you plagiarize, teachers say they\u2019ll put it on your transcript). (2) For all her AP classes, she cheated on tests and quizzes through the papers given to her by her upperclassman friends and when students report her, the teachers are all like \u201c____ is a good student. She would never cheat.\u201d \nIt puts things into perspective about success, school, and cheating\ud83d\ude43",

Theoretically this is supposed to turn out better students but especially in my  year (c/o 2020) I've noticed that this turns out higher volumes of cheaters because of the emphasis on getting an A. I feel the root of the problem is not the idea that school is easy, but that getting an A is easy (which is absolutely NOT the case in college), and that the whole idea of the grading system needs an overhaul.\n\nEither that or the college application process needs an overhaul. There are quite a few gripes I have with that as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso pardon my writing skills, they're pretty bad.",

Be prepared to present your ideas to people from varying backgrounds. If you were writing to someone with a PhD in your field (i.e. your professor), your writing should be different compared to your writing for some random college student.\n\n* Have a game plan. Write an outline before you begin your actual paper. Get the ideas out before you start writing to ensure that everything is organized.\n\n* Follow the instructions. Know the difference between analyzing something and summarizing something. Answer all the questions in the prompt.\n\n* Be concise. Do not fill your pages just to meet a word count. Write enough to get your point across, then move on. Professors have limited time to devote to your paper, so don't needlessly drag things out for them. Vary your sentence structure to keep things a little interesting.\n\n* Know how to properly cite credible sources in a research paper. Failing to do this correctly constitutes plagiarism.\n\n* Finally, don't forget the basics of spelling and grammar... I know this sounds silly, but I'm not kidding when I say that your writing will be taken orders of magnitudes less seriously if it contains errors that should have been corrected in elementary/middle school.",

Eventually the level of detail is sufficient to write it out as English. It overcame my problem of over-obsessing over the prose so much that I ran out of time before I got most of the ideas down. Get the content and organization, and *then* start obsessing over the prose. ;)",

          "text": "SOMETIMES??? It's dysfunctional and completely misguided. The 4.0 scale. An A. They have so much value, however they're simply meaningless. \n\nWhat can you surely determine about a student from an A? They turned something in. They showed up. Nothing else. It's the tip of the iceberg. Underneath the surface, it could be actual hard work and aptitude. Or plagiarism, cheating, pandering, and the bare minimum.\n\nI believe the purpose of an education is to teach students. For students TO LEARN. But what is most important at the end of the day? The A. And how does the standard system determine this highly valued grade? It's not based on learning. How many teachers care if you improved? They all probably do, but does this reflect in grading practices? Rarely. Grading practices typically request/coerce you to write the correct answer, not your honest effort. Thus many students result to cheating, slader, etc.\n\nHere comes my manifesto.\n\nThis is no perfect form of assessment.\n\nHomework (Accuracy Graded) - Often rushed, copied, forgotten busy work\nHomework (Participation Graded) - Often low effort, unintelligible, copied, busy work, easy-As\n\nTests/Exams (MC) - easily cheated, common sense/deduction based\nTests/Exams (Written) - Highly biased/subjective\n\nI personally like tests, but think they're easily gamed (I don't cheat, but it infuriates me how common and expected it is). And I personally cannot conceive of a better and efficient form of assessment.\n\nHomework on the other hand is terrible assessment. It should only be free response, and only positively affect grade (extra credit, optional weight) to represent hard work and effort. Homework is practice for the test and is represented in the test score. \n\nShould a student perform poorly in tests, they should be able to cushion/raise their grade by doing hard work (not rote, but actual learning).\n\nShould a student perform well on a test, no homework/busy work is needed. That student has 'proved' they understand the subject and can use their busy time not on that homework.\n\nI strongly believe this would be a strong step forward for education. When I was in high school, getting misrepresented and mistreated by traditional values (common theme in this world), I managed to compromise with many teachers this way, saving me at least 0.5 on my GPA. When I took these issues up with my school board, I was met with an immutable force. The presentation was much more eloquent than this comment, but still, their minds were closed. Their argument was that it was bad because it was change (there is a much better argument such that it can cause social division between students who do the homework vs not, but that division comes in a much worse form called honors vs normal classes)\n\nI have to rant about this at least once a month, so if you made it thus far, thank you for listening, and tell me what you think.",

Like when I dont let her cheat of me she pisses me off, and she uses the sympathy card to fuck with everyone like she didn't wanna wake up early so she got her TOK presentation time switched from 8:30 Am to 1:45 Pm and she stays right next to the school. Whilst, I had to come at 8:30  in the mornings and I stay like 50 minutes away from school. And the best thing is that she said that I was fine with it, \" like WTF??\". Then i ask her to change it so says no, 3 weeks later she's like \" Please hote for me for student body president!\" And I'm like no way you'll win and shit. So she goes fu king ballistic like crazy and tells the principle I'm anti campaigning and shit against her, so she can get sympathy votes WTF is wrong with her( She lost), but best of all I wasn't even standing for president. She is so fucking fake and I hear shit from my mom once a week \" Look at her, she is a good example be her friend\". Oll tucking laugh when she fails college, dumb b*tch",

The whole things was like a smaller and more stupid version of Watergate. Basically, they had set up a group chat on Snapchat where they shared answers and pics of tests. They brought in anyone who found out and intimidated those who wanted out. The whole thing got blown when then #2 (basically the only person who gets good grades and does all their work) found out about it, got suepr salty, and told administration. Everyone involved who was in the top 10 at the time was banned from being in the top 10 from that point on.\n\nIt's actually surprising that was the only big cheating thing that was uncovered. Almost everyone at my school cheats. It's mostly by sharing homework and test answers through group chats and finding completed worksheets online. I had a lot of bad shit happen in my personal life softmore and junior year and this really saved my ass academically, but looking back I really wish I had just done the work. If not for the pleasure of knowing I have integrity, at least so I could understand what the hell pre-cal was supposed to teach me.",

Everything from casual cheating like asking a class that's taken it, to asking previous classes what AP exam year the frq was from, to paying someone who took the test to go through a test bank found online and circle all the questions that were on the test. \n\nThe fact that my school has 3500 people in 3 grades and that teachers rarely write their own tests really makes it easy for most people to get away with blatant cheating. It's now the expectation among peers that you cheat because getting ranked is seen as a requirement, but it leaves the honest kids out to dry.",

      "text": "America the land on the free, the home of the brave... Scratch that it should be America the land of shootings, the home of the bullies.\n\nThe education system does suck, school is a power game compaired to knowledge. Kids be getting full blown scholarships for catching a fuckin ball but kids be out here being fuckin geniuses but dropping school or giving up on it because of bullying or neglected for help in anything. Literally even if the kid is good, gets along with classmates, is the genius poor kid, and makes it to the end of public school still can they only rely on financial aid to boost them up just a bit if at all. The schooling system is unfair, broken, and corrupt all the loopholes and under crosses in the system have been discovered and are used by those knowledgeable so they always get a unfair advantage. We need a new system with new rules that treats everyone as equally as possible. If the kid that gets a full blown scholarship for catching a ball doesn't have average grades then they dont deserve shit. If some kid seems to be doing to well, be suspicious, test them a bit differently on random and see if they really are that amazing or a cheater. Last for now would be get better school staff cause money buys everything or at least a bit of everything.",

      "text": "I'm a cheater. Honestly, it takes alot of effort. Literally everyone I've met has said that they'd rather have me help them than report me. Most schools don't really bother to deal with such stuff simply because it is a lot of effort. Not to mention, having a high performing student be outed as a cheater reflects really badly for the school.\n\nIf you're a low performing student, chances are your teachers will try to get rid of you. Got caught for talking during an exam? A low performing student will be likely be either suspended or expelled, afterall your going away will make the school's record better.\n\nFunny story- Even after cheating, I finished my paper just the same time as the class topper and even scored literally the same number. \n\nI may never know is the topper was a cheater too or not. \n\nPro tip- cheating will take atleast 50 percent effort of the real thing. If it's taking less than that, you're taking too much risk already.",
