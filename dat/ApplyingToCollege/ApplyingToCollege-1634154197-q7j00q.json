  "text": "I\u2019m a senior and I\u2019m really worried about my calc grade. I have a 68 right now and i\u2019m planning on applying regular decision to a lot of places. I think the highest I could get it up to would be a C+ and a B- if i\u2019m really lucky. Idk what to exactly ask abt but I\u2019m wondering if anyone else has been in a similar position and how that worked out for them",

      "text": "If you choose to drop the course, you will have to email every single college you applied to and tell them that you dropped it (because your transcript will no longer be accurate), which I unfortunately learned the hard way when I dropped AP Physics. This is a hassle to deal with, so I don't recommend that unless you are actually going to fail the class.\n\nIDK what system your school goes on, but I sent my transcript before my first semester senior year ended, so the final grades weren't published and it only sent freshman-junior year grades. If that's the case, then it doesn't really matter what happens with your calc grade because the only grades/GPA colleges will see when they review your app are the ones from previous years. \n\nHonestly, if you're doing well in other classes, you don't really have to worry about your calc grade too much-- just try not to fail. At this point, the grades you've gotten consistently for 3 years will matter much more, as well as the essays and stuff. Your grades only matter so much, but someone with a stellar essay and average grades is much more likely to get into a top school than someone with a shit essay and stellar grades. You can try to raise your calc grade, but if it won't affect the GPA colleges see when you submit your app, then don't worry about it too much and potentially put everything else on your app at risk because you're too focused on calc.",

I still dont know about regular decision stuff bc i thought a mid year transcript was required?",

My mid-year transcript was sent out after my application was submitted since the semester ended after RD was due. Ask your counselor if you can see a copy of your transcript if you're still worried just so you know exactly what info is being sent, but doing poorly in one class in senior year is really not going to have a huge effect on your chances.",

You don't have to say why, you just tell them your transcript is no longer completely accurate because you dropped X class. \n\nIt also depends on your high school, because I dropped it after my school's deadline of when they allowed you to drop classes without it showing on your transcript. Ask your counselor if you have to email them; your school might not even have a policy where they show dropped classes on transcripts.",
