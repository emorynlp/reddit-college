      "text": "When we're interviewing, we aren't there to quiz you per se. We don't even get to see your app, we only know your areas of interest as you put on your Dartmouth app. So unless you tell us directly that you've got a lot of experience in a given area, we won't even know to ask questions about it. And even then, we aren't going to \"test\" you, we're just going to ask you to share a little more so we can tell if you're actually about something you claim interest and experience in. But the alum interview in general is really meant as an opportunity for you to speak to an alumnus/a/um if you haven't had that chance before. We give a small report to the admissions office, but we're really there to get to know you, not to test you :)",
