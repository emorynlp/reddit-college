  "text": "I don't know if anyone else is experiencing this but I applied to the same school as my best friends, and it's really stressing me out because I don't know how to react if one of us don't get into the school.  Like, if we all get in, YAY. If we don't all get in, fine we can be sad together. But if only one person gets in, or if only one didn't make it... that's real awkward man",

These are actions a school has determined and it has nothing to do with your friendships or even your worth. We all know the process can yield unexpected results. Think of it this way, whatever schools you get into, it\u2019ll be fun visiting each other and sharing experiences. Ultimately, see and react to it as if none of you had the same schools\u2026",
