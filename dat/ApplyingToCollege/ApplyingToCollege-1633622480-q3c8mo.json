  "title:": "I got accidentally accepted to UCDublin",
  "text": "I (F, 18) traveled to South Korea about a month ago and had to sit in quarantine for two weeks. During those two weeks, I was going crazy with nothing to do and decided that I should start looking for colleges to apply to for the spring term as I took off the fall semester. I applied to UCDublin as I had been to Ireland before and really wanted to go back, and was super shocked when they responded quickly. \n\nAfter about two weeks of chatting with an admissions counselor, asking about my grades and other questions related to academics, I was over the moon when I received an email stating that I had been accepted! I knew I wasn't the best of students but I had gone to a prestigious high school and assumed that because I had told the counselor I was traveling the world, it boosted my application. Even with the good news, I still was a little concerned because the 20% acceptance rate versus my GPA didn't really make sense. \n\nI brushed aside all my fears and posted my acceptance on my Instagram story, told my friends and family, and began looking at plane tickets for September 2022. The admissions counselor asked me to send my passport, diploma, transcripts, and the initial deposit of $1,235. I gave her everything and then didn't hear back for about five days.  And then I got an email claiming that the admissions team had made a mistake.\n\nMy counselor claimed that it was due to my GPA which she had previously claimed would be okay. I took all honors courses in high school and had a pretty good-looking weighted GPA but after review, UCDublin decided that my unweighted wasn't good enough. The counselor offered me a refund and to send my application to other schools but I quickly shot her down and told her to just give me back my money. \n\nI told my parents and they said I should have fought for my place and that I need to try and appeal the rejection. I didn't tell them that I had already asked for a refund and just kept telling them that I'm giving up. I don't want to give my time and money to a school that makes mistakes like this. \n\nAfter looking at some other Reddit posts of people who basically told the admissions officer \"That's your fault, I'm coming anyway, you need to figure it out\", I regretted demanding the refund so quickly but fear that if I had tried to do something like that, I would get shot down hard. \n\nI don't know if I'm asking for advice or what but I wanted to post this here before having to go through and tell my friends and family that it was a mistake :(",
