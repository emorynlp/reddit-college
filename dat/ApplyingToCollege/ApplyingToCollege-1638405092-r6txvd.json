  "title:": "I have two solid essay ideas, how do I know which one to choose?",
  "text": "So my UConn application was due today and being the procrastinator I am... I didn't start the personal statement until Monday. I actually really like the way it turned out, plus I'm planning on editing it further by peers and teachers for my later deadlines. \n\nBut along the way I thought of a possibly better essay. It's more positive, speaks to one specific experience instead of 3 chronological ones, and has a more positive and clear message. The thing is, I'd have to spend more effort on writing it when I could spend the time on writing supplements. Plus, I'm really happy with how my initial essay draft turned out.\n\nHow do I know which one to choose?",

Like you\u2019re trying too hard for it to be appropriate. Like you\u2019re writing it for the AO and not for yourself. \n\nTo me, the one to use is the one that speaks to you first.",

              "text": "So here\u2019s what I say: if everyone writes what they think the AO wants to read, it\u2019s more than likely off target anyway; how does anyone even know? Worse, now everyone\u2019s written a piece that\u2019s likely boring and expected. To stand out, one needs to make it his own. Don\u2019t be scared to be you.",
