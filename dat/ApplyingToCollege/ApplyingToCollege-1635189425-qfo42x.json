  "text": "So long story short I went into freshman year in the middle of a mental health crisis, flunked my first semester. I got on medication and I improved a lot second semester but lost my financial aid and dropped out. I\u2019m trying to apply to a more affordable school closer to home and they\u2019re allowing me to use my high school transcript (4.3 gpa) alongside my college transcript. My problem is my previous school won\u2019t release a transcript until I finish paying my balance (1500 left) and I can\u2019t pay that before the deadline to apply for school. Does anyone have any advice, ideas, workarounds etc? I\u2019m really dead set on being back in school next semester",
