  "text": "I'm sorry for the vague title, but this is the best way to describe what I'm asking.\n\nI've been poking around WPI's website, and it seems like it might be a great fit for me, academically. They've got a decent robotics major, which I don't find a lot (and trust me, I look), I am fascinated by some of their research and labs, among other things.\n\nBut apart from that, can anyone experienced lmk how their experience was? I would, of course, Google and read and things too.",

It's a useful comment, and many people often do not check basic things like Google search results and subreddits before posting. Even I didn't know about Niche (see above).",
