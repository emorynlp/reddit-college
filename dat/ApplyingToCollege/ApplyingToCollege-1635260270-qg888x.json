  "title:": "Tufts v. Case Western ED",
  "text": "Trying to decide which to apply ED. I love both of them and I think either would be a good fit. They're the perfect size and in lively locations. I'm interested in political science, anthropology, and theatre (would really like a strong theatre department/scene). I would like a somewhat strong alumni network, helpful career services center, professors that are enthusiastic about teaching (not just research) and a student body that loves to learn and collaborate. Also, I'm really eager to try and study a bunch of different things. Both of these schools seem to encourage interdisciplinary learning and students aren't tied to just one thing.\n\nWould love to hear opinions on both of these schools, especially from current students. What is the reputation, the vibe, etc.?\n\nTufts Pros\n-location\n-size\n-ExCollege\n\nTufts Cons\n-no merit/arts scholarships\n-farther from home\n\nCase Pros\n-size\n-location\n-scholarships\n-when I visited I got the sense that the theatre community is really tight-knit and welcoming\n\nCase Cons\n-not as much diversity in terms of geographical background\n-too STEM focused?",

      "text": "I don't know much about the theatre or polsci departments (although I do know people majoring in those subjects) but the anthropology department at Case is super friendly (one of my fave profs teaches anthro). Admittedly, most of the people at case are in stem so it can feel a bit isolating at times as a non-stem major. However, as a result, I'm even closer to the few people who have the same major as me and in general, I find that most the people here are chill so it's really not that bad. \nOh yeah, just be warned that there isn't much school spirit (not that Case is known for their football team) if you care about that kind of thing.\nHonestly, Boston is a far cooler city than Cleveland but I think the aid and the affordability makes up for it for the most part.",
