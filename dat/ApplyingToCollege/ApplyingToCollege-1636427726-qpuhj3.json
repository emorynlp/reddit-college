  "text": "Do athletes look better for admissions at t20 schools?  I am trying to get recruited for swimming and am in talks with several t20 schools. I know that most of these schools put student athletes through the same admission requirements. However, if I am someone who practices 8 times a week at 2 hours/practice during the school year and I\u2019m still able to have all As in my AP classes, does that make me look a lot better as an applicant? I also have a 1560 on my SAT.",

      "text": "Now you're at the point where it depends on the coach's needs. They'll calculate your academic index and weigh that against your sports results. If you're dominating at nationals, then your grades don't matter - they want you regardless. If you are decent at your sport but amazing AI, then you could balance out the dominant kid who has a terrible AI.  Also, keep in mind that the coach could see that you're definitely admissible, but want to save their official spots, and just informally let the AOs know that you could easily walk on and be a great part of the team - you're not guaranteed, but they put in a good word for you. There's all sorts of permutations and each school and sport does it differently. You have to talk with each coach, see what they say, read between the lines. No hard and fast rules except the NCAA recruited athletes. (Strict rules for them) \nGood Luck!",
