      "text": "They are assets. You should google this question, as there may be multiple articles to look at (e.g., random one: [https://capstonewealthpartners.com/how-is-real-estate-reported-on-financial-aid-applications/](https://capstonewealthpartners.com/how-is-real-estate-reported-on-financial-aid-applications/))\n\nAlso make sure you are following the instructions for applying for aid on each of your colleges' financial aid websites. Many colleges require additional financial aid forms, such as the CSS Profile or a college-specific form.\n\nRun the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.)",
