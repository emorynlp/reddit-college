  "text": "My name is Jaden Veal. I am a 23-year-old black female who trying to go to college for creative writing. I have been kind of struggling to find myself for a while now. And I really want to move. So I have been researching and Georgia seems like it would be a good fit for me. The only problem is there is too much conflicting evidence. I think it would be a good idea to get help from people who live there.  I'm also ace and I would like to go to c college welcoming to me. So if any of you live there what college would you recommend? Thank you for the help. Please be kind.",
