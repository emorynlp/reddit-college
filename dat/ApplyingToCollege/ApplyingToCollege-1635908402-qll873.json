  "text": "Running out of time to ask for LOR and it\u2019s mostly because I just have no idea who to choose.\n\nAbout every single year of high school, I\u2019ve had different teachers, so I don\u2019t really have any consistent teachers I have had for multiple years, nor was I part of many athletics so I don\u2019t have any coaches to rely on.\n\nI have a list I have drawn out, and if anyone here has experience with writing or requesting LOR, or actually knows what colleges look for, it would be greatly appreciated if you pick the candidates that best fit those roles. Thank you in advance.\n\n- A Spanish teacher I had through 9-11th grade, head of a club I was in, but now lives across the country \n\n- Math teacher I have had for 11th & 12th grade who I don\u2019t talk with much, but have good relations with nonetheless\n\n- Math teacher who was the head of a club I joined 10th grade, but only stayed in for that year, and is now my AP stats teacher for 12th grade\n\n- My manager at my work that I have had a job at for 3 years, but I only work during the summer and during breaks\n\n- a science teacher I had in 10th grade that I formed a good bond with\n\n- Computer science teacher I had for a year in 10th grade that I had an okay-good bond with (this is the degree I want to go into)\n\n\nWhich 2 of these sound the most appealing? Possibly a 3rd one just in case a college requests that. Thanks so much",

      "text": "Regarding your spanish teacher, do you know if they'd be willing to write a LOR? Mainly cause emailing them might take a long time (ex: I emailed my prev school's teachers and they didn't get back to me for over a week until I followed up but again that's just my experience and hopefully it won't take that long for you)\n\nAlso, who do you personally feel most closest to? \n\nAlso idk if this is common app, but common app has teachers and others. As for others, you have your manager. And for teachers, all of them sound good except for the AP stats one cause (I'm assuming) you were only a member and have them as a teacher this year (so I'm assuming they haven't seen you/known you as much tho I could be wrong ofc)",

          "text": "I understand what you are saying about my teacher not getting back to me. At least from my experience with them, they are pretty reliable and I wouldn\u2019t doubt they would get back to me quick, nonetheless, you never know.\n\nAs for who I feel closest to, that\u2019s a tough one. It depends on what context, I feel that my science teacher from 10th grade is one I can talk to and converse with, but I feel like I understand the character of my 11-12 math teacher more, it\u2019s just really hard to pick.\n\n\nI didn\u2019t even think about an \u201cother\u201d section on the common app, I\u2019ll have to check that out, thanks for help!",

              "text": "Alright yea if you're confident they'll respond quickly, your spanish teacher is a good option cause you had them for 3 years so they can write about how you grew over time. \n\nHmm ideally ask teachers you feel you're the closest to and know you best. Since you want to be a CS major, your CS teacher would nice too especially if they mention projects, etc but it's not mandatory that you do your CS teacher if you feel like you're not that close (my intended major is CS too but I did non CS teachers because I wasn't close enough). Well hm both teachers are somewhat recent and teach STEM subjects. Yea idk sorry. If you feel close enough to the 2 teachers, then you should definitely ask. \n\nAnd you're welcome!",
