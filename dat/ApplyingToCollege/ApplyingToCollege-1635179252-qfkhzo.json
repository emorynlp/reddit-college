  "text": "Hi!  Basically title - my family is pretty middle class but have a high EFC because of our house (bought during the Recession and value more than tripled) and a highish income due to living in a really expensive area.  I basically can't afford any private schools but I'm going to apply to 1-2 dream schools just because why not, and am wondering whether or not I should apply for financial aid if I'm estimated full pay.  Thanks!",
