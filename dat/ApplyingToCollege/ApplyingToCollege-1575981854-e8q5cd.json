Calisthenics are best if you want strength and not loose cardio because you're gonna build muscle mass better for running you're not gonna get absolutely swole off it but its safer then weights and if you're doing weights you gotta make sure you're doing your forms right and being explained what muscles you should activate when lifting and pushing while a proper pushup form takes 1 sec to look up and replicate and btw pushups exclusively wont cause muscle imbalances at all except for maybe your legs cause it's a plank plus going up n down",
