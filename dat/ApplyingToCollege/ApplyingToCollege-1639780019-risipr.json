Compared to other liberal arts schools, student resources are paltry and pedagogy is largely secondary to research, leaving depressed students. Locals resent the presence of the university, the university makes little effort to mend relationships with the surrounding neighborhoods, and is a strong driver of gentrification/eroding the local identity. I wouldn't recommend going to college here.",

      "text": "Oh boy this post came the same night that I made my move to drop out of a UChicago masters program. Fortuitous. \n\nThis program has sucked my will to live out my eyeballs. Never did I think I could be so happy to get into a program only to want nothing more than a way out. It\u2019s the perfect subject for me, after dropping out I\u2019m going to go study this same subject elsewhere, but they have no right to be teaching anything about this field. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. \n\nLet\u2019s start with admin staff. The staff cannot read, write, or speak. Yes, you heard it here first folks, my program\u2019s academic advisor cannot for the life of her find the correct preposition for any verb, ever. She apparently can\u2019t read either, or she just feels empowered to ignore large chunks of the emails that come her way. And she wrote, sorry, created, a form that was so user unfriendly that she then felt empowered to complain to me during our one (and only) advising session, about how much my classmates had fucked it up. Professionalism? Not here!\n\nBut I thought hey, what\u2019s a joke of an advisor if the professors are good. Right? \n\nThe professors were a farce. One freely admitted he\u2019d just copy/pasted some stuff into his slides and couldn\u2019t explain it because he didn\u2019t understand it. Another gave us articles about a real-world case study, apparently without having actually read them, because he then proceeded to make our final exercise based on that case study, and expected us to make the \u201ccorrect\u201d choice when the articles he himself had linked made it clear that the choice he wanted was UNCONSTITUTIONAL. He was like yeah, fuck your civil liberties. Lmao and when called out on it he said \u201csometimes you have to make tough choices in this field\u201d lord help me I wanted to just up and die, right there. And the copy/paste professor? Became verbally abusive to students at the end of the quarter. Probably because he received terrible reviews. Lord knows mine was scathing. I have insomnia but that man put me to sleep in broad daylight. My mom saw an online session once and was like WHY ARENT YOU TAKING NOTES?! (I was on my phone) and I made her stay for 10 minutes of the class. She was crying/laughing at that point saying she took it back and begging me to let her leave so she didn\u2019t have to listen to any more of it. I kept joking with her the whole time, should I write down \u201cyou have to consider risk? Or, you should listen to your gut but not listen to your gut? Or, you should have sources for your data? Or, risk management is important? Which of these should be ink on paper, mom?\u201d Oh and I forgot to mention, the entire thing was one group project after another. Just an endless stream of group projects, grades given arbitrarily without feedback, just utter bullshit. They were making it up as they went along. One guy didn\u2019t do a single thing all quarter for the group. Got the same grade as me who spent something like 100 hours on our group projects. They don\u2019t give a shit. \n\n10k per quarter, 60k for a degree I can get for 10k TOTAL in the country where I\u2019m going. Free if I\u2019d been able to find the right program in Germany. For someone to copy/paste from some Google results and feed it to us like we\u2019re brainless baby birds? No thanks\n\nI\u2019m sure the undergrad program is good or whatever but I\u2019m telling you, my experience is, there is essentially no way they can deliver the value that justifies the cost of their degree. And my degree fucking sucks. One term in and I was ready to end it all. As soon as I made the decision to drop out my mental health improved so drastically. I thought I loved UChicago but by g-d UChicago did not love me back. It was like being in an abusive relationship. In one quarter I\u2019ve lost the cost of an entire masters degree in another country that has equal or better programs. How f\u2019ed up is that? It\u2019s like being scammed. I feel scammed by this university, and cheated. Disillusioned and heartbroken. Angry, so angry that they\u2019re using us as cash cows and Guinea pigs for their programs while they \u201cwork out the kinks\u201d we aren\u2019t paying $60,000 for them to give us the beta version of their masters, thanks all the same. \n\nIn conclusion fuck UChicago and fuck everybody who put me through what I\u2019ve just been through which has frankly aged me a decade inside. You\u2019re better off.",

I\u2019m sorry, but if you\u2019re on a2c and past freshman year of college, there\u2019s something wrong with you. My brother goes there, is an athlete, and loves every part of his time there. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some that have a bad experience, but there\u2019s also a heck of a lot of normal, very smart students, having a great time and getting a great education. \nGood luck to you, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll end up at at a school where you\u2019re very happy.",

I was asking for responses to help me hate it, which is why there aren't many positive things about the school is this thread--because the request asked for the opposite. Also I don't think it's right to hate on people that enjoy helping people with the experience they have, about this process after all they were in our shoes not too long ago.
