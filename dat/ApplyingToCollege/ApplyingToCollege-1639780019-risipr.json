Compared to other liberal arts schools, student resources are paltry and pedagogy is largely secondary to research, leaving depressed students. Locals resent the presence of the university, the university makes little effort to mend relationships with the surrounding neighborhoods, and is a strong driver of gentrification/eroding the local identity. I wouldn't recommend going to college here.",
