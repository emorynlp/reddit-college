  "text": "Hello! I am a high school student looking for some volunteering opportunities. This isn't me trying to plug myself or anything, but my main areas of focus in ECs and classes are mostly social sciences and business along with more generally creative problem-solving. I don't want to do volunteering like stacking cans at a food pantry or organizing toys in a kid's hospital because those are personally meaningless and I have no passion for them (no hate to anyone who does this -- I have done activities like these in past years and can say they're pretty fulfilling/necessary, but I want to do something a little more tied to my interests).\n\nI also can assume the colleges I plan on applying to (T20 schools) don't care about this kind of stuff, and I also just don't want to do things like that, so does anyone know of some volunteering ideas in relation to the social science/political science/business fields that could work? Aside from volunteering with a local politician, which I plan on doing next election season.",

A sustained commitment to a volunteer activity that primarily benefits children and/or low-income families could be quite meaningful.  Possibly precisely *because* it's not the sort of thing resume-padders typically do.  Might stand out.\n\nKey words above being \"sustained commitment\".  Not, like, a couple weekends during your Junior year.",

      "text": "i'm not sure about volunteering, but maybe try to get some internships! since you want to pursue social science/political science, maybe contact professors at universities near you (or others if they offer virtual positions) that specialize in this area to work with them. i'm not 100% sure how it works in these fields since i'm a stem person, but you can also try to get some certifications through online sites like coursera that can give you some solid qualifications. good luck!",
