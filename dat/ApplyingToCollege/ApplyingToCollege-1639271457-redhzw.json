  "text": "So this girl in my class who is definitely from the nicer (much much nicer) side of tracks compared to the majority of my class was talking on Friday during lunch about how her mom owns a nonprofit dedicated to funding treatments for a certain disease. Now originally I didn\u2019t think much of this. Until I heard her say that her mom gave her a position on the board of directors, my friend asked why, and she responded with \u201cMy mom said I needed an extracurricular to get into college\u201d. Keep in mind, her brother is already going to an HYPSM because he does crew (like every other rich white person at my school). Now for the worst part: this made me realize that my school, despite having ridiculous wealth inequity and claiming that they care about equity among students, every year consistently goes out of their way to support a group of 4-5 kids who end up getting sent to a top college , all of whom either do crew, sailing, or are equestrians (sports that cost lots of money to do). They all come from this group of like 15 families who collectively are probably worth hundreds of millions. Yet I\u2019ve noticed that they actually put in such little effort in classes we share. Yet every year, poor or even middle class students (regardless of race) who put in SO MUCH more effort than the richer kids get rejected, while the rich kids get in and get showered with praise by school officials, whereas we have only sent 3 non rich  people to T20s in recent years (two being legacy, one who actually put in the effort). Anyways life liberty and the pursuit of happiness am I right?",

I\u2019m from a more affluent area but holy shit if you want to be popular/well liked you have to be rich since so much of it depends on how cute your clothes are or how much you can spend money when you hang out. Im def privileged economically compared to how my parents grew up, but even I\u2019ve been made fun of to my face for the shoes I wear etc. it sucks. It\u2019s near impossible to get ECs in my field here unless you have a parent in that field (which so many of them do). Oh, and coupled with what I said before, few leaders in my school are genuine. Some of them aren\u2019t qualified at all, but their friends got them a  position. Students older than me were notoriously bad people but hey, college apps only care what\u2019s on paper. There\u2019s no way a leader can be bad right?",

Plus, these tests suck the life out of students appearing for them, forcing them to grind for these tests for years and years on end. And what happens if you do not score well? You end up going to some college you didn't want to. Are you not aware of the intense societal pressure on those test takers to score really well? More and more applicants are moving away from taking them. A single piece of test cannot and should not determine your whole future. So no, JEE, NEET or other such standardised tests are not true reflection of meritocracy, not when they are besieged by external factors such as income inequality and mental pressure.",
