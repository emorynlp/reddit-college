  "text": "Hi! I'm writing my Why This School essay for the school that both of my parents as well as grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins on both sides of the family attended. I want to mention it because it did have an impact on my decision to apply. I initially avoided looking at the program because I didn't want to follow in my parents' footsteps and do the expected thing, but it redeemed itself with the specific things it offers. How do I mention this without sounding like I'm a name-dropping, rank-pulling douchebag?",
