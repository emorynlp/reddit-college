  "text": "I figured I'd come on reddit for a quick summary on what I should do and how to start this process, and I think I found the godly sub.\n\nI chose my subject and my general field of geography; Physics and mathematics related, with research and engineering aspects. I would love to settle somewhere in northern Europe, Australlia, Canada or the UK.\n\nI am planning to just do my bacheleor's first and midway I'll decide whether or not I want to continue masters or not.\n\nSo, where should I look for the best colleges? What data should I gather? These are the main questions I am the most puzzled by, because this kind of processs is unbeknowst to me.\n\nI am taking a British curriculum, so I hope it doesn't complicate things too much. I got all my 5 GCSE's A+-B's and I am to finalize my A level exams next year on June, where I am pretty darn confident I will score excellent marks there that should remove any reasons for colleges to decline me because of my marks. \n\nAlso, what are the various ways I can use to score myself some scholarships? My family isn't very financially strong to fund a top tier college or something, so I need to work hard on that end myself.",

Unfortunately, I'm not one of them :( The only thing I know is that you apply through the UCAS for UK schools.\n\nThere was [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/qxt17g/finding_colleges_abroad/) from a few days ago that might be able to help you out.",

Once you make that list, go on website of each uni and they'll have specific guidelines on their application process. One thing I love about Canadian Universities is that a lot of them have information related to different high school curricula around the world on their website, and A Levels are definitely one of the more famous curricula.",

PM me if you want. :) As for the others, the only thing Ik about unis in Australia is that they start their academic year from February which most probably means submitting applications this year might not be any more possible. But please check the websites of the unis just to confirm.",
