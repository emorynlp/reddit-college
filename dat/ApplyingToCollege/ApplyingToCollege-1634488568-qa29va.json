  "text": "I participated in the essay contest, and if I win my essay will be posted on their website.  At first I thought I would write my personal statement on a different topic, but now I really like the essay that I submitted to the contest.  So, will it be possible to use it if it was posted, and if so, how will AO react to this?  Do you think they google our essays?  And will they read my essay from this contest if I include it in honors?",
