I think it\u2019s the first one but I don\u2019t want to leave it blank if I\u2019ve misunderstood.",

So basically you can explain health issues, having to support your family, or other circumstances that may have affected you. \n\nThere\u2019s another section for extenuating circumstances related to academics, so I think this section is more for how your circumstances have affected your ECs and non-academic things. \n\nCan also be any other important information you want to highlight, but don\u2019t write an essay. \n\nIt\u2019s completely optional too so if you don\u2019t have anything to write then don\u2019t.",
