  "text": "Would also need some scholarship money. Not sure where to apply as I've only recently started to research US universities so I only have a general idea. And that all with bad stats which are:\n\n**GPA on scale 4-10**: 7.3\n\n**ECs**: School Newspaper, Coding Club, Photography Club, Spanish Club, speak 3 languages fluently\n\n**Other**: first generation at university, low income\n\nWanting to apply to Computer Science or Computer Engineering with a pre-med track.",
