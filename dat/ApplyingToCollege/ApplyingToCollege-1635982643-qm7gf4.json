  "text": "So I just realized I trolled on common app after turning in early action, i took some dual enrollment courses at a community college and I realized I put that I entered the school in 2019 when I actually entered in 2020. I also sent the community college transcript to a few schools. Is this a deal big enough where I need to fix it and notify the colleges or am I okay to leave it?",
