      "text": "Actually \"publish\" doesn't necessarily have to be \"published in a big-name science journal,\" and I assume that goes for most HS research projects.\n\nIn my case, my high school requires all of us to complete a research project in the sciences. All successful work gets printed out and made available in our school's library. However, a large number of us (me included) go on to file our research for patents for the potential to be included in research competitions.",
