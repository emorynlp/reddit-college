      "text": "this is \\*purely\\* anecdotal, I've never checked their common data set or anything like that. But it seems that Stanford is less strict when it comes to testing scores and GPA. I felt like they were the school that was mostly looking for personality than any other school. My Stanford application had the most details about my creative interests instead of my career-oriented interests (like musicals, baking, etc.). I made a lot of jokes in it too. This was completely different from my let's say Princeton application, where I wrote about vey serious topics. One of my friends in my HS class was rejected from a lot of universities, and she had a relatively low GPA and SAT score (like \\~3.6 and \\~1300), but she goes to Stanford now. She was extremely talented though, and an amazing leader with the ECs to prove it (no competitions or anything like that). I really could be wrong but this is the mindset I had going into applications so when I did mine I tried really hard to be \"quirky\" on the Stanford one and ig it worked.",

Sometimes, but rarely, you get really lucky and get in, but that's much less common (at least for my limited sample size) than for the people with roughly average stats (for the school).",
