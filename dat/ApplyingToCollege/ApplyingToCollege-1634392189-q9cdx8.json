If you don't follow the instructions, you don't get need-based financial aid. Period.\n\nIf you are DACA, you need to look for schools that provide aid for DACA or internationals.",

      "text": "FAFSA is the only way to apply for federal financial aid.  Schools will require that you apply for and receive all the federal grants you are eligible for prior to them awarding you any institutional aid.\n\nCSS Profile is not an application for aid. It is merely a service that some schools use to collect the information they use to calculate how much institutional aid you are eligible for. It is probably not used by all of the schools you are applying to. (Only used by a relative handful of the >3,500 4yr schools in the US.)",
