  "text": "[https://admissionslawsuit.unc.edu/about/admissions/](https://admissionslawsuit.unc.edu/about/admissions/)\n\nAccording to UNC's website , the in state acceptance rate for the 2021 entering class was 48%, while compared to the 14% out of state acceptance rate. I always knew UNC was easier to get into in state, 48% compared to 14% seems crazy",

The acceptance rate of those considered OOS is sub 10%.",

I would trust the legislative brief stats I worked with way before Naviance. As a side note, UW is mandated by the state constitution to accept a minimum of 50% of its incoming class from in-state.\n\nEdit: this is the issue most on this sub have with stats, there is an overwhelming belief that there is a normal distribution of applicant success, which isn't true as it is logistic data (either true or false, there is no in between, the percentage is a probability, not an average).",
