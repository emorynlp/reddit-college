      "text": "Here are some tips, for cutting down words.\n1.) Focus on sentences, fuse more to one, rephrase them to be shorter even cut some of them out\n2.) Get rid of uncesserally words;\na) such as adjectives (for example: red blood on white snow-every one knows that blood is white and it's normal for snow to be white),\nb)  linkers such as 'in my opinion' (use shorter linkers or don't use them at all if possible, you can easily Google list of such words)\nc) don't use long idioms and phrasal verbs\n3) use words with collocate with shorter expression\n4) use shorter tenses, use passive when subject is unknown (and don't mention it), us simple tense (without gerund or have/had if possible, )\n\nAfter all,\nIf you want to do a lot rephraseing, don't be afraid to break up a bit structure within the paragraph",
