  "title:": "Just got my updated GPA after 1st tri... should I send my updated gpa to EA colleges?",
  "text": "So I just finished up the first tri of my senior year and got a GPA boost from my grades. 3.85UW and 4.06W to 3.86UW and 4.08W. Not a huge boost but I think it would show a continued trend of amazing grades (with multiple AP's) that started with online learning. (10th grade I slacked a little more than I would have liked and I decided to adopt a zero-tolerance policy starting with the change of online learning)\n\nAnyways, I applied to UIUC, Purdue, and UMich EA with my GPA up to senior year. My question is since I won't be hearing decisions for a while now, should I contact admissions and send them my updated GPA? If so, would that be an opportunity to just send them my official transcript that includes my first tri grades (that would obviously include my bumped GPA)?\n\nThanks!",
