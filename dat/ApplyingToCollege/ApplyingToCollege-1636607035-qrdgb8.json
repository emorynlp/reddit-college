  "text": "In the Common App Courses and Grades section, it asks: Do you have 12th grade courses listed on your transcript that have been issued official transcript grades?*\n\nI have my 12th grade half yearly marks (but my counselor will be sending them as part of my Mid Year Report.) Do I need to report them in that section again? And even if I do, my school works on a semester basis, so I don't have my 2nd semester marks. (They will be conducted in January after my 1st sem board examinations which is ISC.) What should I do in that case? Should I just put no?",
