  "text": "high school senior, i\u2019m currently taking environmental science and psychology and they\u2019ve kindled an interest in those subjects that i didn\u2019t realize i ever had. my plan for college has been to major in either writing (creative) or a foreign language depending on what each school offers, but i\u2019ve done some thinking recently and like\u2026 realistically, i probably won\u2019t be able to do much with those degrees, some schools i\u2019m interested in don\u2019t even offer those majors, and those are both skills that i can work on as a hobby anyways. so now i\u2019m considering applying to some schools as some sort of environmental science or psychology major (i haven\u2019t decided on one yet), but i\u2019m worried about my stats. my ECs and other classes do not reflect an interest in stem at ALL. i\u2019m taking the easiest math class at school; i\u2019m taking two creative courses; my ECs include helping out with the school\u2019s literary magazine and volunteering at a library; the only two other science classes i\u2019ve taken in high school have been ninth grade biology, which was eh, and tenth grade physics, which i nearly failed; and the enviro and psych classes i\u2019m taking now aren\u2019t even AP (though they\u2019re considered honors level, so i have that going for me). is applying as a stem major at this point even a good idea? i feel like it might be too late to stray from the liberal arts path.",
