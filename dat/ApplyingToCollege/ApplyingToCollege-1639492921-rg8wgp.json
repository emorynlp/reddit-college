  "text": "I\u2019ve been really worried about the impact of my freshman year grades. I had a 2.6 cumulative that year, and because of that my cumulative gpa is a 3.4 despite getting almost perfect grades in the last 1.5 years. \n\nIt\u2019s been bothering me so much that I\u2019ve wrote my PS on it. (Joining jv football, juggling academics, ec\u2019s, and family responsibilities, etc; and then saying how I learned to adapt and grow from that). Although it is a good essay IMO.\n\nDo elite colleges really look freshman year grades? My gpa is a 3.7/4.2 excluding freshman grades and I\u2019m applying to a few selective colleges and seeing everyone\u2019s stats here I feel like I\u2019ve got no chance",
