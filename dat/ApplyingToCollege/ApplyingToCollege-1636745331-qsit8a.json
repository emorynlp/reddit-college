  "text": "At the time of application, AP students already have some AP scores on their transcripts, but IB students will only get their scores at the end of senior year. So they don\u2019t have any standardized tests (like AP students have) on their transcripts when applying for college. How do colleges gauge IB students since all they can see are their local school grades and all schools/teachers are not the same?",

I think they have to weigh it rather low, though, since timing of AP classes (some schools allow 9th graders to take and some make kids wait till 11th etc) between students prob varies a bit by school. My guess is that AP scores, if available, add additional supporting evidence to solid grades (ie not simply grade inflation).",

(Though, every once in a while you hear someone claim that their school uses the exam grade\u2026 which seems unlikely since that grade comes a month or more after the school year ends\u2026 and many kids don\u2019t even take the exams.)",
