High school was cake for these individuals, and while they said this was challenging, it was no more so than balancing 7 APs with hella ECs.\n\nOne of the main things they did like was no MCAT, and since it was 6 years they actually felt less burnt out because there was no extra \u201capplying to medschool pressure\u201d",

But like, it\u2019s also super racist \ud83d\ude2d. Their anti-racism activist group (Reedies Against Racism) is very active but man micro aggressions to full blown racism from faculty and other students is something I hear about pretty often. Not to discourage anyone going though because it\u2019s a great school. It\u2019s just frustrating to see because the students have done and continue to do SOOO MUCH to get what black students need from Reed. And I guess the vibe Reed gives off is what makes all of that bad for me.",

I'm majoring in Electrical Engg and ECE if possible I'm aware that UIUC has an ECE dept. but I find places like GeorgiaTech to have better infrastructure and faculty in place.\n\nI have an ambitious list cause financially US is very expensive (I'm from a 3rd World Country). Hence the cost of going to an average institute like (for example the University of Buffalo) is very high. If I'm going to an average school, might as well do that in my country where it's a fraction of the cost. So essentially what I'm doing with US unis is 'Go Big or Go Home' (my dreams are MIT and Caltech/Berkeley) and me being in a magnet school helps.",
