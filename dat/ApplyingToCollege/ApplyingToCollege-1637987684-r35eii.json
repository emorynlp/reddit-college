  "text": "so i need one more letter of rec and for my one teacher from last year i just emailed them, but the other one i actually currently have a class with so i think it\u2019d be more appropriate to ask them in person. however, i don\u2019t really know how to go about this. should i just ask them quickly at the end of class or should i meet up with them outside of class and ask more formally? idk",

Of course none of them were on time but they also weren\u2019t late so.",
