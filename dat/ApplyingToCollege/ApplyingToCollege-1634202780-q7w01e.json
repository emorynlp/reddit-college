      "text": "I think adding something like that in there to personalize it would be good as long as you relate it to why you want to attend this school or why you belong there. My daughter included a childhood story in the 3 colleges she applied to and got acceptance letters to all of them. We had read on reddit somewhere that personalizing your letter helps. I believe it was a person that read these all day, they did a long post about it and said it gets boring and they would offer to/pick the person with the interesting letter over the one with the better scores.  Don\u2019t quote me but it was something along those lines. I just took it that way.",
