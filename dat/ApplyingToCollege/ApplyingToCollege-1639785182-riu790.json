  "text": "I got a 1530 on December sat, but my counselor says for me to really have a great shot at the schools I want I should aim for 1560. I\u2019m a junior, and I took august and October before this. Normally, I would think that after 3 tries it\u2019s really difficult to improve score. But what happened here is on October I got -6 reading and -2 writing, but on December I got -1 reading and -6 writing, so I feel that a low amount of errors on both parts for me is possible. Do you think I should retake for a fourth time, or will colleges see it as a bad thing? Btw, math is a constant 780-800 and I\u2019m not worried about improvement there.",

      "text": "You don\u2019t have to send all of your SAT scores. So you can retake as many times as you want. \n\nEven at elite schools once you break 1500 threshold, no one in admission is questioning your academic abilities. It really isn\u2019t worth the time to retake. You should focus on extracurriculares.",
