  "text": "I got a 1530 on December sat, but my counselor says for me to really have a great shot at the schools I want I should aim for 1560. I\u2019m a junior, and I took august and October before this. Normally, I would think that after 3 tries it\u2019s really difficult to improve score. But what happened here is on October I got -6 reading and -2 writing, but on December I got -1 reading and -6 writing, so I feel that a low amount of errors on both parts for me is possible. Do you think I should retake for a fourth time, or will colleges see it as a bad thing? Btw, math is a constant 780-800 and I\u2019m not worried about improvement there.",
