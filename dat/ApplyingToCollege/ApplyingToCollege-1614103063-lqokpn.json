  "title:": "Getting rejected from 15 schools, one year later.",
  "text": "I don't really know if this is the best time to post this, because honestly I forgot when most of the decisions come out. However, I'm doing so because I suspect that there's at least one kid here in the exact position I was around this time last year. (If not, I guess that's pretty awkward).\n\nSo what was that position? Well, as the title suggests, I got straight rejected by 15 schools, mostly T20s. Not waitlisted, not deferred, rejected. Thankfully, these weren't the ONLY schools I applied to: I ultimately had a few decent options, including the school I am at now. However, I didn't get into a single one of the \"glamorous\" brand-name schools: the type of ancient, elite institution that instantly wins you the adoration of middle-aged parents the world over. Meanwhile, many of my friends and classmates were getting into not only T10s but T5s (I went to a magnet HS).\n\nAlthough I had told myself and been told time and time again how dumb and ungrateful it was to care so much about prestige, it was a massive hit to the self-esteem nonetheless. I felt like I was the only one who didn't get into a single \"good school\", that I had worked for nothing, that people I thought I worked harder than were getting into \"better\" schools than me, and that I've must've done something extremely wrong to have been rejected. Furthermore, I started feeling guilty about being so devoted to prestige, which led to a self-destructive feedback loop. I wanted that instant respect, and knowing that made me feel vain and shallow. I was conscious of how unproductive these thoughts were, but despite my best efforts I would think them anyways.\n\nIt all seems very distant now, I can hardly imagine it's been probably less than a year since then. I know this post must seem very self-indulgent, (and it is, lol), but there **is** a point to it. First, if you can relate to everything I'm talking about, you've probably already heard everything I'm about to say. I'm also guessing they're words that feel pretty empty coming from people who have already \"found success\" in one way or another. However, as someone who went through this whole process myself, I hope to lend credence to that advice by speaking from firsthand experience. This post is already WAY too long, so I won't elaborate much, but the important bits are listed below.\n\n1. You're not alone, and it's ok to feel the way you are feeling.\n2. The skills and experience you picked up in high school will propel you towards success no matter where you go to college, sometimes in ways you'd never expect.\n3. You will meet smart, talented people wherever you are.\n4. The \"college experience\" is mostly what you make of it (trust me, I'm legit in the middle of nowhere).\n5. IMPORTANT: Avoiding exorbitant student loans is more important than going to the perfect college (this is more of my personal opinion, ignore if you are rich).\n6. Parents may want what's best for you without KNOWING what's best for you. Try not to hold it against them, but try not to let them get to you either.\n7. If you have confidence in your ability to learn from the people around you and work towards improving yourself, you will come out of this a better, stronger person.\n\nIf you're still reading this, I'm really grateful you took the time to read my entire ramble. I'm hoping this made at least someone feel better, otherwise I just come off as a self-important jerk lmao (sorry if I do). This will probably be my final post on A2C since there's really no reason to come back after well, applying to college. So long, and thanks for all the fish!\n\nEdit: I didn't intend for people to find out what my actual college was but now that it's out there I wanna say that I wasn't implying that I don't think my current school is good. This is a reflection of what I felt at the time. Also I'm not a CS major lol.",

      "text": "This was super helpful! I, like yourself, was also rejected by each and every college that I applied to except for 2 universities in UK. I unfortunately did not have enough financial aid to attend those universities, and I did not want to take out loans to pay for tuition etc. (London is expensive \ud83d\ude14). Then Covid-19 happened and I was stuck at home. I decided to apply to US colleges again but now with a  realistic college list i.e safeties, and writing a better common app essay etc. I also have applied for scholarships this time around. As an international student, it is very difficult to get in a good college but reading your post did make me feel better. I have hope and wherever I end up, I know that I am more than a university. \ud83d\ude0c \n\nP.S I might delete my comment later because I don't like leaving comments \ud83d\ude05",

I don\u2019t mind going my state school (UF) but I do want to make it to at least one top school and maybe hopefully afford (my efc is pretty low).
