      "text": "Other than a record that demonstrates you can handle the coursework, colleges don't have a *specific* checklist of things they want to see.  That includes paid work.  They're looking for students who aren't assholes, and who they think will \"add something\" to their class and campus.  Intellectual curiosity, community service, leadership, initiative, etc.  A summer job *can* serve to highlight those qualifies in a student, but so could lots of other things.",
