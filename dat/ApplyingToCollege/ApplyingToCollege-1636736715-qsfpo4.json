  "text": "Hello y'all\n\nSo my community college has a weird grading system. If you have an 89.5% - 100%, you have an A. 79.5% -89.49% , a B. Etc.\n\nThere is no A+, A-, B+, B-. So your GPA can drop several points just by getting a 88.9% in a class (it would be a B, which is a 3.0 when you add it).\n\nSo do schools account for that? My GPA would be a little higher if my school had a different system.",
