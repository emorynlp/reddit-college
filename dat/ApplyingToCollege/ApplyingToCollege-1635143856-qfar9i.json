      "text": "If you could publish it on a more 'respected' site then that would be better, if you know what I mean. If not, I personally wouldn't recommend it. Also, the 3.5k reads can seem unreliable to admissions officers as those reads can come from you, your friends, or your family spamming it. But if you think it reflects you really well and/or you're going into journalism, something English/writing-related, then I guess you can consider it.",

          "text": "Makes sense, thank you so much!!\nI'm not applying for a writing / creative major at all (Applying for CS / CE) and working on getting the book self published, but I heard that wasn't respectable either. I can put it on Amazon Kindle as well but other than that, I'm somewhat lost because I don't think either of these really have any impact at all on my application. I did put in a lot of effort into writing it, is somewhat personal and important to me but I can always remove it from my application. \nAny ideas? Should I bother getting it physically self published or just not bother mentioning it at all?",
