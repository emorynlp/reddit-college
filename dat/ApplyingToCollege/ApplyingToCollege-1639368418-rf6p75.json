  "text": "It was the first decision I received out of all the colleges too... so I'm not feeling too good. I really, REALLY wanted to go there. And worst of all, I'm just depressed that I won't be able to attend college by my best friend's side anymore. I don't know- I just feel like a huge clown left in the dust. \n\nHere's the best part, when I was scrolling through my stories, some kid decided to post that they got accepted and just had to mention that they weren't planning on going anyway. I was sobbing so much after that lol\n\nSorry for this negativity, I just needed to let this out somewhere :')",

      "text": "I\u2019m so sorry.. I know that must be rough for you. I\u2019m just a random person on here, I know. But please don\u2019t feel that way (like a \u201cclown\u201d), or beat yourself up too much. Assuming your bf will decide to attend (as it\u2019s their dream school), I know it\u2019s gonna be tough to move on without them & vice-versa. However, keep in mind - you may well wind up somewhere really great, and at a college that is just the right place for you to be. Even if it\u2019s not your first choice (or where your bestie is), it could very well work out better than you expect. \n\nThat said, don\u2019t resign yourself to not ever getting to go to your first choice, if it\u2019s want you truly want. - It may not be in the cards now.. but if, after a year at some other college you aren\u2019t settled, you could always transfer in to the one you originally wanted. (As long as they accept \u2018em, and most do.) So keep heart.. You\u2019re probably gonna feel this way awhile, and I don\u2019t blame you. Just realize that it will all work out like it\u2019s meant to. And I guarantee you wherever you wind up going, you\u2019re going to do great. But I def know how agonizing such things can be. GL to you, in whatever your endeavors are. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4a",

And you will return home to the college you ended up choosing, happily.\n\nThe next few months are probably going to suck, but you WILL be accepted by other places where you will thrive.",

And if you don't fit their criteria, then maybe it was for the better, and you'll be a better fit elsewhere. In essence, maybe you should reevaluate your own criteria (away from the fancy brochures and colorful emails) and see if that school would have truly been good for you. Many times you'll realize that it wouldn't have been.",

This has been a year of struggles and rejections for me. I had an offer to my dream school and it was rescinded because of a medical condition that I had as a child. I know what it\u2019s like to plan for something and just have *stuff* hit the fan. Just remember that life goes on :)",
