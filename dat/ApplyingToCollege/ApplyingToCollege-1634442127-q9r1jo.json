      "text": "If you actually wanna do accounting, be aware that getting into a top programme really isn't necessary. Any flagship school or decent university with a business school will have a good enough business school that B4 will recruit there. You should just choose schools primarily based on region. NYU might have a much more prestigious business school than UTSA for example, but they're going to have almost no one in Texas and those that are aren't gonna be in accounting. If you want to work accounting in Texas, UTSA would probably be a better option over YU or BU or UIUC for example.",
