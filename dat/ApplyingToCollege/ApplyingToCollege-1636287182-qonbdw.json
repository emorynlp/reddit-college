If you're sure about Engineering, I would start with a research university from the beginning. But CS and Physics are another story, since many LAC's would offer great programs in these fields.",

We have many undergraduates who are significantly engaged in research, who publish papers about their research, and who present research at national conferences. We have an undergraduate research office which facilitates funding for many undergraduate researchers. \n\nABET accreditation is the gold standard for engineering education. So, if you\u2019re going to study engineering, make sure the programs you\u2019re applying to are ABET-accredited, whether you\u2019re looking at LACs or universities.",
