  "text": "i know some people say us news ranks are not reliable, but uw seattle is ranked #7 in best global universities (between columbia and cambridge)  and ranked around the #20s for its undergrad engineering school. i'm in state for udub and i think i have a solid chance of getting in since it's one of my safeties, but i never really considered going until i realized how good the resources are here in seattle, considering it's a recruiting hub for many tech companies (amazon, blue origin, google, etc) but what do u guys think?",

      "text": "UW is an amazing school, with a couple of caveats: One is grad deflation in math and science, so if you want to go pre-med, for example, it's a little tougher. The other is the area. It's a little less safe off campus than some other schools. \n\nBut yes, it's an amazing school that people try to get into from around the world, so if you are in-state, take advantage of that.",

      "text": "It's really good. You shouldn't put too much stock in rankings, but you can look at their methodology and take it into consideration. You can also look at things like research expenditures or salary of graduates - UW does well by those kinds of measures too.\n\nAs a possible negative, be aware of how their engineering placement works.  Some schools do a direct to major approach. Others do entry into a college of engineering, with placement into major afterwards (which can be competitive or not competitive).  UW has something of a mix - direct entry for CS and computer engineering, competitive within engineering after your first year for other engineering majors.  They certainly aren't unique in that approach, but some students prefer knowing whether they can study their first choice before they enroll.",

          "text": "One negative to this approach is that I've heard the competition can be a bit toxic and stressful. They apparently have a lot of weed out courses early on, and I believe people are often comparing themselves to one another to see how they're faring for a spot for their preferred major.\n\nThat said, UW has amazing maker spaces for the engineers (and other students) and they've got some incredible STEM academic buildings thanks to BillG and other billionaires from the area.",
