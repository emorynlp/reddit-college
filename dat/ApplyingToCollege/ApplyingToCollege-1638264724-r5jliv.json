      "text": "They are asking about you - but 4 different sides of you. So for example, you can write about how you helped a friend or a sibling, highlighting your leadership or skill (PIQ 1 or 3). Then talk about something you like to create (Arts, video, YouTube channel, engineering project) or solve (Puzzles, problems) under PIQ 2, talk about a favorite subject or project in school where you learned something (PIQ 4 or 6). Lastly talk about a challenge (Family, personal, covid related) and how you overcame under PIQ 5. If you can\u2019t fit a story under any of the prompts, use #8 to write about it.\n\nThe idea is to show different sides of you.",
