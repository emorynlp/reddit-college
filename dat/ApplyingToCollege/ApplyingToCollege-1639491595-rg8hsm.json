      "text": "So from what I've seen online, this is what I think the situation is like:\n\nBasically, if you are an international applicant applying for aid (does not apply for US citizens living outside the US) you will have submitted a form called the ISFAA or the CSS profile. Apparently, in previous years the intl applicants who asked for aid and got accepted received some email about filling in the CSS profile. It's mostly so the financial office can provide you with your financial aid package when decisions come out.\n\nEssentially it was a sort of way to find out if you got accepted or not before the decisions were released. I think other schools like UPenn (a friend told me about UPenn, so my info may not be accurate) used to do this too, but they stopped because people found out that it confirms their acceptance. Northwestern used to send out those emails, and people are just wondering where they are this year. I think the most logical conclusion is that northwestern realized that people found out and stopped sending them- unless people actually got them because I didn't see anyone who said they did.\n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a4405q/northwestern_international_ed_class_of_2023/) is a post made a few years ago.\n\nIt's nothing to worry about, the official decisions will come out on the 17th, and that's what you should look forward to.\n\nWe all worked hard up to this point, all we can do now is hope for the best. We got this.\n\nGood luck to all the Northwestern ED applicants!",

          "text": "actually, i believe it's people who could ONLY fill out the ISFAA because the CSS costs money to send -- then nu would send them a fee waiver for the CSS a couple of weeks before decisions meaning that they've accepted them and are considerg their finaid package?",
