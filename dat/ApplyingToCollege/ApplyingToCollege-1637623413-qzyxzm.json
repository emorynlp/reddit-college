  "text": "So I\u2019ve been working on my CSU application for a few weeks and have been doing the part where it asks for all high school coursework and was wondering which term system I would use. My school uses both quarter and semester grades so should I just put in my quarter grades or semester or both? Because I put in both and the system thoight I\u2019d attended school for like 28 years. Any help appreciated, thanks!",

      "text": "Do whatever shows up on your transcript. My school does both as well, but the quarters are more like a progress report. Also the total years at the bottom of the A-G matching page is calculated by 1 year long class as one year and those are all added together (if that makes sense). My counselor said most people have around 24 years.",
