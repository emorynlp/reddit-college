  "text": "Be proud of yourself for writing a few sentences for that supplement, for hitting submit on your safety, for studying extra hard for that test, or simply for getting out of bed in the morning \n\nYou\u2019re doing the best you can \n\nThis process doesn\u2019t give as much as it takes \n\nAnd it can take sanity and happiness and health and self-worth \n\nSo appreciate the small victories\n\nI got accepted into my safety the other day \n\nAnd i really like the school and I\u2019m relieved the be in somewhere \n\nHard work will always pay off in one way or another and i know even if i don\u2019t get into my dream school that i will put in my best effort wherever i go and people will see that",
