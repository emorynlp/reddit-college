  "text": "Do you think applying with no essay to a school that doesn\u2019t require an essay is a good thing? Is it okay? I just don\u2019t want to get denied from my safety. \nDo you guys think it\u2019s better to just turn in the essay. \nIt\u2019s because my essay is so not ready but I want to meet the early action deadline for one of safety schools. \n- Feels like an obvious question but I\u2019m new at this so I don\u2019t know\n\nAny thoughts are appreciated.",

My daughter skipped the Penn State essay and was already admitted.  \n\n(She\u2019s first in a class of 500+ at a school that sends dozens of kids every year, and had an SAT hundreds  of points above the 75th %, so she felt safe)",
