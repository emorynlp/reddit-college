  "text": "yeahhhh we're back with the app procrastination moment (ft. finals stress).\n\ndisclaimer: t10 = t10 on us news bc i rlly couldn't care less i j needed a bound on the schools to look at. rankings are arbitrary and criminally stupid!!!!!!!!!\n\nalso i'm not a professional designer i j like fonts a bit too much!!!\n\nanyways enjoy!!!!!!!! or don't but then i'll b sad so pls do enjoy\n\n1. **Harvard** (Canela Web / GT American Standard). v classic serif / sans pairing, but i j LOVE canela so much the flairing instead of serifs??? immaculate. a true 10/10. and gt american is j so nice as well, utterly perfect kerning and weight.\n2. **MIT** (Messina Sans). very crisp but round sans font, screams mit. with the webpage layout being as it is, it's totally fine to not have any variation in the font bc it's j so smooth and crisp and nice. lovely :)\n3. **JHU** (Quadon / Gentona). it's very very distinctive and different, but it works because it's very hopkins. gentona is beautiful and bold; quadon is (in ur words) \"collegiate but current\" which i do actually agree with. unique but effective.\n4. **UPenn** (EB Garamond / Roboto). love garamond and roboto in isolation. not completely a perfect pair but it gets the job done!\n5. **Princeton** (Princeton Monticello / Franklin Gothic). it's clear they attempted to imitate harvard (esp w franklin gothic?? rlly??). they get points for making their own serif font(!!) but it j doesn't rlly work for me. franklin gothic is j a bit too narrow for me overall.\n6. **Chicago** (Adobe Garamond / Gotham). expected more from y'all ngl. i'm a huge fan of garamond offshoots, so that works v well and is v uchicago-y. gotham though? a solid meh. it's way too grotesque for me and is absolutely not \"friendly without being folksy, confident without being aloof.\" using the rounded version of gotham is what rlly knocks u down though, it's j not as crisp as it should be.\n7. **Stanford** (Source Serif / Source Sans Pro). it's like.... fine. average. nothing great, nothing bad. as body text it works pretty effectively, but the lack of variation makes it j a little boring?\n8. **Northwestern** (Campton / Akkurat Pro). like stanford, u went for a sans heavy layout; unlike stanford, urs is worse than boring. two *different* sans fonts is an absolute design no-no but u went for it anyway and it did not pay off. still not horrific but not very good either\n9. **Columbia** (Trajan Pro / Proxima Nova). ++++ for using trajan pro, it's super columbia. but... proxima nova??? really??? you look like a 6th grader who j decided to make the switch from Open Sans/Arial to something \\~unique\\~ so u would seem different (said 6th grader is me in 6th grade). you could have been so close to greatness.\n10. **Duke** (Merriweather / Open Sans). guys b honest u j went to google fonts and picked two at random. they don't work together or on their own. both fonts r boring and below average and j not good overall.\n11. **Yale** (Yale / Mallory). as w princeton, points for the original serif font. unlike with princeton, what the everloving FUCK is that body text. the characters are so wide and short and ugly. hate them for this (kidding i love you yale please love me back).\n12. **Caltech** (Helvetica). do i really need to say anything about this.",
