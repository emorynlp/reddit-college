  "text": "I\u2019ve read in multiple forums (including one where a UChicago rep replied) and in a google search description on UChicago\u2019s site (clicking the link directs me to a page that doesn\u2019t mention it though) that say that UChicago is need-blind for Canadian applicants. However, most of these sources are rather old and I cannot find anything on UChicago\u2019s present site that indicates that this is the case. Does anyone know for sure?",
