  "text": "Hoping to learn more about an opaque process as advisors were not very familiar with it, either, kinda freaking out.\n\nI\u2019m  wondering if Cal (Berkeley) or Cornell verify that transfer applicants have reported all  transcripts using the National Clearinghouse/another third party, or if  there is another verification process of academic history.\n\nIt\u2019s  my understanding all students will be run through the National  Clearinghouse to ensure they are not enrolled in two different  institutions or have not accepted offers of admission to two different  schools.\n\nBut is that after  admission is granted, and does that info affect transcript/academic  history verification? What if a school was accidentally left off from  the original application - now that admissions has been given, would  they need further information on that school?",
