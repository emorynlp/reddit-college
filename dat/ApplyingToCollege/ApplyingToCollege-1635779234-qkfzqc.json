  "text": "Hello, I was wondering if it's possible for me to include my lexile score on my common app?\n\nI have been studying abroad since middle school, but I think it's important to still provide more info or proofs that I can use english well..\n\nI took lexile tests around grade 10, but I got like \\~1600 which is pretty good I think and is in university level.\n\nDoes anyone know anything about it, or have included their Lexile score onto Common App?\n\nThanks",
