  "title:": "CSU Application isn't giving me honors points for Dual Enrollment Courses",
  "text": "So the CSU's (California State Universities) say they give an honors point for dual enrollment courses. However, they are counting my dual enrollment courses as a 4.0 weighted instead of a 5.0 weighted when I got A's in all five of my dual enrollment courses.\n\nWhen I *don't* input my classes at my local community college (in California), it says I have 23.5 total years and a 4.32 calculated GPA. When I *do* input my classes at my local junior community, it says I have 28.5 total years and a 4.23 calculated GPA.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this issue or is there an error I might be making? Appreciate any help. Thanks.",
