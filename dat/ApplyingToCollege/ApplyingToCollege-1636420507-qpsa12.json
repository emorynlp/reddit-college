  "text": "Is it ok if I wrote my common app essay as if it were a letter to someone? Specifically my father since we\u2019ve had an unconventional relationship. Im not sure if this idea is a little bit too creative writing-ish for the common app essay or not\u2026. I\u2019d reveal enough about the situation with my dad within the letter so that anyone could easily follow.\n\nAlso I\u2019m curious if the admissions officers would interpret this as me pasting the wrong body of text into common app and disregard it all together? I doubt they\u2019d be that stiff, but you never know, right?",

      "text": "Istg this is creative and as a Literature enjoyer I love it. But make sure you talk a lot about yourself in the letter, and maybe talk about your improvements as a person or name examples since it\u2019s a letter. It\u2019s a good idea but always remembers this essay is about yourself!",
