  "text": "I just applied to cmu for architecture and signed up for the portfolio review as well. Does anyone have any idea what they usually ask? Will they ask about the process and want me to explain the pieces to them? Is it like an interview or a discussion? This is sort of like an interview right?",

      "text": "I did a fine arts portfolio review with a CMU admissions counselor and it was casual. She went through my entire portfolio, and asked specific questions for 5 of my paintings. She asked to explain my process, concepts, and what \u201cfueled\u201d my artistic passions. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be slightly different for architecture, but the entire interview felt casual. Most of the admissions counselors are very eager to meet with prospective students, so they\u2019ll be very kind and provide constructive guidance. No need to worry",
