  "title:": "Duke interview gone wrong?",
  "text": "I just had my Duke interview a couple hours ago, and the interviewer was just horrible. she came into the meeting late and joined the meeting from her phone in her car, so it wasn't the \"professional\"  college interview. Even further, she kept asking me my SAT and AP scores even though I did not submit my sat. she did not know that sat scores were optional this year, and even though I explained her my situation of how my sats were cancelled, she kept asking me my sat scores for like 5+ times in the interview. she was kind of disappointed about my ap scores and how i did not have an sat, and for the rest of the interview she did not even take me seriously and looked like she wasn't listening to my answers for 'why duke' and 'why major'. even though i did not submit sat scores, i believe that my extracurriculars and my passion for my major is what sets me apart from other students applying and the fact that she did not even listen to my answers really disappointed me. I know that in the evaluation after the interview, there isn't questions about my test scores etc but I feel like I did not impress her because i did not have sat scores, which could affect the 'evaluation'. Duke is my dream school as I EDed there, and I am very scared that this will affect my chances of admission. should i report her? if so from where? did any of you have an experience similar to mine? \n\n(btw english is my second language sorry if somethings aren't clear)",

I would be severely anxious if my interview went like this. However, if I were to email the school, I feel like it wouldn\u2019t look good on my part. At the same time, for Duke, the interview is a minuscule aspect of your application (5-10%). However, if you believe that the unprofessional interviewer may in fact give negative feedback as opposed to neutral or positive feedback, then I would definitely email them as that could be a -5 or -10%, which definitely hurts.",
