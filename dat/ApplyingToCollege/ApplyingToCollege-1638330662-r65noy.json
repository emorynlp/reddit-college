  "text": "Hey-ho! Could you lovely people please give me some examples of topics that one could write about in the graded paper? I'm an international and this type of thing isn't really something we do. I just need a few example topics to gauge what would be appropriate and to estimate the depth of the writing.\n\nCurrently, I'm thinking of writing one on the subjectivity, objectivity, and emergence of morality, with a focus on the works of Nietzsche. However, I don't know if such a topic would be appropriate for the type of expository writing that they are looking for. Also uncertain if the depth of analysis would be appropriate. \n\nThanks :)",

But in my country, this isnt really something we do. We aren't really required to write such papers. That is why I'm having to write it now (senior year) and the teacher will then grade it. So what sort of topic do people normally write about? Could you give a few examples?",

Imo, it can be about any topic you\u2019ve researched/read up about in sufficient detail (consulted existing papers and articles, for instance). I would steer clear of a topic that sounds fancy but lacks depth in favour of a \u201csimple\u201d topic that you are genuinely interested in and have read a lot about.\nJudging by your interest in Nietzsche, if you\u2019re on the fence about your topic, I\u2019d recommend browsing ContraPoints and PhilosophyTube on YouTube (if you haven\u2019t, already) for ideas. That said, your existing topic sounds really interesting, so if you\u2019re confident about it, go for it.",
