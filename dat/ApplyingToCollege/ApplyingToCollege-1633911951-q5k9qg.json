      "text": "You can, but you have to work it into a larger context of what that school offers. I had a roommate who did FSAE and he wrenched on his bike (Hurricane, same engine as their FSAE car) and was there because of the MechE excellence. So think about what aspects of the degree you're excited about, where that school excels, and how FSAE is part of that.\n\nFor example, at Michigan Mobility, Automotive, and Transportation is a big subfield of MechE -- plus they're right outside Detroit and have done tons of work with automakers. So in that context, FSAE is just one of the many cool things attracting you. Now, not every school is near Detroit, but hopefully that is a useful example.",
