  "text": "Heeeeeeey\nI wanna know if when my teachers and counselor are submitting their LORs and evaluations to the colleges, If when they actually submit, has to be before or after I submit my app. Like, does it change anything? How can their evaluation link to mine, apart from me \u201cinviting them?\u201d Pls answer, my school doesn\u2019t work with counselors or anything for this, so I\u2019ve got teachers and staff from the school trying to help me out, but they don\u2019t know how most of it works.",
