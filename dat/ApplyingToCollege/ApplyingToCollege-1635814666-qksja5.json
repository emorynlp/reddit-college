      "text": "Hi, graduate student here. I can only speak for STEM, but to a large extent, it really doesn't matter what college you went to for undergraduate. What really matters is what you do during your time as an undergraduate. I was able to receive lots of amazing research experience while at the University of Connecticut. That experience helped me get interview offers from FAANG and job offers from the federal government, although I decided to continue to graduate school. If you see graduate school in your future, it definitely doesn't matter where you to go for college, at least for STEM. I've had peers from my major (physics), go onto Brown, Yale, MIT, etc.. all within the past couple of years. On the other hand, if you ever lurk r/gradadmissions, you will find that there are some posters from Ivy Leagues that have a difficult time getting admitted to a decent program in their field because of their poor performance (whatever the reason may be) during their undergraduate. PM me if you have any questions!",

During my third year, it started to grow on me to the point where campus started feeling like home. It may not be Harvard, Yale, or Princeton, but it is a good school where you can craft yourself into the person you want to be. The major downsides is that it's in the middle of nowhere. Sure, NYC and Boston are around two hour drives away from campus, but you're unlikely going have time to do that during the semester. I was on a committee working with faculty and administration to increase student well-being on campus, and the faculty and staff definitely does care about its students. One of my favorite things about UConn was the Jorgensen Center for Performing Arts. Students get free tickets to professional orchestral and ballet shows that happen weekly, along with other art events.",

I'm sure others have written better ones.\n\nI certainly wouldn't try to argue that where you go doesn't matter -- I think that's definitely wrong. Schools offer different quality instruction, can have greater resources for their students, better access to research opportunities, etc.  Grad rates track somewhat with school selectivity, but not perfectly - there are schools that do a better job providing support to their students.\n\nStudents also fit better in different schools -- some prefer smaller classes, or urban environments, or college towns, or diverse student bodies, etc. and being in a place where you can perform well certainly matters.\n\nWhat I would argue is that in most fields there are a lot of good options -- you don't need to just look at the top 10, or top 20, or top 50, or top 100 on some ranking you found. Even if you have the option to go to the highest ranked school in a field, the advantages it offers may not make up for it having a significantly higher cost or a bad personal fit compared to your other options.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ift5we/prestige\\_doesnt\\_matter\\_much\\_in\\_engineering/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ift5we/prestige_doesnt_matter_much_in_engineering/)",

One of the main problems with lower-ranked CS programs is that some aren't quite as rigorous in their standards for graduation. Some students seem to get a CS degree while actively avoiding taking classes that require significant programming, and at some colleges you can manage to game that. Like take the least technical classes allowed for the major, and look for profs who are known to focus on book knowledge and tests without requiring much coding. So those students graduate with very little actual programming ability. Tech interviews are basically designed to weed them out of hiring, because nobody wants to hire a CS major who can't program!

(Seriously.)\n\n\nPerhaps not for law and business schools, but for many programs--such as the humanities--it pays to go to an undergraduate program that also has a strong grad program. There is a bit of 'swapping' that occurs, where undergrads from one strong program are almost traded off to other programs, and they take other programs' students. This isn't to say great students from lesser known schools don't get in. They do. But it is harder for them than if they are at a strong program with a mentor who is at the top of the field.\n\nThe top history student at Berkeley is going to have an easier time getting into a good PhD program than the top history student at Carnegie Mellon. (They are both great schools, but in history Berkeley will be more prestigious, and a more desirable destination for the PhD.)",
