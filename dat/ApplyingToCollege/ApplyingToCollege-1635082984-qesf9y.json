A strong math grade would probably help as well. Beyond that it's a really soft science so there's not much more you can do. Idk if your school has a stock market club or something but that could be considered a related extra curricular. Other then that you're gonna need really good grades to get into NYU, good ECs, yadda yadda. Good luck!",

      "text": "Hi, I'm a university professor! The student who answered \"wealth\" is correct. But to give a different kind of answer, it isn't accurate to say that universities are looking for skills in their applicants in the same way that employers are looking for skills in their applicants. They're universities. They're teaching institutions. They will teach you the skills.\n\nThey are looking for students who will flourish in their campus communities. That might mean the student will delight her professors (or at least I've heard that so-called \"Academic A's\" are chosen in part to keep their professors happy), or will enrich the experiences of her fellow students, or will build on what she learns at NYU to start a business or make wonderful art or save the environment.\n\nYou're looking for different advice than what I'm about to give you, but be yourself. Don't try to be a cookie-cutter version of what you think an NYU student is. The way you're phrasing the question - not to be impolite! - the way you're phrasing the question suggests that you're going to guess wrong if you try to guess what fiction to say, because you don't have experience looking at building a freshman class from the university's perspective.",

      "text": "Rather than skills, I can say there are definite characteristics a large majority of NYU students share. Granted, these traits are probably seen in many students at other colleges as well, but I believe these traits are amplified here at NYU given our location and overall non-traditional college culture/experience. I'm guessing AO's know too because it can't be a coincidence all the students here share these traits.\n\nIndependence, self-reliance, ambition, self-motivation, mature, slight pretentiousness, and yes wealth hahah (no literally I haven't met a single financially struggling person yet here although I'm sure they exist)\n\nI'm in Stern and am naturally around mostly Stern students given shared classes and such and I'll just say that ambition and pretentiousness is heightened, and thus life skills to endure in this type of environment is needed. I've met some very lovely people yet there is a natural air of shared pretentiousness that I'm sure is inevitably present at other business schools as well. The culture at Stern is extremely pre-professional so you need to be ready to lose out on some of your youth and step into the adult world faster compared to other colleges (finance, the most popular major here, starts recruiting as soon as sophomore spring) :(",
