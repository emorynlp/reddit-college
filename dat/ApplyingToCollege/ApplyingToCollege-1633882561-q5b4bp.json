              "text": "I started writing my personal statement at the end of May\u2014didn\u2019t work on it every day, just had the thought in the back of my mind and would write down any one-liners I thought of. Mid-summer I started to pick up the pace; churned out about 5 different and complete essays. They all sucked, but I kept writing and writing and writing! Took a lot of waking up at 3AM struck with a genius idea and 2-hour non-stop writing sessions (and 2-hour editing sessions) to shape that 1,450 word piece of junk into my current essay! \n\nIn early July I started my supplementals. Made a different google doc for each school and just copied the prompts down. I aimed to work on one supplemental each day, even if I didn\u2019t finish on that assigned day, just so I wouldn\u2019t stagnate on any prompt. I had like 20 supps to write total and eventually after writing enough I got to a point where I could just word-vomit something and it would work (practice makes perfect!)\u2014also made Franken-essays from previous supplementals.\n\nI will say though, I was (and am) pretty neurotic about this entire process. My main motivation to get all of this done was my really complicated financial aid situation (need to file NCP waivers and get letters from teachers and everything), so I just wanted to get all of this out of the way so I could deal with that. You\u2019re still making good time! There\u2019s a while until Nov 1st deadlines and honestly it only really takes about a week to write a good essay (granted, for me it took 2 months to write all my bad essays before I got to my good one). \n\nSince we\u2019re no longer in the middle of summer, the best advice I can give for right now is time management and organization. Lay out everything you have to do. Don\u2019t feel like writing your PS? Procrastinate on that by writing supplementals. Don\u2019t feel like writing those? Fill out the common app. Don\u2019t feel like doing that? Fill out the FAFSA/CSS. Procrastinating on work by doing other work is basically how I get everything done. Also just living and breathing and thinking about this 24/7 (which isn\u2019t healthy, don\u2019t do this lol) has made me be more productive than usual. My cortisol levels are probably through the roof and I haven\u2019t had a restless night of sleep since august and I\u2019m developing an eye twitch, so there are cons to my uh\u2026 dedication! \n\nMake sure you\u2019re sleeping enough, eating enough, resting enough, exercising, relaxing. The best ideas come when your mind it at rest and can think about higher things than your basic needs (Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy might ring a bell (speaking of ringing bells, condition yourself into having a designated workspace and a separate goofing-off/free time/relaxing space\u2014will help you get in the groove.))\n\nOnce you submit, remember to keep track of your applicant portals and your login information too! \n\nBest of luck to you :D",

It\u2019s so much easier and less stressful on your mind to just think \u201calright I will dedicate one pomodoro session to Common App today\u201d rather then \u201cI will work on common app today\u201d.  The former will create all sorts of stressful questions in my mind like \u201cwill I have enough time for school work\u201d, \u201cwhat if it takes too long\u201d, \u201cI HAVE SO MANY ESSAYS TO DO\u201d. The latter gives me a sense of ease while also somewhat placating my stress on the upcoming deadlines cause I would think \u201cAlright it\u2019s just 25 minutes, I have more then enough time to do my schoolwork\u201d, \u201cI could do SO MUCH planning in 25 minutes\u201d, \u201cif I do one session a day, for a couple weeks, then I will get so much done!!!!\u201d Etc etc. Again, this might not work for everyone, but it really helped me \ud83d\udc4d.\n\n\nAlso if you don\u2019t know what pomodoro is: https://youtu.be/lyJqgL3Zp4E \n\nHe explains what the pomodoro technique is at 1:48",

I wasn\u2019t expecting for the questions to be similar or have the same topic, but I was trying to nail down my writing style and my writing voice. My parents and I visited each college that I was interested in at least twice (one of a few advantages of online learning), and I made sure to talk to my parents about our finances and the forms we\u2019d need for the FAFSA and CSS profile well in advance of October. By the time the Common App came around, I was ready, and I churned out about 20 essays in 6 days.\n\nThe hardest part has honestly been the scholarships- sometimes you need access to your admission portals (after the colleges download your application and look through it a bit), sometimes the questions are only accessible with a separate account, and sometimes the questions aren\u2019t released until the latter part of August at the earliest. I wasn\u2019t expecting for recommendations to be needed for those, or the extended word counts in association with my school schedule- but things have been working out all the same.\n\nSo to any juniors or RD seniors, organization and communication are the keys to success. If you start early, you have enough time to make as many edits or changes as you need to each part of the process. You won\u2019t know everything- you just need to know something. The rest will follow.\n\nGood luck, everyone!",
