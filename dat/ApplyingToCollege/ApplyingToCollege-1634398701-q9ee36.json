  "text": "College Application season is here and I feel limited because of my GPA. It hurts to even look at it because most of my friends are applying to schools like Brown, MIT, Carnegie-Mellon, U of Michigan, etc. Then there's me. My Cumulative GPA at the moment is 2.82. It was affected by my Freshman year and also my 11th-grade year. My 9th-grade year was very confusing, as most of my teachers were missing. We had substitutes teach us instead. Then towards the end of the year, most of my teachers had returned from their emergency leaves and began to teach the subjects with a completely different approach. It confused me.\n\nMy 11th grade year was probably the worst time of my life. It probably was for everyone. I barely had the chance to connect due to the circumstances that I faced throughout the pandemic year. The thing is, I have a heavy extracurricular list. What do you guys think I could do? \n\n**GPA:** 2.83, possibility to graduate with a 3.2-3.3 GPA\n\n**Extracurriculars:** \n\n**\\*** SGA Historian \n\n\\* 12th Grade Class Historian \n\n\\* Robotics Team Co-Captain and Project Manager \n\n\\* JROTC Executive Officer \n\n\\* Color Guard Commander and JPA Color Guard Commander \n\n\\* School Historian Club President \n\n\\* Executive Associate for RE Broker and Engineer \n\n\\* Junior Mentor for Non-Profit Organization called LPMP (Community Service)\n\nI only added this list here so I can get a general idea of how far I could go in the admissions process with it. I know that the GPA is already a huge deciding factor for me even getting into certain institutions. \n\n**PS:** I have used the Additional Information section to state my experience with COVID and explain any other mishaps that occurred within my HS career.",

      "text": ">I feel limited because of my GPA\n\nYou are, in fact, going to be limited by that GPA.  But that doesn't mean all hope is lost.  There are many, many schools that take students with a similar profile.\n\nWhat state are you in?  State schools where you're paying in-state tuition are often a compelling option.\n\nWill you have financial need?  What's your rough EFC?  If EFC is fairly low, then less selective private schools are an option.  Possibly LACs.  Though, these are often need-aware, so if you have high need it will make it somewhat more difficult for you to get in in the first place.",

      "text": "I would start by focusing on what your long term goals are, and look at what paths can get you there. \n\nI would guess engineering of some kind from your ECs - if that's the case I would look at the best ABET accredited options that you could reasonably get into and would be affordable. Options would vary depending on the state you lived in.\n\nIf those options aren't attractive, then consider community college and transferring - good grades at a community college can easily make up for high school grades that aren't great.\n\nAlso look at the entry options for your state flagship school - they might have guaranteed CC transfers or something like that.  In my state, Colorado school of mines offers a \"track to transfer\" program for students who they think could be a good fit but don't meet the admissions criteria - I don't think that kind of program is unique.",
