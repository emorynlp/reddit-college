  "text": "So I found out a week ago that I applied to the same ed school as a friend that is competitive as me part of top 10% as our graduating class. Do private schools like ivy or similarly competitive schools try to pick distinct people from each school? We are both asian male applying to same college of sciences so I\u2019m worried we are up against each other. i don\u2019t wanna compete against my friend :(\nCan we not both make it together?",

      "text": "Colleges don\u2019t necessarily have a strict quota on how many students are accepted from a given high school (although if your school normally sends 5 students to Harvard, it\u2019s unlikely that number will rise to 15 another year). But you guys will both be evaluated in a similar context, so if one person has significantly taken advantage of the available resources while the other person hasn\u2019t, that wouldn\u2019t reflect well on the latter person. In theory, it\u2019s perfectly possible that you guys both make it together.",

Colleges have a certain profile they want to form each year. They may have a certain set of students with slightly different traits they\u2019re going after each year. If one of you get in, it doesn\u2019t mean that the other isn\u2019t as worthy. It may be that what you share on your app/essays ends up being a better fit for what admissions people are looking for this year or vice versa.",
