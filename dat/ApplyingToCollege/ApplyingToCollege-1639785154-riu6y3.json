  "title:": "Should I take SAT or ACT or neither?",
  "text": "So I got my SAT scores from December and got a 1560 (770 english, 790 math). \n\nMy question is: should I retake the SAT, try ACT, or neither? \n\nHonestly, I'm not sure if I'll be able to improve my score that much since math was probably a dumb mistake and I have 0 reading comprehension skills. \n\nFor context, this was my first time taking the SAT, I'm currently a junior, I wanna go into a STEM related major (probably mechanical engineering), my gpa is good (4.0 as of now, but uhhh finals), I've taken 3 APs so far (all 5s in calc BC, physics 1, human geo).",
