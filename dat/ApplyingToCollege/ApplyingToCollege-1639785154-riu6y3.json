  "title:": "Should I take SAT or ACT or neither?",
  "text": "So I got my SAT scores from December and got a 1560 (770 english, 790 math). \n\nMy question is: should I retake the SAT, try ACT, or neither? \n\nHonestly, I'm not sure if I'll be able to improve my score that much since math was probably a dumb mistake and I have 0 reading comprehension skills. \n\nFor context, this was my first time taking the SAT, I'm currently a junior, I wanna go into a STEM related major (probably mechanical engineering), my gpa is good (4.0 as of now, but uhhh finals), I've taken 3 APs so far (all 5s in calc BC, physics 1, human geo).",

      "text": "People here aren't giving you a nuanced answer. So:\n\n* Where are you from- if the people from your school are bringing in 1580s, then a 1560 does not help you much. it also won't hurt you, but that's something to consider.\n* What race are you, what major are you, which geographic community are you from- not to call AA into account, but as per williamthereader's AMA, the communities you belong to play a part too. DMV, Bay Area, Connecticut, Massachusetts, etc probably require higher scores too. If you're international, look at India, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Singapore as countries that require higher scores in general. \n* Did you fuck up- are you confident of scoring 1580+ if you took again? There's absolutely zero point in retaking again if you are not.\n\neg: I'm 1560, from a school with a 1550 avg, and international, therefore if i had time i would retake the test, but i don't have another test window so I'm happy with what i have knowing it'll marginally help my app",
