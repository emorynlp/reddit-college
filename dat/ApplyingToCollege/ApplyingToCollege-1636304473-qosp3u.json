  "text": "Hi so I ED to a school but my mother got mad and wanted me to apply to more colleges but if I get into my ED , I obviously have to go there but she cried and shit saying she wants me to apply to more schools so I switched from ED to EA. NOW SHE\u2019S TELLING ME I COULD SWITCH BACK BECAUSE SHE DOESNT HAVE APPLICATION MONEY. If I switch back to ED would that be bad? At this point I don\u2019t care, I worked my ass off for my ED school for her to ruin it.",

But first, you and your mother have to talk candidly (know this is difficult) about this being a \"cast in concrete; once in a cycle\" decision. Neither of you want or need any more conflict! God Luck!",

Why not apply for RD for Emory and Cornell if you must and if money is an issue now? By then, your Mom may have changed her mind. You Do know which of you is going to college and needs to be content with it?!!!!",

But my other relatives wanted to send money for me to apply to schools near them (that\u2019s why my mom wanted me to switch to EA). The money in question haven\u2019t even reach to us yet and I switched to EA (stupid ik) so now she\u2019s telling me to switch back.\n\nWe don\u2019t mind paying the the tuition, but the fees at this very point is troubling for us because of where I live.",
