  "title:": "stop considering self-worth in terms of college acceptances",
  "text": "the title is directed towards myself because goddamn does it feel weird. i didn't care too much about getting into yale (although i do admit that i got somewhat attached to the school through filling out the application), and i expected the rejection. but seeing my classmates get accepted to schools of similar caliber makes me feel like i'm inferior to them, even when that isn't exactly true in terms of grades and motivation. \n\ni know that college admissions is also a game of luck, but it kind of hurts when the guy who sits next to me in chem and literally does not know what's going on bc he doesn't do any work got deferred from princeton while i got straight-up rejected, even when i know it's irrational and it has less to do with the school and more with the fact that amongst all this competitiveness amongst my peers (like *certain* classmates gloating about the schools they've gotten into to literally everyone, even one of my friends who was literally crying because of a rejection) and pressure from my family, i think i might've started measuring my self-worth in the colleges i can get into. \n\nalso a bit of a rant? but i got accepted by one of my safeties today (rutgers new brunswick!!) and it's my first college acceptance since i only applied to 2 schools EA and one school RD (this was the RD school, surprisingly), so even though it's one of my safeties, i'm happy about it and i wanted to tell someone. i can't tell my friends since i also have friends who applied there as safeties and they haven't gotten their results back yet, so i don't want to make them feel bad, so i tried telling my mom. she was simply annoyed that i called her in the middle of the day. and it doesn't feel very nice tbh. i wanted to celebrate something tiny (also the last day of school this semester!) but i don't feel like i can and that kinda sucks.\n\nrant over. sorry if it was kinda all over the place lol",
