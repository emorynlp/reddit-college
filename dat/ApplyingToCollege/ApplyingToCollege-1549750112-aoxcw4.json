  "title:": "Failed high school... today I got accepted to UMich :)",
  "text": "In high school I was failing for a few reasons. The major reason was laziness and not being motivated, combined with being treated for EDS and anorexia. I had a wide mixture of A\u2019s, B\u2019s, C\u2019s, D\u2019s, and F\u2019s on my transcript.\n\nI started community college last year (this year I\u2019m a sophomore) and developed a new attitude and new study habits and have been going to therapy for over a year now. I currently have a 3.83 GPA (no ACT/SAT score necessary for transfers) and got more involved in campus life (becoming a statistics tutor after quitting the idea that \u201cI suck at math\u201d and I joined film club).\n\nI applied to UMich as a reach last month and I heard back today!!! I GOT IN TO LSA!!!\n\nAfter my senior year of high school I was super depressed, I thought I was worthless and suuuuuch an idiot. I am very grateful for where I am today. Go blue \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\n\nedit/update: They gave me no financial aid (I'm OOS) so it would cost like $70k+/year including finding an apartment off campus (they don't have transfer housing). So, I won't go, but still good news to hear overall!\n\nAND r/chanceme told me multiple times that I wouldn't get accepted, so keep up the hope y'all.",

          "text": "Great question, the answer is hard to come up with. I'll do my best.\n\n1. I went through a weird existential phase in my teenage years, specifically 16-17. I basically thought \"nothing matters, why even try?\"\n\nI basically changed this idea to \"nothing matters, which is exactly why I should try.\"\n\nI would go on suicide-help boards a lot and would always say stuff like \"please hang in there\" and \"I believe in you\" to other people, but I would never say it to myself.\n\nSo, my method:\n\nTry to argue with yourself. This is going to sound STUPID, but bare with me... Whenever you ask a negative question or have a self-deprecating thought like \"why should I even try in school?\" or \"nobody cares what I do\" *ARGUE* with yourself. If it helps, imagine somebody you really care about saying these things -- what would you say to them? Doing this in the shower is great.\n\n2. I realized that I am never going to \"feel like it.\"\n\nGoing through college I've learned that *so* many students out there, like me, really have to push ourselves almost everyday to do work. Almost nobody has walked into one of my classes 100% prepared, 100% awake, and 100% excited to learn and work.\n\nI had to quit forcing myself to be happy 100% of the time and instead accept the idea that sometimes, I'm going to have to do things I don't want to do... but it's *TEMPORARY*. And though I may not want to do these things, I feel a sense of accomplishment when I even attempt to try.\n\nI cut out social media almost completely. I cannot even start to tell you how much this has helped me in two of my main issues in life: procrastination and self-deprecation. Without being able to scroll on social media apps on my phone (when I should be doing homework), I no longer give myself the opportunity to compare my grades, looks, and overall life to other people.\n\nThis is so important: STOP PUTTING PRESSURE ON YOURSELF. The more pressure you put on yourself, the worse the outcome will be.\n\nIt's like when you're exercising with weights, for example, never try to bench-press 100lbs if you're struggling with 5-pound dumbbells.\n\nSchedule things you want to do. I hate my alarm, but it's a life-saver. Set alarms for yourself to do things. Don't let the ringing stop until you decide to start. At the same time, don't overwork yourself. For me, I set alarms to remind myself to exercise. Some days, I only want to do a short walk for a few minutes, not a long jog, and that's fine.\n\nIf you've already started, you're winning.\n\nThere's a lot of pressure to be a perfect student in high school. It's crazy. But here's another thing: everyone has a different definition of perfect. For some, that's straight A's, for others it's more about being a well-rounded student, and for others it's about simply learning and gaining new experiences. Find out what you really want. In high school, I wasn't even focused on learning. I was focused on scores and grades and getting into that \"perfect\" university. Trying to follow this perfect imaginary version of myself in my head made me more depressed than ever. My imagination has no limits, but my real-life self does.\n\nSit back, take a breather. I can guarantee you that whoever your role models are, they too have been through failures and have spent years practicing and refining whatever it is they study or work on.\n\n\"It gets easier, but you gotta do it everyday. That's the hard part.\"\n\nFor motivation, it's like you're working a muscle. It's not going to one day just permanently appear when you wake up.\n\nFind things that make you feel good and keep you in a positive attitude. Listening to music when you wake up, making your favorite tea or coffee, *cleaning your room,* even dressing up in your favorite clothes or styling you hair can actually increase your confidence, and thus your motivation.\n\nIf you aren't motivated for school work, first find something that you are at least a little motivated to do. For me, there would be days where I would cook simple meals, study a new language on Duolingo, binge-watch a great TV show, read a cheesy teen fiction novel, doodle on paper, walk around my street and enjoy nature, and so forth.\n\nJust break away from your current routine.\n\n3. Therapy helped me. I used to hate the idea because 1) I thought I knew how to help myself, and 2) I hated the idea of people telling me what to do.\n\nI was wrong about both. Going to therapy my main concern was the same as yours. My first session I asked my therapist: how do I gain motivation and energy to do things?\n\nI gave you some advice that has helped me, but no person has the same journey. If you are struggling, get in contact with a professional who can really help you. I ended up crying week after week about problems that I didn't even know were bothering me and causing my lack of motivation and overall depression. I had to go through 3 therapists until I found the perfect fit for me, but it was absolutely worth it.\n\nHope at least some of that helped :)\n",

However, it depends and differs for everybody! If you feel like your circumstances helped you grow as a student or held you back, it would be important to mention -- but I'm sure your essays were already good especially if you already mentioned your jobs!",

The fact is that many people achieve high grades in community college, and I wouldn\u2019t expect that to be strong enough of a signal of academic competence to warrant admission to a selective school like UMich. Is there anything else on your record that makes you stand out?",

And IDK most people at my community college (in the San Francisco Bay Area) have an average GPA of 3.1, especially if they bombed high school (like me) and continued to not try. At least for me, it was not easy to get a 3.8 GPA -- when I called admissions on the phone (I did so for every competitive school I applied to, basically most of the ones I listed above) the majority said that if you have 3.5+ GPA, you are considered competitive. My friend TAG'd to UC Davis for some type of pre-med major (biology, probably) and got in despite having about a 3.2 or 3.3 GPA.\n\nHere are my full stats:\n\nCalifornia Community College student\n\nWhite / Female\n\nGPA: 3.83\n\nExtracurriculars: YouTube and freelance writing/editing\n\nJob/Work Experience: part-time teacher\n\nVolunteer/Community service: 5 years for hospice care, 2 years for food banks, 3 years tutoring, 1 year teacher's assist\n\nEssays: I went *really* in depth on \"why\" UMich, looking up specific classes and professors, disability and health services, internship and work-study opportunities, tutoring, library, school spirit, etc.\n\nI also talked about my mother having breast cancer and currently being on chemotherapy and how that has affected how much time I spend in my academic life and working outside of school, and also babysitting younger family members every week.",
