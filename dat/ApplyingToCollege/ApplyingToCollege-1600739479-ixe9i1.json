  "text": "This is such a stupidly specific problem, but I see it all the time when I\u2019m looking for essay writing advice.\n\nLike this girl had a video on the Stanford roommate essay, and it\u2019s literally her being like \u201coh this is such an easy essay, just start writing about your passions. Like in mine where I created an app at age 14 that helps people with Alzheimer\u2019s remember family members!\u201d\n\nLike whoop-dee-fucking do, however did you get into Stanford? You must have had a great essay, and I\u2019m sure it had nothing to do with your extracurricular activities. \n\nOr there\u2019s one about this guy whose friend got into Oxford and it\u2019s titled \u201cEVERY OXBRIDGE ESSAY NEEDS THIS.\u201d Well turns the fuck out that this guy\u2019s friend was the national science honor laureate of the entirety of Britain, served at a Pakistani hospital for 10 years, and might as well be fucking the queen herself with his 12 shiny Nobel Prizes. \n\nAnd then this guy who\u2019s giving the essay advice has the audacity to give advice like \u201cwell, make sure to have an opening sentence! Everyone needs an opening sentence in their essay to get into Oxbridge!\u201d \n\nMaybe, just maybe, your fun little super-friend got into Oxbridge because he was a combat medic in Vietnam or some shit, and not because he had an opening sentence!\n\n/rant over",

                  "text": "It's a hard truth, but I'd advise you to go through HS really trying to look into the details of your day-to-day life. Don't try to join \"all sorts of EC's\", instead focus in what your passionate about, and through that you'll find ways to impact other people. Jobs and family responsibilities are not an excuse for why you cannot commit to extracurriculars, even if they're small ones! Some colleges are just too competitive for that. A second point, no one knows your life better than you, so it's your responsibility to figure out a plan of action to get what's required. When you walked into HS you knew the destination after was college. Even if you were studying 40 hours a week on school (whihc I can almost guarantee you don't) and spending 10 hours at a job, some additional time for family, time for sleep, you would still have time to build up your EC's. \n\nAnd yes, in case you need to hear it again, your lack of EC's will always be your own fault. Your decisions, actions, and choices make impacts on your life whether you like it or not.",

I understand how you feel about home affairs, so I'd suggest to describe the personal load you overcame at home on your application - so they don't try to bias you over EC's. Figure skating and snowboarding sound like social hobbies rather than impactful extracurriculars, unless you're competitive in them.\n\nI hope my message didn't come off as you need 600 EC's, honestly 1-2 great ones is what matters. No one cares if you were a member in 60 different clubs, but being a leader and making an impact in other peoples lives in a few will make you stand out.\n\nAlso, I want to shoe in that there's no shame in taking a gap year. I know many successful people who took one, and if you need something to expand your interests and seek to improve a part of your application I highly suggest it.",

          "text": "There's a little bit of nuance to it, though you're entirely right about the professional, academic writing bit.  \n\nI'm going to Oxford, and the UK personal statements are so much easier than the US ones. There's only 1 that goes to every school, and it's 500 words. But that does mean you end up putting some more effort into it so it'll be as good as possible. So in that sense the standards are a bit higher - this is all they have to distinguish students with similar grades and probably similar ecs, and there's no \"why this school\" fluff.   \n\nThe big difference as you say is that you're not talking about your lifelong love for piano, unless you're a music student. Probably exceptions apply if you're at a national level or something. This is great because it means, especially for Oxbridge, you focus on the subject itself, what you've read etc. and can end up with an interesting bit of writing that blends your mundane personal experiences with what actually matters - your interest in the subject - in a cool way.  \n\nThe other bit of nuance is that Oxford and Cambridge weigh personal statements less than most other schools because they have interviews and specific 'exclusive' tests for every student - so the main goal of your ps is actually to get an interview and that should be easy enough if your assessment goes well. However I've heard from tutors that personal statements 'not sounding like someone they wanted to teach' has been a factor in admissions.",

              "text": "Yeah, I also attend one of Oxbridge and have chatted to the admissions groups at a lot of colleges about what they look for in applicants, how they run the season, what the interviews are like from their perspective, and what admissions looks like behind closed doors. They've all said that they really don't weight the PS at all. It's a chance to show that you're invested in your subject, e.g. have read books about it, have done competitions, have done small, local science fairs, wrote an essay for a school competition etc. It's also a chance to show that you can write with a professional tone and without errors. If you're applying for math then you probably should never discuss your achievements in piano, unless you had some specific career goal that linked math and music. And it's true that anything you say in the PS can be examined at length, so if you say you've read a book, you'd better have read that book and be able to hold an intelligent conversation on it!\n\nHow we assess whether a person is \"someone we want to teach\" is very complicated and often comes down to interviews more than the PS, but a heavy dose of \"understanding your limits\" and \"being prepared to change opinions in light of new information\" is a big part of it.",

These \u201cneed blind\u201d universities are so obviously not as need blind as they claim to be, and money is just as valuable as being a genius for them. Don\u2019t act like meritocracy is a system slightly unfair that can be beated with \u201chard work\u201d, because in reality it\u2019s rooted on inequality and the fact that you can\u2019t see that speaks volumes of your own social class; the same place where these ideologies you so strongly support come from.",

                          "text": "So your point is those kids who had great opportunities weren't preparing for their futures, but you were? I never said money doesn't give or take opportunities from you. I never said there wasn't inequality. I never said that money doesn't make things easier. You're putting words in my mouth based off of your perception of people who you believe have the same views as me. Let me be clear with you - not everyone at the top came from privilege or money. What I said was no one is stopping you from being smart or working hard. Let me reiterate the people at the top that I know of were not rich in the slightest, they started thinking ahead a lot earlier than most, made a plan to achieve what they needed, sought opportunities, and became the best in our high school.\n\nLet's start at the base of your new comment - I agree with you money DOES make things easier. I don't want to overlook that. However, if you are spending all your time equating your lack of money to some random kid born rich you will never be able to get those higher opportunities, that's a toxic mindset. My bubble is not full of snotty rich kids, we had no advantages, the same with many of the mentors I vibe with who became successful despite where they started. The fact is we didn't let our circumstances define us, we fought to take opportunities, and we're making it. I don't know the scope of what you're going through as an international student, and I never want to pretend that I do, in fact it's probably a lot tougher on you, and no one on reddit knows your individual life better than you, but my point is to never enter a self-defeating mindset because you are just as capable of fighting for what you want in life and reaching your potential.",

No comment on the oxbridge acceptance, but for Stanford where the admissions procedures can be found online, it is very obvious that you will not be accepted off of great ecs and great stats. Maybe EXTREME published in top-10 journal ecs or competed in IMO stats, but otherwise, you will also need the essays to get great personal character and intellectual vitality scores. If these ppl who are accepted have essays thjat are bad and they give bad advice, just remember that this isn't a perfect system and that the AO perhaps saw something in this applicant that you didn't get the chance to see.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni do agree with the premise that just because u are accepted somewhere doesnt make u an expert on how to write a great essay or get into that same place, though.",

The essay is important to admissions because it's the biggest injection of subjectivity into the process and helps cover the fact that in competitive admissions decisions are basically just being pulled out of asses.  \n  \nThat's why you can never get a solid, consistent answer on what makes a good answer, because the most important quality in an essay is whether or not the AOs want to use it to justify admission or justify rejection.",

      "text": "Love this! People tend to exaggerate the importance of one thing or another. One thing for sure you are better off working hard on things you are good at instead of watching advice videos. There are a few things to keep in mind\n\n1. The process is random and subjective - an admission officer might like your name, your EC or your opening sentence for that matter but noone knows what really got you into this college\n2. If you are a gold medalist at IMO, doing some research work which is getting recognition around the world or simply top student at a very competitive school the chances are people won't care about your essays no matter they tell you. \n3. MIT and Caltech are fighting for IMO medalists, other schools are looking for top athletes, others for musicians or student leaders - do you think if you dedicated 5-6 years of your life to solving math problems or playing certain sport at very high level you can be an amazing writer? It happens but very unlikely\n4. Yes essays are important but don't think you can get into a college just because of your essay. Same goes for extracurriculars, recommendation letters etc. It is usually a combination of things plus a lot of luck.\n5. Repeat no1 the process is random so unless you are a world class in something you need many things going your way to get into a top college these days...",

Like I'm never getting into Stanford with my kind of profile! Mine is so below average that even an Nobel Literature Prize winning essay won't be able to get my imperfect arse into Stanford.(even though with an actual Nobel prize, I probably won't have to worry about this whole reddit thread to begin with)",

That's where most of the greatest EC's I've seen come from.  I emphasize with the fact you have to take care of your brother with specials needs, seriously, not a lot of people are going through that, but that's NOT a weakness, it is a strength that makes you a stronger person than the average high schooler.  You seem to be confusing me breaking down weak mentalities with having a bad week, I'm happy this thread was created otherwise people wouldn't be getting exposed. I'd suggest you take time to meditate and think about what you can be doing to support more people in your free time, and through that perhaps you'll find a \"fancy\" EC.",
