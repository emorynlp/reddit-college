  "text": "i\u2019m considering adding some more schools to my list and johns hopkins came to mind. they\u2019re a very prestigious school, relatively close to home(NJ), have ED2(in case i get deferred by georgetown), and are cheaper than the other t10s. however, they\u2019re mostly known for STEM and medicine related fields, and i plan to major in either international business or economics. i\u2019ve heard JHU is pretty solid for undergrad business majors, but they\u2019re unranked. another school that came to mind is florida warrington, it\u2019s relatively cheap and a very good program for undergrad business. are these two good options for me, judging by my interests, or should i consider other schools?",

      "text": "JHU is great! Just a great school all around! Good for STEM and Liberal arts majors! But I will say JHU is best for engineers. Its definitely a \"research\" based school. But their Lib programs are just as good! They just sorta cater to us STEM students a bit. But I'm purely speaking word of mouth.  I obviously have not attended college yet, so I wouldn't personally know. But I have been doing a lot of research on JHU latley because it is one of my top choices!",
