  "text": "Hope everyone is doing well during these stressful times. \n\nI am running low on potential honors awards to list. Thus, I was wondering if I could mention the following; I am a semi finalist in an ongoing scholarship to study in the USA (Intl student) - ongoing meaning that I will hear their final decision in January. \n\nI am wondering if it would be strange to mention this in my honors section?\n\nTLDR; would colleges find it odd that I am flexing a (potential) college scholarship from another organization : ) \n\n- keep in mind, I need to fill up this last spot with something.",
