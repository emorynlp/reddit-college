  "text": "Hey guys. So im from an international country that is listed in the \u201climited interviews category on Harvard\u2019s website.\u201d I have not yet received an interview and I do not know if I will due to only 1 student a year being accepted from my country. \n\nI know there are three countries listed as applicant initiated interviews for Harvard (france, jordan and another). I know two harvard graduates that are from my country and residing here. \n\nWould it be appropriate to email them to inquire about an interview opportunity?",
