      "text": "it wouldnt look *bad* unless you say like you spent your entire life studying for usaco just to reach silver \n\nthe whole reason the top cs colleges would want like gold or plat is because it is difficult and takes time, theres no like shortcut easy prestigious achievement \n\nif you plan on majoring in cs i believe it's worth the not very big effort to get silver, and still worth it to try a decent bit for gold as the time spent will be far from wasted",
