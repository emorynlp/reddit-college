Occasionally, you\u2019ll meet someone who opposes your views, and it\u2019s kinda annoying but nothing dangerous really ever happens. \n\nHong Kong is quite the international city. Although we are mostly Asian over here, the city is quite welcoming as a whole, esp in Hong Kong island, where foreigners are super common. I myself am an Asian American who grew up in HK, and have tons of friends from the states living here as well",
