  "title:": "Reminder to ED Accepted Students",
  "text": "First off, massive congratulations to all of you who got accepted ED. You worked hard, proved yourselves, and deserve your seats. \n\nI just wanted to give you all a kind and gentle reminder to withdraw other applications so that other kids have a fair chance.\n\nI know you must be in a joyous mood and I have no intention to disturb you. \nMaybe you might withdraw apps right away or maybe you might do it some days later. No issues with that but please please dont forget to do it.\n\nI dont want to offend anyone by posting this but just want to give a friendly reminder. \n\nThank you for listening and Congrats to the accepted once again!\n\nEdit: Thank you for the love and support everyone.\nPlease do not withdraw unless you've got your desired financial aid package.",

It's my top college and I really love it even though it isn't an Ivy or anything. I got in with a good scholarship in excited about it, but I wonder if it's too early to respond to acceptances yet. Should I wait longer to say something? I don't want to apply to a bunch of colleges I won't go to for the post above though",
