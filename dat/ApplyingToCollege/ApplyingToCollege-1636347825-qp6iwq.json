Some schools have made efforts, or even commitments, to 50:50 admissions in STEM fields.\n\nThis almost always results in higher female admission rates based on the number of applications.\n\nCMU had a 23.4% F admission rate vs. 13.3% M last year.  Enrollment was 817F/815M so they were good/lucky.",
