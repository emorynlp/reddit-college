  "text": "A couple of the schools that I\u2019m applying to require you to submit an academic paper you wrote. The one that I want to submit is about the book \u201cLet the Great World Spin.\u201d For those of you who haven\u2019t read it, it contains a lot of mature subjects such as drug use, prostitution, and sexual references. I want to submit this essay because my teacher said it was the best work I did all year, but I don\u2019t know if it is appropriate for a college application. Any thoughts?",
