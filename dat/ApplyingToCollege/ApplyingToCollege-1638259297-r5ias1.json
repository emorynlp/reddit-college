  "text": "I submitted my application while the website was having trouble with the increased traffic, and it turns out that the PIQs didn't completely save the formatting edits that I made to it. This made one of my PIQs become formatted like\n\n    paragraph 1\n    paragraph 2\n\nrather than with a space inbetween\n\n    paragraph 1\n    \n    paragraph 2\nThis probably won't affect my application at all, but I'd really like some reassurance right now. I'm really stressing out over every little thing. Thank you in advance!",
