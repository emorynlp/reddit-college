  "text": "Just had my interview for Penn. Probably worst interview of my life. The guy had such a thick accent that I couldn\u2019t understand what he said half of the time. On top of that his audio quality was terrible and I\u2019m pretty sure he had no idea what he was doing, asking me about my stats in school and even not knowing what the IB is. He asked me what other schools I applied to and I said only UPenn for ED. He asked me where I am applying after so I was honest and said NYU. Right after that he said he never studied at nyu and just partied all the time. Weirdest experience ever.\nHow much do you guys think this will affect my application? And will UPenn know how inexperienced this guy was?\n\nEdit: I also said Umich and other schools for my RD. Which he responded with \u201cwhy not Harvard or Yale?\u201d Which I found to be a weird statement to make seeing that he is representing Penn but I still responded saying that I saw value in the social aspect of Penn. But the biggest red flag was that he wasn\u2019t even that familiar with the SAT(asking for stats was weird enough), when I told him my score he asked for the percentile. I don\u2019t know who you are, but there\u2019s not good answer to that question, you either sound like a douche bag or an idiot.",

      "text": "As a Penn alum and interviewer I assure you that it won't matter. You can see if the students you interviewed get admitted and so far none of the admissions for students I've spoken to seem correlated to my experience interviewing them or my writeups for them. \n\nHonestly I think it's just a way for Penn to sell the school and for alumni to feel like they're \"contributing\" by getting the chance to talk about themselves (and LOL at that \"never studied at NYU\" comment?) Also...he shouldn't have asked you about where else you were applying, that's against our guidelines. I'm sure you did fine!",

I know one friend in particular that does give interviews and they are wonderful representatives.  If you get a review form, I hope you fill it out honestly and let the admissions people know at some point (especially after the process).",
