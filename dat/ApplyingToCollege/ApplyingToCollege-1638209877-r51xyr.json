Now that number most likely isn't accurate either considering the census was 4% of the sub and biased sampling wise, but even with that the number is going to fall way below 80%.  \n\n\nEither way it's pretty pretentious to assume that people here are all rich and wealthy who are hypocritically complaining about the elite kids going to these schools, so let's not do that",

One important thing to note is that of those over 250k, it's pretty likely that they live in super high cost of living places like the Bay Area where it really isn't as insane as the numbers might seem. Again, not poor, but certainly not elite by any means.  \n\n\nRegardless, is it really a surprise that the demographics of those most involved in this subreddit would also be relatively well off? It's pretty well known that those from lesser economic backgrounds usually don't shoot for top schools in the same proportion that those of higher percentiles do, or are able to spend as much time on the process. So I'd say that a heavy majority of those that are *active* in this sub most likely are, but even that top 20% isn't as insane it's perceived on paper within their context.",
