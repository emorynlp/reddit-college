  "text": "I'm a junior but my school (it's international but a US school and I'm a US citizen). I'm interested in political science and want to know if there are any good extracurricular for applying to top colleges. there are virtually no work opportunities for teenagers here and because my school is so small, there are no clubs that are like organizations (MUN, stuff like that). any advice? My stats are pretty good (gpa and test scores) so I just want to round out my application.\n\nedit: forgot to mention that my school has a hybrid schedule for COVID stuff. only on campus twice a week and no options for clubs. it really sucks and I don't think it will change anytime soon",

          "text": "well these days politics really does everything. I strongly dislike a lot about the current political system in the US and think that it's important to understand the world around us. I would focus more about world politics than only US. and random YouTube videos about political theory really interest me. i think studying politics can also help with understanding of history (which I absolutely love but don't see myself majoring in it) and economics. but psychology is really interesting too I just don't think I would personally want to pursue that / have an occupation in that field",

If you are able to travel to the US/out of Egypt for the summer, you might be able to do something substantive like a summer program related to political science. You might also try googling around for remote or online political science opportunities, similar to citizen science volunteering. For example: https://www.speakeasypolitical.com/10-impactful-and-important-virtual-volunteer-opportunities/.",
