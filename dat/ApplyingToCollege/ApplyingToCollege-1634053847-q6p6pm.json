  "text": "i\u2019m currently a college freshman at a top 20. college admissions were stressful, especially being surrounded by so many people who feel more qualified than you. \n\n once you get to school, it becomes so much worse. suddenly, every one around you has had incredible internships and has done research and is currently curing cancer. the imposter syndrome is real. \n\n please keep in mind while you\u2019re applying that it doesn\u2019t end once you get accepted and pay your enrollment deposit. don\u2019t sign up for something you aren\u2019t sure if you can handle. \n\nwishing you all the best of luck <3",

      "text": "I don't mean this as an invalidation of OP's experience, but as someone who also went to a T20, this is partly a mentality issue. When you go to a T20 or even T40, you will be surrounded by very high achieving people. I had a lot of friends, including my ex, who had a similar experience. They were top of their class in high school and were suddenly middle of the road students at an Ivy. Much of their self-definition had been founded on success, and once that was gone, they felt lost. No matter how hard they tried at schoolwork, they still got median and it tore them up because enjoying the material and being a decent student at a top-tier school wasn't enough. Remember that even if you're a small fish amongst big fish in a small pond, that small pond is some of the most rarified water around.\n\nWhat OP also touches on tangentially is the importance of finding things you love. I hope you're in college and in a particular major or club for the love of the game. If you look at your peers as points of comparison or people to be competed against, college will turn into another crappy rat race. And even if you're near the top of the heap, you're still going to look at the people above you and wish you were them. I was a pre-med majoring in engineering, and both fields had plenty of people who were constantly looking at medians while missing the sheer coolness of the opportunities around them. Work hard and do things that make you happy and enrich you as a person. College will be a blast",

      "text": "As a jaded junior with three years' worth of additional life perspective at a T15 I would advise you to *stop giving a fuck* honestly. Three of my friends are multiple time AIME qualifiers, another literally made IBO and two more scored 520+ on the MCAT as a freshman. Meanwhile I had to take the SAT thrice, the Math 2 subject test twice, got fucked on the AMC 12 and got B's in math + less than great scores in APs.\n\nI felt like dogshit for a couple months realizing they'd done far more than I could until I realized there was no point. This world is big enough and you can live a sustainable lifestyle as long as you try. \n\nYou need to realize they don't want the same things you do anymore, or at least most of them. You aren't competing with them, nor do they want to compete with you tbh. They might even be interested in meeting people who aren't academic giga chad sigma grindsetters putting forward the curated version of themselves all the time. People here from all backgrounds roll their eyes if someone goes off about themselves. \n\nInstead, start making those connections because it could translate to a referral to a nice job or other opportunity one day and stop subconsciously seeing them as your enemy. These people are also just plain interesting to sit down and chat with. I love learning about people and I'm sure you do too!\n\nLook at it this way: you can finally take classes you enjoy at a top university and live on your own. Sounds like a great experience to me. If you keep fixating on what others are doing then you will always feel like you can't keep up on the treadmill. As long as you're happy with yourself then you've completed your objective. That's a much healthier way to look at things. You worked your ass off for this opportunity so don't squander it by worrying about how others around you are using it. \n\nAnd you're not condemned to some high powered career or professional school after graduating just because you've been on this path your whole life. And you aren't wrong to want to veer off of it.\n\nOne of my friends' cousins was your stereotypical Cal EECS kid gunning for FAANG until he thought about this question, decided his answer to all of these societal dick-measuring questions about social hierarchy, salary and occupational prestige was \"fuck it\" and went rogue. Switched his major to Engineering Physics, got off the Leetcode grind and lived life for his last two years of college. Now he's in the Midwest working at a small company & chasing tornadoes on the side living his dream. Makes the least money by far out of my college grad friends (just enough for him to pursue his passions) but most definitely the happiest person out of anyone I know. Another friend was a top student in HS w/ acceptance to Stanford but dropped the idea of college to join the California Air National Guard. He destroyed the ASVAB and flight training, gets to fly fighter jets for a living and has become one of the most interesting people I've ever had the pleasure of hanging out with. I can't say the same about all of the tech yuppies I've met",

Yeah content is hard but all the resources kind of make it more chill. Of course every college has a different culture so obviously research what it likes before hand, but I honestly expected more crying and stress than what I have. It's a nice \"in between\" type of stress. Not every T20 is the same though, so do research and good luck \u2764\ufe0f",

People will envy you and try to get closer to you, then when you fail they're gonna disappear. Don't let anyone expect anything from you. We're all going to die anyways. This will seem so silly while you're sitting on your death bed. Try your best and know there will always be someone better. That's the best mentality. If you are really passionate you might become the best, or you are passionate but still suck! We all weren't made to be the best that's what makes us unique.
