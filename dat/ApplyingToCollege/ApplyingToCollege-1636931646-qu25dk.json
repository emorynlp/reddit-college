  "text": "Hi okay so basically I was talking to my counselor at school and we realized that I had entered in a course that isn't dual credit as dual credit. I had asked him to look over my application several times but he just glanced at it in front of me and said that I get stressed out over little things too often. \n\nAfter I found out that it's not a dual credit course and that I was misinformed, I asked him if I should email the colleges and how I should let them know that I found out about my course almost 2 weeks after submitting the application that the class I'm taking next semester isn't dual credit. \n\nHe literally just told me not to worry about it or send any emails because the admissions officers don't care about one misreported class. At first that put me at ease, but his nonchalance about the whole admission process is making me nervous. Honestly, I don't know if I should take any of his advice because he hasn't been that helpful. What should I do??",
