  "text": "my custodial parent lives in maryland, whereas my non-custodial parent lives in Virginia. my NCP does not claim me as a dependent, they\u2019ve lived in Virginia for 7+ years, and I visit every 2 weeks. \n\n1) Should I fill out the in-state portion of the University of Virginia common app with the non-custodial parents information?\n2) Am I allowed to claim in-state tuition for schools in maryland and virginia or will this raise a red flag? \n3) What happens if I\u2019m \u201crejected\u201d from in-state tuition\u2014will they still review my application like normal as an out of state student? \n\nWilliam & Mary has made it pretty clear that it\u2019s fine to apply for in-state Virginia, but I haven\u2019t found any direct information about the University of Virginia\u2019s policy for divorced parents in different states. I tried emailing them but they haven\u2019t replied and i want to submit UVA\u2019s common app today ahahaha\n\nthank you so much for any help im dying",
