  "text": "I'm hard struggling to write the supplemental for UW Madison. I've spent over an hour scouring the website, but its hard to find anything. What else am I supposed to say other than its high ranking and I like the location? The website info is very vague for me and most of the stuff I was able to write could easily be applicable to other colleges.",

      "text": "I\u2019ll give you two things not to talk about:\n1) high ranking and 2) location. \nThe school already knows these things. What they are really asking you is: Why you, @ascaraa, at UW Madison? They are trying to craft a class. Who will you be on campus? Is there a club or class they have that relates to what you\u2019ve done or your interests? Usually the class listings and activities can be found online somewhere. Is there a student you can talk to about what it\u2019s like there? Help the admissions officers visualize you. Who will you be and why should they give you a spot? Good luck to you!",

You need to show them why you would be a good fit for them and why they would be a good fit for you. Hope this helps!",

      "text": "What extracurriculars are you interested in?? Find the clubs from the list provided on their website which resonate with your EC interests and write about how you'll participate in them. Maybe you're into music and maybe they have a whole building dedicated to music. Write how you'll take advantage of that (especially mention the name of the building). Write about something you really liked about their students. This one could sound a bit generic but... Eh, that much is fine. Also, if they have a motto or highly respected Honor code... Talking about that is a good idea.",
