      "text": "Colleges aren't looking for unique topics, we're looking for differing perspectives. All of the following have \"being an introvert\" as the topic, but show very different perspectives:\n- introvert who finds comfort in listening to others and picking up more life perspectives\n- introvert who found their voice through theater because it lets them be someone else\n- introvert who wishes they felt more comfortable being their introverted self\n- introvert who wishes they were a more extroverted version of themselves\n- etc etc etc\n\nAnd then that will all be paired with your extracurriculars, letters of rec, additional essays, and everything else to create a more full picture.",
