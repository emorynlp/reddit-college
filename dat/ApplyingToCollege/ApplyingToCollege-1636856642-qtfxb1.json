  "text": "i know this probably sounds so stupid but sending emails makes me so anxious and i\u2019ve just never liked them. i got an email from my columbia interviewer asking to schedule our meeting and i just have no idea how to respond and don\u2019t want to say anything that would possibly offend him. should i refer to him by his first name? would it look bad if i ask to schedule my interview a week from today even though i have a valid reason not to (school\u2019s device-free retreat)?",

      "text": "1. Interviewers are human too! They\u2019re not going to be nitpicking your email unless you send something really offensive.\n2. I would address them using Ms. or Mr. if it is an alumni interview \n3. It\u2019s generally better to schedule your interview sooner rather than later, but a week later isn\u2019t too bad. In your case you could even tell him that your school is doing a device-free retreat if you wanted.",
