  "text": "Hey everyone! I was wondering what a competitive Canadian average looks like for top 20/30 schools in the US. I had a 94.5 in gr 9, 90.2 in gr 10, 95.9 in gr 11and 95.8 for my midterms in gr 12. Also, will a 78% in visual arts in grade 10 impact my chances severely if I'm applying to engineering?",

      "text": "Idrk but I'd gauge it based on Canadian unis. Waterloo CS has a similar acceptance rate to most T20s and they were accepting roughly 97+. But then again, Waterloo values grades a lot more than anything else. \n\nmaybe convert to a 4.0 where the only 3.0 would be the 78? Our school says 4.0 is 80-100.",
