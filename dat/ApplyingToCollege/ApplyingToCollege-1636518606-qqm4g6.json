  "text": "I got 2 colleges mixed up bc of the name and did so for like 2 years. Case Western Reserve and West Point. I think it's because they both have west in the name and West Point is for Army recruits and Case Western Reserve sounds like a school where you're also a reserve for the army. Maybe I'm the only one with this particular instance, but are there any other colleges like that?",
