You could be proactive in the clubs and other community activities where you could meet other people and largen your people network and who knows, maybe somebody will offer you some kind of intership opportunity. And plus if you choose to go to graduate school, it really won't matter which school you came out of, just what you did at your own school during your undergraduate years.",
