  "text": "just thinking ab nyu ed on wed and telling myself ill get rejected. it will be devistating despite me knowing i wont get in. there\u2019s something that really hits you where it hurts about actually seeing the rejection or deferral letter vs just telling yourself you wont get in but having no definitive proof. \ni can only tell myself so many times that wherever i end up its meant to be and if i dont get accepted to nyu then its because i dont belong there but it wont stop me from being sad over it for a little bit :,)",
