  "text": "After submitting my application I noticed that at the end of my last essay I used two periods instead of one behind the last sentence \u201clike this..\u201d I started freaking out and to be honest I still kind of am lol. Would this affect my chances of admission at all? Or am I just overreacting? Either way that was a pretty stupid mistake I made.",
