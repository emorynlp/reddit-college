      "text": "**Get a summer job!**\n\nColleges really like seeing that applicants had jobs. No, the job doesn't need to be an internship with Stanford, and no, the job doesn't need to be a software development position with Microsoft. A simple \"teen job\" like being a lifeguard or being a waiter or mowing lawns shows character and that you're willing to spend your free time that you'd probably rather be using to play video games or hang out with friends to instead support yourself financially and take the initiative to be an independent person.\n\nThere's a reason that a lot of colleges take into consideration an applicant's work experience when reading applications. For example, looking at Yale's Common Data Set on Page 8: they consider work experience as one of their admissions factors.\n\n[https://oir.yale.edu/sites/default/files/cds\\_2020-2021\\_yale\\_vf\\_030521.pdf](https://oir.yale.edu/sites/default/files/cds_2020-2021_yale_vf_030521.pdf)\n\nAlso, who doesn't like a little extra spending $$ to go to the movies with friends or something like that? ;)\n\n\\-----\n\nBest of luck. :)",

              "text": "Yes. Look into your local youth center/county/community center etc and see if they offer any STEM-related summer camps/programs for elementary schoolers.\n\nEmail the coordinators and see if they need any volunteers or camp counselors; I'm sure they'd love the help especially given the toll that COVID-19 has had on the availability of eager volunteers.\n\nVolunteering/being a Camp Counselor at a children's CS/STEM summer program is a great EC because it combines:\n\na) an interest in STEM/CS\n\nb) volunteer work\n\nc) leadership\n\n[https://www.kidztopros.com/summer-camps](https://www.kidztopros.com/summer-camps)\n\n\\^That's an example of a program just so you can get an idea of what to expect; there's a lot of similar programs across the USA because parents like sending their kids to educational camps during the summer, so there should be one in your area unless you live in rural North Dakota or something.",
