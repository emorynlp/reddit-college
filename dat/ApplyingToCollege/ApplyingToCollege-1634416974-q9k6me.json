  "text": "Hello! I've played viola for \\~6 yrs so far and am interested in continuing with it in college, although I'm probably not going to major in music. I've heard that a lot of the top colleges have quite good orchestras but I've also heard that some others such as UChicago don't (although I'm not sure how accurate that is) - I was wondering if anyone knows 1) top colleges that have reputations of slightly weaker orchestras and 2) lesser-known colleges that have good orchestras.  Also, I've heard that playing in a city's orchestra is an option in some places so if anyone has any experiences with that, I'd love to hear them!",

      "text": "I played viola too! Actually my parents made me bring it to college even though I had no intention of joining the orchestra. Someone spotted it as I was moving in and told me the orchestra needed violists so I ended up joining for all four years. This was at a liberal arts school. Great but not exactly competitive orchestra.",

      "text": "Hey! I\u2019m a current music major and I play violin. I\u2019d love to give you some specific advice but I\u2019d rather the discussion be over pm because (if you\u2019re comfortable) I\u2019d like to share my location and school + other slightly more  personal info and get yours. Depending on the area I may know specific schools/ profs or may not, but either way I can definitely help you with all the ins and outs of applying for music.\n\nOne thing you should keep in mind is that many schools will require you to either major or minor in music to get on the orchestra, which means you would have to pass an audition. That can be daunting but I think you can do it. Depends on your level and what rep you can comfortably play. I can give you some tips on how to prep for said auditions.  Again, shoot me a pm.",
