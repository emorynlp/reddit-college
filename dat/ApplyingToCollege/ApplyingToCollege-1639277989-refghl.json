          "text": "Not OP but i go here -\n\nEating clubs are pretty clique-y, and that occurs naturally since friend/student groups will probably join the same club. IE sports teams will often join together, dance groups, etc. Some eating clubs you have to bicker (rush) to get in and can be pretty exclusive, and i\u2019ve felt that students are pressured to be social climbers. \n\nBut in general i don\u2019t think u should take them too seriously. Eating clubs are places to eat and party. They\u2019re definitely safer than other college parties/frat parties. They\u2019re places to build real connections and community. Just ignore all the fluff and focus on making good friends and having fun, and eating clubs are one of many great way to do that.",
