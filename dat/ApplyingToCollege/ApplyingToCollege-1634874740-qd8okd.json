  "text": "I\u2019m currently in high school and live in Texas. I am interested in the field of cybersecurity (probably to do something like consulting). \n\nI hear some good things about utsa cyber security. I\u2019m not too familiar with it but, is Penn State University worth it for its cybersecurity (out of state)? \n\nThese 2 are my main considerations, with my weighted GPA being around 4.87 and 1280 SAT. Feel free to recommend any other public colleges if you think it\u2019s better for me.",
