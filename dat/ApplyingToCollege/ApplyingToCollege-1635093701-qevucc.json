  "text": "Hi, I took online courses in mathematics and computer science related topics, and I was going to add them to my extracurriculars section, but I realized that I never bought the ones where they give me certificate, and if the universities did ask me to prove that I took those courses, it might be hard for me to prove for some of them...\n\nAnyone with similar situations or any comments?\n\nThanks",
