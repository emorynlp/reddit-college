  "text": "Hi! I know a bunch of colleges make decisions on a rolling basis (Pitt, UMN, etc), and generally they disclose on their website how long after applying you should expect a decision. I also know that some of these schools don\u2019t start excepting students until a certain date (Penn State, MSU, etc), but generally that isn\u2019t disclosed on the website. I know Pitt and UMN have started accepting students, but are there other schools that have already started releasing decisions (or when they will)? Thanks!",
