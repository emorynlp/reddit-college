      "text": "I had roughly 30 per week, but it'd fluctuate a lot.\n\nHarder weeks I had work after school for 3 days, 5 hours each. That's roughly 15 right there. Sunday was a full 8 hour day, so 23. Discounting practicing for debate, crafting the case, perfecting the case, blah blah blah, a tournament on Saturday might be 10ish hours. That's 33 EC hours w/o accounting for the insane amount of time and effort just for making the debate cases.\n\nEasier weeks was 23 for work and I just wouldn't do debate, so it'd just be 23. This is why quality matters. I had 2 ECs for my entire high school career, but damn did it take a lot of time. 21 hours would seem fine, imo.",
