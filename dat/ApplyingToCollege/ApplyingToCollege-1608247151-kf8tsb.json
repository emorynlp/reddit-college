  "title:": "(Wholesome) My 4th-grade teacher helped me get into Stanford University",
  "text": "I emailed my 4th-grade teacher this past Monday and she surprised me at my high school. When I saw her I cried for the first time in months.(Im not a sentimental guy)\n\nLong story short: I was really troubled growing up with a single mom and was constantly in trouble in elementary school, but she was the first teacher to believe in me. She gave me a shot and built the foundation for my love for learning. She loved me when I felt so unloveable and showed me that family was much more than a title. Read the email below and here's the [picture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lKGWzwzvHjdLT32LyPgz8SXPKaN6oLho/view?usp=sharing) we took together.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nDear Mrs. (....),\n\nThis letter is long overdue, and it\u2019s been tumbling around in my mind. So I thought it was finally time to thank you. I just sent you a friend request on Facebook because I hope, even after so many years, you remember me (your favorite student ever). You might remember that I was a horrible kid. Struggling to stay out of the office was normal. I hated school, I hated learning, and I hated being in trouble.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn hindsight, the only thing I didn't hate was video games. When I was sent to an alternative school I felt isolated and made it only harder for my single mom. I felt outcasted by teachers and students. I still remember the day the counselor came into our classroom and spoke about bullying. Then, a student started saying I did exactly that. Then one by one each kid in that room shared their experience of how I bullied them. When she asked everyone to raise their hand if Id bullied them, all but one kid raised their hand. I was taken out of the room and taken to the principal's office. I felt terrible, breaking down into tears as I felt like the most hated kid in school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor months it was the same things, school office, suspension, and come back to do it all over again. Then, I was in fourth grade sitting before you. You changed my life for the better. You made me feel like family. Like I mattered. You invested in me when no one else would. You made me fall in love with school again. I could hardly pay attention before, even diagnosed with ADHD.  I fell in love with math. Now, I am taking the hardest math course in the district that I have to leave my high school to go to RHS. Since then, I've made straight A's since 6th grade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI remember when I moved you offered to take me to school every day. Ever since then I remember feeling like I had to succeed, not for me but for you and my family who kept faith when I made it so hard. The world needs more teachers like you. You changed my life forever. I was prompted to write this email after reflecting on how far I've come from the kid who was told by his principal hed end up in jail or worse, to the young man who works alongside his high school principals on school recruitment projects and the district superintendent to speak on student issues. After years of chasing a dream despite my difficulties, I did it. Thank you. Thank you for every word you shared with me. Thank you for caring when no one else did. When you told me you were promoted from your teacher position into an administrative position, I was happy knowing they promoted you, a person who cares for more than a check.  Thank you for the words that changed my life forever, \"The less you have, the more you should be inspired.\"  This past Friday, I got accepted to Stanford University. Although I haven't committed it's likely ill be there in the fall. Im still in disbelief but Im grateful for you. I can never repay you for all you've done, but thank you. The world needs more people like you. Please keep changing lives and kicking butt at it.",

No single teacher quite impacted me that much, but with a single father I was definitely a loud, attention seeking outcast all throughout my youth years. Many teachers supported me with things like costumes for Halloween, presents for Christmas, and all the sort. It gets me a little choked up just thinking about how much they had done for me. Look into the FLI community at Stanford. It has helped me grow, and has afforded me opportunities that others can only dream of (flying to different states, countries, thousands of supplemental income each quarter, etc). Feel free to PM any questions you might have. It\u2019s pretty crazy how similar we are!",
