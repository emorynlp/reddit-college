  "title:": "ED2 to Vanderbilt or RD to Upenn",
  "text": "I have a question and I think I have pretty unique circumstances here\n\nI just got rejected from Duke ed, and now am trying to decide if I want to do ED 2 to vandy or RD to Upenn. I think i like Vanderbilt better, but I am not so sure how I would feel about having to attend there it if I did get into Penn. I assume if I had normal circumstances I would just do ED to vandy since upenn rd is so hard, but the other thing is that my mom holds a high position working at UPenn, both of my parents attended upenn for their phds and my sister currently attends penn. Being that I am a child of an employee and a triple legacy (1550 sat for reference), I am assuming I am pretty likely to get into upenn RD. All that being said, I can't decide if I should apply RD to penn and RD to vandy, and risk my chances of getting into vandy, or if I should do ED2 to vandy and RD to penn, but risk my chance of getting to go to penn if even if i do get in! Thanks in advance",
