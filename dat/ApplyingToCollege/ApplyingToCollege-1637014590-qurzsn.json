  "text": "Counselor told me to put down an athlete scholar reward for having good grades while playing sports. I did play sports and did receive 4.0's but I don't remember ever receiving this reward (I don't know if its because I participated in less rigorous sports like xc and tennis). Should I email my ao and tell them I am not sure, or is the reward relatively small and I shouldn't be too worried about if I actually received it or not.",

However, my school handled the whole application process and so I wasn't aware of whether or not I received it until a few days ago. I've been told that the award looks pretty good by several coaches and counselors, so definitely make sure of your award status.",
