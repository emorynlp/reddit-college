  "title:": "Why did my mom have to make me feel bad for applying to college?",
  "text": "I just submitted two of my college applications (woo!) but right after doing so my mom went, \"How much did it cost?\" So I said \"$145\" and she just seemed so peeved about it, like she didn't want me applying. So now instead of celebrating I'm sat here crying because now I feel like I wasted her money or something. I even told her about how much this was going to cost before hand, so I don't know why she reacted that way. It's not like we have no money.\n\nI don't know how to feel anymore, I wanted to celebrate but now I feel like I can't.",

      "text": "She's probably just in shock that some apps are so expensive, so don't sweat it. She'll get over it, but hopefully your other ones have a lower fee to make up for it.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe it just hit her that this college thing is totally real. It's a scary (but exciting) prospect for us parents.",
