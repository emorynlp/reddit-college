  "text": "Hello guys, I am a 18-year-old international student from Malaysia. In Malaysia, we only have 11 years of education (age 7-17). \n\nI was supposed to graduate high school in November 2020 but it was delayed to February 2021. Currently, I am attending matriculation. I will be done with the first semester in December 2021 and second semester in May 2022. So by the time I'm done with matriculation, I'll be 19 and will be forced to apply for the Fall 2023 intake :(\n\nI'm currently applying to California State Universities (Fall 2022). I wanna quit matriculation after the first semester but I'm afraid that it doesn't satisfy the standard 12 years of education requirement. \n\nMy question is : Can I apply to American colleges without finishing my matriculation? I really wanna apply for the Fall 2022 intake.\n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated :D",
