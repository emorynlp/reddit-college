  "text": "Dear future Tiko1787,\n\nFIRST OF ALL, DID YOU GET INTO UC HICAGO (AND MIT)? I have to know. If you did, great job, you can finally play Minecraft again. You deserve it! But don't forget about your stupid English essay due Monday :) \n\nIf you didn't get in, that ok too. You're almost done with your RD supplements and they're looking great so far. Be sad for a while, but don't beat yourself up too much. You'll eventually get into a school you love.\n\nAnd if you got deferred, well then it's time to write a banger LOCI.  If it's anything like your other essays, it should be halfway decent at least.",
