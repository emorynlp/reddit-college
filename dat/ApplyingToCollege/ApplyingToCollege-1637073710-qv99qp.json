  "title:": "College Applications Keep Asking for a Transcript",
  "text": "Hello everyone, I applied about a week ago to 4 different colleges. I applied through the Common App, made sure I had every thing set and ready/ completed and even double checked. I sent them all off, and then I started getting responses telling me to check for any missing requirements through the school\u2019s portals. When I check them however, they list my transcript either has incomplete, or on a to do list despite me sending them through the common app. I have asked my high school about this, and they said the counselor completed everything needed to be done and to try contacting the school, I have emailed the colleges and called but nothing. I am just nervous as to wether or not my transcripts were sent, and if I need to be worried or not. Does the common app just take a long time to send them? Or are common app transcripts usually opened on a further away date? I am just wondering if this warrants some type of worry or not. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you!",
