  "text": "\\*Not asking for explicit advice (unless you want to share your MIT interview experiences) I already have looked at this sub's interview resources.\\*\n\nI'm so nervous, I'm having trouble coming up with some bullet points for the why MIT question. I can't really go, \"Well it's the best in the entire world for my major so like that insta bio is gonna be SICK! Also I'm going to make about $13k more because I would graduate with an MIT degree so money is SICK!\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust nervous to make a fool of myself, like knowing me I just 3D printed a T-Rex skull and I would totally be the person to go on for about an hour on all my 3D printed stuff. Am I allowed to grab something from my room and show it to them? Also, was reading a post on here on how to email the alumni interviewers, and already messed up. Called her by her first name right away so hopefully, that's not too bad. So any words of comfort (a nice \"you got it bud\" would be very motivating rn), if my interview is at 12 should I email her if I don't hear from her by 11 for a Zoom link? What should I wear if shes just going to see my shoulders?",

      "text": "Don't sweat it! The hardest part is behind you! I did not go to MIT but I did have a few professors from said institution.  I went to Optometry school right across the Harvard Bridge from MIT. Not as competitive to get into as MIT but still highly competitive. My interview was the entire day and best advise is no jokes or sarcasm as most teacher are either boomers or Gen x. Stay on point, this way you'll maintain engagement, it is not only about them interviewing you BUT also you interviewing them; ask questions pertinent to your field of interest, also when is your turn to answer questions make sure you don't turn it into a monologe (remember the engagement part?) And the most important advise, yeap, you guessed it!the famous \"be yourself\". Show the excitement and passion you have for your field of interest and have fun! It's not everyday you get a chance to interview for MIT. BTW when you get admitted,  enjoy your time in Boston, I met many from MIT that never went anywhere, not even for a walk. Good luck!!",

I already have a few questions prepared for her, and she included in her email that she\u2019s a graduate student so she\u2019s not too old (hopefully that\u2019ll make it more natural as I sometimes find it harder to talk to older adults). Even if I don\u2019t get into MIT I know that I\u2019ll work hard on college to reach my dreams, I\u2019m so excited to just be close to finally reaching college decisions and everything",

      "text": "of course you can use a 3d printed thing as a \u201cprop\u201d, it\u2019s something cool that you can talk about.\n\nmy experience: i was super nervous before the interview, but they weren\u2019t lying when they said the mit interview was basically a conversation (wasn\u2019t that way for some other school). it was pretty much this old guy and i getting excited about robotics and art and baking for an hour. \n\ni wouldn\u2019t email too far in advance about a zoom link. your interviewer is probably interviewing other people, so they may wait to send you the link so that you don\u2019t get on while they are still talking with someone else. in fact, my interviewer didn\u2019t send the skype invite until 15 min after it was supposed to start. \n\n\nYOU GOT IT!! It\u2019ll be over in less than 24 hours and you\u2019ll feel so relieved after this huge weight is taken off your shoulders. Good luck!",
