  "text": "Hey guys, I\u2019m currently applying to a Community College in California. I live in Korea, but I dropped of high school, and didnt study, but took the \uac80\uc815\uace0\uc2dc(Korean high school equivilancy exam). So I\u2019m concerned that I wont be able to follow Community College courses and therefore get a Bad GPA. I hope to transfer to a UC school, any tips on studying and getting a good GPA?",

I\u2019m actually Korean too lol.\n\nA lot of seniors from years before from every graduating class tend to go to a community college in my town and then transfer to a UC. Apparently it\u2019s actually easy to transfer to a UC if you have a decent enough GPA.\nI think some of my friends are actually planning on doing that too",

I'm taking CC courses right now and it's honestly a lot more lenient and easier than high school courses. My only concern is your grasp/comprehension of the English language. Considering how you're already really good at English, I'm sure you'll be fine :)) The rates of transferring to a UC from a CC is VERY high! There's also this program called TAG (Transfer Admission Guarantee) where you're guaranteed admission into a declared UC campus (except for LA, Berkeley, and another one IIRC) if you have a certain GPA. \n\nGood luck and I hope this was helpful!",
