  "text": "So I heard St. Anford was like a really good school or smth (idk I've cured cancer so I'm probably guaranteed admission at any school) but I have no idea what kind of religious university they are. Just in case, I've prepped for future interviews by reading every single religious text in the world twice, but I'm still worried :(((( Any pointers?",
