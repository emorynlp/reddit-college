At the undergraduate level, UCLA, Cal, UMich and UVA are all great schools, but they are not public ivies because they are the top 4 public schools. Cal is considered a public Ivy because at the graduate level they exceed most of the ivy league schools and are only second to the likes of H/S. Consistently ranks top 5 in a vast majority of STEM fields etc. Barely any value to undergrads tbh. Think I have seen UCI call themselves a public ivy tho lmao",

I'm working as a predoc at an Ivy now and we have more researchers here now from either state schools or (like me) small liberal arts colleges than we do from Ivies.\n\nIf you're focused on a research career, and do the things you need to do to get there, undergrad at a school perceived as elite matters surprisingly little. At least in my field (economics), they care way more about the quality of your post-college research experience.\n\nImo, if you're picking an undergrad institution with the goal of ultimately doing a PhD, the best indicator is to ask about their support for undergrad research, not to look at their overall elite status.",
