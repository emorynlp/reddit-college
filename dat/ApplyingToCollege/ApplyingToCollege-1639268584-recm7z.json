  "text": "people from my school will probably see this but it's fine\n\nso basically i've applied to about 10/14 of my schools as cis and using my assigned pronouns at birth. however i've recently come to terms with the fact that i don't identify as cis and use a different pronoun set other than i've said on my other applications. however, i'm probably not going to come out until i enter college due to safety concerns and honest convenience, so i'm still presenting as cis and using only she/her pronouns to everyone at school and in my life.\n\nhowever, i'm not sure what to put on my remaining college apps. i know some schools communicate with each other about applicants, and i'm worried that if i change my gender identity for the remaining four that it'll reflect badly upon me and make it seem like i'm lying to get a boost in admissions.\n\nso.. not sure what to do. should i change my gender for the rest of my applications? a part of me just kind of feels guilty or like i'm lying for my own benefit. i don't know.\n\n(i also don't really feel the need to email the colleges i've already applied to to modify my gender/pronouns. i've already been accepted some places and i don't want to risk being outed to my family.)",

      "text": "I don\u2019t think colleges care that much to communicate to others about their applicants. Imagine they have 50000 applicants, do you really think they will ask other colleges about every one of them? The Common App says you can make any changes at any moment but schools you have already applied to won\u2019t see them. If you are really paranoid you can explain it in additional info.\nAlso, since you\u2019re in closet, make sure you don\u2019t have your parents\u2019 email/phone number listed. It\u2019s mostly for advertising and stuff, and totally optional, but I wouldn\u2019t put it just in case. Stay happy\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\u26a7\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

      "text": "i would say either put she/her on the rest and then where ever u end up going have them change it in their system or change on the last 4 and then change it on ur other apps. some portals give u the opportunity to change that stuff and if not u can email\nur admissions officer/admissions office and ask them to change it",

      "text": "You can change it! They wouldn't have a problem with it I don't think. Remember that AOs are majority very young (like in their 20s) and very progressive individuals, and so  they'll know that sometimes gender identity can change throughout the application process. \n\nTake a look at this article from MIT: https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/applying-while-transgender/",

      "text": "If you don't want to risk being outed to your family, I would not recommend changing your name or pronouns, since they use your name and pronoun in official communications. Based on my understanding, not being cis won't bring you much if any of an admissions boost anyways, unless you tell a compelling story about it in your essays.\n\nYou can write \"I go by these name and pronouns but I am not out to my family so I did not list it in my application\" in the additional information section, if you'd like. That won't risk it being automatically sent to your family. I doubt it would matter to the AO in terms of admissions, but I know it can feel icky to list the incorrect name and pronouns when you're already out to yourself.",
