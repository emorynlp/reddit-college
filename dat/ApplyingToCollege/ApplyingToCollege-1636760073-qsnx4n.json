      "text": "I have multiple favorites! Fordham, Syracuse (Newhouse), and William & Mary (in-state) are my favorite target schools. :)\n\n**Fordham -** Upsides: Medium size. Great campus; I love the look of the campus. Perfect distance from home. Solid finance/marketing programs. Great career and internship opportunities in NYC. I like the location in NYC; I like the Bronx and how diverse the surrounding area is. \n\nPersonal downsides: Kinda far from Manhattan. And the food is eh, but I'm not a picky eater.\n\n**Syracuse -** Upsides: Medium-Large size. So much flexibility with double majoring across the Newhouse School & the Whitman School of Business. Great campus; amazing facilities. Love the sports scene as well, it sounds so fun. And I love cold weather!\n\nPersonal downsides: There's definitely some things to do in the city of Syracuse, but there's not a whole lot.\n\n**William & Mary -** Upsides: In-state tuition. Love the campus, the vibe, and the sense of community. Love the medium size. Love their business school.\n\nPersonal downsides: Not a lot to do outside of the campus, but like Syracuse, there's definitely some things to do.",
