  "title:": "I got into an Early Decision school, do I still do the \"next steps\" section for other colleges?",
  "text": "So I applied to a school Early Decision (ED) and got in, but I also applied to other schools. I live in California so I applied to UC's and CSU's, but I also applied ED and got into a private out of state through a scholarship. As some of you may know, when you turn in your applications on November 30th (deadline for CSU/UC's) you get an email a few days later from the schools you applied to talking about the \"next steps\". Now, do I still follow and do the \"next steps\", or can I just avoid that since I already got into a school ED? I am first gen so idk what I am supposed to do. Help me out plz. \ud83d\ude4f",
