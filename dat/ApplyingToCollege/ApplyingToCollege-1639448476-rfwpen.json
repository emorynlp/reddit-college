  "text": "hi, so I have been waitlisted to 2 of my safeties (Minnesota and Iowa (nursing)), although I have a 4.7 gpa weighted, have taken 4 APs and 11 honors, 1400 SAT. do you think I should be worried? I have 6 more colleges to hear back from: 1 being safety, 2 being target, and 3 being hard targets (all nursing BSN). let me knowww I'm stressing.",

That would make them a lot more selective than the university as a whole.\n\nYou might want to consider some options that use traditional/standard nursing admissions. Obviously getting entry direct from high school is preferable, but you want to have some options you are ok with if that doesn't happen.",

That should list all the BSN programs in your state and give you an idea of how successful their grads are at passing the RN exams.  \n\nWinona State would be a big option to look at in Minnesota for example that I think has guaranteed direct admission with your SAT -- they require you to maintain a very high GPA to stay guaranteed for the upper level nursing classes which is why they can offer that kind of assured admission option.",

For example, the nursing admit rate at U San Francisco is less than 15% for a school with a general admit rate north of 50%. If it\u2019s direct entry, it\u2019s generally one of if not the most competitive program on campus. \n\nASU has very clear guidelines for direct entry admit. Are you open to all sorts of schools? Any geographic restrictions?",

And/or completing an alternate BA/BS and doing a post baccalaureate nursing degree. In several states we looked at that made the most sense.",
