  "text": "Hi, I am trying to fill my activities list for the common app, and I don't know how to describe those activities accordingly and don't know how to calculate hours spent per week and per year. I have done a lot of ECA from my 9th to 12th grade, and the lists of most important ones are as follows:\n\n1. I was president get my school's interact club, founded by Rotary international for school-level students. It is a nonprofit community service club. I was involved in community services including awareness campaigns and cleanliness campaigns, and we raised funds for flood victims and helped orphans. I worked as a secretary for this club in 9th grade and as a president in 10th grade. We used to have meetings for an hour every two days a week. And most of the programs we did and I participated in used to be on every Saturday and during other holidays and events.\n2. I tutored three junior students part-time during my 12th grade, and I continued this for two years. I used to help them with their homework and helped them prepare for exams. I used to work for an hour daily except Saturday, and I used to take leave for festivals and whenever I was sick. It was a paid job. I used to get paid $42 per month here in Nepal.\n3. I was an executive member of our club named Science Robotics and IT during my 11th and vice president at 12th grade. Our club organized different robotics competitions hackathons, provided robotics workshops, and managed various informative programs. Before joining this club, I had already participated in a robotics workshop in my 10th grade, where I learned the basics and intermediate of robotics for high school students and developed a line following robot which used to work using the infrared sensors and worked on other small projects. We used to have a meeting of our club every week where we used to discuss the progress of projects, collect funds, and do other official works, and we used to organize a monthly information session. We used to organize robotics workshops with the help of teachers and some invited engineers every six months. We used to manage a grand national-wide inter-college robotics exhibition and different competitions. This festival was known as \"Techno Fest\".",

      "text": "Hours are pretty much just estimates. Honestly? Don't think too much of it and just punch in what feels right (but also don't over-exaggerate). As for how to describe, you've pretty much done the job describing them for this Reddit post; just make it more concise and straight to the point. Prioritize numbers and impact.",
