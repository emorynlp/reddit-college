  "title:": "Advice on a 1580",
  "text": "Back in sophomore year during COVID, I took the SAT during the May session in order to relieve some of the pressure during junior year and be able to focus on AP classes without constantly having to study. I managed to get a 1580 with a 790 reading and 790 math, which is already an amazing score.\n\nHowever, my school offers a SAT test for free in April for all juniors and I was wondering if I should take it or not. As I technically have \"room for improvement\" in both subjects and I've definitely improved my math to get an 800 every time, I wanted to know if I should retake the SAT in April and try for that perfect.\n\nThe thing is, I have not studied for the test at all, and given that I want to start looking for internships and research jobs this year I probably won't be able to devote enough time to it to even improve my score marginally. As such, it's likely that I'll get a lower reading score (likely in the low 700s) next time while getting a perfect on math.\n\nSo should I retake the test or should I just leave it and focus on my extracurriculars?",

At your score range it's not a matter of prepping; it's a matter of luck.\n\nIf you want to take it again then go ahead (it only costs you 3 hours), but I wouldn't spend a single minute prepping.",
