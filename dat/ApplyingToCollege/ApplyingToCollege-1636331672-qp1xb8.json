  "text": "What are some US schools that give need based aid to international students with higher acceptance rates than T10 schools? (Higher ranking the better) \n\nHousehold income is around 130k, parents around 80k saved up for university. I don\u2019t want to go into too much debt especially for undergrad.\n\nAny recommendations for US university?",
