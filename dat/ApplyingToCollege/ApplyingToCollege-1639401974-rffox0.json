Extreme focus on grades, resume building, etc. to the exclusion of pursuing any \"frivolous\" activities.\n\nShe shares another anecdote of a student she chatted with after a presentation who was interested in food/cooking and shared recommendations with her about various places in town she should try.  Her impression of that student was very positive.\n\nShe advises the reader to use high school as a time to explore different interests rather than to view it as a time in which to \"maximize\" one's college resume.\n\nShe mentions one applicant who submitted a letter of recommendation from the school janitor, and how that recommendation was extremely impactful because it spoke to the student's \"character\".  She was the only student in the school who bothered to learn the janitor's name.\n\nStuff like that.  If you want to get inside the head of an AO and get a feel for \"how they think\", it's a great book.  My impression after reading it was that the author, at least, evaluates candidates somewhat differently than A2C might expect.  (Granted, she's just one person; other AOs may have different biases).",
