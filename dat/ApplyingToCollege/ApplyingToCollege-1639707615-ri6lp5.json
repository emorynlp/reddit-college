  "text": "So I\u2019m from Canada and kinda want to apply to us colleges. I think it\u2019s too late now but just wanted to see what people thought lol. I\u2019m hesitant because I don\u2019t want to spend sm money of application fees and then get rejected. \n\nKinda nervous about asking teachers or LORs bc it\u2019s so late and winter break starts tomorrow ://\n\nPls don\u2019t be mean :/",

      "text": "Although you are a little late I\u2019m sure you still have a chance :) Most Early Action and Early Decisions are done but MANY colleges\u2019 Regular Decision is over a month a way. If you don\u2019t want to spend the money I wouldn\u2019t go on applying to 9 schools you\u2019re not likely to get into but if you have a few top schools and you put the effort into your common app then by all means go for it. Right now many people are hearing back from their EA or ED decisions, there are still so many people who have not applied anywhere yet. Best of luck on your college search :)",

This sub is full of people who applied to schools EA (Early Action) and ED (Early Decision), but you still have time to apply for the Regular round. Apply to a handful of schools you\u2019re genuinely interested in and the application fees shouldn\u2019t be too terrible. Let me know if you need any help with anything!",

      "text": "It\u2019s never too late, but get on asking your teachers for LOR\u2019s asap, start working on that essay, fill out that common app (maybe coalition and school specific apps too if you either like a school that doesn\u2019t have common app or if you really get into things and end up wanting to apply to more than 20 schools). If you\u2019re low income, you can get fee waivers from a good amount of schools w/app fees by just emailing their admissions office and explaining your situation (may need your counselor to vouch for you worst case but not a big deal at all). You\u2019ll probably also have to fill out a CSS profile as an international assuming you\u2019re needing financial aid.\n\nOther than that just as some advice: go to common app, click the application requirements on your dashboard, select the circle next to all colleges and sort by application fee. This will show you all schools with no application fee in addition to any other schools you like. Also - go to niche.com and click on the colleges section. You can sort through their rankings by major or overall, and you can check off no application fee to get their rankings for those schools too. You can do the same thing on common app with EA2/ED2 schools (some have mid January deadlines so if you really work over winter break you could still get to a few schools if you like them)",
