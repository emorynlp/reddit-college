  "title:": "\"We ask 18-year-olds to make huge decisions about their career and financial future, when a month ago they had to ask to go to the bathroom.\" -Adam Kotsko",
  "text": "Saw this quote on r/quotes and it serves as a really impactful reminder that just because we turn 18, we're no more than a day older than we were on the 364th day we were 17. Teenagerhood should've been a tunnel into our adulthood, however that tunnel was blocked off by grades, extracurriculars, research, and whatnot.\n\nMay 1st of the next year rolls around and we're expected to accept hundreds of thousands of debt while still not knowing how 401Ks work. Many of us don't know how to properly invest, to make educated purchases, the difference between saving and checking, debit and credit cards. we're signing off on the terms and conditions we don't yet understand, for a \"guaranteed\" future but how much of it is guaranteed?\n\nThere are many students out there that do certain activities under the pressure of their parents or \"for college applications.\" What's next? Do it for the job? A job you have no interest in? For the graduate school?\n\nHow about doing things for yourself? How many of us actually know what we're doing for ourselves? For our physical and mental health?\n\nJust some food for thought as many of us are currently eyeing these prestigious private schools and even out-of-state public schools. There are countless fallacies in education systems worldwide, however it goes without saying that no college acceptance is worth it if you're dead or depressed.",

Curiosity I guess.  I took multiple gap years\u2014did a gap year program, volunteered, traveled, worked full time and lived on my own for a bit as well.  It made me ten times as prepared for school, I knew what I wanted to study and make my career, and I also had a better understanding if finances to realize that I DID NOT want debt.  After working full-time, I have a better grasp on what I want out of a career.  I study in my parent\u2019s home country for financial reasons.  I know that\u2019s not an option for everyone but my point is that I hadn\u2019t even considered that option until I was mature enough to realize that I don\u2019t want to start my life already in debt.  When I graduated high school, I was sure I would study international relations.  I\u2019m now studying Soil and Water Sciences, will graduate as an agronomist.  It was definitely the best choice for me.  Don\u2019t be afraid of taking your time.  You have your whole life.  Anyone who is considering a gap year can feel free to give me a message.",

But I guess, they're private colleges. So a private college choosing to lean on private high schools is their prerogative. Sucks though because private high schools are by definition small and exclusive. That's what makes them attractive. So there simply aren't enough seats even if everyone did have the money to pay for them :(.",

College is where you grow up; you enter a child and leave a different person. That\u2019s why most people change majors in college - the first one was selected by a naive high school kid and you won\u2019t be that person by graduation. (If you are, you probably haven\u2019t learned much.)\n\nYou think choosing a college is all important because it is the only decision of any importance that is in front of you. (Well, except birth control. Please use it for now.) So yes, it is currently your biggest decision and yes, it determines your entire future. But it\u2019s not the rank of that school that determines your future - there are far too many more powerful variables. \n\nPerhaps at college A you would have become inspired by a random course in psychology, changing your major and life\u2019s focus. But at college B you would have met the love of your life and followed her to Milwaukee. While at college C you\u2019d get depressed and drop out to become a roadie with a punk band and at college D your frat brother would recruit you for his eventually successful startup and at college E you\u2019d have been killed in a freak lightning storm junior year. \n\nPlease don\u2019t stress about your college choice. At least not more than necessary. Just choose whatever you think best. Your horizons are about to expand dramatically, and that\u2019s true no matter where you go.",

Tell us how to walk this line. \n\nOur kids start high school at 14. 14 year olds are not especially interested in parental advice. 15-16 year olds are reasonable people who happen to be young and inexperienced; 13-14, not so much. We parents need to accept that as age appropriate. So how do we persuade them to focus on grades in 9th? Do we nudge? Push? Guilt trip? Ground and punish? Go full authoritarian and lower the hammer? Or do we let them make their own mistakes and accept the consequences, in the interest of growing up?  \n\nI chose the latter, and we suspect grades in 9th were what kept one kid out of one top choice school - they weren\u2019t bad (As and Bs) but mostly Bs. So maybe I should have pushed. He thinks maybe I should have pushed. Our kids clearly knew how highly our family values education (PhD parents and grandparents). But at 14 I was still saying \u201cnext time you are caught on the school roof I\u2019m not bailing you out, dumbass.\u201d \n\nBy 15 he got his grades up (while still \u201cenjoying life\u201d perhaps more than anyone I\u2019ve ever met). Both kids did well and ended up in colleges that are a perfect fit. We did not encourage T20s (personal preference) but one got into one anyway (declined). They are financially literate with a full set of practical life skills, confident and capable. But both could have easily gotten into higher ranked colleges, especially with more parental involvement and a stronger emphasis on academics. \n\nSo tell me, prestige focused college sub, how should we have raised our T20 capable teens? I\u2019m beyond happy with the smart and mature young adults I raised, but would it have been worth constraining their youth to place them on a higher rung of the education ladder? I don\u2019t myself believe so. They are attending very good schools where they are ideally suited to excel, and I would far rather see them excel than try to coast on the name of their alma mater. \n\nBut none of us knows the right answer when faced with our first 14 year old. We are all amateurs at parenting, and we won\u2019t know how well we did until it\u2019s too late to change anything.",

Yet I pushed myself and overworked myself to get A\u2019s and did not enjoy my high school career. \nIts so easy look back and say I should have pushed just a little more to get in my top choice school, or maybe I should have relaxed more and gotten slightly worse grades.

          "text": "We handled it very similarly. Two academically focused parents (I have a PhD, wife has an MD) but we allowed our kids to make their own academic decisions. \n\nMy oldest never needed to be pushed, which is good because I doubt it would have done any good. She isn't wired that way. She is now a rising senior with almost perfect stats (SAT, ACT, and GPA) but not much in terms of extracurriculars. She does some clubs and plays an instrument but never had the desire to over extend herself. She works hard and wants to play video games when she has free time. We told her that as long as her work is taken care of she can spend her free time however she pleases. My rising junior is a high achieving student but is only taking two AP courses junior year. He could handle more and knows he could but he's involved in everything. He plays sports all year, holds leadership in 3 or 4 clubs (plus involvement in many more), and always has friends around. He'd rather be able to do that and only take 2 AP courses than load up on APs like his sister did and have little time for anything else.\n\nWill their approaches put some schools out of reach? Maybe. We value education but we don't place any value on T20s. We also value our kids being independent and self driven, so we allowed them to make their choices and deal with whatever those consequences may be.",

          "text": "The problem stems from the fact that everyone is competing for the limited number of entry-level jobs once you graduate college. It's a race to the top (I mean bottom) because to get a job you have to get internships, which means competing with other students for even more limited number of internships than full-time jobs (that's eased if you attend a prestigious school as it eases the friction for getting jobs or internships), which then leads to college students hyperfocused on GPA, projects, and extracurriculars. So then in high school everyone has to up their GPA and their SAT/ACT scores, and the amount of extracurriculars to get into prestigious universities which leaves students burned, stressed out, and turning to drugs to help them cope. This is compounded from the pressure parents exert of their kids so mentally their being f\\*cked from both ends so you have the situation many students are in which leads them down a lonely and dark path.\n\nThat's why it's okay to go to a less school than like a top 20 school or whatever so long as it's a good school. Like there's nothing wrong with going to a state school. The curriculum is mostly the same as a big name school.\n\nI went to what's now considered a top 25 high school in California. It was felt normal when I went their but now students are hyperfocused on academics (predominately asian so not helping) so there's a lot of stress to get a high GPA and SAT/ACT scores, plus whatever extracurriculars. I feel bad for students there as I've heard stories of other students transferring high schools in the school district for a less stressful environment. \n\nThroughout high school I wasn't pressured to get good grades, I got Bs, some As, and probably some Cs. I knew I needed good grades but didn't focus on studying enough to spend all of my available time into it other then getting homework done and for tests. Then went to a small state school for engineering and sports. Changed my major because engineering, primarily because Chemistry 2 and Statics were a PITA and caused too much stress. Got into grad school 18 months after graduating college and now going into real estate.",

There are a few other community colleges in this area that would not transfer in the same way (with some more lacking than others). \n\nYou must check the course equivalencies first if you plan to just take individual courses and transfer them. \n\nHowever, if you get the associates degree, it transfers as a \u201cblock\u201d \u2014 meaning all of the general education courses are considered completed when you arrive at the 4-year institution with no course-by-course equivalencies needed",

I think you should try to look beyond high school and beyond the era you are living in ur town and think about the lifestyle, not education, you are looking to achieve.",

My school has less clubs, less APs, but most importantly there's less information. Most people in my town know almost nothing about college applications yet I live in a state that is considered competitive(not like Wyoming where colleges get little apps). Sure fewer people are applying to Harvard than say, from the Bay area, but that's for a reason. I don't wanna diminish your issues, especially regarding your family, but I think we all need to be thankful to be so privileged as to even be able to attend college anyway. Since my school has sent about one person to harvard in the last 15 years I'm not betting on it either. We all need to consider what we want out of life outside of education and college.",

I think it's more f\\*cked up because just trying to get internships and jobs is incredibly difficult where many students are left behind, even those with relevant majors. May it's because they went to a small school so companies don't recruit there, have minimal experience, or because they suck at interviewing. For those being left behind it creates a group of people disenfranchised with society. Just look at all the towns abandoned in the rest belt with jobs shipped overseas.\n\nTake me for example. I studied finance in undergrad and went into grad school to study business analytics after 18 months of not getting a job. The best I could do was two irrelevant temp jobs to pay the bills that lasted maybe 9 months total. Got an irrelevant internship in accounts payable the first 4 months of grad school and never got another internship, let alone interviews during the 2 1/2 years while in grad school. So it's been 1 year since graduating and nothing to show for it because the pandemic screwed everything up for millions of people. There was a period from September - December where I was applying to 80 jobs a month and doing well interviewing with maybe 20 companies and 3 final rounds, but no job. Got burnt out mentally and couldn't fathom doing that for an undetermined amount of time so now I'm going into real estate because I need to make something of myself if no one else is going to take a chance on me.",

You are forgetting that a solid (declining, but still solid) amount of high schoolers work jobs, or need to take care of family, or are in schools that don't offer this level of opportunities, or don't have family encouragement to do this kind of stuff. You CHOOSE to do all that. Please remember that that in itself is a privilege.\n\nAlso, some states have mandatory class or testing requirement called \"Consumer Education\" that is essentially Adulting/Personal Finance 101. But it's either not taught well or not targeted enough because everyone at the high school I went to thought of it as a joke and didn't take that class seriously (if they even took it - many of the high achieving students opted to test out or do the shortened summer school version in fear of \"wasting\" the opportunity to take an honors/ap weighted class, thereby missing out on important material/practical life assignments). In college we were also required to complete a short, online 0.5 credit training of personal finance and student loan education.",
