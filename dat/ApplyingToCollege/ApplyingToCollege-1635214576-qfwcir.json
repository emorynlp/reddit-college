If you feel like you need it to improve your application ( like if you have a bad gpa or something) I would personally submit it. If you feel like it is lower than your other stuff on your app then probably not submit it. Theoretically it should not hurt you if you fall in the middle 50 percent, but at the same time it probably wouldn\u2019t help much.",
