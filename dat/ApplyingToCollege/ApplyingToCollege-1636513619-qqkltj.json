  "text": "Just want to clarify!\n\nIt says this:\n\n* Upload music files \\[MP3, WAV\\]. Please limit total length of files to 10 minutes. Do not submit video.\n* You may also include a link to a SoundCloud page with your work.\n* Include the title of the piece(s), composer, and instrument.\n\nI have 2 songs, and when pieced together, the length is a bit over 10 minutes. So I guess it seems like I can submit the 2 songs separately?\n\nAlso, for including the title, I'd think that would mean the name of my file, since the submission is audio only?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",
