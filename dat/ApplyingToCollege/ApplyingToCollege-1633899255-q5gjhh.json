      "text": "There's a joke that everyone is working on a novel. If it's done, research how to query and attempt to snag an agent (would make for a great essay!). The WOW factor is not snagging an agent but going through this very \"mature, adult\" process. If the book is not-finished, send in a chapter or two to competitions or even short story competitions. Again, the WOW factor is that you are at the stage to enter the professional sphere.\n\nEdit: I see it's not done. So competitions is the way to go.",
