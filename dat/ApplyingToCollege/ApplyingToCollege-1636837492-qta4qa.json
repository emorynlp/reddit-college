I suspect 1500 and 1550 won\u2019t be treated differently at Slippery Rock.\n\nAbove 1550 will mean little outside of maybe MIT, Caltech, CMU SCS.  Maybe.\n\nThere are obviously other variables. A 1550 of 800EBRW/750M would look slightly different to a STEM school than a 750/800, even though both are 1550.",
