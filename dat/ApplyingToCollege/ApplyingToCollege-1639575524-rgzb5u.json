  "text": "Seriously, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing today. My best friend and I are both gonna meet in the cafeteria and open our shit together (different schools, same day). If we get accepted, great! If not, we\u2019re still gonna grab some nice eats after school and go on with our lives. We have a school dance coming up and life will move on. We applied to like 20 other schools anyways. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is that opening with a close friend will help tremendously, no matter the outcome. And remember that this result really doesn\u2019t mean a whole lot in the long run. You\u2019ll find your place. What\u2019s the worst that can happen? Transferring in Sophomore year. Breathe, don\u2019t let your emotions get to you too much, and accept the decision. You\u2019ll find your place. If not today, then later :)",
