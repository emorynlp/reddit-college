  "text": "Hello! So I applied to this college months ago and I had a friend help me round out my GPA. My friend put my GPA as a 3.92 on the transcript and I actually got accepted into the college. But recently I had someone come over to do my Homeschool Transcripts and they calculated it to a 3.67. I\u2019ve already been accepted into the college I applied too and they have the incorrect GPA, what should I do?? Should I reach out to the office and say it was mistake?",

I had no intention of misleading anyone and I apologize profusely if I have done so.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll need to contact your friend and find out how she calculated it. I don\u2019t know why you thought it would be reliable coming from a friend ( not a counselor or teacher\u201d and only using some of your scores.",

I don\u2019t have anyone to help me since my parents have never been to college and don\u2019t like to help in general, so when I had someone said they\u2019d help me out and since they\u2019ve already gone to college and were familiar with the process I thought they\u2019d be reliable. I probably gave her some wrong information at some point hence why she got the score all wrong so it\u2019s probably not her fault.",
