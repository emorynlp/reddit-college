  "text": "so, i just received a call (yes, an actual phone call to my house) from an alumni interviewer to schedule my interview for yale REA. the interviewer is an older man who lives in my small town, so after confirming that we've both been vaccinated, he suggested that we meet this weekend at a local cafe, and i agreed. what's weird, however, is that yale's website says interviews are only being offered virtually for the 2021-22 cycle, when clearly my interview would be in person. \n\n**tl;dr:** is my yale alumni interviewer breaching yale's protocol by interviewing me in person? if so, is it worth emailing the admissions office about the situation?\n\n(to be clear, safety-wise, I have no issue with meeting him in person, though selfishly, my socially anxious self would prefer an online interview. i'm just worried about doing something that could get either one of us in trouble with yale.)",

Take advantage of that. 99% of applicants aren\u2019t able to have that experience in person. Imagine the difference between getting a coffee and sitting down to talk with someone versus going through fifty people on a zoom call. It makes a big difference!",
