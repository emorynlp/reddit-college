  "title:": "My friend is such a snake. He doesn\u2019t deserve me.",
  "text": "I\u2019ve been literally helping my best friend out so much these past few months: brainstorming with him and editing his essays, giving him advice on extracurriculars, everything. I comforted him when he cried to me about how he was so scared to get rejected from his dream Ivy because his parents would be ashamed of him. I\u2018ve been such a good friend.\n\nAnd what does he do to me? While he\u2019s over at my house, and I\u2019m helping him craft his essays, I go to the bathroom. And when I come back, I catch him ready to click \u201cwithdraw\u201d on my submitted application (We\u2019re applying to the same school, but I submitted a week early, while he hadn\u2019t applied yet.)\n\nI can\u2019t even believe he did that. I know both of us have the \u201cT20 or bust\u201d mentality, but I\u2019m a lot nicer about it than he is. He\u2019s a lot more manipulative than me.\n\nI was soooooo mad. I asked him if he was seriously going to withdraw my application behind my back, and he admitted it. I couldn\u2019t even look at him, so I told him to leave, which he did.\n\nLater, I texted him and told him I wasn\u2019t going to edit his essays for his dream school. (He\u2019s not a good writer at all).\n\nBut then he called me at midnight in tears, apologizing and begging me to edit his essays. He just kept repeating \u201cI\u2019ll get rejected. I\u2019ll get rejected,\u201d and he could barely even talk.\n\nMe being such a pushover, I ended up consoling him and, yes, I did edit his essays. God, I hate myself.",

If he's so desperate to get in that he'll sabotage the one person helping him get through, what's to say it won't happen in college? You don't have to feel responsible for getting him through, because you're only assisting. You don't have an obligation to edit his essays, and don't make it seem that way to him, especially after what he did to you.",

              "text": "Think about it dude. If you edit his essays and he gets in, you just helped some snake get in that school, who would just add toxicity to that environment. Sure he wouldn\u2019t be applying to college anymore, but if he has the ability to sabotage a true friend cuz of college apps, who says he wouldn\u2019t be the same toxic dude with internships and research opps? Let him get what he deserves. While his parents pressuring him is sad, he don\u2019t have to turn to withdrawing YOUR application, that\u2019s another level of disrespect.",

My advice: Stand up to him! You say he is typically nice and only manipulative when it comes to college apps. The thing is he tried to sabotage you. IT COULD HAVE HAD VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES if he were successful. Such an act is unforgivable. Even though you\u2019re best friends with him, he still decided he wanted to do that (shows how much he values your friendship). If he\u2019s hyperventilating, and might not get into an Ivy without your help..LET HIM BE. You are doing him a favor by refusing to help him. He NEEDS to learn to treat people with respect and play fairly. By helping him, you are encouraging his toxic behavior. He is using you. Who\u2019s to say he won\u2019t do something worse to someone else in the future? I know it can be hard to say no and walk away from close friends..but sometimes it\u2019s really for the better. Please think through what he tried to do to you AGAIN. Manipulative people don\u2019t seem manipulative to the people they are closest to precisely because they are good at manipulating.",

It's not just about you or them, it's about the breach of trust. it's not about you editing their essays or helping them with their ECs, it's about how much they value you as a person in their life. I know it's the toughest thing in the world to do, especially in the middle of this entire college applications season but seriously, just write to them once explaining how you feel and how it's for the best that they don't contact you for a while.\n\nYou're doing the best that you can, OP. I see you. Remember this, you deserve all the good things in the world and what you don't deserve is a snake for a friend. The only reason he called you back after he left was because you refused to edit his essays- i know you don't believe it at this point but the essay is what matters to him, the ivy matters, not what he did to you or how he made you feel. That ivy rejection will definitely be tough for your friend but if it means so much to them that they'd sabotage YOU, i.e. their best friend and someone who is literally helping them through it all, it's just not fair to you and you have to cut this entire situation out.\n\nDon't cross oceans for people who won't cross puddles for you but he isn't even crossing a puddle here- don't cross oceans for people who'll kick you in the puddle themselves.",

The people began to call him Mr. Zero. People began being nice to my dad, but he knew better. They were only being friends with him because of his grades. Moral: People will treat you in different ways, but it's up to you on how you treat them back. This is unacceptable so personally, I believe you should ignore him. I would tell you to forgive him, but this would have changed your life m8. Ignore him, but don't bully him. Glimpse at college application, and hand it back with no expression or advice. Most of all, make new friends. Ones that truly care about you for and as you.",

I can't imagine all his problems will magically go away. If anything, he'll be crushed by the pressure of having to succeed and appear like he fits. \n2. He doesn't get into his dream school. His parents thinks he's worthless and a failure. He gets depressed, and then that's that. \n\nDo him a favor, and rip the bandaid off now by talking him into withdrawing his apps.

I enjoy, among other things, letting people know when their use of a word annoys the ever loving shit out of me. Not judging him as a person. Not being derogative about the content. Just letting him know that when I read him use the word that way, it made me unable to focus on what he had to say. Call it constructive criticism without a filter. His usage warrants such. \n\nOr don't call it anything, I really don't care. Have a good day.",
