  "text": "To all of y'all who were disappointed, don't be. Sure, you may not have into the college you always wanted, or dreamed of. But is that really that bad? Ivy League schools may offer connections that are really good, but other schools do too! Take Georgia Tech for e.g., a public university that is ranked much higher than other ivies for engineering, and yet it is cheaper too! You don't need to get into an Ivy to get a high quality education! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean come on guys, around 65k a year overall just for a bachelor's degree? Is it not more worth it to do your Master's in an esteemed college than your Bachelor's? But seriously, all this is just my opinion and I know how soul-crushing it might be. I saw ECs that I thought was not even in my country get rejected from MIT. Remember, if you are able to succeed in school with so many ECs, that is the important part because you know that you can succeed in life no matter what. Sometimes, things do happen for a reason so just take it as that because if you are good enough to even have a lot of extracurriculars with a stellar GPA, you will succeed in life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not education that determines how successful you are, it's actually how you approach life. So cheer up guys, and godspeed for the future!",

          "text": "Also: for top schools where it is almost impossible to get in as an international for undergrad such as HYPSM, it is much easier to get in as a graduate student after doing undergrad in your home country. For example, only 10% (450) of the undergrad students at MIT are international, but 41.2% (2796) of the graduate students at MIT are international. If you can't come to the US for undergrad, coming is grad school here is a great option!",
