  "title:": "How much would 2 years of 2nd language hurt me",
  "text": "I hated 2nd language (French) since the 1st day because I forced into it without the foundation. The whole time I was winging it by memorization and test taking strategies. When grade 11 came, it became optional (it was AP French) and I didn't take it. In my whole grade of about 150 students, literally 1 student was taking it. I also had to take a 3rd language (Arabic) until grade 9 but then didn't continue it. (I didn't like it, but also) the course was taught badly and was extremely simple. The only reason existing for 3rd language was because the government required it. There are only a quarter to a half dozen students taking it this year (almost certainly by family pressure). \n\nHow much will it affect my chances at T15 (CS) universities?",
