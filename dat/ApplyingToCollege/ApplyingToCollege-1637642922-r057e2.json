  "text": "Hello! I am currently a freshman in high school/in 9th grade. A lot of my family members who live in boston- told me i should start preparing if i want to apply to the US for undergrad- especially since i live in a normal middle class family and will be requiring significant financial aid. I have a keen interest in physics, maths and programming, and want to major in CS. How do i start preparing? I would prefer attending a college in Boston- as my family is there. MIT,UMass Amherst etc were the first ones i found for CS while surfing on the web. Can someone help me?",

      "text": "What you will want to do is exploring. US college admissions (for the schools you are talking about), is all about the story you tell. To get into MIT your grades will qualify you for admissions, but to have a chance you need to tell a strong story. So I would recommend checking out clubs at your school and explore what you find interesting to build your experiences. Try and find around 5 activities that you find interesting of which ~2 relate to your major and at least one that is not stereotypical for your major. For these 5 activities get involved and do cool things in them.",

Me and my friends planned a full fundraiser, etc for helping covid bereaved families and although it wasn't that successful, we made about 2,000 dollars-In which a school also donated a large sum of money.Edit: Our school doesnt have many clubs as such- but i am part of my schools MUN team- and have multiple awards including one from an international Korean MUN, Do MUN's help as well?",

      "text": "Your family members are right- preparing early is important. I personally didn't even know for sure I was going to apply until about 11th grade and as a result I didn't take full advantage of the time I had to build my profile up. As an Indian student, I'm sure you already know that grades are important, but you get a bit more slack on that front in the US admissions process (getting 94% in a subject in 12th won't instantly make admission to elite universities impossible, for example). **What matters for US college admissions is having a strong overall profile, which means grades (over all 4 years of HS), extracurriculars (ECs), standardised test scores, essays (No need to worry about those for now), awards, etc. Practically everything you achieve is considered**. There isn't really a specific set of ECs that will get you admitted, but a wide range of activities like internships, community work, contests and competitions you win, leadership positions, courses you take on your own, being involved in research etc. is looked favourably upon, especially if you have a decent number of them related to your intended major.\n\nI'd suggest you start doing research on a bunch of schools you're interested in based on priorities like your preferred major, location, scholarships and financial aid, specific opportunities etc. You can use sites like Niche to help you on that front. By no means does your list have to be anywhere close to final. You have about 2 and a half years to do that (students typically apply anywhere from Oct-Jan of their 12th grade year depending on specific deadlines). Remember that you don't need to be as amazing as the kind of people you see on this sub to be competitive for any colleges- it all depends on the range of schools you're targeting (plus your major- CS admissions are usually more competitive).\n\nIf you have any questions at all about how the process works, you've found the perfect place to get them answered. Check out the wiki for more detailed info about a bunch of stuff.\n\nGood luck!",
