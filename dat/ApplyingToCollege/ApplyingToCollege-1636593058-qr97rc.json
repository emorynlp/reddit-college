  "text": "I procrastinated starting my Cornell Early Decision application, so on November 1, I made the decision to switch my application to RD so I'd have more time to perfect my application and turn in the best possible version. However, I realized soon thereafter that I could, hypothetically ofc, turn in my ED application until Nov. 16 without a formal extension ([https://blogs.cornell.edu/admissions/2021/10/31/in-case-you-need-more-time-a-special-note-to-early-decision-applicants-for-fall-2022-admissions-from-the-executive-director-of-undergraduate-admissions/](https://blogs.cornell.edu/admissions/2021/10/31/in-case-you-need-more-time-a-special-note-to-early-decision-applicants-for-fall-2022-admissions-from-the-executive-director-of-undergraduate-admissions/)). While I now have an interview done and enough of an application/portfolio (AAP) complete that I could put something together within a few days, I also have a decent amount of stuff going on at school. Should I turn on The Grind and try to finish my early decision app before the extended deadline or should I just switch to regular decision? Does applying Early Decision really improve my chances of being accepted that much?? Plz help xx",
