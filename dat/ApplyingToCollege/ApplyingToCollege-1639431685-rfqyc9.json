  "text": "I just got rejected from my ED college (CWRU) on Saturday, and I've been feeling super depressed and crushed. I'm starting to warm up to OSU though, and I'd really like to know more about campus and the university as a whole, as it's one of my top safeties and most likely the college I'll end up choosing. I really liked CWRU because it was super close to my home (\\~30 min), so I'm trying to find some pros and good things about OSU's campus that might make up for its distance compared to CWRU.",

(and shes super smart and in the top 5% of our class so she def coulda applied to more \u201cprestigious\u201d options but fell in love w osu, for what its worth). their libraries are TRULY top notch they are unbelievably gorgeous and also massive, i think study sessions there would be so surreal. the campus too is so incredibly scenic and stunning. i think its so large that any person would be able to find their place there, and  i can imagine theres something for everyone\u2014if u prefer to get involved in school spirit stuff and go to parties and such, theres that! if u prefer to chill in ur dorm and have lowkey social events w just ur close friends, there\u2019s that too! imo its a great balance of social life and academic rigor! allow urself to be sad, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. you will end up where u need to be!!!",

      "text": "I go to OSU and absolutely love it. There's a good mix of partying vs studying kind of people. So many people aren't partiers if you're not into that kinda thing, but a shitton are definitely willing to go out every weekend too (I've heard CWRU doesn't have much of a party scene). \n\nThe campus is also massive, which is a little annoying sometimes, but our buses are nice for when it's too hot/cold/just not feeling the walk. A majority of our dorms are renovated as well.\n\nOne thing I love about going here is that it's competitive but not cutthroat. Your friends are usually not trying to see you fail so they can get ahead. Also, while our diversity isn't the best, it's one of the biggest and most diverse schools in Ohio, which I think is worth a lot.\n\nEven if you don't like football like me, our football games really are so fun to go to. Go to at least one.\n\nI know it's tempting wanting to be closer to home. I live half an hour away from OSU but have only gone home maybe 5 times this semester. You may want to leave a lot less than you think.\n\nWrote this really quickly, feel free to ask/dm about anything!!",

      "text": "Hey there! Current student here, I can agree that the campus is pretty and the libraries are great and everything, but there is nothing lackluster about this school when it comes to academics. Sure there are easy majors here, every college has them, but if you look at the hard sciences we are ranked really high as a public institution. I can really only speak about my major (physics), which is ranked consistently around 25th in the world. In my experience, faculty has been helpful and not super intimidating although they have extensive research experience and have incredible backgrounds in academia. Since we are a huge school, there are so many opportunities to work with faculty on research projects/extracurriculars if that's your thing (I'm a part of two research labs!). \n\nI understand how bad it feels to get rejected from CWRU, it's a great school! There's nothing wrong with feeling sad about it, but in all honestly, Ohio State as a safety is nothing to jeer at either. The cost of tuition doesn't hurt either :P",

The people who have had positive, impactful experiences far outweigh those who don\u2019t, so make sure you\u2019re on the right side. \n\nPM me if you have any questions.",

After touring a few times and learning about the opportunities, I knew it was right. The amount of networking here is insane and with a huge campus comes a lot of opportunities. CWRU was about 50 minutes away from where I lived, and honestly I knew I wanted to be further from home so I could see the world. The two hour drive to Columbus is honestly nothing, so distance shouldn\u2019t scare you. For pros, I really do think there are a lot for OSU. For one, as I said, the networking and opportunities. Then, the amount of clubs and groups you can join is just spectacular. There really is something for everyone, and if you don\u2019t see something you want, you could easily find a group of students to start something with. I could honestly go on and on\u2026",

      "text": "Here's a long post about why you should go to OSU.\n\nThe TL;DR is that OSU provides you any opportunity you could want, and the reason I chose it over Case is that it can do things other universities can't. For now, you'll have to trust me, and then you'll learn it for yourself.\n\nI'm a senior at OSU currently from out of state, and the last college I was considering before I decided was Case.  That said, my mom grew up in Avon Lake, so I also knew Cleveland better than Columbus. I understand what you love about Case Western, and what you fear about Ohio State. Sometimes I wondered what it would be like if I had gone there. You shouldn't wonder. I wondered because I didn't accept that OSU is amazing early enough, and it made me unhappy for nothing. \n\nKnowing only the bare bones about you from your profile, you might think that OSU isn't what you want. It's not Case. The football and the drinking are very much real things. You live in Ohio, so you know the general picture. The school is massive, and it's the place where everyone from your high school is probably going anyway.\n\nYou're worried that no one cares about anyone at a school so large, and that no one maintains their individuality or their self-determination. You worry you won't meet people who enjoy the things you love, and who care about the things you value.\n\nYour concerns aren't entirely accurate though, and if you focus on the things you hate about the school you attend, you won't see the school as it is.\n\nFirst and foremost, the defining magic of Ohio State is that everyone on this campus  is bonded by the university. Everyone who goes here, past, present, and future, will be your ally in time of need.\n\nSecond, OSU has more money to fund everything - your research, your personal projects, your sophomore year grant, the seminars you'll seek out freshman year, the numerous Olympic swimming pools, the construction that consumes the campus each year and currently is moving toward a new music building right as I leave (I'm a music minor and a CS major).\n\nThe computer science department celebrated two 10 million dollar NSF grants this August. This school can obtain the things you want, and it's up to you to get it. \n\nThird, OSU has over a half million living alumni. They're honestly hard to avoid. They'll be your allies for the rest of your life. They're the real proof of the university, and they'll know what going here means. If you end up going here, I promise you that friendship and that allyship. You won't believe me yet. Someday you will. I have a video of students helping each other across an obstacle course in the main pool, forming human chains to move forward, that I took the first week I came here. \n\nOnce you know what this university is about, you'll remember it. You'll want to tell stories about it. I'm still holding back rambling about how many separate AI classes there are, or how one of our alumni first circumnavigated the world without machine power, or how Jesse Owens quotes appear in the gyms, or how the staircase in Dreese is covered in hopeful graffiti and the stickers of a voice tech startup. I want to tell so many stories here.\n\nThe real downside of Ohio State, the only one that I regret still, is that it takes work and discovery to make the potential of this university all come out. You'll have to ask more questions, seek out more help, and introduce yourself more often. The people who regret going to OSU when they graduate are the people who didn't do the amazing things. Seek out research, join a band, put red tape everywhere, work out at a building so massive it seems like a fortress, join an internship or a startup, go axe throwing, go to office hours. For the love of all that is holy, go to office hours, and ask your professors everything you can.\n\nEvery time I have invested in this university,  it has rewarded me tenfold. A week from yesterday, I'll play at  the winter commencement for thousands of people who achieved their goals here. This May, I'll celebrate my own graduation from Ohio State. If you're up for it, I hope you come here next August and enjoy the four years ahead of you.",

      "text": "Hi! I was also rejected from Case Western, wanting to go there because of the short commute and their prestige. I then settled for Ohio State and I have to say, I love it here.\n\nSocial life: The school is HUGE. There are many people from many backgrounds. We also have hundreds (1.4k, from the [website](https://activities.osu.edu/involvement/student_organizations/find_a_student_org/)) of active organizations ranging from archery to board games to martial arts to the Boo Radley club (random acts of kindness club). If you put yourself out there, it\u2019s very easy to make friends.\n\nSchool spirit: Game days are a blast. Everyone is 100% Buckeye Culture which makes it so much better. Even if you don\u2019t enjoy football, I think experiencing the atmosphere and vibe of the games is something you should try once.\n\nFood: Pretty good, actually. Due to the shortages, OSU has lost some pretty well-known establishments and selections, but there\u2019s still solid spots. We have a Swipe-system, which means you have 10 or 14 meals a week. There is also plenty of food options off-campus.\n\nDorms: Some of OSU\u2019s dorms are pretty nice, save Mack Hall or Canfield and other old-ass dorms. First-years can pick the general area of where they want to live (North, West, or South campus), but not the particular dorm. First-years tend to get the less-desirable dorms on campus \u2014 but that\u2019s okay, because now you\u2019re surrounded by other first-years in the same struggle. A great way to bond with others.\n\nAcademics: Hit or miss professors, like anywhere else. Chemistry department is dogshit though, so good luck if you\u2019re taking any chemistry courses. There are many people who take courses at C-State and transfer the credits over, which is what I heavily recommend. \n\nJob prep: OSU is favored by many potential employers looking to find interns. There are many career fairs and job opportunities and preparation events. Many opportunities to network and build connections here. Our bountiful amount of organizations could also grant you experience that you could later put on your resume.\n\nCampus: So beautiful, especially in the spring and summer when people are out and about. Several gyms, many eating establishments, lots of greenspace, lots of study spots.\n\nOff-Campus: There is plenty to do in Columbus compared to the rest of Ohio. Columbus is a pretty hip city I feel, so there is a lot of cool things alone or with friends to do if you look around.\n\nSafety: Crime occurs off-campus, but mostly only during past midnight - wee hours of the morning. I am a male, and make sure to walk with someone else if I\u2019m walking in the dark off-campus.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions. I\u2019m happy to answer or further expand on something. Go Bucks!",

If you want to party you can and if you don\u2019t there are also plenty of others who don\u2019t either. The academics here are also a lot better than most people realize, and having such a huge alumni network is great for finding jobs after you graduate. The campus is really big but not unmanageable, you get used to it really fast. and for being such a big school, I think there\u2019s a decent amount of support for the students. I  also think it\u2019s a fun atmosphere with a great sense of community. In general I\u2019d say OSU is a good balance of a lot of different things and I\u2019d recommend it to anyone.",
