      "text": "Take whatever you want. I'm applying to med schools and I graduated with degrees in biomedical engineering. I can tell you now, med schools don't care about your major so long as you completed the requisite coursework and you did it well to boot. If anything, it's great to take a non-science major (hypocritical, I know, but I did engineering because my heart was in it, not for premed purposes). Health and science majors are a dime a dozen. It's very important to have people who can think for themselves and know the world is a bigger place, and humanities make you a better communicator and just more worldly. Take a major that makes you happy and that you're interested in and work hard in your premed courses, everything will be just fine",
