I don\u2019t envy your generation in this regard - although I also think that the whole T20 obsession in our culture is terribly misguided (and I went to an Ivy myself back in the day).",

I think ignoring is the best we can do, given that we can\u2019t control others\u2019 reactions but only our own. But that absolutely sucks and I hope you have other support systems who hopefully understand how stressful and competitive this process is. Getting away to college has helped for me, and I hope it will do the same for you. Hang in there :)",
