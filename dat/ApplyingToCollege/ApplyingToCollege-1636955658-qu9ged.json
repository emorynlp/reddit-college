      "text": "laptops>> i got a surface pro laptop/tablet instead of an ipad and i love it! yes, i did want an ipad for the aesthetics, but i feel like a laptop is more functional for schoolwork. for note taking, i use OneNote. from my past experience, my ipads only lasted about 6 years before apple stopped supporting older ios updates (once it\u2019s outdated, the apps don\u2019t work). i personally like how windows laptops allow you to update and use your device for 10+ years! but of course, everyone has a personal preference :)",

I have the iPad pro, Apple pencil and the magic keyboard (basically everything) and still feel that a laptops os wipes the floor with iPad os.

A decent laptop (don't overspend) and the entry level basic iPad. Helps a lot for notes and such and also for chilling out.",
