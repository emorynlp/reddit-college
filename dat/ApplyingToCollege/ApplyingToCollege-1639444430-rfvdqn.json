  "text": "Good luck to everyone getting results on Friday! I was hoping to do an AMA once I got a look at my admissions file, which I got today, so here I am. I have a collegeresults post that roughly describes my Common App, although I can answer questions about it in more detail as long as I\u2019m not doxxing myself. I can specifically talk about international student stuff at the college and about career advancement (I\u2019ve had a great experience with them), but feel free to ask anything else and I\u2019ll try my best to answer. I just finished my first quarter last Friday :)\n\nAdmissions file stuff:\n(I was an intl student but I didn't ask for aid and I was at a competitive AP-curriculum private school) \n\nActivity level: 4 (don't know what the scale is)\n\nLegacy: Father (master's degree)\n\nSIC: No (don't know this acronym?)\n\nAthlete: No\n\nFirst-generation: No\n\nSchool type: Foreign\n\nSchool status: Priority\n\nI went through first, additional, final, and committee review:\n\nFirst (on 11/5): Academic-1, Personal-B, Intellectual-Y, Vote-Probably Admit\n\nAdditional (on 11/23): Academic-1, Personal-B, Intellectual-X, Vote-Admit\n\nFinal (on 11/24): Academic-1, Personal-B, Intellectual-Y, Vote-Admit\n\nCommittee (on 12/2): Academic-1, Personal-B, Intellectual-Y, Vote-Admit\n\nOn the review sheets, there were tick boxes for \"Reader Review\" such as \"Final review by counselor,\" \"Final review by committee,\" \"Final review by dean,\" and \"Special affiliation.\" There were tick boxes under \"Nominations\" such as \"Academic Likely,\" \"April Fly-in,\" \"CAAP,\" \"First Gen,\" \"STAMPS,\" \"International Aid,\" and \"University Scholar.\" \n\nUChicago wiped clean the comments on essays and everything else :( \n\nHope y'all find this helpful!",
