  "text": "barnard\u2019s reddit page is kind of quiet, so i hope someone on here could help me. would writing abt a female political figure that i disagree with be disadvantageous? the prompt doesn\u2019t mention writing abt someone you\u2019d admire, but rather someone that \u201cintrigues\u201d you. thanks!",

              "text": "Not to get into the whole \u201care colleges too left wing\u201d discussion but I would say that with a super liberal school like Barnard it may be a bit risky if it\u2019s about a left wing politician. I don\u2019t have any evidence to back that up or anything but it just seems like a risky move. Otherwise you\u2019d probably be ok",
