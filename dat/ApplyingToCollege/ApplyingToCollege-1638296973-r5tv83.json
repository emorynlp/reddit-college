  "text": "[SOLVED] for anyone else who needs this, just google the fin aid office and call them, not the admissions office (edit)\n\nI have applied as an international first year student during ED I for Fall 2022, and I require financial aid. I completed and sent the CSS profile but MyAppVU doesn\u2019t say whether it was received or not. I tried emailing the admissions office and they didn\u2019t answer.\nIs this common? What should I do?\n\nP.S. my TOEFL results are also missing from the platform.",
