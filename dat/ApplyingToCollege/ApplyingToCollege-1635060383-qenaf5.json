  "text": "My rec j sent me her letter to look over. She didn't say anything bad. It's an overall positive letter. But it sounded like a bunch of rambling. There were no anecdotes. It was j a bunch of \"he's talented\" \"he is a good person\" \"he can do this and that\" - like it felt very insubstantial. I read it and I wasn't left with a feeling of \"I need this person on my campus.\" How do I politely and kindly tell her to change it by adding more anecdotes? Also, she decided to talk about my extracurriculars as a plain list. Should I tell her to remove it or should I leave it as corroboration for my activities?",
