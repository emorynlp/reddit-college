  "title:": "Question regarding cold emailing for research",
  "text": "I'm currently in the process of cold emailing professors for research and I was wondering if I should mention any courses that I'm about to take or am currently taking. For example, I'm about to start a Coursera specialization called \"Statistics with R\", but since I haven't actually started   \nnor finished it, I don't know whether I should include that. The idea I had was to say that I'm about to start it and should finish within a month, and then say how it will give me the knowledge to contribute to the lab through the form statistical analysis or bioinformatics.",
