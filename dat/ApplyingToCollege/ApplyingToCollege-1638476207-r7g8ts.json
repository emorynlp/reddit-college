  "title:": "Question regarding cold emailing for research",
  "text": "I'm currently in the process of cold emailing professors for research and I was wondering if I should mention any courses that I'm about to take or am currently taking. For example, I'm about to start a Coursera specialization called \"Statistics with R\", but since I haven't actually started   \nnor finished it, I don't know whether I should include that. The idea I had was to say that I'm about to start it and should finish within a month, and then say how it will give me the knowledge to contribute to the lab through the form statistical analysis or bioinformatics.",

      "text": "I don't think it hurts to mention any specific plans to take a Coursera course in R. But overall, you should focus much of your email on explaining your depth of interest in topics related to that research lab and how it aligns to what you hope to study in college. Also, your resume should be able to demonstrate at least some experience/skillset that would add value to their team, like knowledge in R. \n\nHere's a useful guide from Stanford's Office of STEM Outreach: https://oso.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj18016/files/media/file/Tips%20for%20Finding%20a%20Volunteer%20Lab%20Placement%20at%20Stanford.pdf",

          "text": "I definitely agree. The reason why I wanted to talk about courses is because I wanted to show professors that I can truly contribute to their lab. I\u2019ve started a club, non profit, and other programs for high schoolers in the field of biology so I have some achievements, but I don\u2019t really have much experience to show professors. Also, how do I show my passion without making it sound overly dramatic or superficial?",

      "text": "Good advice from others, but I'll add something:\n\nBe sure to look up each professor's current research and recent work, and show in your outreach that you both understand and are impressed by it. Professors get TONS of these kinds of requests each year and generally ignore them, and one way to stand out a little is to show that you appreciate their work as much as you want them to appreciate yours. If you can link your proposed work to theirs somehow, even better!",

              "text": "If I understand you correctly, that's about right? But also try to be aware that professors are GREAT at sniffing out which kids are actually passionate about their work and which are simply trying to bolster applications. I wouldn't write a novel, for sure, but it's extremely important that your email not come off as a copypasta.",
