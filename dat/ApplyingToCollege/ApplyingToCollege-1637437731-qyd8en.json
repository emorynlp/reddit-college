  "title:": "I made a mistake on my UW applications and I'm so nervous",
  "text": "Applied to University of Washington, submitted my apps one day before deadline so i thought all would be fine and well. BUT just now i clicked into my profile again and found a mistake in the EC section.\n\nThere\u2019s this 2-year programme + research opportunity which i mentioned, i calculated the total duration of the whole activity (in weeks) but forgot to divide it by 2. And i also forgot to put in the hours per week on the low end.\n\nNow I\u2019m stuck with 25 week/year activity which is 18h/week, which is a massive overestimation as in reality it\u2019s supposed to be 13 wk/yr and 3-18h/week.\n\nI will email the admissions office about this. But I\u2019m just so stressed out now because I don\u2019t know how much this mistake would negatively affect my admissions and UW is my safety school. Kinda. :\u2019(",
