  "text": " \n\nI've won first place at MIT Virtual Hackathons in the past but am wondering what type of Honor it is?\n\n**I don't know what level of recognition it classifies as (school, state/regional, national, or international)**.\n\nBut I do know that people from all around the world were selected from the initial application to participate. To be specific, my team won 1st out of a total of 295 and 494 total participants respectively. It might also be noteworthy that I was among the overwhelming minority of high schoolers participating in these events (the rest were adults and people in the tech/biz/health industries).\n\nAny advice?",

      "text": "Could you send the link for the MIT virtual hackathons so I can see what the competition format is like? Generally, even if competitions are held around the world but  are split up into many locations, it still counts as a regional award since you won't be compared to everyone worldwide. However, I don't know the specific format you are referring to so I'll need some extra info on that before I can say definitively.",

          "text": "Thanks for the reply!  \nHere's a generic example: [https://covid19challenge.mit.edu/](https://covid19challenge.mit.edu/)  \nThere is only a singular competition per hackathon that has participants from all around the world... It wasn't geographically split up though, and I (my team) was technically compared to other teams and participants that were made up of people from all around the world aka world wide... no idea how to go about this haha. Hopefully the link gives more insight.",
