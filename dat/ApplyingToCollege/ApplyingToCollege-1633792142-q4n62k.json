  "text": "I think it is pretty clear that getting a research opportunity relies a lot on connections. But, I don't think this has been mentioned yet. Not all Science Journals are made equal. Some are known as \"predatory journals\"; these journals basically have no standards, and they will publish anything, often with a huge fee. IMO, I think publishing in a predatory journal with no standards is similar to donating a build to a college joke\u2014you need a lot of spare cash.",
