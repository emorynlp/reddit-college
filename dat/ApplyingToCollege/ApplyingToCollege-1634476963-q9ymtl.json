  "title:": "Need Help Deciding Where To Apply For CS",
  "text": "Hey, so I've just gotten my predicted score for the IBDP and would like some help deciding which colleges in the US I should apply to for a CS or Data Science Major.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm definitely going to be applying to UIUC, UMich, UMaryland, and Purdue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I got a 40/45 predicted with CS, Chem, Math  HL, and Physics SL all at 7, and Spanish SL at 6, but English L&L at a 4 (But an 8.5 in the IELTS), and pretty good ECs. So, I wanted to know some universities that have a good CS or DS course that I can apply to, as well as if it would be a good idea to apply to the UCs as well as the ones I'm already applying to. (And any more suggestions that you might have).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank You.",
