  "title:": "My personal system for easily creating fun, original essay topics. Introducing: \"Half-Ideas\"",
  "text": " In my experience, the majority of problems students run into with their application essays are based upon picking a bad topic. By \"bad\" I generally mean the topic falls into two categories:\n\n1) Done to death\n\n2) Too weird for its own good\n\nThe first one I can easily provide samples for: probably my most common one is running track. A lot of students run track and want to write about their experiences. That's great except that a lot of other students also run track and have similar things to say. There are only so many ways to write about track - see if you recognize any of these classics:\n\n\\- I joined track and was bad at it, but then I tried harder and now I'm good\n\n\\- I'm really good at track and here is a list of my accomplishments you already saw on my EC that prove how good I am\n\n\\- I'm just ok at track, but through the team, I have gained other skills like leadership that are important to me\n\n\\- I loved running track until something made it so I couldn\u2019t anymore. But then I got better and now I can again\n\n\\- I loved running track until something made it so I couldn\u2019t anymore. And I still can\u2019t. But it\u2019s ok I figured it out\n\n\\- I don't actually like track, but in being forced to do it, I learned some valuable lessons\n\n\\- Here is a live recap of me running the anchor on the 400 relay, with every student I pass symbolizing an obstacle I have conquered in life to get where I am\n\nThat last one is a bit of a joke. But it's indicative of the problem that I think drives elite students to get so...creative in the framing devices on their essays. You students know track isn't that special, but it is something important to you, and you want to talk about it. The end result is...well\u2026\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fy37s9/i\\_think\\_modern\\_elite\\_essays\\_are\\_terrible\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fy37s9/i_think_modern_elite_essays_are_terrible_and/)\n\nAnd then the other problem is with \"le quirky teen\" essays. These never seem to work out as well as anyone wants. That penguin collection may be as important to you as you write about, but without anything more substantial to link those interests to, the essay falls apart.\n\nSo, what do we do about all this? How do we manage to write about what matters to us, but in a way that's still fun and original? \n\nThe answer is *half-ideas*.\n\n\"I like track because it taught me responsibility\" is a half idea. So is \"I have trouble sleeping when I'm nervous. So is \"I collect stuffed penguins.\" So is \"I like making people laugh and try to lighten the mood when things are hard.\" A half idea is anything about you or your world that you think colleges should know about. What makes half-ideas different from normal ideas is that we want to come up with these ideas with the full intention of *combining those ideas together to create an original topic.*\n\nSome people stumble upon combining half ideas by accident. I did! I wrote an essay ten years ago that perfectly encapsulated how easy and powerful combing two ideas can be. My two half ideas for the topic were:\n\n1. I have ADHD\n2. I like to run \n\nEither of these topics could be converted into a competent, if unexciting, essay on their own. I guarantee AOs will read hundreds of similar essays this year.  But luck would have it, I combined those two half ideas into a full idea that worked a lot better. All I had to do was look at those two topics and try to find a connection between them. I've found that the best connections will pop out to you. Mine did:\n\n**How running helps me deal with my ADHD by giving me a way to quiet my mind and think clearly** \n\nThe hardest part of my ADHD is getting my brain to stop moving so fast. As quickly as I start to think about something important, that thought gets batted away by garbage. I like running because I find when I get tired enough, my brain will quiet down, and I can think about things that are important or bothering me. I get most of my best thinking done six miles into a run. That's my essay. \n\nI guarantee there aren't many students writing that essay. By combing two ideas into a single one, I make the topic much more personal and unique. I also build myself a natural narrative structure by both presenting a challenge and a way I conquer that challenge. \"How X helps me with Y\" is a great way to frame an essay  Cool, right!\n\nSo let's get practical. The first step is to build as many half-ideas as possible. Just start posting as many ideas as you can. Don't worry about how you'll match them or if they're even worth matching. You've likely heard similar \"just write; it doesn't matter what!\" advice before, but I think that advice kind of sucks because it DOES matter what you write. With half-ideas, you should feel more comfortable posting weird factoids about yourself because you'll no longer have to worry about turning those ideas into a full essay. Just write them. Here are some sample list groups you can start with, along with as many personal half ideas I can think of for each.\n\n**Cool stuff you've done that would make a traditional essay**\n\n4 years Cross Country\n\n3 Years Track\n\n2 Years School Newspaper\n\n4 years Parli Debate\n\nHosted a school zombie tag game\n\nActive non-fiction writer\n\nStarted my own College Consulting business and made a sweet website, nbd (CollegeWithMattie.com)\n\n**Obstacles you've overcome** \n\nADHD\n\nI suffered through chronic illness in my 20s\n\nColorblind\n\n**Weird \"quirky\" facts about you**\n\nI love cats and have one named Penny\n\nI love football and refuse to work on Sunday\n\nI taught myself piano using a video game\n\n**Positive Personality Traits**\n\nMy mom says I'm funny\n\nI'm easy to talk to and once won a bet by speaking about my cat and college admissions for 3 hours straight\n\nI think differently and often come up with solutions for problems no one else has (like this one!)\n\nI see patterns well and am always looking for a more efficient way to do things\n\n**Goals/Passions/Proof of those passions**\n\nWant to be a private college admissions consultant\n\nFinishing UC Berkeley certification on topic\n\nWorked past three years as a counselor with company\n\n10 years of writing experience\n\nThat's just a short selection. Locate any \"idea suggestion\" posts and you will find more topics to think about. \n\nNow that I have my list, it's time for me to look for connections between the two. Often the best value for this method comes when one of the half ideas is from the \"challenges/hardships\" section. This is especially true for URM or any other student with a background hook. You want to present that background but do it in a way that's more tasteful than \"I grew up X, and here's why it was hard.\" Combine that half idea with another interest of yours, so the topic becomes \"How Y helped me overcome my Childhood as X\". Yay half ideas!\n\nWhen looking at my list, two ideas that come to mind are my history of illness + that I taught myself piano. I decided to teach myself piano two years ago as a way of signifying that my life was going to be different now that I was better. It turned out that way, and now I celebrate my piano playing as a symbol of the fact that life doesn't take things from me anymore; I gain from it.\n\nPretty good topic, ya? Seeing these topics all out in front of me made it easy to compare them to one another and see what kind of connections I could identify. \n\nHere are some bonus tips as you develop your half-idea stable:\n\n**Your ideas don't have to share 50/50 content.** \n\nSometimes one topic is just more interesting than the other. Don't be afraid for a single idea to encompass 80%+ of an essay, with another idea coming in as support. Maybe you write about charity work and realize that every time you read to a kid in the hospital you leave him with one of your stuffed penguins. That's exactly why you want to introduce those penguins earlier so you can add it to your experience.\n\n**You can even have third ideas. Whatever**\n\nGoing back to my illness/piano essay, I'd probably also want to add my wish to be a counselor in near the end. Just as I gained piano in my life, I also want to obtain success in counseling. Seeeee? It's so fun and eaaaaaasy!\n\n**Focus on the interaction between the ideas as much as or more than the ideas themselves**\n\nSomewhere out there is another essay involving both a love of swimming and a keen interest in robotics. Simply having two half-ideas existing in an essay is not necessarily going to make it work. Instead, I find it\u2019s the way those ideas intertwine -the connection itself- that is most interesting. I think it\u2019s because that connection entirely relies on you and how you view the world. That\u2019s where the magic happens. \n\n\n**Keep every half-idea about you**\n\nThis goes into advice for another blog post, but keep the focus of your essays on you. Your friends, family, famous people, politicians, and everyone else can cameo in your story, but the vast majority of content needs to be about you. The easiest way to ensure this is to keep all half-ideas that way from the start.\n\n**You can think of half-ideas retroactively**\n\nWrite something and just feel like it's missing something? Think hard about other aspects of your life that may fit into the essay you've already written. Maybe you wrote about a big camping trip. You can bring up the fact that you're always the one who tries to keep the group calm, so when things were rough, you took it upon yourself to provide moral support. The goal is writing an essay that showcases what happens when different aspects of your life come together.\n\n**Try to form your full topics in the form of a narrative**\n\nUtilizing \"how\" is a great way to do this. How my love for paper airplanes made me a better engineer. How my daily NYT crossword puzzle influences my taste in authors. Get both topics in there and try to present one as having a causal effect on the other.\n\n**Don't go insane**\n\nYou may have a topic or two that are awesome and don't need tinking with. Don't! This may be advice for essays 2-27 you'll be writing. Keep the list of half-ideas handy and constantly be adding to it. You never know when you'll be inspired by it.\n\n\\-\n\nHot damn you kids like this one. \n\nI\u2019ve heard a lot of people mention this piece is how you found me. If that\u2019s you right now, hi! My name\u2019s Mattie. I run a private college consulting service in the Bay Area. Thanks to posts like these, I\u2019ve been able to transfer into offering my services to students around the globe via Zoom. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, check out my website at CollegeWithMattie.com. All my other blog posts are on there (they\u2019re also all here if you just check my profile). Also on the site is a list of services I offer to students looking for 1-on-1 help applying to schools. It\u2019s a good time. \n\nReal life Redditors have already messaged me, set up consultations, and are now signed on with me to work this summer and fall. I\u2019d love to work with you, too. \n\n- Mattie",

As a result, I found that I am at my best when working with animals and pondering a reality in which nature and man is more mutualistic. Could this work or is it too far out?",

      "text": "I'm posting this as a comment, but I might wind up expanding on my thoughts and posting my own post in the next day or two (perhaps collaboratively? :)). I agree with a lot of what you said, but there are some specific musings I would like to make. If I don't mention something in the following comment, rest assured I feel there are no musings to be made on the subject.\n\nOn the topic of half-ideas: the thing that makes an idea, or a half-idea, worth writing about is the scope of its ability to represent you. I'm going to use my commonapp essay to express what this means. Reading it will make the points that follow a lot more comprehensible. The document includes two drafts; the first page is exactly 650 words, and the second page is 714 words that I had to slim down into my final draft of 650. I only mention two specific points from my essay, but I've included them as a lot of what I discuss can be seen at several points in my essay.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy essay is, above all, imperfect. I spent months working on it, and I think it is reflective of as much of me as I have the skill to cram into six hundred and fifty words. I started that essay March of 2019, and continued to work on it until I submitted applications in November. I started it in March, and it went through a ridiculous number of iterations before I completed it. The only thing that stayed the same from first draft to final draft was the goal of the essay: to express as many facets of my personality that I found important as possible, without feeling like I was covering up anything about myself.\n\nWhere the part of speech might normally be placed in the definition of a word, I chose to use the word \"effeminate\"; the part of speech of a word defines how it fits into a sentence, and so I decided to use a word that expressed how I fit into a group. Effeminate sums up so many aspects of my personality; it gives the reader insight into who I choose to interact with, the way I view myself, and exactly who it is that I'm okay with being. I don't think this is a half-idea; I think that the word \"effeminate\" is an entire idea, contained within one word, that expresses an entire facet of my personality to the reader. This is where my main disagreement with you, /u/CollegeWithMattie , comes into play. I think it's somewhat disingenuous to title your concept \"half-ideas\", because it will give students and kids the wrong idea. When you say \"half-idea\", you are expressing a concept of division, of incompleteness, or of not-wholeness, and that's not really what you describe in your post. When you say \"half-idea\", I think the word \"facet\" is, in fact, much more descriptive of the idea that you are trying to express to readers - to young adults, and to students, in this case. The issue is that facet doesn't have the same ring to it, which is why I understand the decision to call them \"half-ideas\".\n\nMy other disagreement with your post comes in response to the following section:\n\n>Try to form your full topics in the form of a narrative\n\n>Utilizing \"how\" is a great way to do this. How my love for paper airplanes made me a better engineer. How my daily NYT crossword puzzle influences my taste in authors. Get both topics in there and try to present one as having a causal effect on the other.\n\nThere doesn't *need* to be anything causal about this, and I would go so far as to posit that these are not ideas that belong in the same paragraph or even a pair of paragraphs. If they are both facets of you that represent a greater part of your personality, then absolutely include both of them. However, unless your NYT crossword puzzle influencing your taste in authors actually impacted *you*, your personality, your character, or the perception people have of you, which it is unlikely to be, then I don't believe it should be included. To waste 40 words talking about how you got into Brandon Sanderson because of an NYT crossword puzzle is only worth mentioning if his writing inspired you to write a book, or make a game, or start moderating an online discussion board.\n\nThe other two points I want to pull from my essay are: the breaking of rules, and the use of transitional language. I think that the breaking of rules and the use of transitional language are what ultimately separate \"good\" essays from \"great\" essays, and \"great\" essays from \"fantastic\" essays.\n\nOn breaking rules: don't. The point of rules is to follow them.\n\nBut if you're going to break them, do it well.\n\nThe following sentence is an absolute bother to read: \"I was that annoying sort of child, the one who would ask why, and when he got an answer, he would ask why the answer was the answer, and when he got that answer, he would ask why *that* answer was the answer.\"\n\nThis is the sort of sentence that does one of two things, when found in the opening pages of a book: it will cause readers to either put down a book and swear it off forever for an annoying sentence they found on page three, or it will cause them to grip that book tighter than they've gripped a book in six years and fly through it, before rambling on on the internet on the subject of how the book is so perfectly crafted and breaks from tradition in the most clever of ways and blah blah blah.\n\nI'm not saying that my sentence is perfect, but it accomplishes the goal. It is an annoying sentence to read, in an endearing sort of way. Many people relate to this directly, either having been that kid or having known that kid, perhaps having been the older sibling to that kid. Knowing that someone is the sort of person to go down the rabbit hole of \"Why?\" is indicative of so many *other* aspects of their personality, and by mentioning *this* facet of my personality, I've saved myself potentially hundreds of words to give the reader a nearly identical understanding of the sort of person I am.\n\nThis, I know, is what the point of a half-idea is: to express personality efficiently, by presenting behaviors you have or ideas you hold close that are indicative of so much more.\n\nTransitional language is important.\n\nOr, rather, the other important thing to discuss here is transitional language.\n\nTransitional language is not just phrases such as \"Furthermore\", \"in addition to\", or \"conversely\". Transitional language is the utilization of words that allow a reader to smoothly redirect their train of thought from one point to another. It is selecting language that relates to the last sentence of the prior paragraph, but prepares the reader to turn down a new avenue of thought as it relates to your writing. I don't have much to say on this subject besides for the supposition that half-ideas are best predicated within transitional language, or at least I feel that that's the case. When you present a half-idea^^1 at the end of a transitional sentence, you then provide yourself ample room to discuss that half-idea, and then once again combine the closing of the discussion of one half-idea with the transition into the next half-idea. I'm not sure where this could have fit into the OP, but I think it's an important thing to mention.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI find it doubtful that everyone will agree with everything, or even much of, what I have said here, but I think I'm a skilled enough writer and critical enough of the writing that I do to make my input valuable.\n\n^^1 ^I ^continue ^to ^call ^these ^facets, ^or ^half-ideas, ^or ^what-have-yous ^by ^the ^initially ^supposed ^name ^for ^the ^sake ^of ^reading, ^but ^perhaps ^I ^should ^insist ^on ^facet. ^I'm ^not ^sure ^it's ^important ^enough ^to ^be ^concerned ^about ^it.",

Much cooler fake name. \n\nSomething I hope was implied from my post is that there are really three aspects to the type of essay I promote here: both concepts individually and then a third which is how those concepts interact. That third part is I think the real power in creating a compelling topic. While it\u2019s true that simply writing about fishing and your love of game shows makes your essay \u201cunique\u201d -in the same way a box with a candle and a peanut in it is unique - it\u2019s only in describing the way those two concepts interact where I think the magic comes. \n\nYou give yourself a natural advantage by writing about two topics instead of one. Then you multiply that advantage by spending your precious words explaining how those two seemingly unrelated concepts only make sense together because of your perception of them.",

I feel that the relationship between two half-ideas is only pertinent whereupon the relationship is inherently pertinent. I made an active choice to leave out several things that I could have left in, because I view these essays as a sort of snowflake (if you've ever heard of snowflake drafting before). When selecting your half-ideas and your facets, you want as many things that are as closely related as possible without overloading your reader. My approach to science, how it effects my personality, how it is pervasive in my existence, and my willingness to question expectations - both my own and those of others - are all very closely tied together and represent vast swathes of who I am. The fact that I bug hunt in just about every game I play isn't something that expresses more of my personality than anything I mentioned in my essay, I didn't feel, so even though it could be considered unique, I don't think it would have been efficient communication.\n\nThat being said, many teenagers are certainly not hobbyist writers. Many teenagers are not the copy-editor for their school's literary magazine, and many teenagers don't choose to spend huge amounts of time on r/grammar simply to embroil themselves in a learning of language, so it might be more apt to provide students with the basics of essaying - half-ideas roughly being the building blocks of the best essays - and then go into more depth with those who, on a case-by-case basis, appear to have the skill, talent, and interest as a writer to play bonsai with their writing.",
