  "text": "I submitted my application to Barnard the other day, however, I didn't submit the optional supplement essay since I felt like it wasn't good enough. Will it harm my chance of getting into Barnard? I think my other 2 supplement essays & the rest of my application are pretty good but I'm an international student asking for aid so I'm afraid they might reject me.",
