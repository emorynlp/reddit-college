The head of IT where I did my internship accidentally submitted my letter of recommendation using his person email (@gmail.com) instead of corporate email (@companyname.com). Is this a problem? What should I do?",

      "text": "I don't think it's a problem. I can't imagine why that would cause an issue. \n\nIf the admissions committee thinks you wrote the letter for him and submitted it from a made-up account, they'll contact him at his work email. But it won't come to that because if he wrote it himself, they'll know from the language it's real. Teenagers are bad at fraud.\n\nSource: I write and read letters of rec all the time, though not as an undergraduate admissions officer.",
