  "text": "hi!! i\u2019m a current junior (class of 2023) and i wanted to get some insight on where my grades and achievements so far could take me. here are my stats and ec\u2019s\n\nwhite female, upper middle class, midwest. i go to a large public high school\n\ngpa uw: 3.8, w: 4.8 (we have a weird system though) my school also has a bit of grade deflation. we don\u2019t have class rank but i\u2019d estimate top 20%\n\nACT: 34, might try for 35\n\nAPs i will have taken by the time i graduate:\nAPHUG, APUSH, AP calc BC, AP lang, AP lit, AP gov, AP bio\n\nEC\u2019s/sports: 1yr debate, 3 years unicef club, young democrats, students demand action, played orchestra for 8 years, i volunteer at a hippotherapy place and have a large amount of hours there, student council, i\u2019m on a board for a cancer foundation (don\u2019t wanna specify to protect my identity), competitive horseback rider (i compete at the national and state level), i work at a concert venue etc there are more but this is getting rambly sorry :p\n\nawards: honor roll and french honor society? i have awards for horseback riding too idk if that would go with sports or awards\n\nintended major: undecided but interested in political science history and bio\n\nso far i\u2019m looking at tulane, emory, tufts, USC, lehigh (legacy), UNC, UGA, CU boulder, vanderbilt and brown (dream school)\n\ni loved tulane when i visited but i\u2019ve heard that it doesn\u2019t have the best rep and it\u2019s pretty homogenous so idk how i feel about that. i love the vibe of brown so any schools similar to that would be cool. i\u2019m pretty far left politically but i don\u2019t need to be in an echo chamber or anything lmao as long as you don\u2019t stick me at frickin byu i\u2019ll be fine. i would prefer schools in the 8k-15k undergrad range but bigger or slightly smaller is ok. i would also prefer a campus closer to a city since that\u2019s how i grew up, suburbs are fine but campuses like cornell are too far \n\nmy only limitations are no notre dame or other very conservatively christian schools (im jewish), no byu or liberty university (i value my sanity) and i\u2019d prefer to get out of the midwest (polar vortexes bad)",
