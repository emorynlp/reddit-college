  "text": "I'm rewriting my common app essay and am not sure what topic to pick. My first idea is to talk about this food and basically connect it with various parts of me, it'll show more of my personality but in a friendly/happy way. I think this can be a fun story. My other idea is to write about how my parents both had cancer at the same time. This one is way more personal, but so far I've been trying to steer away from \"sad\" stories. However, I think this one can definitely show my growth and strength. So now I don't know whether to write a fun essay or a much deeper one. Any advice?",
