  "text": "hi yall i just got accepted ed but my friend did not and i was crying for 30 minutes bc we wouldnt be able to go to college together. my friend was deferred so there is some chance but it's highly unlikely. i love my friend so much and would do anything for them and i am just crushed that we cannot go to the same college. ik i will make other friends and can still keep in touch with them but it really won't be the same. i am still crying because my friend deserves this more than i do and i wish we could even trade place. basically im depressed af about friend's deferral and am looking for support before i break down again tmmr after seeing them",

      "text": "There always comes a time in life when you are forced to part with people you have created special bonds with. You may think that life sucks. I mean it does LOL But surely not in this case. This is going to make the mutual respect, love, understanding even stronger and unbreakable. God knows what would have happened if you both ended up attending the same college. So instead, be happy that you got someone so important in your life that makes saying goodbye so hard. At the end of the day, you got their back, and they got yours <33 Let them go, venture out, seek something new. Then you\u2019ll reunite in most unpredictable and surprising ways. Much love and take care",
