  "text": "Background: I was recently affected by an EF3 tornado. Wrecked my property, and while insurance will cover our house damage, the rest is left to my middle class parents for out of pocket payment. Some colleges have given me a fee waiver after I emailed them, but Boston U said I can do it by selecting the \u201cyou can provide a supporting statement from a counselor\u2026\u201d option on the Common App. My counselor is a sub and not aware of my situation, nor do I feel the need to make him aware. BU said I just need to fill out a form afterwards and not necessarily provide documentation \u2026 is that ok? Will my counselor see on his dashboard that I requested one?  TIA",

      "text": "i believe your counselor will have to confirm that you need a fee waiver (for the common app). maybe just inform them that paying the app fees will be difficult for your family without going into specifics? + ask if you could get a fee waiver \n\n^^ that's what i did, at least",
