  "text": "TLDR: Can an undocumented parent house an International Student? \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to look for answers for this question, but I have yet to find any or I\u2019m just not wording it correctly\u2026 so the question is regarding housing an international student in a house that is rented by undocumented parents. \n\n\nEssentially my bf would like to study at a community college in America, but I\u2019ve been worried about what address he would have to put down when it comes to his housing situation. My parents have said that they are willing to take him in and have him live with us while he looks for a place to stay. I\u2019ve read that he shouldn\u2019t say he knows someone in America since it can lead to immigration thinking he would like to overstay his visa, so then what would he put as an address if this is the case? \n\nShould we book a hotel for the time being, and write that as an address? I just don\u2019t want to get my parents in any type of trouble. They pay taxes and do everything a citizen does and I wouldn\u2019t want them to run into any trouble.",
