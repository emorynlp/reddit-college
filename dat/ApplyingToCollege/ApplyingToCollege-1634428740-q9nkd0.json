  "text": "Hey guys!\n\nI was wondering, how much worse is the EA acceptance rate for Northeastern than ED I acceptance rate?\n\nED I is binding so it will probably have the highest rate, but what about EA? They are both due to Nov 1, EA decisions come out a bit later, but how worse are the chances of getting in?",
