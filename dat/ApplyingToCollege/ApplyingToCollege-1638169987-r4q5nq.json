      "text": "Both, but lean toward straightforwardness \u2014 you have four essays, so there\u2019s no need to stick to one style for all four. In fact, switching it up might show your ability to vary your writing style. I think more than 2 essays being from a storytelling perspective is probably a little too much. \n\nTL;DR: Lean toward straightforwardness, but keep some of your storytelling!",

Just a note that because you only get 350 words, it's a bit hard to do storytelling and you risk writing an incoherent essay that sounds like you ran out of space. I swear I spent almost as much time editing and cutting than I writing haha",
