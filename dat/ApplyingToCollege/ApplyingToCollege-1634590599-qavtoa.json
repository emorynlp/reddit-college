  "title:": "1570 SAT -- OK to be one and done? (Serious question)",
  "text": "I'm a junior. I took the SAT and scored 1570 (790 V, 780 M). I'm very happy with the Verbal score, but was surprised it ended up being higher than math. I scored 800 pretty consistently on my math practice tests. I'm honestly debating whether it's OK to be one and done and just accept that this is a great score, or whether it's worth it to take the test again to try and score higher on math.  I'm not sure if really there is going to be any real advantage for me between trying to get that perfect math score or not.\n\nAbout me: I'm interested in T10 LACs. I've got strong grades and course rigor. I'm actively trying to improve my extracurriculars. (Admittedly they weren't the strongest freshman or sophomore year, but maybe I can get a COVID pass for sophomore year, anyway.)  I am a good test taker, and I know that test scores are going to be a strong point for me, which is maybe why I'm obsessing about this too much.",
