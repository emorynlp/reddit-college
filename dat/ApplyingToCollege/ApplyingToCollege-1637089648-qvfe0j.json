  "text": "Hi guys, I wanted to ask if it is possible to send evidences for activities separately. I created a social start-up and wrote a research paper but I am not sure if the universities would be able to see these or if the admissions offers could find any of these activities when they search for my name. Please could anyone tell me what I should do. I would really appreciate it.",
