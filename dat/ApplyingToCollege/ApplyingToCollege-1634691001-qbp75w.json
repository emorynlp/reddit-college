  "title:": "would a redbubble page be an appropriate thing to include in a 'your space' type application?",
  "text": "A couple of schools i'm applying to have a 'your space' type option where they encourage students to showcase interests not mentioned on the Commonapp. I run a Redbubble business where I sell original prints I've made for certain music artists I like and stuff. Is this too informal to include on my application? The business isn't super successful, but only I am able to see my business statistics, so AOs wouldn't necessarily know this. I want to showcase my creative side but I don't know if that's something appropriate to mention.",
