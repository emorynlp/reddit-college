  "text": "this is me overthinking everything as usual. but ok basically it used to say that duke received my transcript on 10/30 (this is when my counselor sent her rec/school report and the transcript) and today i was aimlessly checking the portal and it now says my transcript was received today, 11/13? i'm so confused because no updates to my transcript were sent in?? if anyone know what this could mean lmk it probably doesn't mean anything but i'm so curious\n\nedit: i just checked and literally all of my other early portals say this too i'm so confused they all used to say it was received on 10/30",
