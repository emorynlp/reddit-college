  "text": "Yo guys. I am an international student who wants to study in usa/canada/even uk. I have very strong academic scores (more than 95 percent) in high school along with  130 duolingo English test scores. I didn't give sat/act.\nNow problem is that I want to study cs but I took biology in my 11th,12th because we can take either biology or mathematics. Actually I am more into logical subjects like cs, engineering or physics.\nHow can I study these subjects. Can I complete my 11th,12th math deficient high school credits in campus or in community colleges or any other solution?\nPlease tell me I am a very passionate student.",
