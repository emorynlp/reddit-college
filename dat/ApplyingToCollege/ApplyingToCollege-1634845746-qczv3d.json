  "text": "I am a cbse student and scored 95.2% on my 12th finals, I want to study psychology and want to apply to singapore but am not sure which universities will take in students with the same percentage as me. I know my scores are too low for NUS and NTU as they mostly take in students who have 97% and above. I am not very familiar with other singaporean unis so it would be great if someone can guide me, i am taking my SAT and TOFLE this dec and i have some Ecs nothing too great tho :(",
