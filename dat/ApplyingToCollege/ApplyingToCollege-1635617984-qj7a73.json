You\u2019ll also be asked to enter your courses in progress for year 12. If you apply through Common App, we'll email you with instructions on how to self-report your courses after you submit the application. If you don't have a myIllini account yet, wait until you receive our instructions.\n\nhttps://admissions.illinois.edu/FAQ/applicant-freshman",
