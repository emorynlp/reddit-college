  "text": "I\u2019m applying to a few schools that state that you must apply by Dec 1 in order to qualify for some things. For example, UPitt honors college and BU scholarships state this \u201cby dec 1\u201d on their website. I\u2019m wondering if that means I should submit it today (Nov 30, 11:59) or tomorrow (Dec 1, 11:59). Please help!",
