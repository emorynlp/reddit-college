          "text": "Great questions!\n\n1) Was Cal my first choice?\nBerkeley was not my first choice if I\u2019m speaking honestly. Originally wanted to end up more in the Boston area so MIT due to the biotech industry there, but San Francisco is another biotech hub as well. Jennifer Doudna is also one of my role models, so Berkeley was a close second.\n\n2) Did I apply to other UCs?\nI applied to UCLA. (To be honest, only because I wanted to play the song if I got it). However, I ended up tailoring my essays towards Berkeley\u2019s culture, and I honestly do think the UCs consider fit. I ended up being waitlisted at UCLA.\n\n3) What do I like?\nI can give a brief summary for now, if you have more specific questions, definitely ask. I love the research culture here. Not only are a lot of people I know involved, but the projects that are being done are amazing. The urban aspect gives you a lot to do in terms of resturants, hiking, going to San Francisco, visiting Tahoe, etc. I am also surrounded by such astonishing minds that it can be intimidating but also motivating. There\u2019s so many clubs that it\u2019s quite easy to get involved. I also do think we have party culture, Greek life, and school spirit, so if that\u2019s what your kid wants, I don\u2019t think they would miss out, but we\u2019re probably not as well-versed in these aspects as other schools. I also do like the classes offered.\n\n4) What do u dislike?\nI will be transparent. With big schools, come issues. Unless your kid is MET or regents, class registration will be a pain, wifi might be overloaded at times, housing is difficult to find, and the school does tend to look at you as a number. However, a lot of these issues help prepare us for the real world better than other schools. Instead of waiting for opportunities, I see so many cal students know how to take initiative, adapt if there are obstacles, and work harder than the guy next to them. We\u2019ve even had recruiters that say they hire cal students because they know we can handle working independently. There is also crime, but as a girl, I haven\u2019t had anything happen to me so far. You just need to be smart. There are also issues in terms of the competition to get into popular clubs like consulting but again, like the real world.\n\nHope this helps!",

                  "text": "Yeah for sure! I\u2019m not too sure about the other UCs, but when I think about LA, SD, and Berkeley, they seem to have different colors per say that pertain to university culture and overall - fit. If I was set on LA for example, I would have been more creative, out-of-the-box, and more about who I am than what I\u2019ve done in the essays. Cal on the other hand is different IMO. Cal is more about what have you done, what do you have potential to do, and how is that change going to make a larger impact. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re aware but Berkeley (also side not but cal and Berkeley are the same) has a large protest culture with the free speech movement starting here. Berkeley looks for those who aren\u2019t afraid to use their voice and want to make change, and they want to see that in the essays. They like to see how you\u2019ve made these impacts, why you did (just a little), and what you learnt (that ties into how you\u2019ll translate that project or skills to the university). They also do want to know quirks about you like I talked about my poetry (bio major here) but tied that into skills I learnt and perspectives I gained that are valuable that I can bring to college. I also think Cal wants people that are eager (hungry even): to be involved, to innovate, to inspire. Some other parts of the cal culture I would say is our research (most Nobel prize winners come from cal), free speech movement, sustainability, and independence that most students need.",

I don\u2019t think we\u2019re more toxic than the toxicity you will see at any other top tier school. I have seen a bit in terms of leaving a hard midterm and hearing some dumb people brag about their grade and how it was \u201ceasy,\u201d but nothing to like the idea of ripping out pages in a textbook (completely false perception). I will acknowledge that since there are a lot of students, you feel like you have to compete more and to some extent you do, but that\u2019s like the real world.

This year will look different with the UCs going test blind again so GPA matters a lot.

Speaking to Berkeley, there is some crime and NorCal does not have ideal weather all year (no snow though so I\u2019m not complaining because my hometown gets sm snow)\n4) The university will not hold your hand. If you start falling behind, there are so many resources to help you, BUT YOU have to take initiative to reach out\n5) Definitely hard to find housing since freshman as the only ones guaranteed, so you have to be diligent, and housing costs are higher here. (They are adding a lot more campus housing in the next few years though)\n6) A few of the dining halls are questionable and wifi has been unstable a few times lol\n\nHope your dreams come true. Good luck!",

Definitely, do not wait to submit later with the deadline being so close. You would much rather submit without the score than not submit at all. Once you get the score, it seems that you have to coordinate with the TOEFL office because they have to send the score to each admissions office themselves. You would give TOEFL each school\u2019s code like 4833 (admissions office code) that you want to send your score too right when they come out. Then you want to confirm with TOEFL that they were sent. As long as this happens before January, you should have absolutely no issues, so please don\u2019t stress.\n\nI opened a new application to try to see the format for this section, and it seems to be able for you to indicate that you took the test and are waiting for your score, so you are golden! Good luck!",
