  "text": "First post.\n\nI have a fee waiver from my school (college board fee waiver) for the UC system. My counselor told me to select paper/check payment when I submit the application and to put the fee waiver inside the envelope. I'll get to apply to 4 UC colleges for free, according to my counselor. \n\nAnyways, I was wondering if on the off chance the fee waiver doesn't get accepted, would I lose my application? So would my application not go through? What about if regular payment fails? Let's say a check bounces (or whatever the term is). What would happen to the application? Would your application still go through as long as you pay later?\n\nThanks",
