Check Naviance if your school uses it and look at the scatterplots for both SAT and ACT. Ivys and other similar schools look at you differently for around every additional 30 SAT points or 1 ACT point that you get. The difference between at 1560 and a 1570 in those scatterplots can be insane at some schools. Same goes for a 35 or a 36.",

                  "text": "1. Yeah Naviance isn't too good, but you can get some basic data for colleges that a lot of people from your school apply to.\n2. As someone who personally knows someone who has worked at Harvard admissions, it is my understanding that SAT and ACT scores in the modern day are used to group people into buckets where they are reviewed differently. Yes, you can't get into school on your SAT scores alone--I know too many people who have tried to do that and failed. But essentially, if you are a White or Asian non-athlete who is not first to go to college, this grouping affects how schools will compare your narrative with another similar applicant's narrative (and I'm sorry, unless you are some next-level applicant, your application will be similar to at least a few other applicants). They would always rather take the 36 ACT New England Conservatory cellist over the 35 New England Conservatory cellist. In this way, yes, small differences in SAT/ACT scores do matter. Should you take the ACT again at a 35? Ehhhhh, I'd say it's not worth the studying.\n3. I want to stress that the SAT/ACT IS NOT the most important thing in your application--not even close. I can understand that everything I said here makes it sound like I believe that it is, but I'm just getting a little bit into the weeds here and being super technical about this. Yeah, you get placed in a higher-level bucket if you have a higher score, but unless you are an extremely borderline applicant, it probably won't tip you over or under the edge.",
