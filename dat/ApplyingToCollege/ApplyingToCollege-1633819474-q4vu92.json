  "title:": "High GPA, low class rank?",
  "text": "I go to a semi-competitive public magnet school (1300 avg SAT, \\~35 national merit finalists each year), and I have 1 B total so my GPA is 3.98 UW/4.76 W. At a normal school this would be fine, but the issue is my school hyperinflates grades, so my class rank (based on UW GPA) is around 80-90/330, or just about the top 25%. I'm taking the most rigorous possible courseload (13 APs, plus several more post-APs and magnet classes) as well, but my rank based on WGPA is not much better as nearly everyone else in my school also takes the most rigorous possible courseload.\n\nHowever, looking at the common data sets from top colleges, being within the top 10% of the class is basically a hard requirement for getting into a T10, which really worries me as I'm far outside of that. The only saving grace is that 1) my B was in an AP humanities class while I'm a STEM major, and 2) class rank is unofficial for my school and doesn't get reported to colleges (but I'm sure colleges could tell when they see my 3.98 in sea of 4.0s from my school).\n\nSo I'm just wondering, how would colleges view an application like mine, where I have a high GPA and rigorous courseload but horrendous class rank? People usually say that 1 B doesn't make a difference, but what about in extremely exceptional cases such as mine?",

      "text": "For selective schools, the AO who reads your region knows your school and has a pretty decent handle on what your grades mean. They almost certainly read a dozen or more apps from your school every year. They probably know which is the hard APUSH teacher and that no one ever gets an A in first semester Chem or whatever your school's quirks are. \n\nFor state flagship, that process school many applications,  it can hurt. This is why most top HS have moved away from ranking at all.",

          "text": "Wait I am kind of confused by what you are saying. Wouldn't I instead benefit in the selection process for state schools since they would only see my GPA/courseload (as my school doesn't report rank and only does it unofficially), while I would have lower chances for selective colleges since they know my school is super easy and everyone gets straight As?",

              "text": "I think what the comment above is saying is that for private/ out of state selective schools, there will probably be a few applicants from your school and through them they get to know the little quirks about your education. \n\nState flagships are often applied to way more often and therefore there is a much bigger pool of students from your school that your application is compared to.\n\nIf you are being compared to 3-4 classmates for a selective private school, one B doesn't look too different if only 3 others applied assuming they have perfect 4.0s. If there's 30 people applying to a flagship and you are compared to all of them, that B has a little more context behind it and could theoretically hurt you if the majority of students that applied to the flagship from your school had 4.0s.\n\nHowever I honestly think you'll be fine wherever you go if you are maintaining a 3.9+ at a competitive magnet.\n\nI'm really terrible at explanations, I'm sorry if this was wordy haha",
