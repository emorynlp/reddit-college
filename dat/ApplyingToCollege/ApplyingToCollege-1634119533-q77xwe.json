      "text": "Financing is going to be one of your biggest issues. You might be able to get some funding through CSGP or provincial grants; and, some US schools have cross-border agreements to grant Canadians in-state tuition. Most of these are in Florida and apply to all Canadians though some are in North Dakota, Minnesota, and elsewhere and only apply to Manitobans or Ontarians.\n\nA great place to start is the EducationUSA Canadian site: [https://www.educationusacanada.ca/](https://www.educationusacanada.ca/)  Bonne chance pote! (Mais je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9: bon poutine et le hockey sont rares.)",
