  "text": "Does anyone on this sub think or know if leaving NHS would affect me in anyway after I\u2019ve been accepted to my dream school? I received a nice scholarship offer from the school and I was just wondering if that amount would be affected in anyway by leaving NHS. I understand staying in would likely open me up to other scholarship opportunities but I think I could make up for it. Idk if I should just stick it out, but my chapter is so poorly ran and it\u2019s just something I don\u2019t really believe in because everyone\u2019s just in it to pad their resume.",
