  "title:": "Fake cumulative report",
  "text": "Yep, this title is misleading lmao\n\nSo I am an international student and my school does not give out cumulative reports but instead like half a dozen small report cards.\n\n(What I do have are official transcripts, two for every year that I have completed. \nFor grades 9 and 10 (and every preceding year), it is one for the first semester and one for the whole year.\nFor grade 11, it is one for the first semester and one for the second semester)\n\nI asked my counselor and she said that if I designed a template that is similar to how your cumulative reports look, she could fill my grades in and also get the stamp and everything. Is that possible/legal and if so, could someone pm me how this report looks like for you?\n\nAlso, I do not have a report for senior year yet but I could get an unofficial grade report about what grades I have so far. Does that even make sense?\n\nThank you in advance!:)",
