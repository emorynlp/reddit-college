  "text": "Now that the early action period is over, I\u2019m not sure if I should be regretting my decisions or not. I applied most of my targets and safeties early (U of M (in-state student), GTech, UIUC, Purdue, MSU, OSU), and was gonna apply to Cornell ED but last night I made the choice to save the possible money I would have had to spend. But now I feel bad that I didn\u2019t apply to any T15 or T10 schools early missed out on a high chance of getting into one of those schools. Am I right in feeling this or could I still have a similar shot in the RD round?",
