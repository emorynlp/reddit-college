  "text": "Question: If you were admitted and attended a pre-college program at a prestigious university, are you likely to be accepted and does it look good on college applications? As in, since you were already reviewed once and got accepted shouldn't my odds of undergraduate admission increase? \n\nFor reference, I applied and participated in the UF pre-college program for medicine. Will this help me with admissions?",
