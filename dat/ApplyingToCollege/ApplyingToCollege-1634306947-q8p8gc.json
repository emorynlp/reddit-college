  "text": "My parents **mandatorily** will have to retire when I enter my 3rd year of college (i.e. 2024). \n\nSo, should I expect to get more financial aid after my parents retire (since my family's annual income will be 0 after that) from a college that claims to meet full needs?\n\nPS: I am an international student.",

It's \"retirement\" income and is generally not supposed to be used for college tuition.\n\nI do get what you're trying to say though, especially about the assets part but even after retirement, my family will have assets less than $60k (including real estate, retirement funds, and savings) which *I GUESS* is not THAT high for someone retiring in my country.",
