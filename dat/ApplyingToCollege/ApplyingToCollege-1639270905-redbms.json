  "text": "Hi. I have applied to A college, EDII round. Recently I found out that this is not the right school for me and I'm thinking of withdrawing my application. If I withdraw, can I apply to another school through EDII? They say I can only apply to ONE school EDII, but since I withdraw my app already, does it make any difference? If I still apply to another EDII school after withdrawing my A college EDII application, is it considered law violation? Thank you!",
