  "text": "apparently, a lot of yall have been having this kind of dream so here's mine:\n\nI had a dream about Cornell last night. **about opening and reading the decision letter (from an envelope \ud83d\ude32).** and I remember being super excited when I read the first line prob because I thought I got in? HOWEVER, in fact, these two letters were hella sophisticated...really quirky and vague...**they did not tell you anything about your decision.** they were beautifully written but I remembered being **extremely** anxious because I was TRYING TO INTERPRET my decision out of them...eventually I failed.\n\nUnfortunately this is true\n\nI think this is a sign that I'd be deferred",
