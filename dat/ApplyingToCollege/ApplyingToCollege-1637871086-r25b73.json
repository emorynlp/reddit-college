  "text": "Let me begin with saying that this is **not a shitpost**. The thought of possibly leaving my dog behind to pursue education in the US, just makes me sad every single time.\n\nYesterday, I saw *The Dogs purpose*, which is basically why this dilemma started. If anyone of y\u2019all have pets, how exactly are you coping with leaving them behind?",

      "text": "This is a really sad story, but I had a similar thought when I left. I had a pet iguana who had been my best friend since sixth grade (7 years at that point). She was a sweetheart, and I loved her with all of my heart. I was thinking about this, and then Jan of 2020, she died right after I finished applying to all of my colleges. Straight up devastating for me.",

Got into a school 15 miles away and a school 1000 miles away. Going to the further one. I hope their death isn\u2019t too sudden and I can catch a flight home in time, but I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll do it. Installing pet cams might help I think :(",
