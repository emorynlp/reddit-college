  "text": "i told my parent that my dream school was Penn state (you already know where this is going...), and they suggested that i ED there. i told them that Penn state doesn't have ED, and they went online and sent me some article showing that UPenn had ED. i tried to explain that UPenn and Penn state are two different schools and the argument basically resulting in my parent saying, \"there's no point in going to a college if it's not a good one. plus, this school has ur major (nursing.)\" \n\ni was really sad :( \n\nso, i ED to UPenn, but i really don't wanna go. i already got accepted to Penn State (University Park campus \ud83d\ude04 and nursing major), so I'm praying for a rejection Thursday.",
