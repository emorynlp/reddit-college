  "text": "i told my parent that my dream school was Penn state (you already know where this is going...), and they suggested that i ED there. i told them that Penn state doesn't have ED, and they went online and sent me some article showing that UPenn had ED. i tried to explain that UPenn and Penn state are two different schools and the argument basically resulting in my parent saying, \"there's no point in going to a college if it's not a good one. plus, this school has ur major (nursing.)\" \n\ni was really sad :( \n\nso, i ED to UPenn, but i really don't wanna go. i already got accepted to Penn State (University Park campus \ud83d\ude04 and nursing major), so I'm praying for a rejection Thursday.",

And if your mom gives you trouble, point out that you're going to the flagship campus and Philly is not the flagship. If she says \"but UPenn is private,\" point out the in-state tuition at UPenn Vet and hopefully that will confuse her. (Hopefully.)",
