  "text": "I\u2019m applying to University of Georgia and on their admissions website it says the supplemental essay should be 200-300 words. On the commonapp though it says 200-350 words. I\u2019m worried that if I write over 300 words on the commonapp they will cut it off when reviewing it, so if anyone has some insight or any connections to UGA any help would be greatly appreciated!",
