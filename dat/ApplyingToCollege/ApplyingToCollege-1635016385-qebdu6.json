  "title:": "Question about NCP waiver for CSS",
  "text": "I haven't been in contact with my NCP for years and can't get his information so I need to fill out the CSS NCP waiver. \n\nI've emailed schools and looked at school websites to see what their requirements are for the waiver. From my understanding, I have to obtain supporting documentation of why I can't get my parent's information/support and this can be in the form of a letter from a \"high school representative.\" Does that include teachers, or does the letter have to be written by my guidance counselor for it to be considered? I'm guessing yes but want to be sure, and also would a letter from a guidance counselor carry more weight than a teacher's?\n\nIf anyone has been through this process, do you know how detailed the letter from the counselor/teacher/whoever has to be? I asked my counselor but they only told me they haven't had to do this before and aren't sure how to go about it\n\nThank you :)",

      "text": "For my university, we just ask for statements from the student, the custodial parent (the one you live with), and a third party (which could be a teacher or counselor) to verify that the student doesn\u2019t have contact with a second parent. The statements don\u2019t have to be super detailed. If you\u2019re curious about what a particular university expects, contact their financial aid office.",
