  "title:": "UCSD vs. UCSB - Humanities / Sociology",
  "text": "Hey! I\u2019m a senior in high school and having a tough time deciding between UCSD and UCSB. I\u2019m hoping to apply as a Sociology major and I\u2019ve heard different things about how humanities students feel about the different colleges. \n\nFor UCSD, I\u2019m considering Sixth college, I loved the modern look, but open to different suggestions on which college would be best for a humanities major. \n\nI\u2019ve toured both colleges and love them both, but UCSB is a lot smaller than UCSD but is rumored to have a much better social life. \n\nAny help you can provide would be so appreciated!!",

      "text": "I tend to think of UCSB as having broader options for the humanities and social sciences than UCSD. UCSD has some really strong programs (linguistics, international relations, political science), but there's probably less room to explore esoteric subjects there.",
