  "title:": "Question about my ECs",
  "text": "So looking at my common app, 3/7 of my ECs are stuff i did independently (web development, powerlifting, drumming). Will it look weird if my biggest ECs are independent hobbies/study? Also, im worried it might look sus because its not like anyone can verify my ECs aside from searching up thr websites i built, and for that idk where i should list those links. Im also considering adding 1 or 2 more clubs as ECs which i did for ~2 years. However, i didnt spend a lot of time on them (~1-2 hours a week for school year) and didnt do anything significant aside from having fun lol. Any advice?",

      "text": "At the end of the day EC\u2019s are EC\u2019s. I read somewhere that AO\u2019s tend to take things as truth unless they are able to prove them false. If your actually did the things you wrote that you did, you\u2019re in the clear. My top ECs are just hobby projects (and a self-started initiative in there as well), so I\u2019m really hoping this is the case, anyway.",
