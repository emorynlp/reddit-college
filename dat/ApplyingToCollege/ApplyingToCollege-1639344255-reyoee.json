  "text": "Hi. So I know a lot of people have dream schools - so do I. For me, a dream school is obviously possibly a reach and something that you could really see yourself in. \n\nBut, I feel like if I was ever accepted to Harvard, I would pick it over my dream school, still. What do you guys think? \n\nFor ED for example, I feel like I may have applied ED somewhere I really like just because I knew my decisions at Harvard would be extremely low anyways.",

You need to apply to Mcintire in your sophmore year, and they accept approx. 60% of students. Obviously, if you do things correctly with your GPA, your chances go up. But the uncertainty of not getting a business degree when committing as a freshman exists nonetheless, and you don\u2019t have that same uncertainty at Harvard. Harvard Econ is 279374839 times better for a business job than UVA non-business, and i\u2019ll stand by that (outside of the systems engineering pipeline to consulting.)\n\nThe competition is also fiercer at UVA. Anyone at Harvard can get an IB or MBB internship with very little effort, the same can not be said at UVA. This is reflected in the attitude among students - there are limited OCR spots at UVA whereas there are seemingly unlimited at Harvard.\n\nSpecifically, Harvard offers opportunities in finance that UVA simply does not - you will NOT be getting a buyside offer out of UVA, period. \n\nHowever, I will concede the gap between UVA and Harvard is smaller in non-finance fields. I suppose all of my statements so far have been finance-centric, but I feel like finance, being the most competitive industry, is the best way to compare two biz schools.",

I can send hard data if you\u2019d like, but and amount of stress and hard work at UVA could get you to a middle-market bank whereas the same amount of stress and hard work at harvard could get you to Goldman or even the Buy Side straight out of college. \n\nLike I understand the confounding variables here, but I promise, name & prestige & alumni matter so much in the finance industry. it\u2019s honestly ridiculous, but that\u2019s how it is. I can send you data to back up my claims of success coming to people at Harvard vs UVA if you want.",

The way I was thinking was this:\n\nI am a senior in hs, and I want to work in a bulge bracket investment bank, like Bank of America. How hard will I have to work to get there from UVA vs. Harvard? The answer is obviously that it\u2019s much easier from Harvard. \n\nI feel like you\u2019re saying how hard is it to get into a Middle Market bank from UVA vs. a Bulge Bracket from Harvard, which i think is a really weird comparison to make. But I suppose if that\u2019s the comparison you were trying to make, you\u2019re correct in what you said.\n\nNevertheless, this all stems from the original commenter saying they wouldn\u2019t want to go to harvard over UVA if they got in. All I was saying was that, putting aside other factors like location/culture/weather, from a career standpoint it makes A LOT more sense to pursue finance out of harvard because of the opportunities. I think we can probably agree there, but if we can\u2019t, I have a lot of good statistics I could send your way that maybe could change your mind.",
