  "text": "I\u2019ve filled out everything in my EC section to my satisfaction but i\u2019m stuck on one thing. It\u2019s my most important EC that i\u2019m also most passionate about\u2026 I\u2019m concertmaster within my schools orchestra and i\u2019m having trouble finding the words to describe it. I\u2019ve been concertmaster for the past two years and i\u2019ve been involved in orchestra since fourth grade. I basically lead the entire orchestra, tune the orchestra, guide the bowings in my section and prep and perform pieces for concert\u2026 I\u2019m really struggling to find the words for this description that makes it sound meaningful and enthusiastic. I\u2019d really appreciate some help!",

              "text": "hmm... because it's very limited, I would focus on explaining your duties in list form and your impact on the orchestra. \n\nbased on the info you gave, something like \"promoted to concertmaster after 6 years; guides the orchestra both in and out of concert; works with musicians to improve performance\"? not super eloquent but I'm sure you have a better understanding of your role.",
