  "text": "I have quite an interest in fish keeping- different kinds of fish, fish disease, water conditions, aquatic plants\u2026a lot. Should I list this on an application? And would it be ok for me to go into detail about different kinds of plants and fish I\u2019m enthusiastic about or should I just keep it to a minimum? \nThanks",

They don\u2019t want their class to be entirely made of 36/1600/4.0/1st in their class/etc, they want well-rounded people who\u2019ll contribute in interesting and unique ways to their community. If you enjoy taking care of fish, that\u2019s an activity that\u2019s cool, interesting, and unique.\nGo into as much depth as you feel that it\u2019s affected your life. If you barely do it, keep it to a minimum. If its you\u2019re entire life, talk about it a lot.",
