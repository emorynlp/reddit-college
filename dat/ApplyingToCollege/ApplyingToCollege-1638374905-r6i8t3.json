  "text": "I've seen unis give out 15000 off to a few students on the basis of sat scores before but my friend is in a really bad situation currently.\n\nHe has messed up his Nov SAT and is in desperate need to go to a college this year but it's difficult for him to meet the financial requirements, however, he can afford the fees for the first year but not for the coming semesters.\n\nIf anyone knows of any uni  that grants full/full tuition (at least) to transfer students on the basis of SAT Scores than it would be a huge help.",
