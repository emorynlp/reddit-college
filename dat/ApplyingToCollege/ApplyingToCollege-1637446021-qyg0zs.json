      "text": "Hey I went to Stanford for undergrad. You will be fine as long as there is a reason. You should contact them and let them know. Even then, the school will reach out if you do not contact them and will be very understanding. \n\nAs a high school senior, I was supposed to be take Differential Equations and Linear Algebra at my local community college. High Schoolers have the lowest enrollment priority so I didn't get into those classes. I thought I had no chance at Stanford and applied as a longshot with an application written in 1-2 days because I had an application fee waiver. This means my lazy 17 year old self who has severe senioritis never contacted Stanford about this change in my class schedule. Fast forward after my acceptance, Stanford emails me about the discrepancy. I explain it and nothing ever happens. I attended Stanford and graduated just fine.",
