  "text": "So I live in Ontario, Canada and I just started high school and to graduate I need 40 volunteer hours. I have already gotten somewhere around that but i was wondering if i could get money to pay for college if i have a lot volunteer hours. My family don't have lots of money and I know i will have to pay for it somehow over the years but i wanted to know if i could get money for universities like the University of Toronto or McMaster's University with lots of volunteer hours. I heard that people going into good universities just needed high averages and that hours didnt really matter but if i could have both good grades and lots of volunteer hours how could i apply for scholarships or anything like that. Or just any amount of money to help pay for tuition.",
