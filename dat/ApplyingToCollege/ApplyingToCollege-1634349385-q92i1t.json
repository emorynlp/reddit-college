  "text": "I\u2019m planning on becoming a game programmer and writing code for game studios as a career. I\u2019ve taken many community college courses over languages and I am about to apply to some colleges. I just want to make sure i\u2019m not missing any great computer science schools that I should be applying to. My schools right now are USC and UC Berkeley San Diego Davis and LA. I don\u2019t want to put all my eggs in one basket and was wondering about any other good compsci schools. My weighted gpa is 4.065 and my sat is 1450. Thank you! (I\u2019m actually from Indiana and have just heard Cali is probably the best place to go. If there are better places I\u2019d love to know)",

Santa Clara is another solid option.\n\nI would probably want one out of state safety with how competitive admissions for CS are in California -- Oregon State, University of Utah, or Arizona State would be reasonable ones that could offer enough merit aid or WUE discounts to be in the same price range as your in-state options.",

ASU excludes the entire Tempe campus I think, but the general merit scholarships there are pretty comparable to the WUE discounts.\n\nIt's certainly something to check though, as is how limited the WUE offer is - many of the schools that participate only offer it to the top students that qualify.",

The UCs provide zero financial aid to out of state students, and would cost $65k or more a year  (Cal state options are more like $45k/year for out of state).  I think it's hard to argue they are worth that much more than Purdue.\n\nPrivate universities vary a lot more and can meet financial need if you have it - check their net price calculators to get realistic estimates.",

I don't know if I'd recommend paying the out of state cost over in-state Purdue or IU, but UIUC is an excellent school for CS if you can afford it and isn't as bad cost wise as the UCs.\n\nIf you wanted a less selective option to look at, RIT has a game design and development major and their co-op heavy approach might help you get your foot in the door.  They can be good with merit scholarships so the cost isn't usually as bad as what they list.",
