  "title:": "PLEASE HELP. Application Type Mismatch error for University of Washington",
  "text": "I am in the process of applying to University of Washington Seattle on Coalition App, and I am having issue getting past \"Application type - visa\" page because it keeps saying the following: \"Based on your response to the other visa or immigration status question, we believe you have chosen the wrong application type.\"\n\nI hold E2 visa, which makes me an international student. E2 visa holders can still study in the US, and I don't have F-1 visa nor do I plan to get it in the future. So I selected \"no\" for the question asking me if I'm currently on F-1 visa or if I'll need it in the future, and specified that I have E2. But basically for whatever reasons it thinks there's application type mismatch and it tells me to either apply as first year student (and NOT international first year student) or change answers to the visa questions (which I obviously can't do). \n\nI checked the UW website and it says that E2 visa holders are considered international, so I believe it makes sense for me to apply as international application. But I'm just stuck with this error.\n\nPlease Help!!",
