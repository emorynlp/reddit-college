  "text": "Anyone not know abt the SRARs and only got the email november first? I only submitted my SRARs now :( Does that mean I can't be considered for EA? For reference the schools that needed it were Pitt, PSU, and Miami in ohio. Also I haven't even been able to actually submit it to Pitt because I need to link it to my Pitt account which I haven't gotten the email with access to it yet. Unconcerned because Pitt doesnt rolling admissions but the other schools do worry me.\n\nAlso, I just got the email to access the UMiami portal yesterday which I did on time but only got the confirmation email today is that fine?",
