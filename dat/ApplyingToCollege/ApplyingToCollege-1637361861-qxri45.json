  "text": "I am a transfer student at CC. I have just finished filling out my applications for FALL 2022. I have a couple of questions. I am very anxious. When, I was a high schooler, I forgot to send in my SAT scores and high school transcripts. Because of that, I was rescinded from admissions. I don't want to miss anything this time.\n\nIs there something else I need to send? \n\nHow do I send in my official transcripts? \n\nHow do colleges actually see the grades that I have, not just the ones I put in at my application? \n\nWhen is the best time to send in my AP SCORES and SAT Scores?",
