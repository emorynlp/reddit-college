Main thing, those who are on Reddit do not reflect the general student population. Some frequently post giving the appearance of popularity.",

Chicago is similar, although less stem-focused. \n\nMost of the fields you listed are just fields that northwestern does but Chicago simply doesn\u2019t, so of course it\u2019s better by default. But when you look at where they do actually compete, Chicago wins most of the time. The main exceptions are chemistry, where Northwestern is better, and med, where they\u2019re about the same. If you look at things like Nobel prizes, PhD placement, membership of faculty in the national Academy of Sciences/arts and sciences, Guggenheim fellowships, etc, Chicago wins, including for Econ and anthropology.

We're not talking about a mammoth institution like UT versus like Williams lol. The Nature Index accounts for quality, so it's not just about quantity; Nature is arguably the most prestigious academic journal so this isn't just some random ranking. It's also funny that neither you nor the above poster are actually giving sources to convince me, just repeating some variation of, \"well it's just better!!! so much better! no one gives a shit about Northwestern!\"\n\nAlso, where's the claim that Northwestern's \"impact on academia equals Chicago's\"? But to claim that UChicago is the \"only T10 in a 20 state radius\" is just blatantly false lmao. To reiterate, Chicago excels in some areas, Northwestern excels in others.\n\nUChicago is a good school. Take pride in that without resorting to looking down your nose on other schools! I know it probably bothers you that theres another school in your neighborhood that gets attention too, but Chicago(land) is plenty big enough to be home to two world class schools, not just one. Just look at Boston.",

So again, I'm looking for those sources. No one's denying that UChicago is an academic powerhouse! But Northwestern's strengths aren't solely in academia, and seriously insisting that UChicago is better than Northwestern in every single possible way just strikes me as weirdly insecure. Do Harvard kids act the same about MIT? Does Stanford about Berkeley?\n\n>easily top 15\n\nAgreed, and I'd argue it's also in the \"top 10\", and welp, looks like all three major rankings agree.

I'll admit most of my information was from 4 years ago when I was deciding between NU, UChicago, HYP, etc. that I was fortunate enough to get into, but maybe those numbers are outdated, but I didn't mean to lie or just say false info; both school are probably equal at this point academically here and there, though I personally would pick NU over UChicago because Hyde Park fucking sucks.

Just look at average graduating GPA from harvard and then from UChicago and you\u2019ll see. The school is also in a terrible part of Chicago - not only is it dangerous, but all the good night life in chicago is on the north side, which is like 1.5 hours away from campus.\n\nThe kids at UChicago are \u201cquirky\u201d and \u201cnerdy,\u201d and that\u2019s not at all a bad thing.
