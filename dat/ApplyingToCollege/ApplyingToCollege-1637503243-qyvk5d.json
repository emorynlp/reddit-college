  "text": "Will having a startup or an internship at FAANG or a huge open source project help in getting admission at an Ivy league? For those of you who do not know what open source is, they are the code projects whose source code is available for free and you can use them for free.\n\nI am a highschool freshman and am wondering whether polishing my programming skills even more help in getting admission at MIT/harvard/standford, CMU counts too! I have good mathematics skills(particularly due to programming) so ig i'd get a good grade at SAT math. I would be an international student, not a native US citizen if that would help.",

It\u2019s not easy to pinpoint the \u201cwhy\u201d but colleges will have to shift gears in the new world that\u2019s forming from COVID. I will assume the admissions scandal had an effect along with the fact that a load of great students who didn\u2019t get into T10 over the decades have helped other schools bloom thus helping to provide new and better options\u2026\n\nBut more importantly, again, whatever strategy one pins his/her/their hopes on, by the time you enroll the (assumed) admissions focus may have changed, or worse, your target major may change. Will one have enough time to switch gears and find x number of ECs (that one assumes has to be about the major)? Why not devote your extra time to things that really say something about you because you want to do them and like to do them anyway? That\u2019s how you stand out. Because a lot of people can achieve 4.0 or super high test scores. And everyone who reads this will now go out and do the same thing as the OP if this feed deems it appropriate\u2026\n\n(Btw, I love ramen too. But I\u2019ve gotten very picky.)",

You honestly can combine them, which is what I did, but it\u2019s important to acknowledge that (since you\u2019re speaking in economic terms) people will buy a product at a higher price if the product is desirable enough. people will also search for coupons and ask for donations. it\u2019s just the unfortunate truth. could i be speaking from a biased standpoint because of the ridiculous amount of work i had to put on ecs? yeah, but the truth still stands.",

There\u2019s no way to convince otherwise because of fear. \n\nIt\u2019s sad to see. But hopefully, we will also continue to see testimonials describing those who did not get into *the* school and have been happier and more productive in their college careers. Or more people pulling back the curtain or washing off the gloss. Or more people confessing they didn\u2019t get a 4.0, or high SATs/ACTs, and only filled out like 3 ECs, but still got into *the* school. \n\nI just wish every student well (especially mentally).

And maybe(just maybe) if I continue working on my passion I could maybe make it without going to school given that I have a schedule of programming for a lot of time consistently for over an year.\n\nu/localramenconsumer discusses about finding a strategy to **getting** into MIT which is also a great argument because a degree still matters a lot.\n\nI get good grades(3.85GPA for the mid-terms) at school without studying much(i dont really study for the tests because i do not have the time to because i am mostly programming). I guess that I should follow my passion for some years and maybe start preparing for the SAT(i am good at math and essays, i'd need to do the other subjects) in my junior or senior year at highschool. Do comment on my plan, like how's it.\n\nAlso, as startups and NGOs are considered at Ivy league schools, I think that open source should also be considered as they are also fulfilling a purpose similar to NGOs.",
