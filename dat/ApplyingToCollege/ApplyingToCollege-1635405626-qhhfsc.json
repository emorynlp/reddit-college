  "text": "Sorry ik this is an overused question.\n\nI\u2019m applying for engineering at umich, and I\u2019m conflicted.\n\nI\u2019ve taken a lot of AP classes, but got 2s on two tests or didn\u2019t take all of the tests. Im for sure sending my 4 on Lang, but idk if I should also send the 3 on bio since I\u2019m not sending many scores.\n\nThank you!",
