  "text": "Being from India, students around me have ridiculous marks in 10th and 12th (basically standardized nation exam). I have 89 and 91 myself so I well above average but in 9th and 11th I had a school that marks ridiculously hard. 9th is 79 and 11th is 67.\nMy ECs meanwhile are way above average and so are my essays. Plus a 1440 SAT and stellar LORs.\nHow would I compare to Indian monsters with all kinds of grades while I just have EC advantage? \n:\")",

I can\u2019t speak for your percentages in the 9th and 11th since those are internal, but 89% in the 10th, even though well above average, isn\u2019t good since most competitive Indian students get 94+ (at least in icse and cbse, you haven\u2019t mentioned which board you took so you\u2019ll have to figure). 91 is good for the 12th if you\u2019ve taken 2 or more sciences, not otherwise. Your SAT score is around the average. But if you have great ECs and LoRs I wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much just apply to schools where your gpa is above average.",
