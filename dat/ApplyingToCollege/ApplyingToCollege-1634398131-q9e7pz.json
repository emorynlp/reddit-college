      "text": "As long as you can spend enough time on each essay and meet all the deadlines, there is no such thing as too many. \n\nThis factor depends on what the schools are. For example, if it's 15 schools with 0-1 supplementals, then no problem. \n\nIf it's 15 schools with 2-3, then that's significantly harder, but probably still manageable if you're diligent. \n\nIf it's 15 schools and you're applying to all their specialized programs so it's 4-5 essays per school, then unless you can afford to spend literally all of your time writing, it's too much.",

If you are extremely confident in your safeties, you really only need your favorite two.

If you\u2019re only doing RD.  Obviously, some things are easier to complete in batches (form fields, LORs, transcripts, etc). This applies more to essays. \n\n1) do your two favorites in each category: 2 safeties, 2 targets and 2 reaches. Don\u2019t turn in. \n\n2) do 1 more of all 3 groups, e-read the first group to see if you\u2019ve learned anything to implement along the way \n\n3) 1 more target and reach (out of safeties). Re-read groups 1 and 2 again. \n\nYou have 11 now. Rinse and repeat if you\u2019re not already tired of the process. \n\nAdvantage:  1) you\u2019re forced to prioritize your choices in each category. 2) you\u2019re going to re-read and revise your most important apps the most. 3) if you run out of time, it will be with your least important apps.",
