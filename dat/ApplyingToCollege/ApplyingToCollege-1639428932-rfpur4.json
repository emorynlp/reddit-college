According to Auburns net price calculator, cost of attendance for me would be around ~$48,000 after my pell grant. I\u2019m 20 and my parent that is filling out FAFSA has an efc of 0. Not really sure what this means. Am I f*cked for financial aid?",

Best run the Net Price Calculator *before* applying.\n\nIf your EFC is 0, it would be challenging to afford a public university as an out of state student unless the school is offering very large merit scholarship money. Check Auburn's scholarship website to see whether they offer that type of merit.\n\nSome *private* universities offer generous need-based financial aid; privates do not differentiate between in-state and out-of-state",

Cross it off your list.\n\n>I never looked into privates because I was under the assumption that they were super pricey and weren\u2019t too generous with aid.\n\nThe opposite can be the case - selective privates can be very generous with aid. Or not. Run the Net Price Calculator on any college's financial aid website to see an estimate. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.) \n\nFederal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow. Larger loans require a parent signature and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow.",
