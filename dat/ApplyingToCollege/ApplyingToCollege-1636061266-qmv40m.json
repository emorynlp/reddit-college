  "text": "How much does being the 1st place winner in the tech category of a national hackathon as an award? The hackathon had 187 participants including college graduates from UC Berkeley and other schools. Since it was not held by a well known company and isn\u2019t a traditional academic CS competition (like UIL, USACO, etc.), I wanted to know how much weight this carries. Also, which is more impressive, National AP Scholar for 10th and 11th grade or USACO silver?",
