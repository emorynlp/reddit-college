  "text": "In the \u201cDependent Education Expenses\u201d, I have to specify the type of college that my brother is attending. He studies at a domestic medical school and in my country medical schools are undergraduate schools and take 6 years to go through. Sadly, there isn\u2019t any option for this. The closest possible options are \u201cgraduate/professional schools\u201d (since med schools are professional schools) and \u201c4-year public college/university\u201d (but it\u2019s supposed to be 6 years instead of 4 years). Which one should I go for?",
