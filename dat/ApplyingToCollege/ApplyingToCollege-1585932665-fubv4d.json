  "text": "I would think that she would be very frantic and controlling (typical Indian mom lol) but she is so excited and surprised at all the amazing resources of this sub! She keeps sending me links to all these different essay guides and wholesome posts and whatnot. She's so motivated seeing how helpful and driven y'all are. \n\nShe isn't as nervous for me about the college process.  She's learning so much about how brand-names aren't important and how the process should be about your passions and what make you happy. I'm so proud of her and so grateful for y'all! Best part is when she asks me if I've seen a recent meme lol. Thank you a2c for being the bestest sub ever that you managed to teach my hardened mother about college!",

You\u2019re only a sophomore and this process is miles away, but even when you reach your junior/senior year please don\u2019t stress. Confide in your parents, they can, will, and want to help you. It\u2019s a blessing that your mom seems to be so involved in your future applications.",
