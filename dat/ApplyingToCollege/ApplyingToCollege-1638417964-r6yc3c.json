  "text": "it\u2019s the end of the semester and im feeling terrible. i\u2019ve never earned a b in my academic career, but im taking accelerated math and despite spending so much time studying and going to after school office hours/tutoring i only managed to bring my grade up to a 79.5. rounding isn\u2019t common at my school and so i\u2019ll probably end up with a big fat c on my transcripts for first semester of my junior year, which is the most important year, and i feel like i\u2019ve thrown my chances at college acceptance away. if anyone has any advice or uplifting words (i don\u2019t care if you think a c is terrible and will tell me to lower my expectations for my applications, i know, i know it\u2019s my fault) that would be much appreciated as i don\u2019t know how to reconcile everything i\u2019ve worked for with this one grade. has it really ruined everything??",

      "text": "colleges take a holistic view of all grades and classes, and generally like students taking more challenging classes than less challenging ones.\n\nYour C in advanced math is at least as valuable as an A in an on-level one, if not a little more valuable.\n\nEspecially if you improve it next semester, even an improvement to a B would show colleges what they want to see, since it's in an advanced class.\n\nAnother note to help you feel better is you'll have a spot to explain additional circumstances about a low grade for a lot of schools. One example is if it's in a zero-hour class, or your jumping from on-level to advanced classes without preparation.  Colleges understand that, especially if you improve it next semester. \n\nAlso, 1 C really doesnt hurt your GPA that much if you improve your grade in that class next semester. (well.. if your school uses weighted gpa/rank.. but you can explain this to colleges if they dont in additional info) 1 semester of a bad grade is such a small portion of your total GPA by the end of it, the valedictorian in my class has 3 C's in AP classes. (and it's a class of 600, general public magnet school, lots of tryhards)\n\nFocus on improving next semester, I wouldn't at all worry, and like another commenter said, we've all got that class or even a couple that got us.. (for me it was zero-hour advanced chemistry I got a C in, improved it to an A the next semester)\n\nEdit: it definitely hasnt ruined your app. Turn it into a story of improvement and seeking a challenge.\n\nDont make it a habit though, C's can only be viewed positively by top colleges if theres improvement attached to it.. I cant honestly say they're in the habit of admitting many students with more than 4-6 C's at a max from what I've seen unless you've got insane qualifications otherwise.",

      "text": "Honestly, each one of us will go through that one class that will really test and challenge us. Take it as an opportunity to really learn how to ask help, study, and prepare- those skills will help you later in the future as well. If it looks like others around you are breezing by, those people too will have to meet a challenging class and learn how to work through it. If you are like me, you may have a problem with inattention to detail. It\u2019s not necessarily that you don\u2019t know how to do the problems; you simply may have a hard time reading the question and writing math down in an organized way. I can attest to that, since my math grades have usually been brought down by 1.) not reading the question correctly and 2.) just really messy organization. Naturally I do read quite fast and gloss through things a lot, which helps in humanities, but will not serve you well in math. I would learn how to force yourself to slow down and read the entire question. If it\u2019s organization, I would learn to write steps next to each thing you do or draw lines to deep separate them.",
