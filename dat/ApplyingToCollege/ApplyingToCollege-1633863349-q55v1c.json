  "text": "Hey y\u2019all so I\u2019m currently Co Captain of my FIRST robotics team and as of this moment we got two options as far as awards go. We were the winning qualifying team for one of the qualifiers and a think award finalist and I was torn in what to put. \n\nI know it\u2019s not worlds or anything and it is a team competition but considering we are a small broke team in the Bronx this was our second time in our entire school history that we got this far and I\u2019m kinda proud but I\u2019m wondering which would be more important to get onto my common app.",

If you\u2019re a computer science major, I think I\u2019d take off honor roll and have two robotics awards",
