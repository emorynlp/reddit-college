Yes, even if they say it\u2019s optional (you do know that optional means mandatory in college admissions language right?) Your future self will thank you.  \n\nLean into your nerves and let the interviewer know you\u2019re nervous. But I think your future self will thank you. \n\nPrepare ahead of time with your invisible backpack full of stories about you. The best way to answer a question is with a story about yourself. Think of lots of little stories about you that represent who you are and what's important to you. That way you can pull them out as they fit the questions. DO NOT memorize them. They just need to be accessible -- like in a little invisible backpack!\n\nI just made a post about the interview. Maybe you\u2019ll find some helpful info here: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/qotxxj/your_step_by_step_guide_to_interviews_from/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nGood luck!!\ud83c\udf40",

      "text": "Yes, I\u2019ve had debilitating social and generalized anxiety disorder for the past 6 years of my life and doing the interviews was surprisingly really fun? The first interview I wasn\u2019t prepared for and I missed a lot of things that I could have said for questions but the second time around I spent time rehearsing answers for common questions and when I got there I actually did pretty well. The more of them you do the easier it gets but most times it truly is just a friendly conversation",

You just have to answer some basic questions about yourself, maybe why you want to do your major, and about why you want to go to that school specifically. Then you can ask some questions you may have about that school. I promise you, you can do it",
