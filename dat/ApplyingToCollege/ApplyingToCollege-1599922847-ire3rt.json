  "text": "So back in 8th grade me and this popular girl qualified for a scholarship. I really needed the money seeing that my mom only makes 26k a year and this girl already had her own car by the time she was in 8th grade. So basically it was down to us and my teacher was like \u201cThe class has to vote for who they think deserves the scholarship more.\u201d It was $3,000. She didn\u2019t even have to lift a finger. When the teacher asked students to raise their hands for her literally 95% of the class did. When they asked to raise their hands for me...well let\u2019s just say not very many people did. She eventually spent the money on makeup. I could\u2019ve used it for school. I\u2019ll never forget that day. Not only was I embarrassed but it dawned on me how poor I was. I wasn\u2019t just the bullied girl. I was the bullied poor girl. Smh.",

So compared to other countries, we\u2019re older for our corresponding grades.\n\nWithin the U.S., a lot of parents delay preschool or Kindergarten, so their kids get another year of development.

I mean she could have voluntarily withdrawn from the competition or given away the price money to you, but you have to remember - \"not being nice\" is not the same as \"being bad. \"\n\nYou can also fault the teacher. I mean He/She was the adult in the class and could have intervened, but then that would be akin to manipulating the competition\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhich brings us to the last group  - \"95% of the class\" and this is the one that calls for introspection. Sadly this is how life is.  This 95% possibly sees that you need it more, but does not want to be seen as the select few not supporting the popular girl.  It is very likely that some ... or may be most of the 95% themselves are not popular and are the underdog in one way or the other - may be some come from financially challenged background, some from broken family, some are abused, some have health issue, some social anxiety issue, some have learning disability - but they all chose to NOT empathize with you.  This is how society operates.. Something to think about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou also have to really appreciate that 5% of the class that supported you. They knew they were outnumbered. When they saw 95% of the class raise their hand for you, they could have just not raised their hand for you. But they did. That is the positive side. You have some real true friends there.",

It was a horrible lesson early on. Popularity is ridiculous. I just enrolled in a college class where the forum grading is based on AI run platform that doles out points and popularity \"spark\" points your fellow students give you. Popularity contests exist everywhere..you have to find a way to rise above it or exit those environments if possible if you don't want to play. I know I don't.",

              "text": "Hey, I actually didn't mean to convey that I thought you were lying - I meant \"bullshit\" as in the \"unfair\" kinda of bullshit, and the intent was to sympathize with how stupid I thought the process was and how you got unfairly screwed over. Reading over my comment now, I totally understand why you took it that way, and thank you for still responding so graciously. I'll be more careful in the future with the way I phrase things on the internet. \n\nI do believe you because in general I'm pretty trusting of people (even on the internet where it's easy to lie). Once again, sorry for my poor phrasing, and I hope you are in a better spot now :)",
