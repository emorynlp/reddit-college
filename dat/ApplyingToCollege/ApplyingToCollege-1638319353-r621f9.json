  "text": "Long story but I\u2019m a junior and have a really difficult teacher. People are dropping like flies because he\u2019s a sexist, racist, jerk and horrible teacher. My goal was to graduate with a 4.0 but that\u2019s over now. When applying to college is it better to have a B on your transcript than to have dropped a class? Thank you for any advice!",
