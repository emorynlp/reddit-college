  "text": "I want you to know that you are not your college acceptance or denial. You are not defined by what colleges think of you. You are deserving of every acceptance you get, but you are not defined by where you get into or where you don\u2019t. \n\nI wish someone had told me about that before I started applying places. You will end up where you are happy I promise you. And if you don\u2019t, you can always work hard to change that. Ivy Leagues and top 20 schools may seem like a dream but I promise you that you can find happiness where ever you go. \n\nBe kind to yourself. You\u2019ve worked hard and you\u2019ve earned this. Happy decision season. \ud83d\udc97",
