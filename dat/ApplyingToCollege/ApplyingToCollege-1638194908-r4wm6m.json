  "text": "please dear god helpppp\n\nmy non-teacher, non-counselor recommender submitted the recommendation on commonapp for my schools. some of the schools had the 'other' option, so i chose that for her rec. some schools only had 'advisor' as another option, so i put her down for that too but now only the colleges that have optional advisor recs show her letter as completed and submitted. do i have to remove my recommender as an advisor in order for her letter to be sent to the schools with the 'other' letters?? the advisor rec is optional anyway, but i do need three LORs for some of these schools because i'm homeschooled and their admissions guide on the websites say so.",
