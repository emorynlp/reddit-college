  "text": "After calculating my GPA semester by semester, I have a 2.6(w). Ecstatic,  I looked online to mote colleges I would like to apply to, and noticed I won't have enough math credits (3/4 years) to be eligible to many schools. The rest of my stats are alright, so should I apply to those schools anyways? Thanks in advance",
