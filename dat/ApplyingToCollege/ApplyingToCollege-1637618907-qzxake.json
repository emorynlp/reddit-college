  "text": "I have a 1420 SAT and a 31 ACT will have around a 4.2 weighted GPA when my first semester senior year grades come in. I\u2019ve participated in a variety of science EC\u2019s (ex. Science National Honor Society), have a pretty good number of community service hours, and help my dad at work after school. I\u2019ve also taking around 8 ap\u2019s through Junior year and am taking 4 more currently. I\u2019ve gotten mostly 4\u2019s and 5\u2019s on those. I plan on majoring in Business and was wondering what schools would be good to apply to. If anyone has any advice please let me know! Thank you.",

If your resume is very strong, Indiana has some large (albeit highly competitive) merit-based scholarships.  Wisconsin has one with a specific diversity component if that applies to you.  If you're a National Merit Finalist then Texas A&M.  Florida's big out-of-state scholarship has the potential to bring it down to roughly the same as what you'd pay in-state at UGA, but it's highly competitive.",
