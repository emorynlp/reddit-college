  "title:": "can i write a school advocacy project as an ec?",
  "text": "so ive been working on my ecs but towards the end i started putting clubs that im a part of but are not really meaningful to me and i realized that my school has this advocacy program that takes place during our junior year where we pick an injustice in the world we are passionate about and write a paper, do a presentation, and reach out to local officials to try to promote change. my paper was about racism within the medical field (which is what most of my ecs are focused on). i only thought about listing this when one of my teachers asked if she could include it in her letter of recommendation.",
