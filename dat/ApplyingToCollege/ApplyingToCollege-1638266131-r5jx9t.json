  "text": "idk, figured it wouldnt hurt to ask! just trying to gauge things generally lol. i do genuinely love math and physics and have been doing everything that i find appealing to me\n\nim a sophomore-- didn't really get to do much stuff bc of covid last year, but i did teach myself up to calculus 1 and 2! im taking multivariable at Stanford now (the credits arent stanford credits-[its this program if you wanna know more](https://ulo.stanford.edu/)), and i will be taking linear algebra in the spring. \n\n taking AP physics c exams in may. will continue taking upper-division math and physics courses through said stanford program for the rest of hs.\n\nresearch! im hoping to do research under some local profs during the summer (i live near t20s, so might just crapshoot a bunch of emails haha). will probably submit whatever research i do under them to competitions (intel, Regeneron, u get the deal).\n\nother ecs im doing :\n\n\\-i really enjoy game design and am doing an internship at a game studio rn, as well as developing games on my own with a friend(we\u2019re planning on eventually publishing them on itch.io)\n\n\\-ive done a group project in machine learning (presented it to 250+ ppl? not significant but it was fun to do lol), we designed a basic neural network in python to detect exoplanets\n\n\\- i was an international AI leadership fellow/basically doing outreach about AI/encouraging youth ai involvement in programming\n\n\\-i teach introductory programming classes to kids for free through a local nonprofit\n\n-i peer tutor ppl at school in physics, math, chemistry(also schoolhouse.world)\n\ngonna try f=ma, sir Isaac newton exam, usaco, etc. i also have a weird knack for creative writing so perhaps a few niche writing competitions as well. will apply to summer programs + all that jazz\n\npls lmk how im doing yall haha",
