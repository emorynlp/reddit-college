I did a lot of math team/similar activities, a few more general stem contests, and a brief stint working in a lab, but also I did every single band thing (regular, jazz, marching, pit, pep) that I could. I also had a few other kinda unique ECs, plus the usual good test scores/GPA. I don't think I was terribly special beyond the scope of my school though (like no serious scientific projects or special work in CS (the field I'm in now and that I applied as)).",
