  "text": "Hey everyone, so this might seem like a stupid question But i am just wondering if it is even worth the Application fee to apply for 1 or 2 CSUs when I might plan on going to community college.\n\nTo be totally honest, I am not so sure as to which path to pick because one part of me feels somewhat ready to commit to a 4 year but another side of me feels like It needs 2 more years to ready myself up for the college life and not die. \n\nBasically, I mighf plan on going to the community college down the street (I live in Los angeles btw) for free tuition, however I wonder if giving CSU applications are worth a shot given that they are literally due tomorrow. However I dont really know anything about the financial factors that the colleges i plan on applying to contain, nor do I even know mych about them. I am basically screwed.\n\nFor extra info: I have a 3.1GPA, And took about 3 APs in total from Sophomore to Junior year of high school (Passed 2 of thosr exams and am currently taking 3 more as of senior year) , my extracurriculars include 4 years as an active keyclub members, member of csf, former JV tennis player, and used to be in BSA\n\nTbh Idk if any of that matters but I just want to know if Its even worth a shot applyinv to a 4 year CSU given my Terrible stats. \n\nThank you everyone!",

      "text": "Not sure what your major is but the CSU you\u2019re applying to (some) are really close and it would make sense for you to live at home, right?  So if you\u2019re living at home, I would go the CC route to get a couple of foundational years in place and make sure you\u2019re ready. Is there a TAG program for you to get to a UC or a way to transfer to a CSU?  That may be your best financial move and you\u2019ll still get a great degree. \n\nIf you feel like you should apply somewhere, I\u2019d apply to the one you think you\u2019ll likely get in. Have that under your belt in case you change your mind from now til May?",
