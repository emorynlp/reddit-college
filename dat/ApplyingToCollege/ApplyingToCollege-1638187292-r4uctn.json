  "text": "disclaimer: i am pretty sure i\u2019m gonna get rejected but jic\n\ni am also an international \n\nmy mom doesn\u2019t know much about the process itself yet she\u2019s obsessed with it. in a good way, i mean. i know she\u2019ll be very supportive if i don\u2019t get in but i also know she would be over the moon if i do. so here is how i plan to say her (if she doesn\u2019t open it with me which can also be the case cuz it\u2019s like really important for her):\n\nso my uncle (her brother) went to school in Pennsylvania (University of Pittsburgh, not Penn but still), so I want to come to her and casually say like \u201cmaybe we should talk to him.\u201d I rarely say this so maybe she would go like \u201cwhy?\u201d, and then I would casually say smth like \u201ccuz you know, I got into Penn, i need some advice about the state and stuff\u201d\n\nI already see her face and hear her screaming and crying of happiness\n\nthat would be so awesome to do. hope Penn doesn\u2019t let me down here haha",
