Evaluation (he just uploaded a random certificate there)\n3. For short evaluation, listed my eca\n4. Mid year report - submitted my 11th grade test results\n5. Final Report - submitted my 10th grade test results.\n\nI\u2019m an international student. He was so confused about it all, then he should have asked me. But no! He went on and submitted the whole thing.\nAny Counselor here who could give some suggestion on what should I do??",

I don't think it would be a problem for you to have a second account as long as you use only one of them to submit applications.",
