  "text": "Hi all, I was hoping to get some advice. I am currently a high school senior and I just took my first and last SAT this October (all of my past three test dates got canceled due to COVID). I got a 1480 and I'm not planning to submit my score because I don't think it would help for the places I am applying, especially with all the schools being test-optional. However, after reading lots of posts online (probably not the best idea, oops) and talking to peers, it sounds like almost everyone had managed to take the SAT/ACT multiple times or in general have a score to submit which is freaking me out a bit. It seems to me like people still are regarding tests as a baseline requirement despite the optional policy.\n\nDespite every school being \"test-optional\", do y'all think it will still be a disadvantage if I don't submit any score? Should I just submit my score anyway or could it hurt me if the schools I am applying to have average scores above the one I earned?\n\nThank you so much in advance! Any help is much appreciated. :)",
