      "text": "If you can find 2 years of courses to take at CC that will transfer to 4Y, then it could make sense.  Be aware that many schools won't let you meet requirements in your specific major using transfer credit.\n\nIf, during the 2nd year at CC, you will end up taking a bunch of courses that won't transfer, then it may not be a great idea.  Then again, you come out with an associate's degree.  If you decide not to attend the 4Y school (or don't graduate) then that could still be useful.",

Maybe, one of your reach/target schools would be able to answer some questions. They are, of course, super busy, but you could start with an email and ask about a phone call, Sometimes for \"FAQ\", there is a template that can be shot out. In most instances, Transferring is straightforward and is directly dependent upon spaces available. But, you have not only your secondary school transcript but have demonstrated your ability with college-level courses.",
