  "text": "Title says it all. I'm a senior in hs and I'm kinda worried I won't be able to make any friends in college. I'm trying to go out of state to avoid the people where I live, but I'm scared the place I'm going to is gonna fit a certain stereotype. Like if I go to a college in Ohio, am I gonna get Midwesterner types that I don't fit in with at all, or if I go to some big city am I going to meet a bunch of anti socials that had their friend group solidify in elementary school? Am I right to have these fears? Or are people pretty much the same everywhere you go?",

      "text": ">If I care about the social life at my college, does it really matter which college I pick?\n\nIn some niche situations yes, but generally no.  If you don't want to join a frat or sorority then you may want to avoid schools where 40+% of students are Greek.  There aren't too many schools where that is the case.  Likewise, if you have a distaste for people of a certain political or religious stripe then there are other schools you may want to avoid.  Outside of those two scenarios, my sense is that it isn't much more difficult to make friends one place than it is another.\n\nI would be wary of making sweeping generalizations like, \"If I go to a school in Ohio it will be all 'midwesterner types' with whom I don't fit in.\"  It really depends on the particular school in Ohio, for one.  But, beyond that, it's simply not the case that everyone from the Mid-West is exactly the same.  There are queer midwesterners.  There are both conservative and liberal midwesterners.  There are midwesterners from the city; there are others who grew up in the country.  As a whole they skew white, but it's certainly not all white people.",
