  "text": "Where on the common app where does it ask for Planned AP/ IB Tests?  I do not see it under the Testing section as I've been told.  I'm unsure what tests I will take, so just planning and trying to determine if this all has to be figured out for the Common App since I want to avoid having to report changes later.  Is it better to be cautious and under-report planned tests if I am unsure? ",
