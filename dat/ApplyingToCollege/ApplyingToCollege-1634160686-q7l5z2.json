  "text": "Before I took the SAT I remember reading on here how people hated it and I remember thinking psshh it can't be that bad...\n\nWrong. Two months later, after spending tons on fees I've had it. It was beyond stressful actually trying to get to testing centres due to lack of sites and a lot of people on here have faced problems and cancellations, which isn't justifiable with the amount paid. It is not worth the stress. \n\nI hope colleges/universities continue with this test optional policy or implement a better, alternative option. Something has to be done about this monopoly from CollegeBoard and ACT.",

      "text": "Even if they make schools test optional, competitive students are still going to take it. It's still going to be the same stressful process with us comparing ourselves to people who did better than us and questioning if we should even put down our score. Now that test optional exists, colleges are probably only going to see scores within the 1400-1600 range and while they say it doesn't matter, I'm sure it'll influence them at least a little bit like an unconscious bias. What they need to do is get rid of it entirely, but that is not going to happen because so much money is made off of these exams. Students buy prep books, spend thousands of dollars on prep courses, pay for each exam, each retake, and they even charge us each time we want to know what we got wrong. They may have gotten rid of subject tests, but that's because they're similar to AP tests and they'll make more profit off of AP tests anyway. Just to top it all, they call themselves a nonprofit organization.",
