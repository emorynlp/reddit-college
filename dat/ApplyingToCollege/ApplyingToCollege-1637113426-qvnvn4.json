  "text": "So I live on a small island where nobody knows anything about Ivy Leagues or even care. They barely know anything about Applying to college basically. \n\nThis is what happened first... (btw in my country we graduate at 16 then go to precollege which is 12th/13th grade in the US) \n\nI graduated high school and told my mom I wanted to go to the only IB school in my country. She was barely open minded to the idea because she never heard of it and it was something new. I got into the school with a near FULL scholarship and I had to decline because of her lack of knowledge. Guess what happened? She rejected a FULL scholarship to an IB school just because transport would cost 500... but guess what? She sent me to an A Levels school just to pay more than she would\u2019ve at the IB school. All this was because she was so close minded to the IB. They all shitted on my dreams of going to an IB school, made fun of me, cursed me saying I\u2019m stupid and living in a fairytale. \n\nNow she asked me about my plans for college and I told her about the top 20s. She shitted on my dreams again... saying I live in a fairy tale and  I don\u2019t know anything. I literally showed her how many colleges I was going to apply t because obviously i know I can\u2019t apply to just 5!schools I\u2019m not Dumb... when I showed her all of this she barely paid any attention to what i was saying...\nThey shitted all ver my dreams of attending an. ivy by saying I\u2019ll never afford it when I LITERALLY qualify for full aid... \nMy whole family and everybody in this island are sooooo closed minded towards any high goal. This is why whenever someone asks where I\u2019m gonna apply to I never tell them. They end up making me feel like fucking GARBAGE for aiming high. \nI feel so alone like I have zero support from anyone. I don\u2019t even have fucking friends anymore \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

      "text": "<They end up making me feel like fucking GARBAGE for aiming high. I feel so alone like I have zero support from anyone.>\n\nDry-Yam, I just wanted to hop on here to say something I've had the fortune of learning from my older sister: **don't be afraid of your ambition.** I live in a small town that hasn't had someone go to a top tier school in a long time; when my sister was applying to school, a lot of people told her anything from \"it's a long shot so be prepared for tough news\" to the much ruder \"you'll never get in\". She's chillin at Harvard now because she didn't believe them. I know it's really tough to not have the support of your family and community, but I hope that you'll keep your goal of going to a highly regarded college alive. They don't believe that you can go to these schools not because they don't think you're smart, but because they have never seen it happen and therefore think it's impossible. Be the first one. Show them that it is possible. And I think that wherever you end up going, your determination will serve you well. Hope this helped",

I am trying my best even though ecs are discovered and I have to travel 400 miles to take APs and SAT and also participate in competitions and awards and do ECs while everyone discourages me. I felt like I was alone, But the A2C and Intl2USA has really made me feel like home.",

      "text": "I'm very sorry to hear this. I'm also from a very judgemental and close-minded community myself so I can relate to facing all kinds of criticism for thinking out of the box or trying to choose a path different from everyone else. I know someone who was the first person among their extended family, cousins and all, to go to uni, he got so much aid the uni was basically paying him to go! But yet no one showed him any support, not even his family, everyone thought he thought he was better than them, just because he was leaving the country to study and seek a better life for himself. \n\nAs long as you're not depending on anyone, you have every right to disregard what they say and pursue your studies, chase your dreams. You may not have their full support but you absolutely have mine!",
