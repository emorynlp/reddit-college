  "text": "1. It's not your fault, it's the college's and AO's fault. Why can't they know you better. What gives them the right to judge you on such little information? i ReGrEt To InFoRm YoU\n2. Withdraw your application before decisions come out. You can't get rejected by your college if you reject them first.\n3. Appeal.
