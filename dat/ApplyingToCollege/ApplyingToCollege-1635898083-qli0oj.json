  "text": "So when reviewing personal statements, my school (college guidance & co). seems to be telling people to go with essays that sound more resume-like, almost rehashing the entire application versus personal stories. But no one can explain why, except for like that the resume-like essays sound \"more like you\" the student. \n\nBut my school doesn't seem to have a great track record with t10 even when kids have perfect scores. Is this why, these resume-like personal statements? What do ya'll think? Is my school just out of touch?",

Your essay\u2019s job is for the ao to get to know you as a person, which in most cases a resume just can\u2019t do. Plus, it\u2019s redundant. They are going to see your resume anyways.",

      "text": "DO NOT write a resume-like essay. It's an instant turn-off. Of course its nice of you have a personable essay that ties in one of your ECs (showing your growth/development or personality) but putting a laundry list of ECs would be a waste of your time.\n\n*\"But my school doesn't seem to have a great track record with t10 even when kids have perfect scores. Is this why, these resume-like personal statements?\"*\n\nMaybe, but probably not. A lot of kids with perfect scores don't have strong ECs and awards or recommendations, which is (probably) primarily why they don't get in.",
