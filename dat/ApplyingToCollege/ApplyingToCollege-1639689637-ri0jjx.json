  "text": "I have a virtual Duke University interview coming up next week. I did some research and quickly learned just to be myself and talk casually; however, I really need to ace this interview because my stats for Duke aren't amazing. I definitely still have a chance of getting in, so does anyone have tips and or a list of things to specifically mention?",

      "text": "Duke ED applicant here, stressing out about decisions coming in T-2 hours. My situation was similar to yours and I also have bad social anxiety, but I ended going over the time limit for the interview. The \u201cjust be yourself\u201d tip is pretty accurate as there\u2019s really no way to completely predict how the interview would go. My interviewer was a pretty chill guy. He introduced himself and talked a bit about his own experience at Duke and explained to me that the interview is just a way for Duke to get to know us better and for us to talk more in depth about our interests. Initially he asked me some questions about my intended major, my motivation for pursuing my major, interests, and generally basic stuff to set the mood. We did end up getting deeper into why I was planning on pursuing my major but I can\u2019t remember fully what questions he asked. Towards the end, he did ask a few esoteric questions directly related to my field of study that I believe I answered to the best of my ability. Once finished, he asked if there was anything I might have wanted to discuss that we might have missed. I mentioned my status as an immigrant, and we ended up conversing a bit more about that. Finally, he talked a bit more about Duke and I asked a few questions, generally ending things off in a light-hearted mood.\n\nNot every interviewer will be the same, but you should definitely try to lean towards things that you have interest/have experience in. Thankfully, both me and my interviewer were prepared (I\u2019ve heard some horror stories about interviewers joining late and are literally running around in a park or was driving a car). I hope that this will help you. Good luck on your interview!",
