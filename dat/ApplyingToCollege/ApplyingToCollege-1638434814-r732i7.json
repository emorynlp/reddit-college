  "text": "I am an introvert so I feel very exhausted after meeting ppl, although I act like an extrovert at school and I talk a lot at school bc I have a lot of friends. And I am more extroverted around extroverts and fit in, and enjoy talking at the moment. But once I meet ppl and get home, I feel tired. School kind of energy consuming for me. I like to spend my own time and do my own stuff. Anyone feel the same? I wonder how this will last in college\u2026 I feel like sometimes just meeting ppl is kinda useless and I would more like to focus on my own work and life. And I feel like colleges and jobs prefer more extroverted ppl.",

Make sure you take time to be alone and recharge your batteries, but don\u2019t allow yourself to hide in your room to avoid social interaction. You\u2019ll have to be working on the balance.
