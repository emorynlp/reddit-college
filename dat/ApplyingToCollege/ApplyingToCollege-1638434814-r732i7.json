  "text": "I am an introvert so I feel very exhausted after meeting ppl, although I act like an extrovert at school and I talk a lot at school bc I have a lot of friends. And I am more extroverted around extroverts and fit in, and enjoy talking at the moment. But once I meet ppl and get home, I feel tired. School kind of energy consuming for me. I like to spend my own time and do my own stuff. Anyone feel the same? I wonder how this will last in college\u2026 I feel like sometimes just meeting ppl is kinda useless and I would more like to focus on my own work and life. And I feel like colleges and jobs prefer more extroverted ppl.",

Make sure you take time to be alone and recharge your batteries, but don\u2019t allow yourself to hide in your room to avoid social interaction. You\u2019ll have to be working on the balance.

      "text": "I\u2019m an introverted college frosh. I cope by limiting the amount I\u2019m willing to be social. I \u2018recharge\u2019 during the week by largely isolating myself from the social scene. I tell people I\u2019m busy and an early to bed/early to rise type so I can slip away. Bonus, this gives me plenty of study time.\n\nI actually like meeting interesting people (I\u2019m looking for \u2018my people\u2019) but my bigger priorities are my grades and other academic goals. I see alone time and studying as connected but it turns out a lot of study groups get together in the evenings here \u2014 a sort of half studying, half socializing phenomenon.\n\nThe only socializing I do during the week is meet up with friends on alternate weekdays for a quick dinner. I go to the gym alone, go to/between classes alone, study alone (I even located somewhere to shower alone). By the time the weekend comes around I\u2019m looking forward to catching up/going out with people. \n\nBeing a social-ish introvert isn\u2019t that uncommon here. Most people aren\u2019t the extreme (introvert or extrovert). My extrovert dormmate likes to get quiet time to study. She sees me as a positive influence in this way and I\u2019ve come to appreciate the way she catches me up on weekend to the fifteen new people she\u2018s met in the last week.\n\nThe hardest part was before I got here \u2014 I used to worry about how I\u2019d get enough private space/alone time, imagining it to be far more extrovert-culture than what it actually is (at my college anyway). Don\u2019t be afraid of being different or creating boundaries. Like me, you\u2019ll find a balance that works for you :)",

              "text": "Depends on the quality of the discussion. I enjoy insightful discussions in subjects I\u2019ve chosen. At a high enough level it might even be \u2018energizing\u2019 in a sort of intellectual vitality type of way (the complete opposite of what \u2018small talk\u2018 and standard social chit chat does to me).\n\nIf the discussion is just people rehashing old ideas, to the point it seems like a \u2018performance\u2019 to me (a social act), I\u2018ll say as little as possible (and half zone out to organize things in my mind or think about something else). Well, unless a prof tells me to \u201cstop being coy\u201d anyway :)\n\nOne of the things I\u2019ve been a bit disappointed in so far is I expected some social time (like over dinner) to include intellectual discussions \u2014 it doesn\u2019t happen, or at least, I haven\u2019t found people who do that yet (and I go somewhere perceived as \u2018nerdy\u2019).",
