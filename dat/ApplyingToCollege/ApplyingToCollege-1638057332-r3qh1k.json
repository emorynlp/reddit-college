  "text": "update: thank you all for your kind words :)<3 i\u2019m now working on emailing all of my schools and have updated my commonapp info so that i don\u2019t have any issues with any schools i may apply to later on \n\nself explanatory title but basically i submitted my commonapp and fafsa under the guise that i have two living parents. well two weeks ago one of my parents died (we knew they were sick so it wasn\u2019t necessarily unexpected). \n\ndo i need to fix my fafsa and go back in and update my applications? \n\nand what if there\u2019s \u2018conflicting information\u2019? for one of my schools they have the application and fafsa saying that parent A is alive but i had to fill out the css profile which was due a few weeks later. the day it was due  (and the day we submitted it) was the day they died, so on the css it says they\u2019re dead.",

      "text": "I\u2019m so sorry about your loss. Admissions counselor here, if something like this happens, you can usually contact the financial aid office and fill out some sort of change of circumstance form. The FAFSA is filed with prior prior tax information so if anything has changed in the past 2 years such as a death or loss of job, you should be able to submit a form indicating that change to the school and they can adjust your aid. This is what you would do for a private school at least.",

Although I am not an AO, the logical step is to definitely contact the admissions offices for the schools you applied to\u2026 they should be more than understanding about this situation. Good luck man, and my dms are open if you need absolutely anything at all :)",
