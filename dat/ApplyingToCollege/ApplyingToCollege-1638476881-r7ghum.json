  "text": "I scored very less in TOEFL and very high in DET. And, I wanted these colleges to consider my DET score and not TOEFL score. But, before taking the TOEFL, i sent them the 'free' reports. Now my colleges, such as USC have both DET and TOEFL score. If I don't meet the minimum requirement for TOEFL but do for DET, will it affect my application?\n\n(scored 92 in TOEFL, which doesn't meet the min requirement, but scored 145 in DET, which exceed the requirement).\n\nWhat do I do, any advice?",
