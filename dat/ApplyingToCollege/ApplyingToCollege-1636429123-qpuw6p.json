  "text": "OK so uh i got into this research ML internship and the professor had me do a task related to an algorithm to prove I \"above average.\" Anyways I did it and it was hard af but I got it done. Now the issue is I just got added to our research group chat and I realized this shit is so much harder than I thought and I start next week but I have no idea wtf I need to learn or where to start. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm also kinda scared of asking the professor bc hes kinda famous online for being a bitch (lol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone have any advice on wtf to do? Or any suggestions for intro to ml lol",
