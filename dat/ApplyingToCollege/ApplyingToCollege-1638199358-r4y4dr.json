  "text": "My prompt: \u201cDescribe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?\u201d. \n\nWriting deliberately about my topic comes easy of course since it is something I naturally talk about all the time. My draft does a great job explaining my topic and what I love about it but lacks heavily translating what that means about me. I\u2019ve read all the basic tips of show don\u2019t tell or how it should be woven into your descriptions but like how??? I thrive off examples so if anyone could show me an example that first lacks the personal sense and then what it transforms into after being made personal. Thank u so much I am desperate to understand and get this fixed before the Dec 1st \ud83d\ude2d",
