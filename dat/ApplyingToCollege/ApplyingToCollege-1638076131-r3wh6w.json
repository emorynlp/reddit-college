  "title:": "which UC catagory is key club in?",
  "text": "key club is a service non-profit volunteering based organziation where the whole premise is that we do service projects and note how many volunteering hours everyone has... but **does this go into the \"Extra Circular Activity\" or \"Volenteer/Community Service\" group in the UC application**..?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n i put it in the volunteer one and now I'm looking at examples and realizing the volunteer group is for specific organizations you've volunteered at but I don't want to waste a slot for 1 specific organization I volunteered at cause in key club we volunteered at like 20 of them. I already wrote this whole thing for both paragraphs and idk if I wanna change it LMFAOO plz tell me what is right and if its ok if I  leave it like this or should I put it in the other category",
