  "text": "I\u2019m a senior and applying as an international relations major and I have no ECs in that area. I\u2019m an international student and I took all of the courses at my school offered in politics, history, law etc. I also speak 4 languages. I have a pretty good gpa. Do you think I have a pretty good chance at getting into top 20 colleges with my major? I do have a lot of ECs, just not in my majors area.",
