      "text": "* a2c aims really high, top colleges have very high standards, a 3.5 isn't low in general (well above national average) but for the general population of the sub that fact is somewhat ignored\n* gpa's arent standardized -- one man's 3.5 is another's 3.0 -- so information on 'required' or baseline gpas required for top schools is a bit flexible\n* a 2.6 is still not enough to prevent you from going to top schools (eg., friend's sister had a 2.7 and now has a full ride at NYU)\n\ndw about it and focus on what u can do now",
