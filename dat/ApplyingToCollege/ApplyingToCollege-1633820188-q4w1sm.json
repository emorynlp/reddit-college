  "text": "What happens after you\u2019ve had a tough day and just want to sit by the imaginary window and rest? You breathe. Whether it is college apps, life, emotional pressure or whatever is going on in your life, please know and acknowledge your feelings are valid. Give yourself time to heal and reset. Sometimes we get so in a mood that there\u2019s no way out but inwards. If it feels like too much, maybe give yourself a break. While it may sound insane, considering the approaching dreadly deadline, it is needed and worth it. Breathe, have some hot cocoa and remember, you are not alone bestie.",
