  "text": "Kinda panicking right now! I have 3 middle school courses over 2 separate years listed on my HS transcript. I submitted my applications with everything under 2016-17 even though two of the classes were under 2017-18. Should I be worried? Also is there even any way to differentiate by year? I haven't figured out how to do that in the Courses and Grades system.",
