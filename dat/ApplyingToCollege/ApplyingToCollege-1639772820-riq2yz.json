  "text": "Hi! I'm Ben, I'm a Princeton student pursuing a creative writing certificate. This sub helped me so much when I was on my ohmygodihavesomuchtodo December college essay grind and I wanted to give back:\n\nI put together an editing resource I wish I had back then. It's a spreadsheet that helps you understand your essays' weak points, with little notes on how to fix them!\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KDSofSHED42LLYGgBzyMfe\\_-bz1KK3ztjtOZVAHFoaQ/copy?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KDSofSHED42LLYGgBzyMfe_-bz1KK3ztjtOZVAHFoaQ/copy?usp=sharing)\n\nJust click \"make a copy\" and you'll have a list of questions about essay content, structure, and grammar that'll help guide your writing process. Check out the explanation for each question by mousing over its cell!\n\nEnjoy, and let me know if you have feedback!",
