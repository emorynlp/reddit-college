  "text": "rejected from the school ive been dreaming to go to since freshman year. just like that. someone on here said to eat ice cream so ive been doing that but it aint numbing no pain :( i just keep crying every few minutes like an involuntary response.\n\nthankfully i unfollowed the unis insta acc yesterday after seeing a post abt it, but it hurts even more cuz ppl ik are getting into amazing places. and im happy for them i truly am, i just wish i couldve been with them in that happiness instead of where i am now.\n\nmy anxiety was getting really bad just before the decision release and even though i thought i mentally prepared myself for this, facing flat out rejection after years of slaving away just isnt something you can prepare yourself for.\n\nto make things worse i haven't even started my rd apps because i just couldnt get myself to earlier. sorry for the rant, just needed to get some stuff off of my chest",

For now, I say that you crack open another gallon of ice cream and go to town. Try focusing on two things: The pain won\u2019t last long, and that ice cream tastes really damn good.",
