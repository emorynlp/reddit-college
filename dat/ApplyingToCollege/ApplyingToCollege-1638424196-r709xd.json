  "text": "Hello all, I will get straight to the point.\n\nCurrently, I am a senior and taking AP Stat, AP Env. Science (APES), AP Eng Lit, AP Micro econ, Design, and Humanities. Next semester I am joining swim so I will get rid of humanities bc of that (humanities not required class). I want to drop APES second semester so I can do TA for my fav teacher. I cannot drop design bc it is required to graduate. I am in California. I talked to the counselor they said don't do it bc colleges won't like it if I drop 2 academic classes. Apparently, they might see it as me being lazy or some shit. And even though I will be accepted into whatever college by end of 2nd sem., she said they might rescind their admissions if they see my updated 2nd-semester transcript. IDK if this is true or not can anyone help me out? Thanks yall. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI should also mention I have all A's in my current class and have a 4.0 weighted GPA(if that helps)\n\nI am applying to Ivies, UC Berkeley, UCSB, UCSD, UCI, UCD, and a couple CSUs.\n\nI believe my apps are solid and I want to major in econ so APES and humanities aren't even related to my major choice right?",
