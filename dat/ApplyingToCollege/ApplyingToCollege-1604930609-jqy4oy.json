  "title:": "Colleges Sending Fake Emails of Interest has Got to Be the Most Unethical Part of the Process",
  "text": "I'm sure many of you already know this, but I really want to rant today lol. Outside of pressuring kids into sacrificing their sleep and childhood, by emphasizing \"the rigor of courses\" and \"leadership\" so that colleges could profit off of our intelligence and passions, those fake emails that some colleges advertise to pretty much everyone, faking their interest in a student, just for an application fee, is extremely disgusting, as well as disheartening.  Imagine receiving an email from your dream college, with the typical \"Dear, X, we'd be glad to have a student like you\", and etc, and figuring out that they don't want you, they want your money...\n\nI get it's advertising/marketing, but there is nooo way that anyone can justify that.\n\nI know this was very brief, and not very philosophical, but I just wanted to get it off of my chest",

      "text": "This is actually y'all's fault (and your parents').  Stay with me.\n\nBack in the early 1980s there was a struggling magazine that was trying to stay relevant.  One of their writers got the idea to create a somewhat arbitrary ranking of US colleges.  Within five years it was their most popular segment and it exploded (and saved the magazine - seriously, without it, US News and World Report would be long gone).  Readers loved the idea that some colleges were marginally better than others and students, parents, and alumni alike eagerly awaited the next update so they could flex on their peers.  \n\nBut it got worse from there.  People started consulting the rankings when deciding where to apply to college.  By 1997 41% of students said the rankings were an important factor in their college choice.  This caused colleges to suddenly care about where they landed on this glorified Buzzfeed slideshow.  Many of them started emphasizing the criteria the rankings used and neglecting things that weren't included in the formulas.  Some colleges outright gamed the new system or even cheated and lied to juice their ratings.  Seriously, they were brash and bloodthirsty about it:\n\n- USF reported an average SAT score 40 points higher than their real number because the admissions staff decided not to include their bottom 6% of scorers as part of a \"marketing strategy.\"\n\n- Northeastern excluded all of their international and remedial students (20% of the student body) in the numbers they reported.\n\n- Monmouth straight up fabricated an average SAT score that was **200 points** higher than reality.  They blamed it on a rogue \"former employee.\"\n\n- RPI boosted their stats by counting as rejects any admitted student who was initially waitlisted *or who did not get admitted to all of their indicated major choices.*  Seriously.  They decided to just reject someone from one of their chosen majors, then count that student in the denominator, but not numerator, of their acceptance rate.\n\n- Boston University reported SAT math scores for international students (which were generally high) while curiously NOT reporting their verbal scores (which were generally much lower).\n\n- NYU stopped including \"economically disadvantaged students\" from their reported metrics.\n\n- Even Harvard overstated their SAT scores by 15 points, calling it a \"mystery\" when it was later discovered.\n\nThe list is virtually endless - Oklahoma admitted to lying about their alumni giving statistics for 20 years; a former Clemson president admitted to the so-called \"common practice\" of massaging the peer evaluation form which US News supplies, assigning artificially low ratings to colleges which were immediately ahead of themselves in the rankings; Claremont McKenna was even temporarily banned from the rankings list for their egregious cheating.  There are literally dozens and dozens of examples of ethics and morality sacrificed at the altar of the rankings god.  Colleges recruiting students they fully intend to reject is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nYou can read the whole saga here, ironically in a 2001 UChicago magazine article:  https://magazine.uchicago.edu/0110/features/abuse.html\n\nIf no one cared about the rankings, then colleges wouldn't feel the need to massage the numbers, recruit rejects, or lie and cheat.  But as long as y'all and your parents are over there simping on the T20 list, they're going to play the game.\n\nSo if you don't like it, toss the rankings.  Find a college that you think is a good fit for you and offers a valuable education (e.g. www.ctcl.org, etc).  And most of all, don't apply somewhere just because they sent you marketing materials.",

The University of Illinois and the US Naval Academy have also engaged in manipulative or dishonest representations to boost their rankings.\n\nThe list of colleges that have been caught cheating is pretty long.  And that's just the ones that have gotten caught.  That means there are probably many more that are getting away with it or are simply \"legally manipulating\" the rankings - rating their close competitors lower on the peer evaluation forms, encouraging applications that they fully intend to reject just to boost their stats, making clever use of ED/EA/transfer/test optional/superscoring programs to massage the numbers, etc.\n\nAlso, I didn't mean to imply that colleges shouldn't be held responsible for this.  They should be, but it's hard to articulate exactly how.  US News and other rankings systems really need to do a better job of making the information clearer, more accessible, and less prone to manipulation.  Students and parents should also care less about the rankings than they do, but that's probably not going to happen either.  But I'll still be mad online about it.",

If that's what's happening, you're taking things too far at the expense of your development as a human being, or are employing poor time management. Either way, if you find yourself dipping into those extremes, that's on you.
