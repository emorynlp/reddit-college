  "text": "Since I\u2019ve been in middle school, my dream school has always been UMich. But they don\u2019t offer ED. My parents and friends have been telling me to ED to my second choice, Cornell. I like Cornell, but I like UMich way more. But I don\u2019t want to waste my ED, so I\u2019m highly considering EDing to Cornell.\n\nNow I know what everyone in the comments will say: \u201cIf you feel like you would regret EDing to Cornell, don\u2019t ED there.\u201d But I feel like if I get rejected from UMich I would regret not EDing to Cornell. So I\u2019m just really conflicted. \n\nIs it a bad idea to not use my ED? Should I just ED to Cornell?",

Plus, at T20 schools like Cornell, the ED boost isn't as high as some people think. If you can in ED, then you can most probably get in RD, too.",

      "text": "UMich has EA which I think also boosts your chances slightly. Don't apply ED if you're gonna regret it. HOWEVER, there's a potential loophole where you can apply to Cornell ED and ask for financial aid, and if you happen to get into both Cornell and UMich and want to go to UMich, let Cornell know that the financial aid isn't enough, which I'm pretty sure allows you to decline the ED offer. Again, not 100% sure but I've seen people do this before.",
