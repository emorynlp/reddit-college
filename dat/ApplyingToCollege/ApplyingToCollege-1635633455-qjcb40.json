  "text": "misleading title because i wrote 3/4 of an essay. i have tried so hard and for so long but consolidating the highlights of the past 17 years in a 650 word essay is near impossible. I tried to pick \\*one thing\\* but there isn't just \\*one thing\\* that defines me.  i just think the flow is terrible, some of my claims about myself violate the basic rule of show don't tell. but i can't SHOW Everything because then my essay wouldn't be an essay it would be a fully fledged novel. sometimes i have to say I'm this I'm that. I can this i can that.\n\nI just needed a forum to complain. like i started with an anecdote and tried to build from there but there's nothing overarching about me as a person other than the fact that i'm a huge bitch.",

      "text": "Choose one thing about yourself. Just one. Are you creative? Are you good at comforting people? Are you a natural leader? It doesn't have to be something world-shattering, just one thing you like about yourself. Then think of a way you could possibly demonstrate this. Did you spend months working on a creative project for the sheer joy of it? Do you find satisfaction in giving people a shoulder to cry on? Do you like taking the lead on group projects? Get specific, and see if you can expand on it. Maybe you demonstrate this in other parts of your life, too: at home, at school, in your ECs. You don't have to condense down your whole life, just this one thing that you want colleges to know about you.",

Every narrative, essay, short story, book, saga, epic tale doesn't have all the facts just the ones that carry the story.",

Write one or two sentences about each topic \n\n3. Eliminate 20 topics\n\n4. Combine any topics similar enough that they could be the same essay (optional)\n\n5. Ask others from the remaining topics what they like, take it with a grain of salt. Try to go slowly and eliminate until you are left with 1-3 topics\n\n6. Make outlines for each topic and finally decide on the best one",
