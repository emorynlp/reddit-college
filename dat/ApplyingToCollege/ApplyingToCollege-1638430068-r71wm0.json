  "text": "Yesterday, I got a letter from the President of Adelphi University congratulating me with the holiday, I don\u2019t know which one.\n\nSo my questions is, does it mean anything? Did every applicant receive that, or perhaps it means that they accepted me, that they the email was sent to me?\n\nI guess it is rare when the president of the university sends you a congratulatory email, I would understand if it was the Dean of Admissions.",
