And there's a lot of reasons I want to go to DS - a list of the top 10 reasons I want to go can be found here: [https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/deep-springs-2022-2023-discussion/3519807](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/deep-springs-2022-2023-discussion/3519807)\n\nBut if I had to choose a single reason, it's because I want to better understand how to live a life of service. \n\nDon't get me wrong. You don't have to go to DS to live a life of service, but I feel like the experience will be transformative. After all, you're stuck in the middle of the desert with people you have to see every day. You can't run away from your problems and there's a sense of mutual responsibility fostered which I feel is really important to leading a life of service. To me, service is all about connections - the way you approach humanity rather than the actual way you help others. Going to DS will not only help me better understand my role within a community, but it will force me to confront issues that I may not have previously had the moral courage to face.\n\nI feel like in the world today, there is a growing sense of social apathy which sort of threatens our potential. You see it in international relations, wars, conflicts, etc. To me, this all just seems so absurd for together as a whole we are greater than the sum of our parts. Perhaps I'm being idealistic, but I honestly believe that we can achieve anything if we understand that our differences are an asset and not a source of conflict. When I grow older, I hope to become an ambassador to sort of help the \"sheeple\" of our world. I want to help people see that we are more than just a collection of individuals. We are humanity and our potential is limitless.",
