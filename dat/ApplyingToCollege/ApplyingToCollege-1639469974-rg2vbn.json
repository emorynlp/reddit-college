  "text": "No one in my hs got in early decision so far (from what I know)\u2026 I\u2019m scared, this kid who had legacy with good stats didn\u2019t get in. Our hs is pretty competitive and most ppl have good stats\u2026 my early decision results is gonna come out soon, i\u2019m only thinking Im gonna get a rejection letter\u2026. Even if I expect it it\u2019s gonna hurt so much and i\u2019m not gonna be able to focus on my RD apps.",
