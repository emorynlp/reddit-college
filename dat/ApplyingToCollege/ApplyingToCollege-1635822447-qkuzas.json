  "title:": "Help! I think I accidentally submitted my ACT scores when I ment to go test optional",
  "text": "I was reviewing my application earlier before submitting I guess it totally slipped my mind to check test optional. My ACT (27) is either at the 25th percentile or just bellow it for both schools I applied to. I have a 3.86 unweighted, which is about mid range for both schools and I took like 10 AP classes. My class rank is like 52 out of 400 but our school doesn\u2019t let us report class rank and everyone has an unweighted GPA. I haven\u2019t actually sent my ACT from the ACT website but I reported on the common app. Not sure what I should do\u2026I know I can email the admissions office but I don\u2019t want them to think I\u2019m irresponsible. Just feeling a little dumb right now, any advice would be appreciated:)",
