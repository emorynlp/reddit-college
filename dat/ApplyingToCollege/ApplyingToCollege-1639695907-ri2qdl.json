      "text": "My guess is you're Californian? \n\nI'd say 45-50% chance you get into CU Boulder or Utah. Your stats are fine for them, but being out of state always makes it tougher.\n\nFor the UCs, your UC GPA matters immensely. With a 3.5 you might get into Merced and possibly Riverside, unlikely for any of the others but possible.  \n\nUSC is near certainly a rejection unless you have some really special hooks or are applying for a special program like film and have really strong other aspects of your application.",

              "text": "Quite the opposite. If you apply to cinema, for example, the acceptance rate is like 1%, but they\u2019ll care about GPA and SAT less than your portfolio. When I say \u201cspecial program,\u201d I mean most stuff in the arts. 99% of majors are going to be GPA and test score as the main backbone of your admissions.",
