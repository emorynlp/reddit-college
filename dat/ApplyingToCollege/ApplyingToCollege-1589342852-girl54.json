  "text": "Having a spot on a waitlist gives so many students an unhealthy hope of getting into an Ivy when they should be moving on with their lives and college plans. It\u2019s unfair and emotionally taxing to students when Ivies put just as many students on a waitlist as the amount of students they accept. So please, accept that you will not get into an Ivy and increase my chances of getting off the UPenn waitlist. Thank you very much.",

Lots of my peers are talking gap semesters already. If I was in your position I especially would not want to experience freshman year like that either.\n\nThat said, lots of colleges don't really know what they'll do and probably won't know til the end of summer. And a lot are going to try and keep enrollment up so they won't announce their decision until later on purpose. Which majorly sucks :(",

Even if they are, in this time, it's better to have that relatively positive hope to hold on to, to distract you from all of the BS going on in the world. Also Mr. Gatekeeper, this is THE application period to keep your hopes up as many factors, including travel restrictions will make yield rates shit this year. Absolute shit. Let them hold on to hope. For some this may be one of the few positive things to think about in their lives rn. I know cause I've been there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso not loosing hope until the door is fully shut is a VERY important skill to have, You loose nothing by having that skill\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I see, a shitpost, still point still stands, everyone has a right to believe like you do",
