  "text": "I\u2019m a straight A honors student, 4.0 unweighted GPA, 4.3 weighted. I have a few extracurriculars spread throughout the year like colorguard and theater, as well as working a job. I\u2019m in beta club but outside of the required 8 hours of community service a year I don\u2019t really do any. I was going to start doing a bunch last year but due to a bunch of medical stuff happening (outside of COVID) I wasn\u2019t able to. Is this going to keep me from possibly getting into the college I want? It\u2019s not a huge college or anything, but it\u2019s not a community college.\n\nAlso not sure what flare to chose",

Community can be your school too - any initiative to improve from race relations to recycling to tree planting \u2026.. basically anything you can think of.",

          "text": "Thank you! I\u2019ll look into things. I\u2019ve done colorguard since 8th grade (I\u2019m a junior now), different things with theater since freshman year, and I help lead a DnD club at school. Biggest time consumer right now is work, I work a good bit each week on top of all of this but I\u2019ll definitely think of something I can do just to add to it",

(i.e., \u201cperformance\u201d for CG; hobby/passion for DND; responsibilities for your job). I agree w/ above commenter, there are various other things that could tie into those, or dovetail with them, which will round out your EC\u2019s. And they don\u2019t have to be very \u201cofficial\u201d - just something you do that makes a difference (even a small one) in your corner of the world - even a solo project/routine. Or something you do regularly that you truly enjoy. \ud83d\udc4d",
