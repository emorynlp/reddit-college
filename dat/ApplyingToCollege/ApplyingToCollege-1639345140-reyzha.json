  "title:": "My EA school comes out in a week. Can I switch to ED this late in the game?",
  "text": "I was deferred from my ED school on Friday night (no loss there, bc my EA is my dream school but I was unsure if I wanted to go there before. Now I'm absolutely sure I want to go.) It says on my portal for my EA that they've processed my materials and they're finalizing decisions, but can I switch to ED at this point? Is it possible they've already decided on me, and perhaps an ED switch would make them reconsider me? If anyone has any insight at all, I would love to hear it.",

      "text": "I think you technically *could*, but they've probably already made up their minds. If they were planning on rejecting you, it's highly unlikely to change their minds. And if they were already planning on accepting you, switching to ED would only limit your other options.\n\nThe one case where I could see it making a difference is if they were considering deferring you. I could imagine your switching to ED putting you over the top.\n\nI don't know your situation, but my advice would be to wait it out.",

          "text": "thanks for the thoughtful answer, i had really wanted to ED to this school but i psyched myself out at the beginning of the year because my family was concerned it was in a dangerous city and highly competitive. oh well, i feel like i have really good essays and the kind of personality that the school likes, and i worked really hard on this application so if i get in i'll probably accept the offer.",
