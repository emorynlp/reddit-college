However, the university that I planned on transferring to, although very prestigious, has...very low rated professors...\n\nI checked rate my professor and went through the entire computer engineering / computer science department and I have been reading a lot of negative reviews that are about majority of the professors there.\\]=\n\nShould this be a sign to reconsider applying there?
