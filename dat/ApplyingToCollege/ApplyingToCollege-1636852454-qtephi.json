The literal difference between a student in the top 10% and the top 50% are roughly 4 percentage points (on a scale of 100). \n\nYou could scream \"omg overinflated\" but there are a number of people below the top 50% in my class who are literally ranked at the 99+% in the country for maths, humanities, and the sciences based on a huge national-level standardized test (that no one studies for) being administered here.",
