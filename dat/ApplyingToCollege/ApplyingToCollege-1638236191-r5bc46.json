  "text": "This is helping me an insane amount and was so, so cathartic.\n\nYou probably have a lot of \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d running around in your head right now and tbh that kind of sucks. Scenarios can snowball and get out of control and ruin moods. So earlier this year, I wrote myself a letter. (A real, paper letter!)\n\nI wrote down how I was feeling in the moment and gave my well wishes to future me, the person who had just opened their decision. I wrote about how scared I was and how thankful I should be that it was over. In the letter, I cast myself as a rejected applicant. I told myself it wasn\u2019t worth crying over spilled milk, and reminded myself how amazing all my RD schools are, too. I wrote a list of my favorite songs to cry to and reminded myself that it would all be okay.\n\nBut then I remembered, as sliiiiim as the chances may be, I could also get accepted. I folded the first letter up into an envelope, labeled it \u201cRejected\u201d and slipped it into the bottom of my desk drawer. I wrote a new letter, congratulating myself and writing instructions for future me to follow: telling my friends and family, emailing my interviewer, upgrading my Instagram bio\u2026.I can\u2019t recall all of what else, but I also live under a mile from my REA school, so I told \u201cfuture elated me\u201d to walk onto campus for the first time as an accepted student, and savor it.\n\nI labeled the envelope \u201cAccepted\u201d and slipped it next to the first letter. One of those letters will be read again on decision day, and the other will be tossed in my fireplace. The decision of which I will\nopen is not mine.\n\nGetting my thoughts down on paper\u2014the good, the bad, and the ugly\u2014really helped me to reign in my spiraling thoughts and bring some order to the chaos of speculation. It helped the situation feel under control, and gave me something to look forward to reading, either way the decision goes. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone struggling with the \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d this season.\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "Dude I love future me letters. I opened one the weekend before thanksgiving break and it was from exactly a year ago. at that time i was basically bawling my eyes out over a math test that i didn't feel ready at all for and basically apologizing to my future self for ruining my grades (and of course threw out a half-hearted \"oh good luck with apps\" at the end) but i smiled while reading it because both the math test and the year turned out okay. it feels reassuring to know that writing a letter now, as stressed as i am, would probably make future me laugh because by then, it's all over. \n\nanyway. *highly* recommend writing letters to your future self. i always do it when i feel absolutely terrible and its cathartic as hell.

      "text": "highly recommend!! i also wrote a letter while i was in the midst of applications to future me (it was an email that was automatically sent to me a year later). it really helped me gain some perspective bc i wrote the letter with the mentality of \"i will be in college by the time i receive this\" which was oddly comforting? to know that i'd be *somewhere* and that this stressful time would be over by the time i received it",
