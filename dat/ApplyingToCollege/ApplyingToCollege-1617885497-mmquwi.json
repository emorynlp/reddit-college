  "title:": "Not getting into the school you want fucking sucks and I'm sorry if that happened to you",
  "text": "   \nI'm really sorry if you didn't get into the school or schools you wanted.\n\nI'm sorry because I know how hard you worked. Fuck this shit about \\*entitlement\\* or whatever; we both know that's not what this is. You were never an ethereal snow angel manifest destined for greatness. You're a teenager who really wanted something\u2014more than anything you've ever wanted in your life. You didn't just want it; you took active steps over a sizable percentage of your time on Earth to try and get it. You spent very real time and made very real sacrifices to try and achieve something bigger than you. And then you didn't achieve it. To tell you that this isn't a big deal is to directly imply that you are a fucking moron to have ever acted like it was in the first place.\n\nYou will fail again in life, but it will never quite be like this. The reason is there isn't any other life event that quite matches college admissions. Sure, you could not get the job or find out the girl or guy doesn't love you, but it's hard to think of a scenario for either of those two in which you *spent the past four years trying to achieve that specific goal.* All I've got is grad admissions, weird corporate fantasy positions that don't actually work like that, and running for president. Likewise, life can and will take from you. I'm sure many of you already know that. But to take implies you had it to begin with. This is just\u2026\n\nIt fucking sucks. And I'm sorry that it happened to you.\n\n\u2014-\n\nIs this OK? I've been on this board nonstop for a year now, and no one ever says this. It's always platitudes about school not defining you and making your own future and all that shit. And not a single Goddamn person reading it feels better afterward. Because it's hollow nonsense. You are on the applying to college subreddit. Our patron saint is named Dartmouthsimp. This shit **absofuckinglutely defines you.** If it didn't, you wouldn't have worked so hard for it, and my friend wouldn't have asked me today how \"The Barnard girl is doing\". Fine, thanks.\n\nRight now, you're \"didn't get into X\" or maybe \"Got into X, but very clearly wanted Y.\" That's pretty much what defines you. And that's why it hurts so bad.\n\nAnd that's OK. **You're allowed to hurt.** If you take absolutely nothing else from this piece or any other pick-me-up hooraw you hear or read again, please take this because I mean it with every fiber of my being: **This fucking sucks and you are allowed to feel however you want to feel.**\n\n\u2014- \n\nBut that's the fun thing about definitions. They change. You know me as College With Mattie. Twelve years ago, I was depressed because I didn't try hard enough for USC Mattie. Eight years ago, I was plucky Tulane grad writer Mattie. Four years ago, I was unemployed drunk with no cat Mattie. All **super real definitions of me.** And living through some of those definitions fucking sucked, too. But do you see me as any less knowing that I wasn't always like this? Or do you think it's cool that I made it here anyway?\n\nIono, I'm rambling. I think I hit it pretty hard a bit above. Here's all I want you to know:\n\n**This fucking sucks and you are allowed to feel however you want to feel. But I'm still proud of you and can't wait to see what else your life holds in store. I also think you're neat.**\n\n\\- Mattie",

It\u2019s nice to see someone finally recognise that college may not define us in the long run but in this moment and many close ones to come, our rejections and our failed dreams will define us.

I have a lot of respect for those who grinded constantly for these four years, because it takes an admirable amount of perseverance, hardwork and dedication. At the same time, I feel like that the US college admissions culture can be very toxic and unhealthy to the extent many teenagers feel like it is an extreme, be all end all situation - and they can't really be blamed when there are so many external and internal factors pressuring them into thinking otherwise. I don't think the 'platitudes' are 'hollow nonsense'. Maybe you have a different perspective as a college admissions consultant, but many of the people who post those kinds of posts are speaking from diverse perspectives at a later point of life. And if so many people are saying the same thing as they reflect back, is it really nonsense? I think it's really easy get to absorbed in the college admission grind, especially on this sub, and posts like that help us zoom out and get a bigger perspective on things. Don't get me wrong, the college you go to is important and can definitely make a difference, but not to the extent that it defines you as a human being. So it's okay to grind for four years, it's okay to feel disappointed, but it's also important to remember that there's so much more to life than which college you go to",

It feels personal. It's disappointing. And there's a deep down sense of hollow anguish that hurts.\n\nHere's what I want to share: I'm 52 years old. I'm a writer. I've had my books and TV shows rejected too many times to count. I've been turned down for amazing jobs, I've had my heart broken by women I thought I loved.\n\nI have the best wife. The perfect woman for me. I have a son I love. I have a job that pays the bills and I keep swinging with the creative stuff. \n\nPart of the reason I have a good life is because I've learned to deal with the pain of rejection. That pain you feel right now...it's not wasted pain. It is the training you need to have the life you want. Life is nearly constant practice at failure. At least for me it has been. Getting good at feeling bad is a skill. People who aren't good at feeling bad stop taking risks, they hide from what they want and they never feel the thrill of things working out, when they work out, because they play it safe.\n\nI am very sorry for my son and for all of you who feel the raw, real pain of losing out on a dream. But get used to it because once you learn that this feeling cannot and will not destroy you, you can keep fighting for what you want in life. Feel it, then grow from it. \n\nIn 30 years maybe you'll be doing something amazing that came after a string of defeats and you can look back on this, your first major let down, and see how far you've come.",

UCLA's basketball team worked their tails off before the Final Four game in practices, did near-everything right during the game, and still [lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTY04Bon48U). That game was basically undergrad admissions life in 40 minutes. But just as UCLA goes back to the grind for next season, you go somewhere different and prep for the next steps of life. You just have to work with what you can.",

I think it's fine to let your rejection define you for now, but just like \"unemployed drunk with no cat Mattie\" wasn't ok as a long-term definition, I don't think \"Ivy Reject\" is an ok long-term definition either.\n\nAnd just like you needed to dig deep to reform yourself, cultivate some pretty amazing skills, beat-saber yourself into shape, and make your own success (and get a cat!), all these Ivy-rejects need to do the same thing - and ultimately move on.\n\nHere's a post I wrote about how to find and fall in love with Plan B.  My hope is that it gives tangible action steps to the \"redefine yourself\" strategy.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mmspg7/picking_up_the_pieces_how_to_handle_disappointing/",

My parents didn\u2019t even say congrats when I got in places just \u2018how much\u2019 (money did they give u). Like....girl u know we don\u2019t qualify for good need. Anyway I received my first rejection earlier this week from a special program I interviewed for and everyone in my life is being so mean about it for some rzn. As soon as I told my family my parents started picking apart my essays and interview and launched into a \u2018what you could\u2019ve done better\u2019 speech as I was literally falling apart right there not 5 mins after reading the email lol. And now, every few days they bring up something I said in the interview and literally MAKE FUN OF ME for it and since we all are spend 24/7 at home I legit have to cry in the shower cuz there\u2019s no where else to go lmfao. anywho... that was dramatic but that\u2019s what u get when u don\u2019t have time or space to healthily process ur emotions </3",
