      "text": "Current junior at Vandy who didn't visit before applying ED 2. Definitely PM me if you want to talk more but I would say that you should only ED if the peace of mind is more important to you than seeing where you get in RD. Sometimes I wonder what would've happened if I'd waited it out instead, but overall I'm still happy with the choice that I made.\n\nVibe wise, Vandy is kind of weird. Nashville is a very liberal city but you're still in Tennessee, and if you're a POC coming from a big city like I was, it's definitely an adjustment. However, you met an incredibly diverse group of people here--my friends come from all over the country and I've genuinely learned so much more about Southern/Midwest/East Coast culture than my high school friends who stayed home. It's very much a work hard/play hard school, but it's not cutthroat at all; the people here are some of the nicest I've ever met, and while there's obviously socioeconomic issues with rich white people in Greek life, for the most part Vandy kids are pretty genuinely intellectually curious and motivated. Everyone here knows what they want out of their life and they're not afraid to push hard to get it, but we all want to help each other succeed. \n\nThe biggest con I'd say is the sports culture. If you're into sports at all, the college football scene is only going to disappoint you. Our school spirit/pride comes more from academics, but I've kind of accepted that since you basically have to choose: do you want the big state school rah-rah energy, or do you want a smaller private school? I think Vandy strikes an okay balance while being in the SEC, but the sports scene definitely suffers. Personally though, I always thought that my experience as a student academically more than made up for it--I genuinely feel like I've gotten an excellent education.",
