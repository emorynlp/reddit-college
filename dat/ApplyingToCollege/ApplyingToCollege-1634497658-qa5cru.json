  "title:": "lower gpa mentioned in my teacher's recommendation letter",
  "text": "My history teacher just sent me a copy of the recommendation letter he sent to all the colleges. He mentioned that my GPA is 4.43, he got that from the resume I sent to him in Junior year. But my current GPA is 4.53 after my Junior year grades and a summer college class I took. Will that be a concern? Should I ask him to correct and update the recommendation letters?\n\nthanks!",
