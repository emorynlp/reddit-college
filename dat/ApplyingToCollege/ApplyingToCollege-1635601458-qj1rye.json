  "title:": "How to make a FUCKING TRANSCRIPT??",
  "text": "So yes, my school administrator acts sooo egoistic like he knows everything and Harvard calls him daily for advice on how to run the illuminati, but dumbhead doesn't know how to make a transcript and asked me to make my own!!! \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21\n\nAnyways, here are a few questions I have, if anyone can answer these, will be extremely grateful.\n\n1.) Transcript is just grades of every class on a paper with school letterhead, official seal of school and principals sign, right?? Or something else??\n\n2.) Should I make a different transcript for each class (9-12) or just a single one??\n\n3.) One of my Early colleges requires me to send my mock 12th grade term 1 exam scores too, but rest of them only require grades upto 11th for early cycles. So I'm not including those in the transcript, but will be mailing them externally to that college (I've already talked about this to an AO from there.)\nSo those grades should also be printed on another paper with school letterhead with official seal and signature of principal and then mailed to that college, right??\n\n\n(As always, hoping for an appearance from u/prsehgal) And if anyone else knows anything about this, help meeeeee\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nEDIT:: Thank you all for your wonderful comments. They've helped me a LOT, enough to create a passable transcript (and one that my stupid administrator is happy with\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44).",

If your counselor is uploading this, schools would know it's legit but having that stamp + signature does no harm.\n\n\nAlso, make a single transcript for the sake of simplicity.\n\nIt is my understanding that AOs only look at the final year grades since that's what matters the most in our curriculums.",

      "text": "(I am from india cbse) Bro I just submitted my report cards for 9 , 10 , 11 combined in a single PDF, you don't have to make a transcript (unless your school operates that way) if you're making a transcript make sure to add everything I mean EVERYTHING all the internal stuff,  marking scheme , pass criteria and officially verified by school with principal signature and office stamp. For the uni that require midterms im submitting term 1 marks when they come out because they're official. This is what most students have done that I've talked to online.my suggestion is to not  tamper with your marksheets submit it as it is because it has worked for me and others as I've received acceptances.",
