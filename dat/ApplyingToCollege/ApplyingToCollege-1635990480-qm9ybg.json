  "title:": "Should I include the prompt if I'm using common app prompt #7 (choose anything)?",
  "text": "I was thinking I should include the prompt I used to write the essay (bolded for clarity) -- but now I'm not sure.. Anyone else using #7 / \"pick anything\" and got suggestions?\n\nWould AO's like to know the prompt I was writing for? I'd assume so right? (does this count against my word limit?)\n\nI'm also using the same essay for Coalition's \"choose anything\" prompt, so I'd also like to know for that one too.\n\nThe reason is, I wrote what I think is a pretty good essay on a prompt for ApplyTexas, but I've decided to just use Coalition & CommonApp instead of messing around with the stupid ApplyTexas system. (it makes Coalition look like a walk in the park, and it's also just a PITA since I was applying to Coalition schools also.. no need to do 3 apps.. so I just dropped applytexas since those schools use Coalition also.)",
