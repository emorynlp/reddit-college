  "text": "Hello everyone! Recently, there was a pretty popular post called [Crash course in living away from home](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/labe15/a_crash_course_in_living_away_from_home/) by u/3VERYTHING0ES, and it addressed all the basics of living in a dorm (it's definitely worth a read!). Nonetheless, I've seen many misconceptions and doubts you have going around this subreddit, so as a person who's been living in a dorm for all of their high school, I'd love to give you more insight.\n\n* **Communal bathrooms are scary.**\n\nI get it, the idea of sharing such a private space with strangers seems... strange? It's unusual at first but after a few weeks, it feels completely normal and not uncomfortable at all. I promise, no one in their right mind will accidentally or intentionally walk on you - other people also value their privacy, so they won't even attempt doing it. If you're afraid nevertheless, it's a good idea to go there with someone else at the beginning - they will look after you, and you after them. The next thing is changing clothes. From personal experience, it's best to change into and from a bathrobe in your room - you save a lot of time and feel more comfortable. Lastly, you probably have heard horror stories about the mess people leave in the bathrooms. There's not much you can do about it (considering you're a decent person and don't contribute to the mess yourself), but it doesn't happen as often as you might think, and the staff does their best to keep it clean at all times. Always use flip-flops while using the shower, and you're good to go!\n\n* **What should I wear as my PJs? I don't want people to give me weird looks.**\n\nHonestly - whatever makes you feel the most comfortable. The majority wears sweatpants with a t-shirt, it's the most convenient if you have to go somewhere before going to sleep, as it passes as an everyday outfit. A lot of people also wear PJ sets, which makes sense considering their purpose. The pattern, style, or anything else doesn't matter, as long as you feel good in it. No one is going to judge you for what you wear to sleep, I promise :)\n\n* **Food in college is so bad, I'll spend a fortune buying groceries.**\n\nAlthough this one varies, I come from a place with an extremely bad reputation when it comes to food, so I can tell you about the worst case you can find yourself in. Even when food is generally bad, there are always some outliers. I recommend trying different options before forming your opinion, so you'll see that some of the available options are (at least a little bit) worth your room & board fees. Additionally, don't skip decent meals, even when you're too lazy - you'll eventually get hungry anyway, but this time, you'll have to waste your money. When it comes to spending money on food, I highly recommend getting ingredients that you can use to cook something yourself rather than constantly eating out. Firstly, you're going to save A LOT and I mean A LOT of money in this way, secondly, it's usually way healthier and nourishing, and lastly, you'll either learn a useful life skill of cooking or master it. Contrary to the popular belief, cooking doesn't take long and is a better time investment than the procrastination of any kind.\n\n* **I'm used to having plenty of private space, I can't stand the idea of having a roommate.**\n\nAs I mentioned before - the beginning is always the most difficult. You have to have luck when it comes to roommates assignment, but you don't lose in any case. If you have nice roommates - congrats! Your college experience will become even better than you could've ever imagined. If you don't have nice roommates - it happens from time to time, it's fine though! You can always change the assignment. From my own observations, it's way more common to get a great assignment than not, so there's nothing to be afraid of. Learning to live with another human being is also an important life lesson of sharing, communicating, and collaboration. The author of the post which I've linked in the beginning elaborates way more on this topic, as well as on how to establish a healthy relationship with your roommates, so check it out if you're interested.\n\n* **Dorm just can't feel like home no matter what.**\n\nUnless you totally hate your college, at one point, you're definitely going to accidentally (or on purpose) refer to the campus as \"home\". I get why you're so excited about decorating your room (I'm looking at you, Pinterest ideas posts) because it's honestly one of the most enjoyable parts of moving in every year. Making your dorm personal, making a lot of friends, bonding with your roommates, getting used to the college town/city, attending classes every day - all of this makes you one day start perceiving \"the new reality\" as your place to be. You still might get homesick from time to time, but it won't be a constant state. You'll grow as a person, and grow to love it.\n\nI hope this makes you feel at least a little bit less worried about what's to come in the close future. If you have any questions, doubts, or think I missed something important, I'd love to respond to you. I hope you find this useful, and for now, I wish you luck in the applying/waiting process - you've got this, and you're amazing!",

I really wouldn't mind a weekly question thread (idk the word for this some other subreddits have it for questions)  for college students to answer questions (AMA style) and give tips. \n\nOne of my tips- don't be afraid to say hi to people that you only know their name and nothing else, invite people places, or invite yourself to places. Especially the first semester (even longer due to covid) people are dying for friends. Also, don't be afraid to join a bunch of random clubs, try it out, then quit the ones you don't like.",

      "text": "As someone who's been to a fair amount of summer camp (living in a cabin in the woods for a month with 10 other guys, plus a college-age counselor) and absolutely loved it, you'll surprise yourself; living in a smaller space with more people than you're used to is stressful for a few days when you first do it, but the learning curve is quick.\n\nThe two biggest things I've taken from that experience are:\n\n1. Define boundaries with the people you're living with; if you both have the same expectations for privacy, cleanliness, and generally how life goes, you'll all be way happier. In a camp environment, that's more or less enforced, but it's easy enough to figure out independently as well.\n2. Get into a routine; knowing when and where you're showering, doing work, CLEANING YOUR LIVING SPACE (really big one), and going to sleep every day does wonders for your mental health. It's easy to take it for granted, but if it's your first time without parents setting that expectation for you, it helps to get into a healthy pattern\n\nI've never lived in college, but I know there are people out there who haven't had the same experience living away from home that I've been privileged to get every summer for a while now, so I figured I'd pass that on too. Good luck with decisions everyone!",

          "text": "1.  Just do it in the shower.  Almost all \"communal bathrooms\" have shower stalls.  It's not like the open shower areas at public pools.  Most girls shave their legs/armpits in the shower.  Many men shave their faces in the shower.  This isn't that much different.\n\n2.  Every college has private bathrooms somewhere on campus.  They usually don't have showers, but you can definitely do that in a sink and then take a shower afterward.  See my old comment pasted below for more info on this.\n\n**Private Bathrooms.** Spend some time first semester looking for them and *don't share the info with anyone else*. It might be a lobby, office building, administrative building, visitors' center, library, retail/dining, sports facility etc. Many colleges have offices dedicated to various programs/academic centers/organizations that will have shockingly nice private bathrooms. Go beyond the main entrances - check basements, top floors, rear entrances, etc. Aim to find 3-4 that you can stash in your arsenal for when you need them. I know a guy who literally never pooped in his dorm bathroom.\n\nAnother critical thing to check - most colleges have several different housing options. If you don't live in a massive dorm, you might have a private or semi-private bathroom. A lot of honors college housing and \"living/learning communities\" have different setups that include a bathroom for every 1-2 bedrooms.\n\nHere's a comment from NoxiousQuadrumvirate along these same lines:\n\nFollow the age-old advice that is passed down through the years (if it wasn't clear enough, this is old advice that you can find on reddit, but good luck finding the original!):\n\nFind the nice bathroom on campus. There are quite a few, but they're hidden and rarely talked about, precisely because people want to \"protect\" them.\n\nDon't look in the nicest, newest buildings; these do have nice bathrooms but everyone knows it. Don't go to the oldest, most rundown buildings because the facilities are about as bad as you're imagining. Look for something in-between, probably 90's era, maybe 80's. Take the ~60th percentile for your own university.\n\nAvoid areas with high student traffic. These are places like refectories, multiple lecture halls in a single area, near student clubs, the library, or other popular hangout spots. If there are bathrooms in that area then everyone knows about them, which is what you're trying to avoid.\n\nThe best locations will be near more office-like areas. Around purely research areas or administrative sections, there are often single-stall, gender-neutral, and/or handicapped bathrooms that are not used by large numbers of people precisely because they're somewhat out-of-the-way. These places aren't thoroughfares and have no buildings/amenities/services of interest to 99% of the student body so there's no reason for people to walk through.\n\nIf you get the option to pick a dorm room, bear in mind that the rooms which are farthest away from everything/everyone else may have their own smaller bathroom. My own hall did this. There was a large communal bathroom in the centre that most people used, but since my room was in a smaller annex, we had our own private bathroom to share between 3. Again, you're looking for areas with few people that are far away from busy thoroughfares. Everyone needs to pee, so there have to be bathrooms around for everyone.\n\nIf you find one of these mythical bathrooms, never tell anyone where it is. Tell one person and everyone will know, and then you'll have to find a new one. It'd probably be further out of your way too.\n\nBasically, look for floors and hallways without many, if any, people. If you feel uncomfortable and as though you're somewhere you're not supposed to be, then you're on the right track. If an area is out-of-bounds to you then there'll be a locked door or a clear sign or someone will politely ask you if you're lost (you can lie and say yes if you like). It's not like you'll accidentally wander in the CSL or anything; you won't get into trouble just for walking around. If you find a single stall but it isn't for your gender, check the next floor up/down as sometimes they'll alternate.\n\nSee more discussion of this here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9lvur5/holy_shit_i_just_realized_my_worst_fear_of_going/?limit=500",

I have seen some absolutely ridiculous and risqu\u00e9 ensambles and I\u2019ve never judged someone for it or heard anyone else judge them. \n\nI also second changing into a bathrobe in your dorm room and then showering. After four years of trying different ways, I settled in that in my sophomore year and it is by far the most ideal.\n\nI didn\u2019t mention this in my original post, but living with a roommate isn\u2019t as jarring as you might think. It may be at first, but eventually you get used to each other. I\u2019m fairly quiet and so is my roommate, so we would spend most of our time in our room doing our own thing. I never really felt encroached on and my dorm was a lot smaller than the average (like you could fit about one suitcase length-wise between our beds) once we got comfortable with each other. \n\nIt\u2018s always nice to have someone to talk to or get help from, and a roommate can easily become a close friend or even a best friend. We help each other with homework, buy gifts for each other, etc. With the right person, having a roommate makes a dorm feel more like home. I understand how scary it can feel because you\u2019re heading into the unknown and don\u2019t feel like you even have your own space, but just give it a chance!",

Experience new stuff with others. Try to learn as much as you can abt people from other cultures, and other parts of the world. Try going out and having fun with your friends as much as you can (I'm not saying forget studies, but also don't forget to do this). 4 years later, when you look back, you'll cherish these memories a lot. So don't shy away from the chance to make some of them!",

          "text": "I posted this above, but adding it here so you'll see it too:\n\nLittle known fact: almost every college has secret private bathrooms. Spend some time first semester looking for them and *don't share the info with anyone else*. It might be a lobby, office building, administrative building, visitors' center, library, retail/dining, sports facility etc. Many colleges have offices dedicated to various programs/academic centers/organizations that will have shockingly nice private bathrooms. Go beyond the main entrances - check basements, top floors, rear entrances, etc. Aim to find 3-4 that you can stash in your arsenal for when you need them. I know a guy who literally never pooped in his dorm bathroom.\n\nAnother critical thing to check - most colleges have several different housing options. If you don't live in a massive dorm, you might have a private or semi-private bathroom. A lot of honors college housing and \"living/learning communities\" have different setups that include a bathroom for every 1-2 bedrooms.\n\nHere's a comment from NoxiousQuadrumvirate along these same lines:\n\nFollow the age-old advice that is passed down through the years (if it wasn't clear enough, this is old advice that you can find on reddit, but good luck finding the original!):\n\nFind the nice bathroom on campus. There are quite a few, but they're hidden and rarely talked about, precisely because people want to \"protect\" them.\n\nDon't look in the nicest, newest buildings; these do have nice bathrooms but everyone knows it. Don't go to the oldest, most rundown buildings because the facilities are about as bad as you're imagining. Look for something in-between, probably 90's era, maybe 80's. Take the ~60th percentile for your own university.\n\nAvoid areas with high student traffic. These are places like refectories, multiple lecture halls in a single area, near student clubs, the library, or other popular hangout spots. If there are bathrooms in that area then everyone knows about them, which is what you're trying to avoid.\n\nThe best locations will be near more office-like areas. Around purely research areas or administrative sections, there are often single-stall, gender-neutral, and/or handicapped bathrooms that are not used by large numbers of people precisely because they're somewhat out-of-the-way. These places aren't thoroughfares and have no buildings/amenities/services of interest to 99% of the student body so there's no reason for people to walk through.\n\nIf you get the option to pick a dorm room, bear in mind that the rooms which are farthest away from everything/everyone else may have their own smaller bathroom. My own hall did this. There was a large communal bathroom in the centre that most people used, but since my room was in a smaller annex, we had our own private bathroom to share between 3. Again, you're looking for areas with few people that are far away from busy thoroughfares. Everyone needs to pee, so there have to be bathrooms around for everyone.\n\nIf you find one of these mythical bathrooms, never tell anyone where it is. Tell one person and everyone will know, and then you'll have to find a new one. It'd probably be further out of your way too.\n\nBasically, look for floors and hallways without many, if any, people. If you feel uncomfortable and as though you're somewhere you're not supposed to be, then you're on the right track. If an area is out-of-bounds to you then there'll be a locked door or a clear sign or someone will politely ask you if you're lost (you can lie and say yes if you like). It's not like you'll accidentally wander in the CSL or anything; you won't get into trouble just for walking around. If you find a single stall but it isn't for your gender, check the next floor up/down as sometimes they'll alternate.\n\nSee more discussion of this here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9lvur5/holy_shit_i_just_realized_my_worst_fear_of_going/?limit=500",

I\u2019m looking between a suite (both with and without a roommate in the individual room) and a traditional dorm and i\u2019d really appreciate a post with a compare and contrast. but my question is: how much does it affect making friends and social life? do you make friends in the shared bathroom? my sister had a traditional dorm and the night before every function or event they turned it into a beauty salon and it was a very social thing. will i miss that in a suite or is my sisters the outlier?",

My bathroom doesn't have locks for safety reasons and some people assume a closed-door means it's being used so don't lock the door. If it has a lock, learn to lock it. \n\n\\- Keep it clean, discuss with suitemates who cleans what and how often. \n\n\\- Wear flip flops still. Your suitemates might be strangers so you never know how their hygiene is. \n\nPros of suite-style-\n\n\\- You only share with three other people. Generally, if you have to go, there's not somewhere in there. \n\n\\- You decide how much it gets cleaned (pro and con)\n\n\\- You get \"more\" roommates aka more people that you can interact with, possibly forcing you to be social (pro and con)\n\n\\- It's basically what living in an apartment is like. You share a bathroom with 1-3 other people, clean it yourself, learn to knock, etc. \n\nI'm not sure how it compares but unless something really sticks out to you, it's just a single aspect of choosing which dorm to live in (if you have more than one option).",

Just having a roommate in general is not something I want to experience next semester at least even if they\u2019re like me, since we\u2019d both still be going around different parts of campus for class & coming back together in such close quarters. Especially if I go to a school in a large city w more cases.\n\nThings seems to be getting better & hopefully most people will be vaccinated then too, but idk that things are improving quick enough for me to confidently fill out a housing application before it\u2019s too late. I\u2019d rather just commute if most my classes are online or try to find a studio apartment (it\u2019s actually cheaper than campus housing anyways) if I have to live closer to campus.",
