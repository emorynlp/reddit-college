  "text": "When I was going through high school, I thought I was doing all the right things: getting good grades, taking lots of APs, making my way up the newspaper staff chain, competing regularly in debate competitions, and a few other extracurriculars and volunteering here and there. But now that I\u2019m putting everything into the Common App and I\u2019m quantifying all my work, I feel like I\u2019ve done nothing. Where are the extensive summer internships and the national awards and the impressive research and writing accolades? I see so many people with stats and ECs light years ahead of mine still not getting into some of their top choices and it makes me question whether I even worked that hard and if I even have a real shot at a college I would want to go to. Literally the first football game I went to was this year\u2019s HOCO game, I feel like I wasted my high school experience by both not having enough fun but also not working hard enough to get the stats I would need for my top schools. Whatever I\u2019m probably just hormonal. At least I\u2019m an auto admit to my state school ig",

I was having a full blown crisis in april/may when I started stalking people's LinkedIn pages and seeing all these insane ECs and awards that people had. Luckily I turned it completely around in the spring and over the summer, and I am way better off now than  at the end of junior year. \n\nStill haven't gone to a football game, homecoming, or any other event, but that's a different story.",

There are so many schools that are less competitive, but still offer a high quality education. \n\nSometimes I feel bad for not dedicating my entire high school experience to becoming the best STEM student, but high school shouldn\u2019t just be about academics.\n\nDon\u2019t let this sub get to you.

I sometimes feel like I wasted my experience by throwing everything into the sport I played since I\u2019m not going to play in college. I put it over grades, and have no friends because of my dedication. Then I look at the experiences it provided. I learned so much. I lived in Chicago with random families for 9 months because of the sport. It lead to me meeting so many people and developing a love for learning, acceptance of being weird, and so much more. Being as isolated as I was made me so much fucking better than what I would\u2019ve been with parties, friends, and no drive. Look at what you got out of your experience, not what you missed out on. That\u2019ll kill you. \n\nAnd if you feel you got nothing of value out of your course-rigor or extracurriculars, then start doing things that you feel are actually meaningful. You have so much power at 17. You can actually cause change. So don\u2019t dwell, just accept where you are and push forward with whatever lessons you take from the feelings you\u2019re having.",

I wouldn\u2019t worry about what college you get into as long as you don\u2019t burn yourself out and get a good mentor who can help you facilitate the proper and meaningful learning path.\n\nRemember, you can always transfer if you keep good grades.\n\nCollege is pretty overrated unless you are going for a career where degrees actually matter like lawyer or doctor. But if you are truly going for a lawyer or research career, who you know and being able to network with is key, never forget that.\n\nYou will do well, so don\u2019t worry! You have already laid the groundwork and shown you have drive. Again, don\u2019t let it burn you out or have disappointment put out that fire. Stay focused on your end goal, make sure you know how to cope healthily with stress, and do the needful. You got this!",

      "text": "You\u2019ll be just fine.\n\nI actually work for my local university\u2019s enrollment management team and I once felt the same way you did.\n\nAs soon as I went from middle school to high school, my prerogative immediately changed from \u201changing out with friends is the priority\u201d to \u201cI need to blow friends off and focus on the real goal here \u2013 doing everything and anything I can to ensure I get into a good college.\u201d\n\nBut along the way, really towards my junior/senior years, I had begun to realize that universities and colleges won\u2019t care if I don\u2019t have the 4.0/4.5 GPA or if I\u2019ve scored 4\u2019s and 5\u2019s on my AP tests (finished with a sub 3.4 GPA as an A-B average student and scored 2\u2019s across the board on all my AP exams).\n\nMost schools have actually pulled back on some of their GPA requirements (I believe mine now has a 2.0 minimum, down from 2.5 in years past). Extracurriculars do help, but even if it\u2019s as little as 2-3 in-school/out-of-school activities you\u2019re heavily involved in, they\u2019ll like those things.\n\nInternships and research partnerships are irrelevant in comparison to good grades and \u201cnormal\u201d extracurricular. I say \u201cnormal\u201d as my university has hardly ever had students mention doing either internships or research apprenticeships before completing their HS diploma.\n\nSo it\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not the 5-star applicant. If you ask me, they don\u2019t exist. College admissions processes vary by school. Some are more prestigious than others, yes, but the common ground between them all is diversity. It\u2019s what makes college so amazing. People of all different backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, skills, interests, all admitted to the same school. No one has the same experiences, and if they do, well there\u2019s likely a club on campus to share those experiences.\n\nMy advice: enjoy your HS years while you can. And make the most of them \u2013 grade wise and extracurricular wise. But don\u2019t compare yourself to other college bound students. Do what it is that interests you, and build your HS/applicant resume your way. The experiences will come, and so will the grades. If you try to be like those internship/research students, you\u2019re only going to stress yourself out. It\u2019s never too late to turn grades around or join new clubs/organizations.",

You being a normal person and having passion and capacity for success are looked at a lot more than people will mention (ie if you had every resource in the world and only did marginally better than someone who busted their ass to get where they are, they\u2019ll take the other person who didn\u2019t have the same resources at their disposal)",

Dont let yourself be skewed by the sample size here, it\u2019s self-selected. I felt like a failure at first for choosing to go to my state flagship for financial reasons as everyone here is going to top 20 schools, but after I left this place and started to appreciate what I had I felt better.",

      "text": "I mean hey, I had a 3.9 high school GPA I did choir a capella musicals I was the choir president did poli sci club and started on varsity tennis and worked, went to college at a local school (Ramapo College of NJ), got a 3.1 there, and got into Boston University for my masters even though I only joined one club and volunteered, granted I worked full time in undergrad and I\u2019m working full time now. I couldn\u2019t even tell you what I wrote my college app essays about but I know it wasn\u2019t nearly as meaningful and in depth as what I\u2019m writing for my law school apps right now. You will be FINE. Like I said I got into BU grad school with a bachelors from a practically unknown undergrad, it doesn\u2019t even matter where you go as long as you take advantage of your education!!!",
