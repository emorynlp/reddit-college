  "text": "Hey!  \nSo as the title says, I started an online course via Coursera in mid-late October and I listed it in my activity section, but life got in the way and it slipped my mind for a few weeks. I only just finished it, but now I'm a bit paranoid wondering if that will sink my application considering it wasn't finished at the time of admission. Does anyone have any thoughts on this matter?  \nThanks a lot",
