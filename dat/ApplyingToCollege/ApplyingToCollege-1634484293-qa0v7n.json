  "title:": "Please help explain to me how applying to college during a gap year works",
  "text": "Hello, I was recently planning to ED into a school, but due to family circumstances (that I don't feel comfortable elaborating on), I had to drop it. I am still applying for schools during the RD round, but am not nearly as confident because I had to drop my ED, which I very luckily had legacy status to. Unfortunately, my school does not consider legacy status in an RD application. While my grades, test scores, and ECs are decent, I don't think they stand out so much so that I have a  good shot at my dream schools, esp without legacy consideration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was planning to do a gap year regardless of whether or not I get into any college I want to go to. However, if I were not able to get into any schools I want to, I would be even more inclined to do a gap year. I heard that I can apply for schools during my gap year round. Theres also the added benefit that I can benefit of legacy in my ED next year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my question is, how exactly does applying to school during a gap year differ from applying to school during my senior year? Does applying during my gap year lower my chances at getting admitted?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading this!",

      "text": "Consider making an appropriate list now, rather than waiting (perhaps wasting) a whole year of your life merely to chase prestige. Getting rejected RD at your legacy school might not lead to acceptance ED next year. Your reason for taking a gap year should be to do something interesting you otherwise wouldn't have a chance to.",

              "text": "If you are accepted to a school this year in RD, and wish to hold onto that acceptance during the gap year, the deferred enrollment agreement with that school will most likely prohibit you from applying to more schools next year.\n\nIf you are planning a gap year anyway and you are hoping your family can come around to an ED application next fall, then don't apply this year.\n\nIf you do take a gap year, I would suggest getting in touch with teachers for recommendations in the late spring, get them lined up for the following fall.",
