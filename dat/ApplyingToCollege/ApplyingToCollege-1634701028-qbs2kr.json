  "title:": "My writing is trash and I\u2019m not getting in anywhere :)",
  "text": "I\u2019ve come to the honest conclusion that I can\u2019t write well enough to get into any schools except my state school. Narrative writing just isn\u2019t my thing at all. I am a technical writer and I like routine and formats. I like writing scientific papers and instructions on how to do stuff. I don\u2019t conceptually understand how to do narrative writing. I\u2019ve asked for help, I\u2019ve done all the writing prompts leading up to writing the supplements. I\u2019ve read examples and and tips and I still can\u2019t do it. It feels like I should be able to but I can\u2019t. The questions also ask questions I can\u2019t formulate an answer to and that also annoys me. I just feel bad bc I\u2019m asking my parents to spend so much money on Application fees fir schools I know I can\u2019t get into bc I write terribly.\nFor example: \n\u201cI like to read, so I\u2019d like to continue to join the book club. I like the environment so I\u2019d like to join the environment club.\u201d\n- This makes sense to me. It feels right. Bc I know that it\u2019s wrong and needs to tell a story or something. Idk I\u2019m just ranting",

I like what someone else in these comments said, if you\u2019re good at writing instructions then you should write your story in the format of an instruction manual! Colleges love to see unique takes on essays, I think that could be really good!",
