  "text": "I've seen at least 5 top schools already who have announced that they're releasing ED/REA at 7 PM EST. There are probably more, too. Why did they all pick this exact date and time? A2C is going to go insane this Thursday. Well, to be fair, A2C has already gone insane, but on Thursday we're going to lose any semblance of a grip on reality altogether.",
