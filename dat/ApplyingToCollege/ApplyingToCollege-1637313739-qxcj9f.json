  "text": "I'm in the middle of finishing and polishing my application as a community college transfer for Fall 2022 and came across something I got concerned about. I added a few courses that I was going to take in a future semester (Spring 2022) at my community college and put them under planned/progress on the application. \n\nIf something came up like the classes I planned to take were full or no longer available to me, would that impact me at all? \n\nAny advice or help is greatly appreciated.",

      "text": "Depends. If it\u2019s a course required to transfer, and you don\u2019t complete it, yes it would impact you. If it\u2019s not, you would probably just have to send an email letting them know you had to take a different course or whatever. In my experience with CSU transfers like 3 years ago, it was more of a \u201cdid you complete the requirements,\u201d and I never got the vibe they would reject someone over an elective course choice the semester before transferring lol.",
