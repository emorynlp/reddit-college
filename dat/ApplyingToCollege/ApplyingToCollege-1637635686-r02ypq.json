  "text": "Basically the title. We started off with \"tell me a little bit about yourself\" and I spoke for like a minuted. Then, he just asked *me* what questions I had for *him* about the school. I tried to like squeeze in a few of my experiences, but Idk.... should I be worried?\n\nEdit: I asked him a bunch of questions and we had a 50 minute long conversation, but not once did he ever ask me about my experiences/my thoughts",

My cornell interview was just an alumni learn more about cornell one so the \"interviewer\" just asked me a question about myself to get to know me then let me ask a bunch of questions. It was fun but definitely not an interview haha",

I\u2019m also assuming that you asked some in-depth, related questions, which would have given him a gauge on you. That\u2019s essentially what he was trying to do when he told you tell him about yourself, so, in general, the interview sounds successful.",
