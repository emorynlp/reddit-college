  "text": "Hello,\n\nI'm 22 and have seen it all. Most of my friends go to top schools - Ivy & T20s. I dropped out my freshman year to start my business but am going back next fall (T20 School).\n\nWanted to let you guys know that if you don't get into your top school choices, don't panic or think you're a failure or your life is over.\n\nA friend of mine dreamed of going to UC Berkeley. He was top of his class, high ACT, so many EC's, and didn't get in which was honestly soo surprising. He was the only kid who didn't go to college out of our graduating class - people thought he threw away his life\n\nHe went to a partner community college, worked his ass off, got into UCB, and now works at a FAANG making $420k/yr. All the kids who thought his life was over are now living at home with $100k in student loan debt with no job.\n\nIf you don't get in where you want to go, keep pushing. Figure out a way to transfer, go to a partner community college, or figure out a way to get involved at the school you want to go to. There is always a way in.\n\nDon't let your personal self worth get intertwined to a denial (or even an acceptance) of a school.\n\nYou going to Harvard doesn't make you any better than somebody going to U of Indiana or a small state school. Or you going to NC State doesn't make you any less than a human of those who go to NYU or Penn. In 10 years after you graduate, the school you went to won't really matter much after you have your first job.\n\nWish you guys luck on your acceptance decisions and the rest of your lives!",
