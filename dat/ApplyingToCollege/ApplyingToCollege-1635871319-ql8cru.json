  "title:": "if i add a common app college after my counsellor has uploaded the school report and rec, will the college still receive the documents?",
  "text": "i added UVA to my college list after my counsellor and recommenders uploaded their docs. i applied ea, and just got the portal link. it says that they\u2019re still waiting for the school report, official transcript, and recommendation, so i was wondering if these aren\u2019t included if the college is added later? when i was drafting my application, the interface looked the same as it did for others, so i\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just a delay or something like that.\n\nthank you!",
