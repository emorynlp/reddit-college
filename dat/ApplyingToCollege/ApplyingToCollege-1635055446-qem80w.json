  "title:": "QuestBridge Finalist; how would it affect Rice ED application",
  "text": "Although I was selected as a QB finalist, I did my research into the partnered schools and did not find many that genuinely interested me (aside from USC and Boston uni). \n\nI had decided beforehand that I really wanted to go to Rice so I ended up not ranking schools and to apply ED to Rice. I plan to mention my QuestBridge Finalist status on my diversity supplement essay and want to know what sort of effect this will have. \n\nWill they recognize that I did not rank schools and ED\u2019d to Rice and therefore hold more weight to my application since I decided that I\u2019m more interested in their school than others and made that sacrifice? Will they not care? Will they take it in a bad way since I did not use the QB match scholarship program by ranking schools?",
