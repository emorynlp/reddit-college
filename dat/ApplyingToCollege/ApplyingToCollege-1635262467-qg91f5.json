  "text": "Alright so basically i submitted my apps day before yesterday. For the dates of my test scores, I put the dates I ATTEMPTED them on but now when I check my ACT portal, the dates below the tests are the dates on which I RECEIVED the results, which is about a 4 day difference. Did i absolutely fuck up and my acceptance get rescinded if there is a 4-day difference between \"official dates\" and reported dates. Should I email all unis asap? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance",
