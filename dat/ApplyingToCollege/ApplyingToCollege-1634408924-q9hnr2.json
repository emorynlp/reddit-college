  "text": "Okay so I took the SAT a few weeks ago and got a 1020. I found the math hard and I underestimated how little time you get for the reading, so I randomly filled in the last 10 bubbles and got a 620 for the reading / writing portion. I absolutely suck and math and don\u2019t understand it..would the ACT be better for me since I am better at reading?",

The math section problems get harder the farther you get into the test, so you may want to take a practice test for that just to get a gauge of what it\u2019s like.",
