  "text": "My dad was discussing college decisions with me. He was ranking the unis in \"preference\" I should give when I receive my decisions. Since his \"acceptance list\" consisted of colleges like Stanford, mit and Columbia, I tried telling him that as an int Indian male applying for STEM, my chances are.... subpar at best. And then he's like colleges will accept me because their class won't be balanced with only toppers, and that they would want kids who are not at the top, but not at the bottom too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRIP",
