  "text": "So my school counts Honors classes as just normal 4.0 classes (which doesn't make any sense because there's no incentive for putting more work on yourself but anyways). Right now my GPA is around a 4.4, but if my school was normal it would be like 4.8 or something because I've never taken anything below honors classes. Back to my question, will this affect me on my college apps or no? I know some colleges calculate GPA on their own.",

In SC, with a 6.0 scale, a 5.21 wouldn\u2019t be very good at all.\n\nWith no context, how do you have any idea what a 5.21 even means? Under the process her school used up until last year, 5.21 wouldn\u2019t be that good. Top students graduated with \\~5.65.",
