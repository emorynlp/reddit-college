  "text": "hey everyone! i know a lot of our ED results are coming in this week. big theatre kid and musical theatre fan here, but something that has honestly helped me stay calm a lot this week has been listening to \u201csomething\u2019s coming\u201d from west side story once a day for the past two weeks before going to bed. it may seem silly, but if you\u2019ve never heard this song before, it is honestly the perfect representation of how i have been feeling and what i am hoping and dreaming for this week. and maybe it will help you too! best of luck with everything friends. you got this!",
