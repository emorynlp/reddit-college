  "text": "Hi first generation who goes to a giant school where I can\u2019t get one on one time with counselors here\ud83d\ude00\n\nEA deadlines are in a week and I\u2019m going test optional. My application is averge-ish, definitely not guaranteed Ivy material but I suppose there are a few minor things that could be noteworthy but I\u2019m not a very competitive applicant.\n\nI was going to apply to schools like Boston College, Villanova, UCONN, northeastern because they are more selective. I don\u2019t have a dream school, just whichever gives me the best deal. \n\nIs applying early to these schools worth it? I heard applying early gives you a bit of a boost but that much more competitive applicants are also applying early so it\u2019s also hard for people like me.\n\nI also heard that colleges give early applicants more financial aid but then I was told aid decisions don\u2019t come out until after RD anyways.\n\nI\u2019m really relying on the internet here and there\u2019s so much differing sources. \n\nThanks!",
