      "text": "remember your personal statement is not somewhere to just list all of your ECs, that is what the activities section is for. But for your specific question, you can write about teamwork, problem solving, if you had a president type role, you can talk about delegating. But again, i discourage you from just writing about all your ECs, personal statement is space to write about things not obvious elsewhere in your application, who you are as a person.",
