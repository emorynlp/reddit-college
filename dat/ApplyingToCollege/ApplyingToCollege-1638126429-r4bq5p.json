  "text": "For the special talents question, I was going to go deep into baking specifically, using an anecdote of a time when I was so depressed over the ending of a story I read, and it led me to make donuts for the first time because it was the main character's favorite snack, and kinda go into the \"qualities\" of a donut and how baking them comforted me and how I grew to be invested in baking in general, but I don't know if I am misinterpreting the prompt too much.",
