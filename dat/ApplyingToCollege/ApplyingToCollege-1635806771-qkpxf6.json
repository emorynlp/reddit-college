      "text": "How long has it been since you submitted your app? The \u201cforgot password\u201d thing only works if the college has received, downloaded, processed, etc your data all so that an account has been fully created. It doesn\u2019t automatically happen with you hitting the submit button on Common App. If it\u2019s been less than 5 days since you submitted, give it time. Wait until you get an email with the login info, or wait until 3+ days pass at least until emailing the office about it. The video profile can be submitted past Nov 1.\n\nAlso tagging u/irox123",
