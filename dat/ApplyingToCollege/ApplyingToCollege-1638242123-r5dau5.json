              "text": "Somewhat, but not impossible. Cornell is a target school, and MBB & Big4 hire from all majors, but some recruiting events may be geared toward Dyson kids or even exclusive, and you\u2019ll be competing w Dyson kids for clubs etc. Plus, a Dyson education is more directly preparatory for consulting. \n\nHowever, many people double major in both CALS and Dyson. Supposing you got accepted to either, it wouldn\u2019t be horribly difficult to apply for a second major (though handling coursework is a different story). \n\nIn the end it\u2019s up to you, Dyson is probably the better choice for education/opportunity but CALS is easier from a purely statistical standpoint. (If you apply for CALS, make sure to emphasize Econ and don\u2019t stray too far into business though, you don\u2019t want to look like you want a back door to Dyson) Although, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re willing and likely able to take on a second major and or are willing to do more legwork potentially to get a career offer",
