  "text": "hey everyone. I applied to Yale REA and wanted to send in some updates to my application. I was recently cast as a lead in the school musical and I got an internship at a startup created by a professor of a T5 university. Idk if these are worth mentioning to them since we\u2019re super late into the process and they may have already made decisions. Lmk if I should update them (they also say not to unless it\u2019s super important)",
