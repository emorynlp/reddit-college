  "text": "yay for literally the saddest ever title.\n\nthrow away because i don't want this on my actual account. many of you have probably interacted with me through this community. i've certainly been here enough to warrant that.\n\nnow, it all seems pointless.\n\nrecently I'd been coughing a lot. *A lot.* got myself checked in a hospital, and the reports  came back saying i have cysts on my lungs or something. my doctors are telling me it's kinda rare and that my lungs may collapse at any time, and even surgery is super risky and may not work out too well.\n\nbasically, i have a fair chance of dying. yay.\n\nBefore the report, all i could think about were colleges and an amazing future, and now i may not have that.\n\ni'm not even sure why i'm writing this, but i refuse to tell any of my friends yet (they have their entrance examinations and applications to focus on, I'll tell them eventually) and boy howdy is my family does taking this well (can you blame them?).\n\ni needed to get this off my chest somewhere (on that note, WHAT THE FUCK, NON CORPOREAL DIETY GOVERNING MY LIFE?!?!? WHAT THE LITERAL FUCK??! sorry) \n\nThis community is awesome and super supportive and been such a huge part of my life these last few weeks, so it seemed like the right place to write this. I'll probably delete this later, sorry for messing up your day with my weepiness.\n\ntl;dr was excited about colleges, found out i'm maybe dying and now i'm just sad, confused, eating a whole tub of ice cream and deflecting way too hard with humor",

Doing this required strength too and the fact that you're not telling your friends to prevent them from getting distracted just shows the kind of great person you are. You can get better, please don't lose hope! I'm sure you've got amazing stuff ahead for you in life. (As a sidenote, I would also suggest that even if you do end up telling a few of your friends, please don't feel guilty in anyway about it--friends are meant for you to share, so don't be afraid) <3",

Your parents are aware of it, right? \nTry to look for treatment methods, and never lose hope. \n\nYou have people who care about you, which shows you are a great person. \n\nTake care, and again, pm me whenever you want.",

You absolutely don\u2019t deserve this and it\u2019s heartbreaking that some people at such a young age need to deal with circumstances of this sort. \n\nI\u2019ve had a friend who\u2019s lung collapsed out of nowhere. She got surgery and had a few weeks of down time but she\u2019s completely fine now. Another good friend of mine was diagnosed with cancer as a child and was cured. Another friend had cancer twice and survived. Stuff like this unfortunately happens more often than one might think, but for what it\u2019s worth, at least know that you aren\u2019t alone. And we are living in 2019 where medical technology has advanced to groundbreaking levels. Coming from a family very involved in the healthcare industry, rest assured your health will be in good hands. I know that for a fact. There\u2019s risk to everything, but your doctors know what they\u2019re doing. \n\nAs much of a stressful time this is in your life, just try to relax. from the tone of your post, it seems like you\u2019re looking at things in a very light hearted and positive way and I hope you know that that\u2019s a great thing. Your family is there for you, and so are your friends. As well as us! \n\nLike someone else said, you should consider reaching out to colleges and see if you can send them an update about you where you can mention this. Maybe not now, but once things begin to settle. Focus it in the extenuating circumstances that you are facing and what you may have learned from this experience. Maybe ask /u/admissionsmom for some input on that. \n\nMy best wishes go to you. I hope for an easy recovery. Everything will be okay, keep your head up and try to get your mind off of it. Spend time with your friends and family as they\u2019re a great support net for you, and trust me your health will be taken care of. Feel free to reach out if anything!",

I know you are a strong person and will make your way forward with this. Don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s ok to feel whatever you\u2019re feeling.  Fear and anger are natural so don\u2019t try to squash them down.  Looking forward positively is important for sure but allow yourself to feel whatever comes. \n\nModern medicine is amazing and we are so lucky.  Try to do some breathing and focusing on your breath. There are some great guided meditations on an app called Koru. I\u2019m a Koru teacher, so I know they work and might help you through some scary bits. \n\nAnd yeah, with you and me as the bosses, I\u2019m pretty sure those cysts don\u2019t have a fucking chance.  Just ask my kids \u2014 I\u2019m very bossy. \n\nTake care. We are here for you. \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\ude0a",

I did the wrong thing and figured my life was fucked, so I spent the better part of my 20s drinking and doing drugs. Despite all that, I survived. Finally, at 28 I got my shit together, got clean, and enrolled. I graduated with honors last spring.\n\nI don't know what the future holds for you, but I know what the past held for me and I'm sure that if I had remained positive and did what my doctors told me to do, I would have recovered faster and have a better quality of life right now. Instead, I have permanent pain all day every day. I really didn't want to get all preachy but it's so hard to see someone headed towards the same path that you took when you already know where it leads. ",

When we met, he was in his early 30s maybe 10 or 12 years after his diagnosis, and I was in my early 20s. He and I started running together, ran in several half marathons and several Tough Mudders together. We went camping together. We live on opposite sides of the country, now, but if I make it to Raleigh, he\u2019s top of my list to see. \n\nPoint is: don\u2019t give up on yourself. Feel down, but realize this is an obstacle to clear and you\u2019re capable of doing so. I\u2019m thankful every day for Nick. You\u2019ll be someone\u2019s Nick.",

Just never doubt yourself, and if you ever do, we're right here.\n\nMaybe get a taco or go for movies or watch the sunset, but do enjoy and keep on believing. \n\nFor belief is what tips the scales in your favour. \n\nKeep the hopes up, there is always a chance. Always.\n\nYou're the man. \nAnd we're rooting for you. \n\n",

And you'll have left a legacy one way or another, stories for family to tell for years to come, like a legend or somethin....Idk\nAnd the thing I would be excited about personally (if worst case happens) is you get to see for yourself what truly awaits on the other side, no more theories or opinions, the real deal, the truth you get to see for yourself potentially. I'm kinda jealous actually.....\nHope this didn't make it worse. Just trying to find words of comfort, Idk what else to say",

You and your parents may also want to look into getting help or a consultation from a medical center that specializes in this area, one that is known to be a center for excellence. Usually these are academic centers, you can search online or ask for a referral from your doctors, especially if they are saying they don't know how to treat this. This is especially important if it is a rare condition. It sounds like your parents are staying on top of things. Stay positive and it will work out.",
