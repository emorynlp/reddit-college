      "text": "Funny story, I actually applied for MET originally and then got into EECS thereafter. So, the answer is no, MET does not reject your chances of getting into EECS. If you get rejected from MET, you automatically go into the selection for EECS. As far as you being qualified, nobody is truly \"qualified\" for EECS. Please don't think you need to be an extremely prestigious student to get in. Just know that you did your best on the apps, and the UC system is famous for putting students where they belong in terms of major. I have faith you'll get in, and let me know when you arrive here in Berkeley :)",
