      "text": "I think last year they said something about a 15% accept rate for deferrals compared to <10 REA and \\~3 RD. So you're in a good spot.\n\nStanford defers very few and rejects most of their REAs, unlike most other t10s. I think they all defer quite a few people.\n\nSend a LOCI, update them, and hopefully things go well for you.\n\n\\`\\` \n\nSo searched a bit and Stanny's REA rate was 9.5 in 2016, and it would probably be a lot lower right now because of test optional...I will guess that rates would be similar to Harvard, so <7. \n\nIIRC they defer only around 10% of the early pool.",
