  "text": "Hey. So basically I kinda produce music (mainly make beats etc) and its just a casual hobby nothing too serious. I have around 4 beats on soundcloud so its not anything too crazy but its just a casual hobby yk. So, my question is, should I add it in the activities section of the common app or should I just leave it out of it? Without it, I have around 6 activities. So yea, lmk what I should do.",
