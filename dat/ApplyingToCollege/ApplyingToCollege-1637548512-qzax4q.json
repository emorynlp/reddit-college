  "text": "Do you guys think I could write about my experience in the Jr. Lifeguard\u2019s program as a \u201csignificant educational opportunity\u201d? I\u2019m applying for marine biology and this is what led to my interest in the subject. We had guest speakers from local aquariums and I learned a lot about first aid and water safety as well. I\u2019m also concerned because I haven\u2019t really done anything with my interest because of covid. I\u2019m working on a deep-sea themed short film for my animation class\u2026but that\u2019s it! Thanks so much for any advice, have a nice day and good luck to anyone applying!!",
