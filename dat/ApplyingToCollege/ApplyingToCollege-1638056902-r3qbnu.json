  "text": "Every time I think about my ED results, I start to sweat and I feel as though it\u2019s becoming unhealthy. Everyone I know is giving me positive comments saying I\u2019ll get in but I seriously doubt I will cuz it\u2019s an IVY. I really don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I don\u2019t get in cuz I feel like I will have let so many people down and that getting in is kind expected of me, and when I talk about being rejected it just becomes more awkward. I feel like facing my friends and family if I get rejected will just be so awkward and it\u2019s so annoying how much pressure I feel like I\u2019m being placed under, when if fact the admissions process is out of my control now. \n\nIs anyone else experiencing this, and if so how are you dealing with it?",
