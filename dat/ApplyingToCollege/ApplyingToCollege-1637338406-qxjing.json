  "text": "So it turns out I legitimately just never realized that you could submit portfolios to MIT while applying. I turned in an EA application for MIT in October. I did this research project at a university and we have a paper that's going to be published this year. I talked about it in my application and quoted the abstract in the additional category, but didn't create a portfolio about it (as I was too blissfully ignorant to realize at the time). \n\nI checked and it's clearly way too late to submit anything. Should I still shoot my shot and email them about a portfolio, or just wait until December and submit it if I get deferred? They've already received a recommendation letter from the professor who was in charge, and I did mention it in my activities, so I don't know if it seems suspicious for me to not have created a portfolio.\n\nI feel incredibly dumb right now and I think trying to toss in a portfolio so last minute probably isn't the best thing to do, but I don't know if bringing up research in my application but not submitting a research portfolio will seem like a red flag.",

They already have the abstract and received the leader\u2019s recommendation letter, and I mentioned the organization and the award in my application. I\u2019ve checked the portfolio and they ask like 5-6 short questions (what did you contribute, how did this affect your research interest, etc.) so should I just send in a PDF where I answer all those questions? And should I specify this is because I didn\u2019t fill out a portfolio, or just tell them it\u2019s extra information? I think the only reason I\u2019m a bit hesitant about contacting them is because they already have received the actual proof and significant parts of a portfolio, so the only thing that\u2019s \u201cmissing\u201d are the short essays and the portfolio submission itself. I\u2019m really sorry about all the questions, I just really want to avoid annoying the AO!",
