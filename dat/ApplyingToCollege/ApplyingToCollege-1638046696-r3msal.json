  "text": "I did not prioritize school at all during freshman year and ended with 3 A- and 2 B+, and it was only mid sophomore year where I started trying, where I had 3A- and 2 A. Junior year had 4A+ and 1 A, and my Q1 senior report card had 5A+.\n\nI\u2019ll also add that I took progressively more AP and honors classes, and senior year I\u2019m taking 4 AP and 1 Honors. \n\nI\u2019m wondering how admissions officers are going to look at this. My ECs are really strong, so I\u2019m applying to 5 IVYs, and I\u2019m wondering how these grades are going to affect my chances.",
