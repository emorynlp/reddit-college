  "text": "Damn. After talking to my genius friends and bearing witness to multiple posts made in this sub... I just wanted to come on here and say that you really, truly are going to be alright. You are going to end up wherever you are meant to be; you are going to get a degree; you are going to be successful in whatever you do despite your sarcastic cynicism begging the opposite (ahh, Reddit...). Please don't drive yourself insane because you can't come up with one more EC or you have one B on your transcript. It can be so easy to get wrapped up in what family thinks, the incredibly high standards you set for yourself, your friends/teammates/peers, etc... but in the end, all you can do is show colleges your unique self and get on with things. As someone with severe anxiety, don't let THIS be the thing that debilitates you; don't make this a MILLIOONNNNNN times bigger than it really is. Sure, it's a huge deal, but apps don't need to be the source of all of your stress (we're already dealing with enough...) You don't want to go to a college that doesn't want you anyways, right? \n\nYes, this is all coming from someone who has mediocre stats- the most \"prestigious\" college I applied to was UGA, and I'm not really worried that I won't get in. I don't have any plans to pursue a complex STEM career, and I haven't even considered applying to the schools that are talked about 90% of the time here. I know that people have certain circumstances that really do make this process so much more stressful. I'm not trying to sound all deep or philosophic either, but I really just want y'all to know that everything's going to work out. If you're a high enough achiever to be applying to these schools, you're going to go somewhere you love. Hopefully this is a little safe haven of a post in the midst of a sea of stressful comparisons and conversations. The colleges that accept you don't determine your worth. I know you've heard that a million times, but it really is true. Best of luck to everybody!",
