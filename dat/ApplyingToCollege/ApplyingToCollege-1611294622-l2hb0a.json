  "title:": "A recent upsurge in the number of posts and people calling the Indian/Chinese education systems 'ideal' and 'meritocratic'.",
  "text": "I have witnessed an increasingly positive opinion shared via people in this subreddit towards the JEE exams in India and the Gaokao in China. They claim that these tests assess 'pure-academic-grit' of students and their aptitudes. As someone who prepared for the JEE exam for 3 years and then finally dropped it, I can assure all of you that what you have is 10x better. \n\nThe structure and complexity of the JEE is such that it pardons literally nobody. Our JEE All India Rank 1 guy, who also had olympiad medals and now attends MIT was studying for JEE for about 8-10 hours daily. That is the case for almost all aspirants if they're serious.\n\nNow who do you think is in the position to study Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics for 10-12 hours daily? Are low-income student who have to take care of their younger siblings and also work part-time to get a daily wage, or a girl from rural india who is forced to do the household chores (cause of patriarchy) in a position to study 12 hours daily for a single test?\n\nThe US system is trying to be generous, and atleast a bit humane in its assessment, and I think all of us should be happy about it. \n\nI'd like to conclude the rant with a quote:\n*Meritocracy exists only for the privileged.*\n\nEDIT: A number of critiques in the comment section infer falsely that I am advocating for the US system. If my government would ask me today what system I would want, I would most most most definitely not simply say Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V the US system. If you read my arguments closely, I have not once said that the US system is good. I've said that it's atleast trying (in part) to be accepting of students' situations. My post was in essence not against the Indian/Chinese system, not advocating for the US system, but specifically an address to the people who are touting the Indian/Chinese systems as somehow better than the US system.",

Literally your entire future will depend on how you perform in the span of a few hours, doesn't matter how good or bad of a student you were. Your score will be everything the university/college sees.\n\nPlus I can't imagine how stressful and boring studying for that would be. I was in the Chinese middle school system and when we studied for middle school finals,for an entire month prior to the test, all you would do when you go to school is to complete exam papers for math, Mandarin and English. ALL DAY LONG. No sports, no art, no music no nothing, just practice exam after practice exam for weeks on end.",

Since what I was doing was largely unguided I wanted an additional opinion and figured they'd be great at assessing my work.\n\nThe matter my research covered is a minor extension of what was taught in the 6th Semester for the CSE track at IIT-B. I gave one of the CSE faculty the draft, and after the few hours I spent touring the campus I got back to them. They reverted saying it wasn't under the UG curriculum at the university and so they couldn't give any concrete feedback. \n\nI know my draft wasn't the problem either, since a week later I submitted it for peer review and it was accepted for publication the following month.\n\nP.S. using they/them pronouns, doesn't stand for plurality",

I\u2019m sorry but the one-exam system is truly terrible (not just in Singapore but in many other Asian countries), and I found that I learned very little from the process other than how to use the correct phrasing to get the damn mark. Now that I switch to the US system, even when it\u2019s college, everything is a lot better when the focus on grade significantly drops (in my experience) and I actually get to enjoy what I learn in school.",

My sister cleared neet this year while I'm applying to UK,she knows how to calculate the angular velocity of a mouse in a wheel but she has no idea what a radiologist does,she hasn't even been to a hospital to see what the job entails and what she's getting into. There's no area of work experience,volunteering,extracurriculars. They've spent the past 4 years of their life learning for a 3hr exam,getting suicidal,building no personality of their own, hell they don't even know the recent health news bcz all they've been told to do is eat sleep breathe high level physics chemistry biology from books. In india, there's no other profession other than doctors and engineers, anything other than that you're a pure disgrace. You've been fed into your head that IIT(the most prestigious engineering uni in india) OR NOTHING. Go to iit/become a doctor and you'll be earning millions right after you graduate and life is set. No one cares about your personality. Hell one could find the cure to cancer and not get into a med school only because they were not from a backward caste and couldn't clear a freaking 3hr exam that by no means has the capability to assess what kind of a doctor you'll become in the future. \nApplying abroad, all the extracurriculars,work exp and volunteering we have to do for the sake of applications has made me such a better person,taught me what my career entails,what I should expect,how to talk to people (which is so important as a doctor) and has built me as a person. \nI see all the snake-y posts here that how your friends are snakes, wait till you come to india and sit one of these entrance exams, even your relatives,your parents will change the way they act with you if you don't clear it. \nJust check the suicide rates in Kota (a city where students come for these entrance exam coaching leaving their homes,their families and their childhood literally at the age of 15 to join a race). Everyone in the US/UK are really lucky to have such a system where a candidates personality,character and love for the course gets you a place in a college rather than in India,where your whole education is determined by a 3hr exam which you can only give once (in a year). \n\nThe funny part is, 90% of the students clearing the exam and getting into med/engineering colleges don't even want to be there, they just happen to be good at studies. Its just parental pressure and the mentality that its either doctor or engineering and any other field is basically ruining your life.",

I think a lot of american students tend to believe that their system is horrible, and while it does have some flaws, it is still much MUCH better than the Indian system. I didn't even try studying for JEE but one of my friends started preparing for it in 7th grade.\n\nThe US system takes into account low income applicants, as well as their problems. A job is counted as a pretty good EC and so is supporting your family. The IIT's do not care. You need to get a good rank out of the \\~million or so people taking JEE.\n\nBecoming a doctor in India is another incredibly competitive thing. There is another exam called NEET which is similar to JEE. All of these exams have olympiad level problems, with concepts you should be studying in college. And yet, you have to do all them in high school, along with your board exams.",

Another big issue is also the time limit. They specifically make it near impossible to complete the entire exam, so the added time pressure to complete as many questions as you can, elevates the difficulty to a whole new level.",

I've been completely abandoned by the education system of my own country...There is absolutely no way that I can go to a place with a center and come back in time for my exams. Which are by far more important than the JEE...\n\n\nOn paper... The NTA (the agency in charge of administering the JEE).. Has allowed candidates 4 chances to sit for it... But given its timings... It completely clashes with our finals... And with travel restrictions.. There's no way we can write it..\n\nPeople in the US think their system is bad.. But with a pandemic... Literally all colleges yeeted the SAT... Something they have relied on for all eternity... Just to support their students...\nWhat about India? Nope. Fuck the people. You have to write the test if you want to go to college..\n\nImagine being abandoned by your own country and your own system.  Y'all love to tell your tales.. But don't realize what you have is as good as it can be right now..\n\nHave a problem? Email the college.. Missed the deadline by a day? No problem.. There's a pandemic.. Let's extend the deadlines... Misentered some info... Just let em know and it'll be resolved..\n\nWhat about us?\nThere's 10 of us here in the country (that i know of) who want to do engineering (hence have to give JEE)... And each of us have emailed the NTA... The JEE Admin staff... The MHRD... Even the Grievance office of the government.... And no response..\n\n\nThis isn't the meritocracy point.. But it important to point out because the US college admissions system is near fucking perfect for people like us who have quite literally been abandoned..",

      "text": "Thank you for saying this.\n\nThough I am not writing JEE (I am an Indian as well), many of my friends are currently preparing for the first JEE which is to be held towards the end of February and the pressure for them is too much compared to the pressure students have when they apply for universities abroad. It is something like a do or die situation considering it is one of the hardest exams in the world and having a pandemic with education completely online does not make it better. The US system, although flawed, is inclusive and at least evaluates you solely not based on marks, but rather through your personality (essays) and what you might do in your free time, even if it is as simple as helping your household.\n\nThe Indian system prioritises marks over anything else, and if you have scored super-low or even slightly less than the cutoff, the chances of getting into a good university drops down dramatically and having your family members pressurise you a lot makes life a living hell for students who study for almost 15 hours a day. In fact, there is a reason why there are so many student suicides associated with not clearing the JEE/NEET etc.",

But you are looking at this from a JEE standpoint. It is important to understand IIT is like the Ivy League of Indian Engineering universities.\n\n**37.4 million** students are expected to graduate in 2020. On average, **900k** students appeared for the JEE Mains exam. That is **<0.02% applying**. IITs have a **<2%** acceptance rate. \n\nSimilarly, Harvard has an acceptance rate of **4.7%** acceptance rate with **43k** applications out of **3.7 million** students who graduate from high school. **<0.01%** apply. \n\nThe Ivy League graduates in America and the IIT graduates in India put in nearly the same amount of hours every day, albeit in different areas.\n\nMost people I know did not prepare for JEE. By the above numbers around 36.5 million. \n\nFor **99%** of students in the Indian education system. They prepare for a few months before the 10th board exams. The grades determine what classes they can pick in 11th and 12th school. Then they prepare for the 12th board exam for 3 months. The grades determine which college they can go to.\n\nThat's it. Most people have adequate time to prepare, and often low-income students get the highest grades. Except for these preparation periods, students can spend their time however they like. Moreover, engineering graduates from non IITs are well paid depending on the university and their performance in college. i.e based on merit.\n\nFor **99%** of the students in America in order to get into universities, they have to put in the work for 4 years in a variety of areas-- ECs, Volunteering, Standardised tests, APs.  \n\n\nI think the IVY leagues **and** IITs are as you put it a \"meritocracy only for the privileged\", But most Indian students have it better off than their American peers. The Indian system is far from perfect considering bribery etc, but it is more of a meritocracy than the American system.",

But I think what the commenter that you replied to was trying to say is that even with easier standardized tests, you literally have no idea if you will be selected or not, which is where the \"unfairness\" comes from. American colleges are very very random because of their holistic process (diversity, financial aid, affirmative action, etc). One of the flaws about holistic applications is that a meritocracy is not really apparent. Additionaly, test preparation really depends on what school you go to in the US. A person who goes to a private school will most likely have test preparations, but public schools usually have a strict class agenda that makes it impossible for preparing for SATs in school (but I do agree that doing well in school should lead to a good score). At least for a college decision based on a test, you will know your approximate place and apply to your \"matches\" carefully. In the US, even a smart student has no idea if Ivies or T20s will accept them. Besides, the fact that college essays ask you to be so personal is in my opinion very arrogant of colleges. Colleges shouldn't value students by their morals because they have no right to pass that kind of judgement. But anyways, I sidetracked very hard there LOL. Again I completely, 100% agree that standardized tests in India, China, and probably the other Eastern Asian countries are harder. But please try to understand where some of US students' rants are coming from. This is most likely a privilege issue, but at the same time, even my parents (from an East Asian county) have a hard time understanding the US college application system because of their vagueness.",

Suicide and self-harm are sickeningly normalised and these kids are on a grind 24/7. \n\nWhile the American system is also extremely flawed, India's collectivist society also makes the failure of missing that mark cut-off or not getting that rank like 10times more amplified and children are crushed under the weight of their parent's pressure and the pressure that they've been putting on themselves. The IIT's have also been extremely glorified to the point where many believe it's their only chance at social mobility and not achieving that when you're already struggling financially just because of a single mark or percentage is horribly depressing and almost dehumanising.

The irony is that those who get admitted to IITs and all, if given an opportunity to study abroad in some T20 at less tuition, will immediately leave their seat and go.  Even AIR 1 went to MIT.\n\nSecond, the paper pattern in my opinion is wrong. For example, I enjoy Maths and Physics but not Chemistry, but there is no such choice to do a particular section. It is either all or none. What does Chemistry even have to do with Software engineering or programming broadly speaking????\n\nThird, just for the sake of saying it, the reservation system is another factor that demotivates me. I mean if it is indeed a purely academic-based testing system, why does someone else - who got fewer marks than me, get a seat that I else deserved \"academically\"?\n\nFourth, yes they are prestigious institutions producing top-quality engineers and all, but not all branches of IIT, IIIT, NIT do equally well added to the fact there is merely less than 2000 seats in all IITs combined for more than 1600000 aspirants. And even out of those 2000 selected, not each one does equally well either. It may be hardly 100 who even get a decent package at some MNC, and 2 or 3 who make the news for the \"package\".\n\nComing on the subject of the newfound business - Coaching industry. Why do I call it a business? It is worth 1600cr. Either be in the list of rankers, or in the list of bankers. In grade 11, I also joined one of them and believe me you do not want that kind of experience. Out of a class of 80 students closed in a 8x8ft room for 8 hours, one look around and you will find only dead dreams and parental/societal expectations in the eyes of 70 of them. And this is the case for 90% of the aspirants who are stressed, broken, sleep and food-deprived and isolated. \n\nIt is always \"look at the brighter side\" and \"2 saal ki baat hai, phir aish hi aish hai\"",

If a person from such horrid circumstances was to compete with you, a person armed with privilege and all possible resources at your hand, how do you expect them to secure their place in this \"meritorious\" world?\n\nYour marks are hardly just your merit. It is a sum of your privilege, your resources and your talent. So don't make the mistake to deem yourself meritorious and in the place of a GRAVE injustice.\n\nReservation system has its flaws, no denial in that.

I thought you were telling him to stop complaining as there are others worse off and to accept and be grateful for what you have, which is a mentality I dislike.\n\nHowever, I do think the system looks at things the wrong way. The reservation system is messed up because it's outdated and can easily be taken advantage of. It was initially introduced to give the lower caste members better opportunities. However, it makes no sense now, as the discrimination is nothing like how it was before, and doesn't really exist at the educational level. Everyone irrespective of caste is given an education. The main thing that decides the quality of education is money, which doesn't have anything to do with caste any more. Moreover, the reservation system is keeping the caste system alive by keeping it relevant. The only reason it still exists is  because the government keeps track of the caste of people and uses it.\n\nWhat the system should do is focus on giving education that does not depend on how much money one possesses. Education as a whole should be a right, not a service. But that's clearly not how it is. The government just keeps farming the reservation system for votes and doesn't bother improving the education system at all.",

It is not like the earlier times, true. But NO DISCRIMINATION is a big lie. It IS there in every aspect in ingenius forms, even today. Education sector sees that. Maybe in the cities we may not know about it, but the rural India is very different a scenario.\n\nEveryone irrespective of caste is given an education\nDude! Just go and read any newspaper. Or just search for Dalit on google. You'll get tons of bulletins about how people are thrashed/outcasted/killed just for touching plates, enetering temples or riding a damn horse! Now, going to school and getting education is more grave a sin according to the society that surrounds people like them. Also, you might nonchalantly say, \"It is just some bulletins.\" YES THEY ARE. They are just the tip of the iceberg: things so grave that they catch the eye of OUR MEDIA or get reported at police station. So there IS STILL A LOT OF DISCRIMINATION. \n\nmoney, which doesn't have anything to do with caste any more.\nPartially true, but would be horribly wrong if considered true for the whole nation. Urban areas have people from all castes, many so-called lower caste people have managed to climb up and homogenise in the society. But still caste dictates a lot of monetary stuff. Do you know, caste is very much related to the jobs people do/ allowed to do? An overwhelming majority of sanitary workers are Dalits. \n\nthe reservation system is keeping the caste system alive by keeping it relevant\nTRUE. But then what do you expect? The politicians play on those votebank strategies and do not wish to provide equal opportunities, invest in educational infrastructure and work on the caste issue to dismantle it from the roots? Caste is relevant due to many things, it only comes to people's eye when the upper castes don't get seats for admissions, otherwise, for them it is all good. People still advocate Brahmin pride and then blame reservations is just a huge hypocrisy. Reservations are helping people to get a better future, who would otherwise always be sanitation worker or something of that sort. \n\nWhat the system should do is focus on giving education that does not depend on how much money one possesses.\nYes. The Delhi model is beautiful. That's exactly what govt schools are supposed to do. But they are impoversihed and private ones mint money. So again it's about MONEY and PRIVILEGE.",

It was so intellectually fulfilling, but I think the problem lies in the competition.\n\nI mean, JEE Mains (Stage 1) is super chill but JEE Advanced (Stage 2) is the one that trips people. Not to forget, your major is chosen by your scores, so you can't study what you want in undergraduate (merit-based system).\n\nBut this fact doesn't correlate with IITs being bad. They're super awesome colleges. I mean, it's kinda unfair to compare a 62-year old (IIT Bombay) with a 385-year-old (Harvard University) institution. IITs are doing much better than other colleges for what they're.",

      "text": "\"Meritocracy exists only for the privileged\"\n\nA *holistic* meritocracy is actually ideal for society.  We need to take into account talent and ability AS WELL AS motivation and effort.  The US system gives students ways to express how they've worked hard outside of school.  You still need to be a hard worker and to do exceptionally well given your life circumstances in order to get into an exceptional college.\n\nYes, you must be privileged in order to study for a test 10 hours a day, but you must also be hardworking.  Let's be honest.  Most privileged students in America don't spend anywhere near that much time studying.  We need to give credit where credit is due and reward hard work.  Meritocracy provides the incentive to work as hard as you can, and incentivizing hard work will be good for our society.\n\nAt the same time, not everyone has the same opportunities, and the beauty of the US college application process is that students have opportunities to express how they made the most of what was given to them.  This allows colleges to have an even better chance at rewarding hard work rather than privilege.\n\nThe SAT score is very important, and so is the essay.  The SAT and your GPA show what you are academically capable of, and the essay is your chance to show how hard you worked to get where you are today, to explain struggles you've gone through, and to demonstrate what kind of a person you are.  BOTH are important.  Our application process's holistic approach takes into account both.  An exceptional essay should cover for a poor SAT score, and vice versa.  The essay/extracurricular sections should not be used as an excuse to admit a mediocre student, but rather as an opportunity to allow an unconventionally exceptional student to shine in their own way.  Basically, you need to explain how you worked hard and maintained motivation despite your exceptionally bad life circumstances in order to compensate for an exceptionally bad SAT or GPA.  **Something about your application still needs to be exceptional in order to demonstrate that you are a good choice for an exceptional school.**",

The essays were actually engaging, unlike the joke that Indian schools describe as essays.\n\nWhile the IIT's are great as making engineers, entrepreneurship is terrible here. Some people from IIT's end up going abroad, where, for some miraculous reason, they perform at the top of their fields. And I'm not saying that IIT's can't create entrepreneurs. They can, but that's only because of the peer groups, NOT the faculty/resources.\n\nOh, and another thing, the Professors are paid chump change compared to what the teachers at Coaching Institutes make. Kota, a city that is the HQ of most coaching institutes in India, has teachers who are paid $150K to $200K vs the Professors at IIT Mumbai, India's flagship engineering school, who make about 70K, and that's for the 0.1%. The others hover close to 30K, and that still is a stretch. When the amount of effort vs the compensation graph is so unbelievably horrible here, it's no surprise that most professors don't give 2 shits about the students' performance. \n\nP. S. Kota is a small town, and relatively cheap to live in. Mumbai is as expensive as NYC, if not more. That should put the salaries in a better context.",

Social mobility is better in every other country discussed here when it comes to university entry. It's way easier to get into a top university from lower classes in every other country than in the US. Value added (i.e. salary increases) by education is higher in every other country than the US by proportion.\n\n\"Exceedingly rare\"? What about recruited athletes? Are they academically capable enough or worthy to go to Harvard on a scholarship just cause they can run fast and catch a football? What about legacy?

      "text": "Once I had completed 10 grade it was given that I had to writ the JEE exam, but, just as I was enjoying post final exam holidays I discovered the beautiful system of the western education, though with flaws it was way better than the Indian education style. A system which adores to personality and way to express yourself in essays.\n\nThere are no set rules in western education, just let a kid roam around and explore with extracurriculars and essays and the more you stand out the higher your chance of excelling. While Indian education is just a factory with quality check called JEE, the number not expressing the child's passion, interest or personality, infact many JEE top scorers lose their personality because of the extensive grit, just watch any video of a JEE topper, they look like they haven't socialised for years and you can see the emptiness in them.\n\nWestern education lets you do things your way, like, you can write a diss track of a college and get in, do that in India and you'll be kicked of the planet. Most Indian kids when they enter highschool are told to not participate in competitions like debates and even ENGINEERING COMPETITIONS when the whole JEE exam is FOR Engineering. In India engineering is seen as a money making degree and most Indian engineers regret getting into it.\n\nAn indian girl killed herself because her parents didn't let her Persue music as a career and she even cleared JEE, which shows that exams don't account for your passion for the subject you might hate it and still clear the exam.\n\nThere is video which documents a place called kota factory. Kota is a place with the best coaching institutes for JEE, but, every year a 11th grader commits suicide in those institutes just because of that exam.\n\nIn India you become an engineer and then decide which path you want to choose for your life. A parent would send their kids to the worst engineering colleges rather than an prestigious arts or humanities college. You're clowned on when you pick arts or humanities, you could be the best artist and still not earn respect.\n\nIf you want to prepare to for JEE, you are told to not talk to girls, because guess what relationships are a distraction and people are in relationships are demonised, not just by the teachers but the students themselves. It's not even relationships nowadays, boys are not allowed to talk to girls or else they are suspended, there was video which surfaced which showed a guy and girl congratulating each other for getting good grades in 10 grade, in the video you could see  them hugging each other, but, both parties were suspended and even the HIGH COURT approved of this descision.\n\nThe Indian education system is very cruel and accepts no excuses. Exams may seem standardized and fair, but, there are factors which you have no control off. American AO's try to understand the students background and economical situation and then they base their evaluation. In India your marks don't depict whether you were born on the streets or don't do justice for the sacrifice in other areas.\n\nThough I do understand that there are clear flaws in American education, but undermining the difficulties of students in different systems is disrespectful.",

The government provides reservation to EWS students for a reason because they know it might be more difficult for them to study for the JEE\n\nThe only problem with the JEE is that in order to be equal, it has to believe that everybody is the same and reject individuality",

And even then, poverty was just one of a plethora of disadvantages a student can have. Someone can have a serious migrain issue that demands of them to take class A drugs that really damage the student's memorization abilities (something that is tested on the exam). That was obviously a very specific (and personal) example, there can be other factors like social discrimination, yada yada yada. \nIs there a reservation for students who lost their fathers/mothers a day before the exam? Is there a reservation for students who have abusive fathers who are often violent at home(something prevalent in India)?\nYou get the point, you can never have enough reservation for everyone. It's much better to let the students tell their own stories.",

In countries with pure \u201cmeritocratic\u201d systems, they would only be seen by that metric and most likely be rejected, whereas in the US system, there are spaces to explain their situation to AOs to help understand what was holding them back from being the student they CAN be in college.",

      "text": "Literally everything you've said here applies completely if not even more to the US.\n\n> The structure and complexity of the JEE is such that it pardons literally nobody. Our JEE All India Rank 1 guy, who also had olympiad medals and now attends MIT was studying for JEE for about 8-10 hours daily. That is the case for almost all aspirants if they're serious.\n\nTell me how this is different at all to the US system. In the US students also suffer from the issues of not having time to study, having their own responsibilities, systemic and geographical barriers to success, etc, etc. Literally none of this is mutually exclusive at all. In fact in the US if you want to take AP exams and standardised tests you have to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\n> Now who do you think is in the position to study Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics for 10-12 hours daily? Are low-income student who have to take care of their younger siblings and also work part-time to get a daily wage, or a girl from rural india who is forced to do the household chores (cause of patriarchy) in a position to study 12 hours daily for a single test?\n\nAh yes and can these students do the \"HoLisTiC\" extracurriculars that US unis get their panties in a bunch over? No. Can they write a Common App essay to even one tenth the standard of a native speaker? No. Do they have the time to write forty five supplements for top schools? No. Again, how is this mutually exclusive?\n\n> The US system is trying to be generous, and atleast a bit humane in its assessment, and I think all of us should be happy for it.\n\nLMAO, which explains why people like Olivia Jade can pay their way into schools without even bothering to study. You can donate a couple million to Stanford or Harvard and get in. Can't do that at IIT or Peking or Tsinghua. Because they're actually legitimately meritocratic institutions who don't use their students to milk donations. Are there inequalities? Yes. But the US's level of inequality is absolutely massive compared to theirs.\n\n> I'd like to conclude the rant with a quote: Meritocracy exists only for the privileged.\n\nYes, which explains why the US is clearly so equal and why top schools clearly have incredibly fair systems of assessment. LMAO get the fuck off your high horse OP. Pretty much every student at HYPSM fits the same cookie-cutter shit: founder of a fake-ass 401k organisation, an athlete, white legacy student, donor, is a top athlete in a sport where you can pay for coaches and equipment, or has some sort of extreme talent which generally comes from having privileged backgrounds in the first place.\n\nHas this entire thread forgotten about the existence of legacy, recruitment and donors? Jesus Christ. You people are deranged.",

It favours legacies and it favours rich people. \n2) URM, low-income students usually do not have the resources to have fancy and holistic ECs. \n\nBut, the post wasn't advocating for the US system anyways, it was a commentary on why it is better than the Indian/Chinese system, meant specifically for people who are of the opinion that the Indian/Chinese system is better. \n\nMany well-off students I know, who have applied to the US in the past have mentioned cooking, taking care of their siblings, teaching their younger siblings, doing household chores in their activites list or in their essays. This is also the case for low-income students. Even though they are at a massive disadvantage due to their lack of resources, atleast the things they do in their daily life, their hardships etc. are a part of their application, and sometimes very valuable parts. \nYou'll need to donate atleast $5-10mn to \"secure\" a seat in Harvard, and I don't think that population represents even 1% of the total applicant pool, on the other hand, size of the low-income applicant pool is a good deal higher. It is rather funny how you passingly conclude that the inequalities in the process in US are higher than those in India by quoting a singular example of Olivia Jade.\n\nAdditionally, try to not be cocky in your arguments next time :). \nThey go a long way to instantly invalidate your arguments.",

The SAT, ACT, grades still exist?????? You literally have to reach thresholds at top colleges to even be considered??? And every single problem is amplified by the gap in extracurriculars, that poor people cannot access?????? \n\nAgain, the UK is literally not based on numbers. It's based on context of where you are and what school you go to. I don't know how many times people have to explain this until you understand it. It just doesn't use extracurriculars, which are the biggest time sink in the US application process, to differentiate applicants.

That\u2019s y there\u2019s such a huge pressure to do well in the gaokao, to the point that for the last few months it\u2019s just pressurized studying from the teachers (who monitors ur studying every second) and your parents. \n\nStudents basically don\u2019t hv a choice :/",
