      "text": "Generally, institutional scholarship applications are not committal or binding in any way. I\u2019m sure there are some, but I\u2019ve only ever seen one (a departmental scholarship at Missouri S&T) which required enrollment prior to submission. And even then, it would be obvious you had to enroll first. Colleges generally understand how big of a role finances play and will usually offer their full, effectively-final aid package before enrollment is necessary. I\u2019d make sure to read the details of the specific scholarship you\u2019re applying for to make sure it isn\u2019t committal or contingent on enrollment, but odds are it isn\u2019t. Hope this helps.",

Again like we\u2019ve both said I am pretty sure they are not. I feel like asking the university would be a no-no.",
