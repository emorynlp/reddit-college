  "text": "So with regular decision deadlines around the corner, I know we all have to submit mid year reports. This year, my grades have significantly dropped in relation to my grades from previous year\u2019s (as of now 3 B\u2019s compared to near perfect grades before). I might be able to up these grades but I\u2019m not sure. I had very severe personal circumstances at home and personal life which caused me to lose focus for a while, in turn dropping my grades significantly. Will this affect my application to colleges? Will they understand? I\u2019m applying to t10s and t20s for reference and before my application easily fitted the bill but now with this drop in grades im not sure.",

Talk to your counselor about this.\n\nAlso, you can send an email to the colleges explaining the extenuating circumstances if you want.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m sorry you feel that you need to explain or apologize for Bs. Bs are very respectable grades!",
