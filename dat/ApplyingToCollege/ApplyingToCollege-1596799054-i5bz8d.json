  "title:": "PSA: A2C Class of \u201821 Essays Presently Suck. Here is what all of you need to do differently and you don\u2019t need a coach to improve",
  "text": "This might belong on one of the off my chest subreddits and is long but if you don't get it after reading this tome of a post, then no one can help you and you might as well burn the application fees on steam games and sweets.\n\nI thought I was fed up before so I wrote the previous post. Little did I know y'all would do it to me again but 10x worse. Now, I'm mad as hell. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nYou people do not get how admissions officers do their jobs. I think if you could truly empathize with this, you'd be better off. All of you. I've given you all the information you need for this but now it's on you to apply it to your situation. Time to listen, kids. For real and for your sake. Accept the truth. I think of the hundreds of essay ideas I've reviewed here, maybe 2 have been good. That's right. 2. The rest are basically garbage.\n\nSo don't think you're the exception. You're not. For kids that are so smart on paper, I'm just so disappointed by the lack of initiative to grow and learn something for once. Do better guys.Throw your pride out the window if you want to get in this cycle, especially if you're asking for aid. I can take a horse to water but it's on you people to drink it.\n\nI'm disturbed that you guys are not receiving and internalizing the good advice here and you want the quick fix. In your minds the quick fix is an example essay from someone else. Not relevant and not a good approach. Be rational and think about this logically? Was a masterpiece painted in a day and a carbon copy of something else? No. No. No. Stop taking shortcuts. Stop looking for instant gratification.\n\nYou all think your ideas are still good. They\u2019re not. The pride kicks in. I spoonfed you a curated list of steps on what to do and read and then you guys say you need sample essays in order to understand, ignoring all the previous wisdom that is out there. I would have died and gone to heaven to have this back in my day and you guys just toss this away.\n\nFor the love of god people, you do not need examples. This is not a math problem. There is no right answer but there are good approaches and bad ones that don't help your case in admissions.\n\nRead the post thoroughly and read the brainstorming post I've written and others here on the sub or on the web more broadly (yes, I said web) Brainstorming for Dummies is what I should repost it as.\n\nRant over. Moving on to new content. Listen and learn. None of it is truly new, I just copied it from the links in my other post. Everything you could ever dream of is already on this sub, guys.\nThis is the only part of your application that you have total control over at this point.\nCan't change your circumstances, race, or years of ECs, the school you go to, or how you couldn't take the SAT / ACT this year. This is on you.\n\n---\nSince many of you struggle with clicking on links, here are some tips from parents of CC. These are legit insights. I did not edit these so it\u2019s quoted essentially. It\u2019s in your interest to follow this advice if you\u2019re not working with a pro and DIY\u2019ing this. Do not debate this especially on the mental health part. It is debated on cc if you click the link in my other post so go view the drama over there. Take it as a nugget because I keep getting the same damn question over and over. Read this before you read the previous post. \n\nBottom Line: don't have more than 2 adults review your essays, ideally those that are aware of the college process and what good writing looks like.\n\n\u201c\u00b7 The admissions officer reading your essay did not write the prompts. Their goal really isn't to know the answer to the prompt. It is to know you.\n\n\u00b7 The question they are trying to answer is what else is there to you that doesn't show up in the rest of the app that should make them want you on campus? The essay is what makes you 3D to them. It is a chance to show them what makes you tick and what could make you a positive addition to their campus.\n\n\u00b7 Sure, you need to loosely answer one of the prompts. But figure out what you want to tell, then fit it to a prompt.\n\n\u00b7 Those poor admissions officers read hundreds of essays on the same prompts every year. Unless you have a whale of a sob story (immigrant boat people or homelessness type big), my advice is to look for something positive to write about. Things that seem huge to a teen (secrets about sexuality, overly religious parents, abusive parents, etc) are not uncommon themes, but also don't really make you stand out in a positive way.\n\n\u00b7 The admissions officer has to meet with the team and make a case for you. They'll shorthand you as they debate it -- it is probably better to be the \"kid who loves reciting Chaucer \" than the \"depressed kid from Connecticut\".\n\n\u00b7 Teens are notoriously terrible at judging the quality of their essays and how they will come across. They are also awful judges of whether any humor they've included is funny to an adult. Get an adult editor who has some understanding of the admissions process.\n\n\u00b7 Here's another tip: be likable in your essay. Colleges want to admit people they like.\n\n\u00b7 A Columbia admissions officer once said that your essay should be so about you, that if it fell on the floor without a name, a classmate could pick it up and identify the author. If you are all about your mental illness, then write about that. But if you prefer to be identified by some other attribute of your personality, that is probably a better topic.\n\n\u00b7 The point behind an admissions essay is to \"sell\" your application-- to give the adcom a chance to see you as more than just your statistics, to separate you from others with identical qualifications.\n\n\u00b7 I'm not convinced that it's the best time to point out anything which doesn't \"sell\" your application.\n\n\u00b7 No one is suggesting hiding mental health issues. But the suggestion is simply that this particular time and place may not be the right one to highlight it.\n\n\u00b7 Attention to all teens: The person reading your essay and deciding if YOU will get into their college is an adult. No generational difference can erase the fact that, unless you are a great writer (bearing in mind that the vast majority of teens are not great writers), the college admissions officer is primarily interested determining if you can succeed at that college, and if you fit in. The adult reading your app is protecting the bottom line of the college: keeping students in school, who help fill their coffers. If that adult feels you don't measure up, especially because of red flags in your essay, he/she isn't going to admit you. You are selling yourself, so give them a reason to say yes.\n\n\u00b7 This is a time when you should consider your audience carefully. They ARE judging you. Even a millennial admissions officer is tasked with something of a gatekeeper role to identify students most likely to succeed in their environment. Pointing out the reasons you might not succeed, might add drama to campus (they do NOT want drama on campus), or cost the college more in services, is not helpful.\u201d\n\n\nWilliamTheReader case study example from the AO's perspective.\n\nI have realized something. Many of you have been really overrating the quality of your essays, or you just have no idea what top colleges are looking for. This is concerning to say the least. So, as the deadlines are approaching, I want to give some insight on how essays are actually evaluated. This is critical advice that I'm not seeing anywhere else on the internet, and it comes mostly from my experiences on the other side of the table as an AO. The main takeaway is that essays are the single most important factor on your application, excluding outside factors you can't control (race, HS, hooks etc.)\n\nThe first thing you have to understand is that there is only one universal goal that a top admissions essay has to accomplish: to make the AO like and root for you on a personal level. No other universal rules exist. That is the only guiding principle, everything else is dependent on the AO\n\nIf I reject the 36 ACT 4.0 superstar, I lose nothing. If I accept him/her, I gain nothing. This is dangerous, because now we have a wealth of kids to pick from whose fate affects us in no way.\nIt's January 2nd, 2019 and I'm starting to read applications. I'm going through the applications for my region and read Applicant A. He's a USAMO qualifier, he tutors at-risk kids, he is captain of his state championship debate team. But he writes a really sort of average common app essay. Well my enthusiasm for him is only going to be so-so not because I choose not to be, but because I genuinely don't remember anything about him ten applications later. But, he still gets to make it through to the next round because his accomplishments are really strong and he scored a 35 / 3.95 UW.\n\nSo his application comes up in committee. I, as his regional counselor, am responsible for pitching him. I stand up and tell my colleagues about this academic superstar, accomplished leader in his community, family oriented role model. I then explain his common app essay. I say all of this in sort of a matter-of-fact prose style. I try to be enthusiastic but faking it is hard. I get no reaction from the rest of my colleagues because 1) I personally am not enthused by the essay, and my lack of enthusiasm is very apparent and 2) his common app objectively sounds generic. Well, none of my colleagues are going to throw their weight for a kid who I myself am not crazy about. Also, nobody gets fired if we reject this superstar. We vote. He gets half yes's and half no's and he ends up in the deferred/waitlist/rejected pile. I don't personally care about this applicant, so I don't vote to appeal his case in the next round (which is something AOs do if they really love a kid that gets voted down).\n\nThen, I pull up the next applicant file. Applicant B, a girl with lower scores and worse ECs than Applicant A. I visibly get excited, as I had been anticipating this profile all day. This excitement translates immediately to my colleagues indirectly (as any room of people would) and the intrigue starts to build. They're wondering, what's got WilliamTheReader so excited? I tell this story about this sort of average, haven't done anything noteworthy applicant. I have an outline for what I'll say because I've been thinking about this particular case for a while. I describe the common app essay and how it made me personally feel, and even quote one of the more profound lines in her conclusion. Her supplements are well crafted, vibrant, and create a full picture of her. Everyone in the room can tell how passionate I am about this girl, and since I work with them everyday and there's some level of respect/office politics going on nobody thinks it's worth it to fight against me. We're all veterans, and the first rule you learn about committee is to pick your battles. We vote and she thus gets 0 no's (and therefore all yes's), and she gets the acceptance.\nThis sequence of events has happened multiple times every single day of committee, for every admissions office at every elite school in the country, for the past 20-30 years. As you can see, a bad pitch can ruin a good application, but a good pitch can really make the difference for a so-so application. Average essays ruin top applications, strong essays boost average applications.\n\nu/minigolflyf said it well: Don\u2019t be afraid to annihilate your baby (essay). #5 https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fxxlv2/essay_advice_from_a_stanford_2024_admit/\n\nCongrats on making it til the end. Do better. Everyone that has PM\u2019d me. Read this because I\u2019m not going to repeat myself. We need to have more meaningful conversations going forward if you want my help.\n\nTLDR: I'm disturbed that you guys are not receiving and internalizing the good advice here and you want the quick fix. In your minds the quick fix is an example essay from someone else. For the love of god people, you do not need examples. This is not a math problem. There is no right answer but there are good approaches and bad ones that don't help your case in admissions. Was a masterpiece painted in a day and a carbon copy of something else? No. No. No. Stop taking shortcuts. Stop looking for instant gratification. Essays matter a lot. As u/williamthereader said, \u201cAverage essays ruin top applications, strong essays boost average applications.\u201d\n\nEdit 1: wow! I\u2019m so glad this rant is getting read. Hopefully the angry approach gets the message out. You guys really don\u2019t need any editors unless you feel it\u2019s what you want. People keep asking about where to find the two adults to edit but that\u2019s if you really need one and most don\u2019t. People whose native language isn\u2019t English would probably be the case where I\u2019d have a native speaker review it for grammar but they probably don\u2019t need to be adults for that purpose. Hope that helps\n\nEdit 2: thoughtful DM questions are encouraged and all of those that did not get a favorable message last time, should say hello and share what you\u2019ve got more recently\n\nEdit 3: whenever a post gets traction, the haters come out. I definitely don\u2019t care but let\u2019s clarify some things. If you feel bad after reading real advice from parents and William referred to here, you need to reassess yourself and why a forum post can make you feel this way. None of this should demoralize you. It should inspire action. \u201cMy essays probably suck, however, this is 100% in my control. therefore, I can do something about it by starting with knowing my audience.\u201d\n\nEdit 4: although there is a small contingency of haters that have totally taken the conversation away from the point, I\u2019m encouraged by the response of the intended audience for this post... that is, the ones that can handle tough love. Don\u2019t get distracted by worthless discussions on whether I\u2019m qualified ... to copy and paste advice from pros already on here for your convenience ... and my ethnic background. None of that noise changes the fact that you all should keep working on your essays keeping the adult reader in mind. It never ceases to amaze me how productive conversations on here inevitably veer off topic with a small contingency. No win situation so it doesn\u2019t bother me but I\u2019d hate that someone unfamiliar with this sub gets caught up in the drama and misses the message. If you have a problem with me, PM me rather than clogging up the comments with garbage the keeps repeating itself. You\u2019d be better off making a meme for Wednesday honestly. You won\u2019t hurt my feelings but I will only respond if you make a truly intriguing point. Thank you.\n\nEdit 5: It might be helpful for some of you to know what the goal of this post is. This is not a standalone post. It is part 2 of this one with the two articles I liked the most copied and pasted into this on rather than accessing via link https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/i3z50e/guys_tbh_your_essays_suck_redeem_yourself_by/ These are also a collection of links from the wiki so if you didn't read that, then you don't have the context. I don't see the point in trying to come up with my own ideas because the ones I am showcasing are the best of the best out there and they're all underpinned by the fact that you need to consider your audience. Your perspective MAY NOT be interesting to an adult so make sure it actually is before you click submit.\n\nIt also references the brainstorming post, which encourages specific exercises and having you dig up others from the sub, Mattie's techniques and Scholargrade https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/hfzhy7/specific_fun_prelim_summertime_college_essay/\n\nMost ideas that I've seen don't warrant a thorough response. My time is limited and this is free. You get what you pay for. My assessment is whether I think you're on the right track, whether you need a coach, and whether you have something that will stand out to your intended audience IMO. I would never share an essay with anyone for free if they're not someone you know like a teacher.\n\nPlease stop sending me essays. I don't evaluated them. I'd charge for that but I have no interest in making money from A2C so I can remain independent. Some of you that don't need college counseling services can go with my \"poor sister\" however your draft needs to be far along by the time you work with an editor. I've been having her take on pro bono clients too so I can make sure she is good enough. I've chosen 2 students already but there are 3 more that I will choose too.\n\nDo not expect something super detailed for free. Be grateful that someone knowledgeable about the process is giving you a greed or red light on your idea in their opinion. I have hundreds of kids and I noticed a trend that most did not take their audience into account. I wrote a post that I hoped would address the issues I kept seeing because my time was wasted and all of you were making the same errors. That post didn't get enough traction so I had to step up the snarkiness to get the message out. I have no regrets and haters inevitably show up when something gets read.\n\nThere are also a lot of kids that are trying to monopolize my time. I can't give you much given the queue. Take the opinion or not. I'm not the be all and end all and I'm a good sounding board. It's on you and you really shouldn't care what anyone thinks besides you for your final draft. It's about finding the right idea that you guys need to work on now.\n\nIt is insane that people (aka special snowflakes armed with a closet full of participation trophies) are so sensitive. Toughen up. If that post makes you feel stressed, then there are bigger issues that you need to deal with. The intent is that it's free advice that was collated from our very own sub and a competitor forum that did indeed have a good thread for once because I am noticing that things get missed if you have links only. This is out of the goodness of my heart, I'm not making money from you like others on here so be grateful or downvote it, and move on with your life. It's your prerogative.\n\nEdit 6: Thanks for the massive bump in followers. All the controversy seems to help in that department oddly enough.\n\nEdit 7: All previous submitters of their ideas need to resubmit their newest to me OR talk about your understanding of audience and what you intend to do going forward. I said this before but the conversations I'm having are not very meaningful for me to participate in and I'm tired of repeating myself, so please make it worth my time or you will get a minimal response with a yawn emoji for instance. Respect my time please because you get what you pay for and no one here is paying. I'm saving you time and money should you choose to work with a coach or editor when you come to them with a good idea already in your pocket.",

      "text": "I remember sending out one of my Stanford essays a few years ago to some AOs/readers on this subreddit who read it and said it was, to put it simply, 'trash' and 'too childish' to qualify as a successful essay. For the record, it was about Legos and was a close-up of a single day of my life when I was \\~12 years old. It revealed nothing about me in an academic, work, or 'what can I bring to the school' sense, and was purely a glimpse into a seemingly mundane event that helped shape who I am today. You all shitted on my essay for the literal reasons that I wrote it the way I did.\n\nCome Late April/May and I got my Stanford acceptance packet which included a handwritten letter written by my regional AO who essentially said it was one of the most unique essays he's ever read and that it was a large reason that I got in. Pretty much everything you know-it-alls on this sub said was bad on my essay turned out to be a major positive in the eyes of my AO. To each their own I guess.\n\nThat being said, I don't think this anecdote serves to disprove anything you've said. The process is entirely subjective, random, and if I had gotten an older AO they might have dismissed my essay as a nostalgic clown fiesta. I don't think there is a distinct formula to a great essay, but your point: \"The admissions officer reading your essay did not write the prompts. Their goal really isn't to know the answer to the prompt. It is to know you\" serves the point well.",

I also hope Stanford is having other people review the applications you receive, because I have a feeling you\u2019re trashing perfectly fine applications over minute details.\n\nStudents - there\u2019s very little helpful advice in this and I desperately plead for you to ignore most of it.\n\nEDIT: It\u2019s important to remember no one is asking you to write a noble prize winning essay. Yes; there\u2019s general cliches that are bad and you\u2019d be good to avoid, but whoever wrote this post is clearly just frustrated at their job - more specifically that it\u2019s a tedious one - and unable to comprehend they\u2019re reading high school essays, and not on the Pulitzer Prize panel.",

Holy shit. We at T5s are not fucking geniuses beyond reproach, and somehow this thread is filled with people idolizing her. She\u2019s a T5 grad, not a damn published academic! I wouldn\u2019t take such strongly-worded advice from half the people I\u2019ve met at Yale, much less everyone there whose only qualification was getting in and becoming an interviewer, having had little to no actual training in this field. And you all shouldn\u2019t either! So many of you are qualified for these schools. There is little separating you. Do not idolize people who just happen to get in; you\u2019d be shocked how ordinary most the student body actually is. She is just a random Stanford grad who probably has actual issues that are causing her to react in such a toxic way. i hope she gets help or realizes what\u2019s wrong with this attitude and mindset towards stressed 17/18 year olds.

I don't know how many times I sat at my desk and marked \"consultant\" on an essay because it was that obvious someone had altered a students voice to fit an \"expected mold\" and to \"not be clich\u00e9.\"\n\nBE YOURSELF.

I started seriously thinking about my essay about a week ago, and even though I new it was important for me to have a good one, sub-consciously I felt dragged down and unenthusiastic about it, because my academics are not as good as I wish they were.\n\nHowever, this post not only serves as a wake up call, but also as a little bit of hope. I especially like the idea that \"average essays ruin top applications, strong essays boost average applications.\u201d Thank you so much for this, I hadn't seen any of your previous posts, but this one was super helpful!",

      "text": "In my own opinion, I\u2019ve never found the idea of writing an essay to express yourself to admissions to be an efficient or worthy way of judging someone\u2019s ability to attend or fit in at a college. Given the time and effort, anyone could make the crummiest of essays worth reading, worth giving however small of a damn about. I would go straight to interviews and yeah there\u2019s a 1000 reasons lots of schools can\u2019t do them but I wouldn\u2019t make a final decision of whether or not an applicant should be admitted based upon if they have a superb essay. Enthusiasm for an applicant, in my opinion, means that they wrote their essay well, but does not serve as a judge of potential for success at a school. I believe colleges could do away with essays but the entire system is still unfortunately, a business. You could take this all with a grain of sodium chloride, who cares anyway. Just don\u2019t over stress. An essay or essays sent to educational institutions, however meaningful or meaningless, means nothing in the span of life. And yet some colleges, definitely not all, but definitely some, expect the sheer awesomeness of your words on a paper to govern if they should let you spend the next few years on their campus in a certain city so that you can learn something completely or not at all, related. Oh well, who cares. I\u2019m going to make a sandwich.",
