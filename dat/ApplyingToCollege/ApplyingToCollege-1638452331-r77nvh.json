      "text": "Hi!  IB (Psychology, Biology, and English Literature HL) student here.    Honestly it would depend on what you\u2019re going in for.  If you have in your application a clear interest in business and apply for that major, they\u2019ll likely be able to tell you went with Psych for the look of a harder course load. \n\nIf you genuinely want to take either, just go with the one you prefer.  \n\nTo be honest, I don\u2019t think they pay attention to the difficulty between HL courses (with the exception of Math A&A H-hell, cuz those kids are freaks bro jk).",
