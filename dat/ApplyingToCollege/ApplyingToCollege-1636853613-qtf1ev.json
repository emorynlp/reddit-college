  "text": "re-recap: Online learning and switching from remote to in-person screwed me over. I was an almost straight-A student up till junior year when my grades dropped significantly. Few other students who started the year as straight-A students had as much difficulty maintaining their GPA. I ended junior year with an A, 2 B's, 3 C's, and a D. got fairly decent ap exam scores except in chem (got a 2).\n\nnow i am a senior. currently I've got straight-a's and it's looking to me like that's going to continue. my test scores were great, 1570 SAT and 35 ACT with 8 on writing. I'm getting two letters of rec that are going to be at the very least good. which schools do i actually have a shot of getting into now?\n\nedit: considering bio, psych, and linguistics as majors. looking for schools with individualized track/concentration options. preferably new england. cities are nice but medium towns work too. good professors pls. currently I'm in love with UConn, Rutgers and Northeastern if that helps at all",

I didn\u2019t even submit my SAT score as an out of state student and was admitted to Storrs with a scholarship. Just keep the grades up for now and submit your SAT and you\u2019ll be good!",
