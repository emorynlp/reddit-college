  "title:": "Tea Advent Calendar Cornell ED Superstition (Totally Full Proof)",
  "text": "Alright, I think I am losing it but ya you read the title right. Just hear me out man\n\nSo for Christmas, I bought an advent calendar that gives me a little tin of loose leaf tea every morning. Honestly super cool and I love it so much. I got it so that I had something to look forward to every morning as Jan 1 approaches + I have a visual calendar of how much time I have left. I can drop a link if yall want\n\nAnyways, since the tea every day is completely random and I had no choice in choosing the types of teas, there uh have been some less than preferable tea.... Can't say I am a fan of tumeric tea to be fair.\n\nMy monkey brain, therefore, did some mental gymnastics and made the decision last night at 4 am that my result for Cornell ED tomorrow will be evident from the tea. Pretty much the thought is if I get a tea I actually like, I will get in. If I get one that I hate, I get rejected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy current breakdown (black tea the best):\n\nBlack Tea - Accept\n\nGreen Tea/Chai - Defer\n\nHerbal Tea (Tumeric or something bruh) - Reject\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I am definitely losing it waiting for tomorrow at 7pm but ya we thriving I guess. I'll update yall on what tea it is when I open tomorrow morning and what my ED result is.\n\nLove y'all and gl with ur apps :)",
