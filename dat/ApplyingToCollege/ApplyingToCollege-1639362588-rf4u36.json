  "text": "With college decisions coming up I've gone to the gym for 1.5hrs every day and I've gotten 7 hours of sleep each night. The one thing I haven't been able to keep up with is my work for school because I am so incredibly distracted. My decision comes out Wednesday and I've been painfully anxious for the past week in particular and I haven't been able to complete any big assignments at all, despite anti-anxiety medication and ample support systems (therapist, reassurance from parents). I don't quite know what to do. I've also been listening to anti-anxiety frequencies so if anyone is in my position I recommend that you take a listen as well. I'm aware of how lucky I am to have access to support systems during this stressful process and it makes me feel even more pathetic for truly being unable to deal with my anxiety.",
