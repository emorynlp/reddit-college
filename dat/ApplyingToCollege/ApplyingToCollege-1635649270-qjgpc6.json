  "text": "Sorry if I sound really stupid right now, but I am just generally stressed \n\nI just submitted my Common App and Supplements onto the Common App for UChicago, but my pea-sized brain keeps thinking that my application isnt submitted. Is there anyway to confirm that I am now done with everything for the ED and it's actually fully submitted, or is the answer right in front of me and im just not thinking at all.\n\nThanks for the help y'all, sorry again",
