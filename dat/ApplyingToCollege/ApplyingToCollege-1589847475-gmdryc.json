  "title:": "TRULY UNPOPULAR OPINION : Online APs are a Necessary Evil",
  "text": "On this sub, it appears the general sentiment is that College Board is some giant scam that purposely created an unfair online test-taking experience. While some of this is true (I certainly disagree with College Board's status as a monopoly and supposed \"non-profit\"), there are certain parts that I think are just completely false. Here are some of my points...\n\n**1. THERE IS NO EASY ANSWER TO THE CURRENT TESTING SITUATION**\n\nWhile I understand it is frustrating, I believe it is important to think about the predicament that College Board is in. They must create a standardized test that all universities can trust as a method to gauge course understanding, as well as assuring that this test is accessible and achievable for the average student. As well as this, they must try to maintain the authenticity and security of these results when they are being taken AT HOME. Given all of this information, what all could they really do? If they had decided to import the ENTIRE test online (multiples essays, short answers, multiple choice), students would complain about the difficulty and there would likely be even more technical difficulties due to people's internet cutting out across such a long time span. If they had made a longer test and more relaxed time requirements, it would give students even more ability to cheat and share answers, further compromising the security of the test. While imperfect, I think the current format for test-taking is about as good as they could have gotten it. My only real gripe is that I wish the personalized email option had been open to the first week test takers, but I suppose hind-sight is 20/20. Regardless, I would like to hear if anyone on this sub has a better alternative to the current testing format, genuinely.\n\n**2. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNFAIR TO CANCEL ALL THE TESTS**\n\nAnother common sentiment I see on this sub is that tests should have been cancelled right out of the gate. This is simply an immature thought in my opinion. If they had done this, I have no doubt that people on this subreddit would have been livid given the fact that they had just been robbed of the opportunity to gain college credit. I know personally, a large number of my friends are counting on their current APs to exempt them from a number of their college classes. While the current testing format is imperfect, I appreciate that given all of this craziness, we are still given the ability to further our education. Additionally, If you truly believe this testing situation is too unfair, College Board is accepting all refunds so you don't have to take them if you don't want to (I understand some schools require you to take the test as a final/mandatory curriculum. I do think this is unfair)\n\n**3. THE REPORTS WE HEAR ARE LARGELY EFFECTED BY BIAS**\n\nI am extremely empathetic of those who experienced technical difficulties when submitting their APs, but it is important to realize that the reports we hear are largely inflated by selection bias. Those who have technical difficulties are more likely to voice their concerns than those who did not. This effect is often called the \"vocal minority.\" Again, while unfortunate, it appears that no test in week one had a failure-to-submit rate of more than 8%. That is still a sizable number and should be considered, but is definitely not the amount that is being portrayed by this sub. It should also be said that those who experienced errors (at least in my class) commonly did not take the required submit time (5 minutes) and instead gambled by attempting to submit with 2 or less minutes left. While this is obviously unfortunate as well, it should be understood that at least some of the submits errors were user-based issues\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nIt needs to be said that the current situation we are in is difficult. We are taking a test that is different from what we have prepared the entire year for and it is completely fair to be upset. However, painting College Board as this purposely malicious entity is simply not true. I believe there are improvements that could be made on the current system (The retest window should happen RIGHT after week 2, there should have been more stress-testing done on the current website, email option should have been standard, greater accessibility to test taking options), but I also think that the current iteration we have is pretty okay and not as bad as everyone is displaying it as. Regardless, I would love to hear your opinions on the situation.",

And yeah, probably most people really didn't want to cancel the exams for all kinds of reasons, but one is so that they wouldn't get laid off in the middle of an economic catastrophe.  CB isn't Trevor Packer in an ivory tower, it's lots of normal people working normal jobs. They aren't greedy fucks because they didn't want their company to have to declare bankruptcy.\n\nAnd so they found an imperfect compromise solution. It won't hurt anyone. No college will think less of you if you don't take the test or don't do well, but you still have the opportunity to try. That's as close to fair as we are going to get. \n\nThis was a hard problem. It wasn't  a perfect solution. But the bad guy is Rona, not College Board.",

Regardless, this isn't a great situation for anyone and I'm sorry to everyone who's had issues and/or a tough exam form. Yet, the fact that they came up and implemented this in only a few months is impressive.",

Also, every teacher is required to submit a predicted grade to the IB organization. What the IB organization is going to do is analyze how good of an indicator the predicted grades coupled with the IAs are in determining a Students final grade, and thats how they are going to get our final grades.",

If the number of students for this date was low they could only test in a few schools per district (like the ACT). This would date likely be mostly taken up by underclassmen, but seniors attending college who don\u2019t need the credit first semester could still use the opportunity.\n\nStill an imperfect compromise, but IMO makes the tests more accessible. Gives students a lot of freedom in choosing, as some AP tests are arguably easier in-person (just by having MC) than online. While I think the current testing situation is OK, especially given the circumstances, as someone who\u2019s taken 4 already this year I know that for some of them I certainly don\u2019t feel like it was the fairest assessment. With only two questions, for some classes you were only tested on a few of many concepts. For history classes especially, I don\u2019t think a DBQ is anywhere near representative of what you\u2019re supposed to have learned (for the regular test). Additionally, one of the prompts for one of my exams seemed kind of hastily written and had some hiccups.",

It would have sucked for people taking them this year, but placing the test online has compromised the legitimacy of the AP score entirely. The whole point of an AP test is that it is standardized. A 5 one year is the same as a 5 the next, same with each other score, because CB goes to great lengths to ensure that the tests are as similarly weighted and balanced as possible.\n\nIt's impossible to balance a test with two questions and unfettered access to the internet. My AP Comp Sci A test was an absolute joke. I know with certainty that I got a 5 because I literally was typing my code into a Java compiler which identified my errors and often fixed them for me. That's a whole different ball game from writing code on paper with a pencil.\n\nWhat reason do schools have to value a 5 this year as much as they would a 5 last year? I'm expecting to see higher average scores all across the board from this testing period.",

We had multiple people email the college board from our school to ask for even just two different testing times as opposed to one, and they completely evaded that question multiple times. The fact that they created so many different versions of the test is a testament to how they easily could have offered the exam at 2 seperate times for people to take them without becoming nocturnal. \n\nNot to mention, they sent out a pretty manipulative survey to everyone in the affected time zones which three options: A. cancel all AP exams for these time zones, B. Have them in the middle of the night, or 3. No preferance. \n\nI still think the test itself is decent and I actually much prefer the option to type + the open book format. I just really wish they had given some consideration to the fact that not everyone is in the same timezone as North America.",

IMO, IB had more of a reason to cancel bc we're more equally spaced internationally and everyone has completed Internal Assessments, which are papers/reports/exams that are done at our school that are then graded by IBO, so they have something substantial that they can at least use to calculate our grade. AP doesn't do internal exams so the only way to measure a student's knowledge is the AP exam at the end of the year.\n\nLook, I don't think that this situation with AP is pretty. But honestly, it's not bad. College Board has been quite open about communicating the necessaries while I can't say the same about IBO.  Yes, it's not fair to spend a whole year to just take a 45 minute test. Yes, I agree that Collegeboard should've had a better way to help students with errors. But tbh, given the situation with the economy and hundreds of thousands of people losing their lives, CB's solution to AP exams is a commendable attempt.",

      "text": "While I agree with most of your points I feel that a huge company like college board could have prepared more for technical issues wheee they have a system (which currently they have added) where they have an option to email if all else fails. Obviously their servers couldn't handle the mass amount being sent or some other technical issue and at the very least this back up system should have been implemented right after the first reports of tests being dropped came out.\n\nThey also (from my understanding) attempt to convert your answers when you upload an image into text before sending off your answers which would help graders a great deal, the problem is that (again if I understand properly as I did not use an image) if the text recognition program failed it just cancelled your test. As annoying as it would be for graders they should have just left it as an image file as they would've had to be grading off people's handwriting if covid wasn't a thing anyway.\n\nMy final grievance is a lot smaller but they should have had some sort of audio cue for when the timer hit 5 minutes. If they weren't going to give you a period after the test to turn it in they should at least have a little bell noise or something as its very easy to loose track of time. You have to be writing your answers elsewhere so its not like you can constantly look at the timer. Honestly this would most likely be <10 lines of code to implement anyways and the lack of it is just kind of disappointing.\n\nIf I got anything factually wrong please let me know, I'd rather not spread misinformation if I can help it. \nAlso just a note I only took ap cs: a so if there is anything different from other exams then I probably don't know about it. Also I generally hate cb so I am definitely biased against them.",

      "text": "Thank you for this opinion, you absolutely nailed the delivery! I actually enjoyed my AP Language test (taking a make-up in June for bio) because it was online and allowed me to type my answers. College Board did their best, but there are still a few problems I have with it.\n\n1. The pricing. \n\nPerhaps I don't understand product guarantee and how it would apply in a situation like this, but students paid for a certain version of the test and prepared for this product for months. Regardless of the potential bad decisions by cheating students, it is absolutely unfair to charge the same for an exam significantly less thorough than what they were expecting.\n\nI think about the test as a product but primarily as an experience \u2013 an experience that we indulge in for the chance to succeed and earn college credit. We aren't paying for the college credit itself, as there is no set amount of credit one might receive. The only thing we pay for the opportunity. If that opportunity/experience is fundamentally different, and in a simplistic form, the best action is to give some financial return to the students for their loss. \n\n2. the \"is College Board really a non-profit\" issue.\n\nI honestly don't know that much about this, but based off of the reported figures of the organization, they are undeniably profiting and full of shit if they rejected the idea of financial return based off of unavailable funds.\n\n3. Test-specific constraints\n\nMaybe we're all just bitching, or maybe it's Maybelline.\n\n Either way, the formatting and time constraints of tests have been reported as less than ideal. The least college board could do is loosen up on the time constraints in consideration of home environment, technological difficulties, etc. \n\nMy personal example is for the AP Language exam that I took: 45 minutes to read a passage, annotate, and write a five paragraph essay, and 5 minutes to submit. They got this figure from the recommended time from the original exam where 40 minutes were spent writing and 10 analyzing the passage and setting up a plan. Understandable, right? However, it fails to take into account how individuals divide up their time and the aforementioned home environment and technological failures (I do acknowledge the presence of a make-up form). From full practice tests I've taken before, the rhetorical analysis is undeniably my weakest essay, and the one I spend the most time on. I can whip out a synthesis or argumentative essay in significantly less time. One would imagine that they would've tacked on a little more wiggle room with time and push exams up to an hour. \n\nAdmittedly, that's more of a personal qualm. Nevertheless, I appreciate your response and I agree with the majority of it, thank you for bringing diversity to the opinions within the AP community.                     \n\n (\u3065\uff61\u25d5\u203f\u203f\u25d5\uff61)\u3065\n\nedit: the numbers appear as all 1's? idk what the fuck is up with that \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f",

It also does not have such a strong connection with college credit as AP does. Plus, I know plenty of people who are upset with how IB handled this as well.",

I just feel that online testing introduces too many inequalities and I know plenty of people who are extremely happy with how IB has handled it. They discovered a solution that fixes the problems you brought up. It\u2019s most definitely not perfect, but IMO it\u2019s a much better solution.",
