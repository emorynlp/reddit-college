  "text": "I'm curious about the a-g requirement UC schools use. I took Algebra I and Geometry (my school's 9th and 10th grade classes) in 5th and 6th grade. Because I cannot report courses before 7th and 8th grade, and because courses like geometry are required for UC admissions, I am wondering what I should do. Please help.",
