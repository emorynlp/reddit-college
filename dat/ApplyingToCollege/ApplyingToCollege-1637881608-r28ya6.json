  "text": "Hello y'all so I had a question about UC and its dual credit inputting. I got a few classes to put in, and just a couple questions. First, do I put them in the regular year section  as well like with the highschool courses. Second, how do I find college transcripts or just see them, for example some of the classes wouldn't be on my transcript yet as they are next semester, and how do I input the info as its different than in the Commonapp. Thank you!",
