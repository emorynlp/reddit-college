  "text": "Hi so I think there\u2019s an issue with my Naviance. It says on Naviance that it\u2019s linked to my Common App account and my FERPA rights are waived. But on the \u201cColleges I\u2019m Applying To\u201d list, nothing is showing up, and thus my teachers can\u2019t submit their recommendations and I can\u2019t get my transcript. I\u2019m literally losing my shit right now because REA is in 2 weeks. I\u2019m meeting with my guidance counselor and college counselor at school but still I\u2019m losing my shit. Anyone have this issue with Naviance?",
