  "text": "Hi A2C,\n\nI\u2019m a junior and I recently got accepted into my school\u2019s National Honor Society chapter. However, their meetings are the same day that I volunteer somewhere in my community. I can\u2019t change my volunteering hours or it would conflict with my schedule, and it is a **volunteering position that requires consistency because of the age group that I am working with.** I volunteer 4 hours a week (2 days a week) every week. \n\nI have other clubs and activities on my resume that demonstrate my leadership and commitment to my community. **Would colleges care if I am not in NHS?**",
