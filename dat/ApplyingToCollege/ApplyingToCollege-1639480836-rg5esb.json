  "text": "i cannot begin to explain how stressed out i am. i\u2019m currently a second year film production major. it\u2019s a little bit of a different program so i declared it in the first year, that was the wrong decision :) i don\u2019t know why at the time i thought it would be a good idea. i heard it\u2019s hard to get in since it\u2019s such a small program and i thought it\u2019d be fun? but it\u2019s severely underfunded and i genuinely just hate it. i don\u2019t even like film i like editing. i\u2019m a 19y/o social media marketer, i work for a skincare company and as a waitress too lol. but basically all i do is freelance, graphic design, photograph, etc. i don\u2019t need this program. many people in film don\u2019t need a film major. anyways i slyly let myself into a cpsc class with gregor earlier in september and i fell in love with the material immediately. i don\u2019t even know how i hadn\u2019t thought of it? i work as a social media marketer, i do the front end of design and social media work it only makes sense to add on to my assets of skills and get a degree in cpsc. so now. i wanna change my major. but there are like 27191 problems i have. i took 4 electives this semester bc i didn\u2019t know what to do (ended up failing one of them because i just didn\u2019t care about it and never showed up) my average is a 79 but probably gonna go down after this semester. but next semester im taking 110 and 121, + two electives. i wanted to apply in april for a computer science major but unfortunately i won\u2019t be able to take a 200 level course you need to apply to major in cpsc. so what are my options? i don\u2019t know what to do. i emailed them and they said i\u2019ll just have to wait until april 2023. i\u2019ll be in third year: what if i don\u2019t get into the major? and do i just wait around the entire year and waste my tuition? what am i supposed to do. because i could just get ahead and do all the cpsc classes through the semesters and summers in order to try and get fourth year standing once i\u2019m finally in it officially as a major but it\u2019s impossible to get into ALL of them they fill up so quickly, or what if I DO that and then end up not being able to have it as my major?\n\ndo i transfer to a new school? do i wait it out, what do i do? i\u2019m so confused and lost my head hurts this is killing me.\n\n**PS. pls do not tell me oh see how you like the classes first you never know!! i know i\u2019ve never taken cpsc classes before. but this is all theoretical i am assuming im going to like it this is not helpful**",
