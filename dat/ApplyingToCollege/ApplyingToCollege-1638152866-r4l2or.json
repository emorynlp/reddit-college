      "text": "Be sure to distinguish between merit scholarships and need-based financial aid. Top private universities tend to give generous need-based financial aid, but tend not to offer much, if any, merit scholarships. (You can find merit scholarship info on the college's website. There is some merit at schools like Vandy, WashU, etc, though the merit tends to be very competitive, as these schools are reaches for admission alone.)\n\nFirst see whether you are eligible for any need-based financial aid. Run the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a *need-based* estimate before you apply.\n\nFor substantial *merit scholarships*, you would look for less competitive colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college. Also look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: [https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/](https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/); see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family.",
