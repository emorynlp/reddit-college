  "text": "I\u2019m taking the ACT October 23 and I feel I have a good shot at getting a pretty good score but I could also not (the math section will be my downfall) \n\nI want to apply EA to a few of my more competitive schools because the program I am applying for is competitive and has limited spots and I\u2019m hoping to get a good financial aid offer. \n\nThe issue is October scores will not come out until November 2nd. A day after the EA deadline. \n\nI know some schools give you extra time to report after the deadline and I do have the option to do that\n\nDo I have to say I am going to submit an ACT score on my application or can I put I am going test optional and still submit later on? \n\nIf I put yes I will submit and I end up getting much less than my desired score I\u2019ve been told I still have to submit or else the application will be marked incomplete \n\nIf I put no and end up getting a good score then my chances of giving my average-ish application a boost for these competitive schools is gone.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!",

My English and reading scores are very good and I could possibly get a near perfect on both. Science has been in the 28-31 range. So really I guess it all depends on what I encounter.
