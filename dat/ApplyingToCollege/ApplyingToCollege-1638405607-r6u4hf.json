      "text": "BS is a bachelors of science and a BA is a bachelors of art. so it kinda depends on what you wanna do with the degree and what you enjoy doing to learn. if you\u2019re looking to do research and labs and then have a career in something stem-related, a BS would probably be better for you. that being said, most colleges would be more likely to offer just a BA in communications specifically. it\u2019s much more on the english and liberal arts side of the learning sphere. it depends on what college you\u2019re looking at though, I would look it up and make sure they offer whichever degree you\u2019re more interested in.",
