So I saw there are some posts about Minerva University (formerly Minerva Schools at KGI) on this sub and I was just hoping to answer any doubts or questions anyone has :)\n\nEdit: From the posts I saw Minerva doesn't have the best reputation on this subreddit, so I'm hoping we can clear any misconceptions about it, or just answer any Minerva related questions\n\nEdit 2: Welp now people are saying this AMA is \"sus\" and comparing it to a previous Minerva AMA that was actually sus... anything I can do to make this less sus?",

As I said in some other post I agree that the admission rates are biased\n\nI payed less than what you mentioned since I had a good financial aid package. Most students at Minerva are international,  and as you can imagine a lot of people from abroad can't pay the crazy college fees that US universities have, so Minerva is a solid choice for international students. I can't speak for Americans since I'm not from the US and don't know as much about what it's like for them \n\nWhat I can tell you is that if you're an international student looking to live/work in the US, Minerva is a great option since it will likely give you good financial aid and you'll get OPT (you can work in the US for a couple of years after graduation)",

I think you're more interested in me discussing the TM Landry scandals about the fake transcripts? I don't know of any fake transcripts at Minerva or cheating or anything similar to that - so no\n\nNot sure if that answers your question, but is there a specific reason you bring TM Landry up?",

Minerva recently became fully accredited (hence the change in its name) - so hopefully that in itself gives you some confidence. I attended Minerva while it was still Minerva Schools at KGI - from my understanding it had its accreditation through Claremont KGI and was technically/legally part of KGI and not independent\n2. If I were in your shoes something that would give me a lot of confidence in the university would be to reach out to either current students or other alumnus. Regarding alumnus I have former classmates who have gone on to get jobs in all sorts of industries and around the world (corporate such as BCG, Wish, Bain, GoldmanSachs, Uber, etc.), startups, and academia (pursuing master's or PHDs at Oxford, Harvard, etc.). Maybe you could look for alumnus on LinkedIn and contact them?",

Some other careers like medicine or law might not be as good at Minerva (e.g. for medicine or natural sciences you'll need a lab, which Minerva doesn't have given the entire international rotation).
