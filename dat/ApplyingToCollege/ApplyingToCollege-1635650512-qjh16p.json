  "title:": "Should I send my SAT score to UMD College Park?",
  "text": "The 50th percentile SAT score at University of Maryland at College Park is a 1375. I currently have a 1350 super score with the two tests I\u2019ve taken (670 in reading/writing and 680 in Math). I am applying Early Action (Nov 1st), and an out-of-state NYC applicant. Any second opinions on submitting them or not? I was told my a college counselor that I should, and only should, submit mine if they are at the 50th percentile or slightly higher/lower than it. I know this question may be silly but I can\u2019t make my mind up if I should.",
