  "text": "So I got an email from one of my schools this morning, saying that they have completed reviewing my application, and wrote these following things:\n\n\u201c1. Make sure you have completed your FAFSA application to be considered for any financial aid and merit based scholarships. \n\n2. Sit tight and look out for a decision by email and letter in the coming weeks.\nWe know you\u2019re excited so we won\u2019t say anything else about how excited you must be.\u201d\n\nwhich I found odd since I applied Regular Decision for that school. Does this mean anything?",
