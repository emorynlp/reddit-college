  "text": "hey everyone! \n\ni have been wondering if its better to fill out all 10 slots on common apps activities section or to leave a couple \"minor\" ECs out of it? i have a few very short experiences (e.g. 1 week at a learner camp but around 30h total) - should these be on there (if so prob at the bottom of the list). they do correspond to my major of choice but idk. the thing is, i wouldnt say that i have super strong/impressive ECs to the point where i can only list 3-4 of them and be competitive. please help & share tips if you have them! TIA <3",
