  "text": "I was getting ready for my Princeton interview today and got into the zoom waiting room. I\u2019m waiting patiently but I think that there\u2019s enough time to whack one off but the Princeton interview just came on and saw me orgasm to Dartmouth alumni. I am so nervous that this will negatively impact my chances of getting in. Please send reassuring messages and make me feel better about myself.",
