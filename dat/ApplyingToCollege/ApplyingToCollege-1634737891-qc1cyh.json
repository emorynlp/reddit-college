But my counselor said that I must attach one anyways. \n\np/s: The resume expands my contributions beyond the 150 characters given by CA and includes some of the online project links I have.\n\nIf I could do this by myself, I would have left my resume for schools that requires it, or maybe in interviews\n\nWhat your take on this?",

              "text": "Your counselor is definitely wrong in the case... AO's have to go through hundreds of applications and if they come across something unnecessary, it won't really help your case... And if they wanted more than 150 characters per activity, they would've asked for it... And they never have time to visit any links... So skip the resume and work on improving the other parts of the application.",
