  "title:": "UC App Out-of-State Honors Courses",
  "text": "So with the UC app, school-designated honors courses do not count towards your weighted \u201cUC GPA\u201d for out of state students, just AP and IB courses. \n\nIn the section that asks for the classes you took throughout high school, can I still mark the honors classes I took as honors? Even if they don\u2019t count towards the weighted GPA, I\u2019d still like them to see that I did in fact take honors courses and be able to distinguish them from regular courses.",

      "text": "I believe you are not supposed to mark them as honors. But, it is confusing. I would at least write the title of the course to include the word Honors, assuming that is how your transcript reads.\n\nPSA, in case it's relevant: public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.",
