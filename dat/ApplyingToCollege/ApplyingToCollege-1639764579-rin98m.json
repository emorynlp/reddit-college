  "title:": "I feel like I made a mistake when choosing my ED school.",
  "text": "Hello girlypops.\n\nI applied to Cornell ED and was admitted on Monday. I should be happy, but instead I feel a foreboding sense of discontent. About two weeks before November 1st, I started researching into University of Chicago. Even then, I knew that U Chicago was a better fit for my aspirations and personality. However, I already wrote my Cornell essay and was too afraid to back out of the plans I set months prior. Now that decisions released, the error of my decision is very clear to me. Of course, I could also be feeling some jealousy and inferiority. Many of my peers with similar stats/EC's were admitted to schools like Yale and Stanford. Am I crazy for feeling this way? My parents and friends think I am crazy for wanting to transfer out of a school that I haven't attended yet. \n\nDoes anyone have advice for someone who feels like they made a mistake or for someone troubled by  jealousy?",

If you truly don't like it, you can always try to transfer, although transferring to UChicago would be difficult. \n\nimo the fact that you were accepted by Cornell means that they think you'd fit in at their campus, too.",

You seems to have paid too much attention to the overall prestige rather than the fit factor to be jealous about your friends getting into HYPSM but you are oNLy getting into Cornell, which is same level in the stem field. Maybe watch some Cornell student vlogs to see if you will like that school, or transfer if you find necessary.",

Take a little time and try to let go of the this idea that one school is a better \u201cfit.\u201d That is admissions officer language, and it has little place in the real world.
