  "title:": "how i am predicting (coping with) Cornell\u2019s ED results",
  "text": "I applied ED to Cornell with very little preparation. Instead of accepting that I won\u2019t get in, I\u2019ve been playing a \u201cfun\u201d little game with my magic 8 ball!\n\nI\u2019ll ask it first if I\u2019m getting into my safety school to calibrate it, then I ask it if I\u2019m getting into Cornell in as specific terms as possible.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten a positive response 9/10 times.\n\nNot to get my hopes up or anything this is just my way of coping. GL to all of you!",
