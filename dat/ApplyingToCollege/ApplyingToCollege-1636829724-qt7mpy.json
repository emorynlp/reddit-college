  "text": "Hey all,\n\nSo I\u2019m in my last year of community college here in Cali with full intent to transfer to a UC in Fall \u201822 and am on track to complete all of my major\u2019s coursework by next spring. However, I was wondering what the difference is between getting a regular associates degree and associates degree for transfer? If I\u2019m fully committed to transferring to a UC, do I have to worry about doing an AA-T degree? They require around 3 more classes for completion and I simply won\u2019t have the time to do them. Currently, I am on track to receive a regular associates for my major with the classes I have planned for next spring. \n\nThis may be a bit of a dumb question but I\u2019m a bit confused and would appreciate someone\u2019s input. Thanks!",

      "text": "This is a really good question for /r/TransferStudents, but based on what I found on Google it sounds like the AA-T is designed with classes expected to transfer to a four-year and/or are a closer match to a four-year program. Not sure if it suggests AA degrees are more intended for folks entering the work force immediately after. https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/t/what-is-the-difference-between-aa-as-aa-t-and-as-t-community-college/1917404",
