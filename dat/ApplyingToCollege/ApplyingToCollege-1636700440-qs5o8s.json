  "text": "Ok so now that I'm a senior, I've noticed that this happens a lot and it peeves me. Like literally I could introduce myself and my age and someone will ask me \"oh you're a senior, did you ED somewhere?\" \n\nA range of people have asked this question: from acquaintances I barely speak to, to my pediatrician who I see once a year, to neighbors, to school teachers, to literal random teens and adults I don't even know the names of. It happens every week. \n\nI can't stand it. I always reply the same each time. \"I didn't ED anywhere.\" But that's a lie, the truth is that I don't know you well enough to feel comfortable telling you where I actually EDed. I mean, why is it any of your business? Colleges applications are something personal to me and my family, and I'm not just going to reveal my dream school to some inquisitive stranger just because they asked.\n\nI don't like lying though, and I wish there was a way to retort back in a way that isn't overly rude, as I can't just be like \"none of your fucking business\" to a teacher. The best I've been able to do is ask \"I'm not ED'ing anywhere. What about you, where are you ED'ing?\" (if you're gonna be nosy so am I) but it only works on other seniors. \n\nSo yeah. Since so many people ask me this question I've started to wonder that maybe I'm just the one going crazy with stress, and that asking someone's ED is perfectly normal. Can y'all enlighten me please if you feel the same about this issue? Idk if everyone is being too nosy or if I'm being too uptight.",

No need to get annoyed by it! It only stresses yourself out.  \nIf you tell them your ED and you get it to your ED, great. If you don't, well, they passed on a future Nobel prize laureate or something. If people make fun of you for not getting in, now you know who's on your side and who's not.

Then ask them something about their college choices so you don't have to say anything else.\n\nIf they keep asking about it you can be like, \"I don't really know how things will turn out yet so I try not to think about it too much.\"\n\nEveryone has their hangups.
