  "text": "Hey guys, Im super confused on whether or not to apply to some top schools in my preferred field, finance. I have a 3.4 UW gpa (I know it\u2019s not competitive at all but online school screwed me over. I got mostly A\u2019s up until online school where I got straight Cs. Although I have an auditory processing disorder so I mentioned that and hopefully it gets taken into consideration) a 32 on ACT and strong extracurriculars. I live in FL. \nDream OOS school: UVA\nDream IS school: UFL\n\n- two profitable businesses (one being a software company)\n- Treasurer of Debate team\n- member of international thespian society \n- president of BBYO (Jew thing) chapter \n- member of American economic association \n- member of American finance association\n- did some volunteering at a local camp \n- volunteering for dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s fundraiser. \n- Proficient in 4 different coding languages \n\nThere is some other minor ones. My essay is about this tribulation I encountered during my business and how I overcame it. Hard to explain in one sentence but I think it shows my character pretty well. Any advice or other schools I should apply to? Thank you!",
