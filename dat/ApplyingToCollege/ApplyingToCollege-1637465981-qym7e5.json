  "text": "There\u2019s been a lot of posts on here about interviews, and in almost every one of them there\u2019s at least one but usually multiple comments that say \u201cinterviews don\u2019t really impact the decision anyway\u201d or something along those lines. It seems like it\u2019s become an almost obsolete aspect of the admissions process, especially considering that not everyone who applies gets one, so it would seem pointless to continue doing them. Seems like a waste of time for both interviewer and interviewee.",

Most interviews don\u2019t really matter, but a truly fantastic interview could give an application the push it needs into the admit pile. Alternatively, interviews can also be used to weed out the small number of applicants that seem fine on paper, but turn out to be very rude/uninterested/bigoted/etc in real life during the interview. It mostly serves the two extremes.",

However he also says that his feedback, no matter how glowing, does not affect admissions decisions. \n\nHis alum is a highly rejective Ivy. If he interviews 10 students a year, he\u2019s found that one of them gets in every other year. This is despite him writing amazing things in the feedback about 9 out of 10 of the kids he interviews. \n\nOf course there is still a college or two out there that gives evaluative interviews, but it\u2019s a very small handful. Make sure you know how much the interview is actually considered. At a lot of schools it\u2019s simply to check the demonstrated interest box. \n\nAnd of course a very bad interview can negatively affect your chances of getting in. So always be professional!",
