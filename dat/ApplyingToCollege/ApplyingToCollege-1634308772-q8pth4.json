  "text": "I submitted my application already to UCF through Common App, but I decided not to put my SAT score since I thought I\u2019d wait until I get a better score. I was wondering how would one submit their scores after they\u2019ve already submitted their college application? Would I have to call admissions or is there somewhere else I can submit them like College Board? Thank you.",

[https://www.ucf.edu/admissions/undergraduate/freshman/](https://www.ucf.edu/admissions/undergraduate/freshman/)\n\nIt appears the deadline is May 1. I do not see EA there. Common App says admission is rolling. Since scores are an application requirement, your app will not be complete until an official score report is received. So, this is not a problem - you will be able to see this once you receive your admission portal login.\n\n(While many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app, some do not. Check each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept.)",
