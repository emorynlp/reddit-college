I'm hearing about people with these brilliant ECs and research work getting rejected and I'm actually losing hope for myself. Does anyone else feel like this?",

I don\u2019t have perfect grades either and depending on the SAT score I\u2019m getting back tomorrow I\u2019ll either go test opt or submit what I have. I certainly don\u2019t have the most outstanding ECs either.I\u2019ve been looking at everyone talking about their applications and what schools they\u2019ve been getting into and it\u2019s making me nervous. As for me I\u2019m applying ED2 to Boston University and rest of my schools are RD. Its okay though wherever we end up at we\u2019re going to be fine, you still have your whole life ahead of you and college is only a small fraction of it. Don\u2019t worry and take care of your mental health I\u2019m cheering for you.",

And my dream school is cornell. I should've done ed but I started college apps too late. I have a feeling I'm not gonna make it into cornell rd and it's killing me. Especially since one of my best friends made it in for ed :(",
