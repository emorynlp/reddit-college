Like legally-have-to-return-your-balcony-key-during-finals insane.\nThe quarter system is not the move either. Also it rains a LOT in seattle. I used to hate it but now am ambivalent, but there are a lot of people who never really get used to the rain.\n\nIt's not a bad school or anything though. The campus is beautiful and the quality of education/research opportunities are amazing. The location is amazing as well, and the community is wonderful for at least muslims. I'm certain it is great for others as well, but that is the only community I can really attest to.\n\nOverall I'd say most students have a strong love/hate relationship with the school because it is wonderful, but so easy to get fucked.\n\nI probably shouldn't have said anything about it not being the move, because it is a genuinely great school, I just felt like complaining a bit about my school because it is finals week.",

I love the campus, it's a bit hilly but I got it, the school spirit is incredible, and for me it's a jew school but that's probably not the case for you. \n\nOther smaller ones: all freshman housing has private bathrooms, there's \"split doubles\" (roommate with a wall dividing your bed) which imo is perfect, and Syracuse as a city may be small but it's perfect. \n\nThe only real reason which is somewhat pulling me away (and decided not to ED) is that it's really isolated. There's a small airport and a twice daily train, one towards Buffalo and one towards Springfield/Boston, but besides that it's only highways. It's a great school in the middle of nowhere.",
