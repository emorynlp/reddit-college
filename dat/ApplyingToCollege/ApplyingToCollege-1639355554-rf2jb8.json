  "text": "I just saw a post that advised students not to write about death for their college essay because it doesn\u2019t lead to very good results. I\u2019ve already submitted it for nearly all of my schools and I\u2019m wondering how screwed I am. I have 4/4 acceptances so far but should I expect a lot more rejections because of the topic of my essay?",

      "text": "The danger of writing about death in an essay isn't the topic as such, but rather that the tone of the overall deal will come off as overly negative. That's why a lot of people say not to write about it, but I would much rather use the term \"dangerous.\"\n\nTo avoid that danger, make sure that the focus of your essay is more about what the experience taught you, or how it informed future decisions you made in a positive way. If you've done that, there's very little to no worry at all! If not, though, you may want to rework your personal statement for RD apps in the next few weeks.\n\nHope that helps, and best of luck!",
