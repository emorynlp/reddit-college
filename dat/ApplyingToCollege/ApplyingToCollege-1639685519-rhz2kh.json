  "text": "I got a 34 act no superscore in December and have like a 4.7/5.33 gpa, everyone told me santa clara was an instant admission. Why was I deferred?  I dont play sports but im not sure why this would happen\n\nCould it maybe be because i did very well last year in covid on online school and they are worried i wont continue that trend? I got like all As last year and going to get an A, A-, and two Ba this year. I also didnt take a fourth year of latin which would be AP latin",

Deferred is NOT rejected and there's a number of practical (and capricious) reasons why they might have deferred you too.",

Also, it did occur to me that they might have rejected you because of your financial situation (if they think you couldn't afford the school based on the level of financial aid they give out). Not sure what your EFC is so I'm not sure if that applies to you.... but just saying.",

I think unless you absolutely bombed your essay (like grammar errors all over the page or like half the word limit, etc) - it wasn't the cause of your deferral. The most likely answer is that you were statistically out of the league of the university. I don't mean to offend anyone currently attending Santa Clara, but if you have decent extracurriculars the only answer is yield protection. You do not have to apply ED2 to show interest, just apply to the school that you really wish to attend - whether it be ED, EA, or REA - schools are remarkably great at spotting school interest by very subtle hints within one's application.\n\nEDIT: May I ask your class rank?",
