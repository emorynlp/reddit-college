  "text": "I'm currently filling out extracurricular activity descriptions. I am a part of a Leadership course and a Yearbook course at school. (courses in the sense that they are technically on my schedule, but all of the work done and meetings are all outside of the timetable). \n\nDo these even count as extracurriculars? What would I classify them as? Volunteer? Other?\n\nThank you!",
