Then I picked the one I felt was most personal and showed the qualities I wanted and literally typed out my recording. Then I edited it. Whatever you do in your story, tell how you felt about it. Or how you  grew from the experience. For example don\u2019t just say I love to go fishing with my grandpa. Tell them why you do. What do you get out of this? How has it helped you develop and take on challenges. What wisdom could you impart on your future college friends?",
