  "title:": "Question about Filling out the SRAR",
  "text": "Hi, so I'm in the process of completing the SRAR (where we enter academic grades from our transcript and such onto a database for colleges).\n\nI noticed that there was a section for entering middle school grades, and I wondered if this applied to me since I took Algebra I and Geometry in middle school. However, those do not show up on my high school transcript nor are they used for graduation requirements since I took the math course following geometry (algebra 2) in freshman year.\n\nI've been hearing ppl say that we should add middle school courses if they are math or world language defined courses, but I've also heard ppl say that we shouldn't add them if they do not explicitly show up on our high school transcripts. So, I'm a little confused and was wondering if anyone would know.\n\nThank you for any info or advice :)",

      "text": "For math, it\u2019s almost irrelevant once you\u2019ve taken more advanced coursework. Of course you can do basic algebra if you\u2019ve passed Calculus! For some schools, it can help meet a min # of years of a foreign language requirement, so that\u2019s where it can be important to include.",
