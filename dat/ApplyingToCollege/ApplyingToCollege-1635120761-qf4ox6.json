  "text": "I am a Mexican student looking to apply for US colleges. In the CommonApp, I am asked to provide my ethnicity (hispanic) and my race (latino? idk). The problem is that the CommonApp includes White, Black, American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, etc, but doesn't include latino. I am neither of those races; I am brown, like 20% cacao chocolate. What do I put? If I put White, I would be misrepresenting my identity, and if I put any other, I would be appropriating a race that may not be my own. Could anyone help me?",

      "text": "Common App asks:\n\n>Are you Hispanic or Latino/a/x?\n\nCheck yes. Then Common App asks:\n\n>Which best describes your Hispanic or Latino/a/x background? (You may select one or more)\n\nCheck Mexico. Then Common App asks:\n\n>Regardless of your answer to the prior question, please indicate how you identify yourself. (You may select one or more)  \n>  \n>American Indian or Alaska Native  \n>  \n>Asian  \n>  \n>Black or African American  \n>  \n>Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander  \n>  \n>White\n\nCheck nothing or check white, as many US Hispanics do. Unfortunately, there is no Mestizo category. Checking the American Indian or Alaska Native category will bring up further questions asking for federal tribal identification, which you don't have.\n\nIt's fine to check nothing. Colleges will understand that you're Mexican from the question above, in addition to your presumably Mexican citizenship.\n\nTo be clear, acceptance rates for internationals to top US schools tend to be about half the overall rate. Colleges report internationals in a separate category, so that the underrepresented minorities reported in the Common Data Set are domestic applicants.",
