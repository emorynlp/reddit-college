      "text": "If your school doesn't offer AP courses, you are not expected to take them. AP course grades are far more important for college admission than AP exam scores.\n\nYou are also assuming you can just sign up - you have to find a host high school that will let you.\n\nExam scores may be more useful for placing out of requirements at college. This also varies widely, though you can find this info on college websites (google college name and AP credit).",
