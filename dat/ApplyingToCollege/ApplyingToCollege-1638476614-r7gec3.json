  "text": "I found this server early on this semester as I was starting my college apps, and it was honestly such a wild experience. It got me to start my applications early on so I wouldn't have to stress when deadlines neared, and was a good outlet for support when I felt alone in my worries. My school provides little to no guidance with college related things (SAT, personal essay, fafsa, etc.), so this server really helped me out with working my way through alone. \n\nIn most ways, I consider myself to be a perfectionist and slightly hard on myself when it comes to things applications or academics, so I can understand the toxicity within this subreddit when deadlines near. Most of us are just worried if we are good enough, and we all just want to end senior year on a good note. \n\nI genuinely think, despite the toxicity around stats, this subreddit was a huge help this application season (for me at least). Thanks for all the support guys, and good luck!",
