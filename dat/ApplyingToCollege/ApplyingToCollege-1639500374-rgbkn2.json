Suddenly, deals ain\u2019t looking so hot. \n\nAnd, before I get the \u201coh it\u2019s higher because you can pay more.\u201d  I can\u2019t.  She won\u2019t.  We just don\u2019t have a paper trail of the abuse so I can\u2019t get a waiver. \n\nThat said.  I feel qualified to agree with this statement, that financial aid is the least equitable when applied to middle-income households because I see the increase between my low-income based aid and my mother\u2019s middle-income based aid.  \n\nNo, she does not have crazy assets\u2026or any assets other than a house.",
