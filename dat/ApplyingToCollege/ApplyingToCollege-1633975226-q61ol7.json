  "text": "hello! i know the title sounds pretty bad but i just dont feel like ive had an amazing connection w any of my teachers (except my freshman english and soph yr math teachers that left <\\3) i dont think any teacher has seen me as a bad student, but i havent stood out too much either. i wasnt able to get close to any of my junior yr teachers due to online schooling and i havent gotten close to my current teachers yet. im planning to ask two teachers irl and tell them about myself/my ec\u2019s in an email. those LORs will probably be okay, but not stellar in any way. also, i got a new counselor this year so that doesnt help my case either. how badly fo you think this\u2019ll hurt my chances?",

      "text": "The counselor rec problem is definitely a common thing, most people don\u2019t have connections with their counsellors cause they tend to work more with students who need help or they are new counsellors; you can just give the counsellor your resume so they can have more to discuss. However, not having that strong of a connection with your teacher recommenders will be a problem, especially since they\u2019re given more weight than the counsellor recommendation.",

          "text": "Again please read the NACAC state of College Admissions annual report for making the last comment. Schools have considered counselor letters ever so slightly more important in the evaluation process, especially in the week of Covid. I believe the latest figures were 16.5% of admissions personnel give heavy weighting to a teacher letter versus 17% for a counselor letter.",
