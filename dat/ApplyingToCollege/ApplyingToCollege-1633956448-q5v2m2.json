      "text": "I would guess you'd need to write about why, specifically, you're undecided.  Doing that in a way that doesn't reflect negatively on you may be somewhat tricky.  One approach might be to discuss your *varied interests* and talk about what you find attractive about each direction you might ultimately go in.",

      "text": "1.  As /u/jayphoward suggested, write about your varied interests and why you love them.  Write about why you love open-ended study and why that's such a good fit for you.  Write about your general love of exploration.  For some inspiration, go look up the Echols Scholars Program at UVA and the Ben Franklin Scholars Program at Penn.  Both are tailored to open exploration, few limitations, and some amazing opportunities.  Reading about their philosophy of education may be helpful or spark some ideas on the types of messages you might try to convey.\n\n2.  Pick something that feels like a good fit for you and go with that.  Over 50% of college students change their major anyway, and colleges know this. You aren't committing or etching your major in stone.  If option 1 doesn't feel inspiring or compelling to you, this would be better than writing the prose version of \"???\".",
