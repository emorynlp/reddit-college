You should ask the teacher or your school counselor about that.\n\nAlso, do you want your PSAT and ACT scores included on your transcript? If you\u2019re applying to any colleges test optional, you should ask your counselor to remove those scores from your transcript.",

If GPA is based on semester grades, you have 3 A-\u2018s, so A- = 3.5 would explain it. It would also make the B+ meaningless, even if incorrect.\n\nOther grading combinations would also explain it. But you need your GPA rules. And a counselor would also explain better than anyone here.",

I also don't fully understand what the points thing means that you mentioned.  \n\n\nand the two A-s on AP chem dropping the final to a B+ is strange to me too.",
