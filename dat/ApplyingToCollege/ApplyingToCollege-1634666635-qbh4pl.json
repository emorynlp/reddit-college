  "text": "I\u2019ve received a few acceptance letters from safety schools like Michigan Tech and MS&T with some alright merit scholarship packages. However, I just got my SAT back last Friday and my score jumped from a 1430 to a 1540. Would I be able to \u201cupdate\u201d or \u201crecalibrate\u201d my merit scholarships? Should I contact my AO? Sorry if this question sounds dumb.",
