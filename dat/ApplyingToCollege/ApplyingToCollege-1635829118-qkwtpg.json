  "text": "The Common App dashboard set 11:59 \"local\" as the deadline. I thought of that as my local time and final submitted everything 11:30 central which is 12:30 eastern. The Common App gave me a \"application deadline has passed\" notification. Now, none of my schools will be early action and my early decision to Cornell is wasted \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs there anything I could do? My application at the top still says EA and ED on it but I think that's just the common app option I selected",
