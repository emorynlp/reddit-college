      "text": "Resumes are a good way to dive deeper into what you did in your activity list since they provide a LOT more space. But I also highly recommend including stuff that wasn't in your activity list, perhaps a job you couldn't find space for or a volunteering activity that was too small to include. You can also include other awards as well as skills (programming languages, software you're skilled at, etc.). Also, highly recommend https://flowcv.io because it's super fast and easy to make resumes there, absolute life saver imo",
