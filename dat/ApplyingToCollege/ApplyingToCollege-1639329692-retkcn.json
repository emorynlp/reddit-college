  "text": "Hi All, \n\nFor a sophomore that did relatively well on the P-ACT...is it necessary to go ahead with the SAT? I feel like the ACT reflects a wider range of knowledge and would be emphasized more by colleges anyway. \n\nThanks in advance...and my you all get accepted to your first choice.",

      "text": "The SAT and ACT are both equals, and there is no preference between the two amongst just about all of the American colleges. Do the one which you feel more comfortable with -- I've seen many people who score good on the SAT, but bad on the ACT and many others who score good on the ACT, and bad on the SAT. I've also seen quite a few good with both.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, pick one (which you feel more comfortable with) and just focus on that. You can see some practice papers online for each. If it's the ACT you like, then go for it!",
