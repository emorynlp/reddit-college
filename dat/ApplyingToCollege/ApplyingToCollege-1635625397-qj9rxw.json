  "title:": "Common app essay about guitar and applying for engineering, is that alright?",
  "text": "Some people have told me that I should\u2019ve avoided it but it\u2019s too late at this point. My essay isn\u2019t about the actual playing itself, but how playing the guitar allowed me to realize I can succeed through hard work. I did really bad in freshman year but i picked it back up in the later years, and I started playing guitar during freshman too, so i assumed it would go well together as an essay? Let me know",
