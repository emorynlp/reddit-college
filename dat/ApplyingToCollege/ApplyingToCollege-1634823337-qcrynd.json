  "text": "As the title suggests, I'm an international student with limited resources due to financial restrictions. Parents don't really have any contacts that can help me get an internship and since I'm applying for a competitive major like CS, I'd really like to intern somewhere (virtually) in that field. I can't find anything on LinkedIn and the other websites people have suggested don't have internships or research opportunities for international students (unpaid works just fine, can work in any time zone). Any leads?",
