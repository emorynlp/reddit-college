Figured I'd give it a shot too and just played around with the software for a while. Ended up liking it a lot and started producing music (not professionally). Later bought a small DJ controller and started doing gigs. Ended up buying more stuff like workstations, instruments, touchpads, etc with the gig money. Now it's like I have a whole music studio in my room.",

I would recommend Logic Pro X as far as composition software if you can save up for it, but honestly you can compose a great score off of Garage Band if you have the dedication. Good luck with your composing!!",

              "text": "Honestly, I'm split across just about every field, so I think a breakdown will answer your question in the best way:\n\nI love particle physics because it's similar to classical physics, and that's what most of my training consists of. Of course, I'm trying to diversify that training. It also encompasses most nuclear reactor / bomb physics, which is incredible to be able to imagine.\n\nI love Cosmology (not necessarily astro, but it plays a part) because it answers so many questions about the development of the universe. Although the beginning is curious to me, I'm more invested in how we can use the origins to predict the future of the universe. For example, I recently had a discussion with my teacher about symmetry of expansion. I wondered whether, since each object eventually returns to its initial state (taking into account the object's system in full), the universe would eventually contract. Turns out it is not so easy! (I was forgetting effects of higher dimensions.) \n\nI like (what I understand so far about) quantum mechanics and the mystery of probability. It's a little disappointing, though, to never have been taught about wave/particle duality, mostly on the particle side. It turns out all massless particles are fully waves (and so are electrons) and not particles. This would have made it easier to understand quantum tunneling, that's for sure!\n\nAlso, relativity is *insanely* cool. Time travel (into the future)! Sign me up!\n\nI still haven't 'figured out' the time dilation aspect of relativity on my own though, so I may need to look up the explanation some time. I usually try to avoid doing so, though, because imagining physics is just so much fun! I spent an hour in class yesterday trying to figure out how the rate of neutrino density falls off as a function of distance from a nuclear reactor!\n\nPhysics is great because physics is *truth.* Well, math is the actual truth, and it's easier to conceptualize some things in physics mathematically (e.g. higher dimensions), but at the end of the day, math would tell us nothing about our physical world if we didn't ask it physical questions.",

          "text": "That's the biggest problem with the whole admissions process. Everything is transactional. Hobbies need to turn into ECs related to your future major for them to be a good use of your time. And if it's not a good use of your time, then you need to use that time for homework from all the AP classes you need to take.\n\nMy kid used to love having random hobbies that she'd be really into for a couple weeks or months and then move on to the next thing that caught her imagination. Now it feels like every day is a time optimization exercise. Every hour not in school is either EC-related, homework, or sleep. There's very little time to explore new hobbies or interests if there's a low probability of it ever turning into something big.\n\nI'll be glad once this process is over, and she can go back to being her old self, if any of her old self is left.  :(",

It\u2019s a great way to make friends and fill some of your time.\n\n2. Build a reputation with your professors. One of my first accounting professors just got me an internship and another one is my advisor currently helping me plan to pursue my MBA and MSA at the same time. You never know what connections can bring you.\n\n3. Do your work as early as possible. This semester, I realized that one of my classes that is online is entirely at your own pace. After 2 weeks of grinding, I had already secured an A in the class. While that might seem pointless, mind you I\u2019m in my last year (3 year senior here). Work will still pile up. I had multiple nights of going to bed at 5 or 6 in the morning doing nothing except for practicing my sport and doing homework. You will have weeks that absolutely suck so getting ahead can help a lot in the long run.",
