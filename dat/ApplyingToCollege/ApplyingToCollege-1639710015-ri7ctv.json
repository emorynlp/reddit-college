  "text": "I\u2019m applying ED2 for the combined Media and Film Studies and Theatre major but I\u2019ve yet to find anyone on YouTube, this thread, or current students I can talk to that has entered or applying to any CAMD major. Knowing that Northeastern is a research school is it easier to get into this major? Hoping so cause I feel like I don\u2019t have the most rigorous course load to apply with. Anyways, also what\u2019s the lowest stats people at northeastern have gotten accepted with (no ap\u2019s, no leadership extracurricular s, etc). Also mention if comfortable sharing that information, just trying to see if I have a chance",
