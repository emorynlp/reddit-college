  "text": "I\u2019m applying ED2 for the combined Media and Film Studies and Theatre major but I\u2019ve yet to find anyone on YouTube, this thread, or current students I can talk to that has entered or applying to any CAMD major. Knowing that Northeastern is a research school is it easier to get into this major? Hoping so cause I feel like I don\u2019t have the most rigorous course load to apply with. Anyways, also what\u2019s the lowest stats people at northeastern have gotten accepted with (no ap\u2019s, no leadership extracurricular s, etc). Also mention if comfortable sharing that information, just trying to see if I have a chance",

      "text": "I attend northeastern and have friends that are party of CAMD and that major specifically, however not in the major or college myself. I would say that Northeastern is very true to their holistic review process in admissions. However, CAMD does have a different application process with requiring a portfolio iirc but that may just be for specific majors. It is not really dependent on major at the Undergraduate level at least that is what my advisor told me (again could just be from her experience and not as a whole). Some of my friends and I have very different stats and we attend the same school. You also have a higher chance to get accepted through ED than EA/RD. You can PM me if you would like to hear more about what I specifically did or my stats but I did go EA",
