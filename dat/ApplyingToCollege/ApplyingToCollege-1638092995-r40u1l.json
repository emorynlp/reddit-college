  "text": "Hey folks,I wanted to apply for MDC(Miami Dade College) so I emailed them for more information about their bachelor's degree programs 10 days ago. They still didn't respond. So I wrote 2 follow-up emails 5 and 3 days ago and they didn't respond to them either. Application pros, help me out. Am I too impatient? Should keep emailing them or should I try something else, if so what? I'm all new to this so if there is a guide or a help post somewhere on this subreddit I would be really happy if you could link it down below.\n\nThanks!",
