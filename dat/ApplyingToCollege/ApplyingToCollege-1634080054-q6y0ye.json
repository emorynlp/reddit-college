  "text": "\nI am majoring in biology at UNC. I wrote my personal statement about photoshop, my first supplement about my CS teacher, my second supplement about my racial identity, and the honors college essay about philosophy. Is it bad that they\u2019re not related? I do like my personal statement so my idea was to change my supplement to my biology teacher and write my honors essay about biology too.",
