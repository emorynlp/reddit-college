  "text": "Currently have a friend who is freaking out because a teacher hasn\u2019t submitted their LOR. Would there be a grace period for LORs like with normal applications?\n\n\u201ci applied to the university of texas at austin as an EA applicant to the business school. once i applied, i asp applied to the canfield business honors program that the school offers. however, i was not aware that the business honors application would not be fulfilled until a resum\u00e9 and recommendation letter have been submitted, all by the deadline for tomorrow, december 1st. if one of my teachers do not upload a letter tonight because i waived my FERPA rights, will i get penalized or not be considered for the delay in the letter?\u201d",
