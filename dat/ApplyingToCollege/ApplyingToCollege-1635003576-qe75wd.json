  "text": "I am white and asian (Japanese and white) and these days more people are telling me that I should just put that I am white when applying to college. My question is if I put white and asian, wouldn't that put me in the multiracial category? Last I've checked the multiracial percentages at colleges are really low, would that not give me a benefit if they are looking for diversity? Or is that not how it works....\n\nI was considering only putting white but I look extremely asian and my last name is Takata, I dont know if they would think I'm lying or not.",
