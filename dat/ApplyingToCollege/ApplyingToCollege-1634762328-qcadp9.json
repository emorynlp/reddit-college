  "text": "As in the title, I want someone to help me write my college essay. I'm an international student, so I don't have any previous experience with college applications in the US. I could really use some help marking crucial things to include in my essay and correcting professionally.\n\nPlease, write down trustworthy and proven tutors, who could work with me. I'm fluent in English so the language is not a barrier.",
