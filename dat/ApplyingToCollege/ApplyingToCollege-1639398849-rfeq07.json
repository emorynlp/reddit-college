I\u2019ve written a couple of posts recently that might help you prepare \n\nHere\u2019s my first one about emotional planning and what that means: https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/r8sjp7/happy_weekend_beautiful_seniors_if_you_applied/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nHere\u2019s my post from yesterday with some stories about baby trees, lotuses, college decisions, and you: https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/rdhia6/you_can_handle_this_college_decision_time_is_hard/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nAlso-- I was recently on the \"Inside College Admissions\" Podcast with Scoir talking about handling your decisions and how it hurts, but then it passes.  Even if it feels like the worst thing in the world right now, it will pass. You are the sky; everything else is the weather. [If you'd like to take a listen, here's](https://insidecollegeadmissions.buzzsprout.com/1384537/9651241)[ the link.](https://insidecollegeadmissions.buzzsprout.com/1384537/9651241)\n\nYou can handle this. College decision time is hard --- and it really sucks sometimes, but you're gonna grow stronger.\n\nxoxox \n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-",
