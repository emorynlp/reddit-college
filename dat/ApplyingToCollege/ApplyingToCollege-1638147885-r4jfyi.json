  "text": "Hello I am currently getting a bachelors of athletic therapy in Canada. After some classes covering the heart and how it works with veins and arteries and such I am very interested and actually want to look at continuing education that involves the heart after my undergrad. I did some research and I am having no luck in finding a potential masters or bachelors studying the heart. Is there a program that looks at the heart and would the jobs for this credential be well paying to make it worth it?",

      "text": "You could become a cardiologist, for that you would first have to go to 4 years of med school after your bachelors and then 5 years of a cardiology residency, it is actually one of the highestpaying jobs but the competition to first get into med school and then into cardiology residency is insane.\n\nTo go to med school you will also have to complete the med school prerequisites and take the Medical School Admission Test (MCAT) you can get more info about it on the internet and on r/premed",
