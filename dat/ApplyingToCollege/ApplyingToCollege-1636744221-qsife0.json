  "title:": "How to explain a low score when the whole grade has low scores",
  "text": "In my last AP Physics C midterm (not exactly, but close enough) I got a 44%. It was the highest in my grade (we're 8 students from < 150) and the average grade was 25%. The reason for the low score is that they completely changed the question type compared to the previous midterm (and the questions also being hard). No curving or anything similar happens at my school. At most, they boost the grades of everyone a bit but so far it's been limited to the largest courses.",
