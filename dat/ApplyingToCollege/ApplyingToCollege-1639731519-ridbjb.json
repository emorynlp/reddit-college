      "text": "No, but also kind of yes.\n\nNo:  if your stats are marginal, almost every school will care about \"the other stuff\".\n\nYes: if your stats are high enough, there is usually a large set of schools you could get into based purely on your stats, because your stats are so far above their median applicant.\n\nAnother reason yes:  Some states have guaranteed admission policies at their public universities based on class rank and/or SAT.  Texas, e.g.  Literally all you need is a high class rank (so long as you're content to study in the College of Liberal Arts).",
