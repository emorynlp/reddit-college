I would say UIUC or Wisconsin would be reaches that you have a shot at, maybe Minnesota as a target - but if you wanted to go into engineering all those schools get more competitive (UIUC especially).   Michigan State would be a bit safer, and Iowa, Iowa State, Missouri all have auto admissions policies if you need options where you know you could get in.",

              "text": "Main thing to know is that majors like human physiology, exercise science, sports management, kinesiology, etc. usually aren't more selective than the university as a whole in the way that nursing, engineering, CS, or business might be so you can use the average admitted GPA and test scores as a good guideline.\n\nSchools like IU Bloomington, Pitt, Ohio State, Penn State, etc. would all be in that target to achievable reach range too.",
