      "text": "Schools are looking for students with talent and interest, who have shown the ability to succeed and benefit their campus. The goal of college is to educate/train you in an area of interest. You are not expected to already be that when applying.   \n\n\nI suspect most high schools will have one Psychology class. So everyone applying will have zero or one. The difference between those is not large.\n\nPlus, anything you start less than two months before applications are due will not be impactful.",
