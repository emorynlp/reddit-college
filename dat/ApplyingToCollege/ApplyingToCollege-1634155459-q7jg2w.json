  "text": "Also, can this include taking care of my dog (feeding and walks)?\n\nI break it up as 30 min to feed and walk my dog, 1 hr to cook dinner, 40 min to clean the kitchen, and 40ish min of helping with homework or workbook = 2 hrs and 50 min for 5 days a week. I feel like I should also account for the fact that my sister doesn't always have homework so 2hr and 10 min some days. Averaging them would give like 2 hr and 30 min, which is like 12.5 hrs per week.",
