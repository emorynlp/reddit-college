      "text": "I am a parent. My son is applying this year. What exactly are you looking for in college counseling? If you are looking for help on how to write good essays, look for the YouTube videos from \u2018college essay guy\u2019. He really explained how to get started. If you are looking for how to navigate the whole process and want somebody to guide your kid, you might need a counselor. But from most of our (Parents I know and myself) experience, even the highly recommended counselors will kinda mechanically explain the process. \n\nWhat I found out important was to organize the thoughts on what story your kid wants to tell and how he can draw examples from his life. For us, even with a highly rated counselor, we had to do that so called soul searching ourselves. Like I said, look at the videos from college essay guy. He laid out some of the steps very clearly.",

      "text": "There are thousands of college counseling services - you are best to find a recommendation on a parent board in the town or city where you live. That said- my counseling experience has been meh even though they came highly recommended. Between my moms research and mine the didn\u2019t tell me anything we couldn\u2019t (or didn\u2019t ) already find on the internet. I actually stopped going. \nAnd to be clear my parents didn\u2019t do college in the USA so had no idea but there\u2019s heaps of info out there if you have time to navigate it ( and. You have plenty of time).",
