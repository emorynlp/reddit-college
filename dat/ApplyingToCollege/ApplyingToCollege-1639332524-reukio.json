  "text": "okay so i really want to major in astronomy/astrophysics but the only problem is that i\u2019ve never taken physics in high school. it\u2019s not because i don\u2019t like it or don\u2019t know anything about it, but the teacher at my school is known to be horrible and i didn\u2019t want the subject to be ruined for me all because of a crappy teacher. i did, however, take hs physics on khan academy and a little of ap, (and i\u2019m currently excelling in AP calc, and took AP chem last year) would it be alright if i included that in the common app? or am i just screwed?",
