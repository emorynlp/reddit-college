      "text": "If you're asking this question, then it's likely the questions you would ask school are very basic and googleable (ie not things you should waste their time with)\n\nFirst, you should figure out whether or not colleges you're interested in even consider demonstrated interest (google \"X college CDS\" and scroll down until you find demonstrated interest)\n\nThen, if they *do* consider it, only email them with specific questions you can't find answers to online\n\nIf they don't, then you can email them with specific questions you might have, but it'll have no bearing on admissions (not that asking questions of a school that does consider demonstrated interest will really matter that much anyway)",
