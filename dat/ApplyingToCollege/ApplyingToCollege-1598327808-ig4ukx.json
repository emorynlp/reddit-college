  "text": "like all we do is wake up at 8am and stare at the computer for 7 hours straight then do college apps and homework and then go to sleep which is so depressing? my choir teacher asked us how we were feeling about the school year and we\u2019re all so horribly depressed it sucks, even the teacher started crying on zoom bc that\u2019s how bad things are. i would kill to just sit in a normal classroom for a day, to have some semblance of when life used to be normal\n\nsorry just a little rant you can ignore me :)",

I wanna go spend time with friends and play my senior year in sports.\n\nInstead I have to sit around my house for 8 hours everyday, going to class and doing homework. And once I finish school, I get to sit in my room too tired to do anything for another several hours, before I go to bed, and start all over again. I'm not sure what's worse: boredom and monotony or the extreme loneliness lol.",

      "text": "Honestly guys, online school isn\u2019t terrible to me. I have been cyber schooled since 4th grade and I am now a senior this year. \n\nI have had way more opportunities for volunteering, sports, extracurriculars (piano, flute, violin, etc.). It\u2019s also easier as I don\u2019t have to plan drs appointments around school hours. Sure, it may not be the same as sitting in a classroom, but you are still learning things. If you are upset about the socialization, see if your school is going to offer clubs online. FaceTime your friends. Hell, even hang out with your friends (if your state/ country allows it). If you look at cyber school as a negative, the whole year will be negative. It\u2019s your senior year! You\u2019ve made it this far, you can do it!\n\nIt won\u2019t be the same as a typical senior year, but that\u2019s what makes it so much more exciting. You are one of if not the first senior class who completed an entire year solely online (depending on your school of course). Think about what you will be able to tell your children, grandchildren, etc. \n\nI know I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted for this entire comment, but I honestly don\u2019t care. This is my thoughts on it and that\u2019s great. Your comments on the subject are also great. I hope you have a great school year! Congrats to class of 2021!!!! \ud83c\udf93",

For most of us, our schools expect the in-school learning experience to parallel perfectly to a Google Hangouts meeting, with homework remaining the same, and the school day taking up the normal 8AM-3PM schedule with minimal breaks and mandated attendance. I agree that we should try to stay positive and make the most of it, but the truth is that things are very half-assed on the part of our administrations, not even accounting for the kids with bad internet connections.",

The world relies on mentally tough people doing the right things with the hope that the future will be better as you make it. \n\nHopefully this will just be a brief phase in your long lives where we look back on that awful 2020 with a wry smile and shake of the head.\n\nJust focus on what you can control bc I'm telling you the ability to excel in adverse conditions will be nothing new as you get older. Sure it may not look like a global pandemic but those other times will be a \"personal-demic\" and if you can make it through covid19 you can do that next one too.\n\nGood luck and stay safe.",
