  "text": "Hey guys,\nI am international student applying to US unis\nI have great stats and overall portfolio. So I think my chances are quite good. However, I need a financial aid as my parents are not able to afford. So in order to apply for fin aid in a lot universities I need a css profile. How do I prove that my parents make less than 65 k a year ( that is really the case), if it is a small shop who\u2019s is run without any official registration ?",
