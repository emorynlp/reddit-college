  "text": "A lot of things relating to college application process have changed after the pandemic.I have heard so many mixed opinions on this.Some people claim SATs hardly matter now,while others claim it is still as important as it was 5 years ago.With the SAT subject tests gone,SAT/ACT is the only standardized test available in most countries.What is the extent of importance given on SAT/ACT exam in 2021?",
