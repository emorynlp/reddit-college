      "text": "I likely have some sort of problem on an emotional level with processing big events though I\u2019ve never been properly examined for it. Things that should trigger an big emotional reaction like getting accepted or being awarded good scholarships don\u2019t give me one, at least not on their own. Hell, my reaction to being accepted by my second choice college and then being granted a huge scholarship by a college now tied with second was literally along the lines of \u201cAight, cool\u201d before forgetting about it to go do something else.\n\nBut the smaller things that came with being accepted and getting that scholarship - like my mom being so excited when I bring home a big envelop from a college, the pride the rest of my family has when I show it to them, all of my moms friends and clients trying to give their best tips for general college life, my dad sitting me down for a good heart to heart, my siblings tearing up at the thought of me going off to a dorm - all of those really give me a sense of pride that opening the letter or email was never even able to begin to approach.",

      "text": "I was accepted ED to my dream school, and honestly, I couldn\u2019t even describe it but I\u2019ll try\n\nThe week leading up to it I had already given myself no hope because I didn\u2019t wanna be super depressed when I didn\u2019t get in since I\u2019d procrastinated RD and had hella supps to write. I kept telling myself \u201cur gonna be ok\u201d up until the day of. I was sitting at home writing my \u201cwhy NYU\u201d essay when i got a super unexpected email that decisions were released and i started panicking. I clicked \u201cview status update\u201d fully ready to close the tab and keep writing my nyu essay and then i saw congratulations as the first word. Im pretty sure i had to read it 3 or 4 times before processing that i got in and screaming to my dad that i got in. He quite literally didnt believe me and i closed my nyu tab lmao bc i was DONE. It didnt even hit me for a couple days, i kept waking up every morning like \u201choly shit i got accepted to ___\u201d \n\nBut yeah. Special thing. So much relief when i realized a) i was going to college at my literal dream school and b) i didnt have to write essays over winter break. pm me if u wanna know anything else (or help w apps or something)! (Wasnt gonna dox myself but if u wanna know where i can tell you lol)",

      "text": "The first time: Good! My friend jokingly asked if she could read me the letter once I received the portal update, and I was like \"sure,\" because I wasn't too invested in specific colleges. Then she panicked because she was afraid she'd have to read aloud to me that I was rejected. Luckily, that wasn't the case.\n\nI perhaps too arrogantly thought of the school as a \"target,\" though, so my attitude was more like \"wow, that's neat\" than overwhelming joy. My friend was probably more excited than I was and we hugged a lot.\n\n===\n\nThe second time: There was an update to my portal. I knew the odds were low\u2014it was a pretty competitive transfer year\u2014but I had a feeling that I had made my odds as high as they could have been, given the effort I put into my application. I went on a walk and tried to relax, waited a few hours, went somewhere no one would find me, and opened the portal.\n\nWhen I saw the little bubble letters spelling \"congratulations\" that floated around when you moused over them I was stunned. Getting into your overwhelming top choice is a joy, but if you didn't expect to then overwhelming first feeling tends to be shock. In the past I've screamed over things I was excited about, but that time I was completely silent, and it felt like something was caught in my throat. I read the letter, closed it, then read it again, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake (wouldn't have been the first time; I was accidentally accepted into a private high school once that rejected me a few hours later.) My shock melted into relief as I imagined my new life at a college that I was 90% certain would be in many ways so, so much better for me.\n\nThen I ran to tell my parents, in tones not so much excited but as if I'd seen aliens descending from the sky. My dad's reaction (he knew I was applying because a guardian had to sign off on the application) was \"Wow! Congratulations! That was pretty lucky but you also deserve it. I hope you like it better.\" My mom's was \"you applied to transfer??\" followed by dozens of questions about why I'd decided to do so.\n\nI immediately called my best friend at the school I'd just gotten into her and we gushed together. She told me she knew I could do it and had a good feeling about it.\n\nGetting in made me randomly happy every few days for the rest of the summer. I still feel that way sometimes.\n\n===\n\nUltimately, the feeling of getting in may be memorable, or it may not be. It may be exciting or not so much. The latter memory is certainly fresh in my mind and was primarily wonderful, but I have been similarly excited and shocked over things before, like getting a birthday present I'd wanted for a whole year or my first time being cast as the lead role in a play or my first invitation to interview for a job. If you don't feel that way about college applications, there will always opportunities in the future to feel shocked and thrilled about something. Right now, college feels like the most important thing for many people, but once you've graduated, you will indubitably have other experiences you value. Treasure the \"wow\" moments, but try not expect them or to mourn the loss of them.",
