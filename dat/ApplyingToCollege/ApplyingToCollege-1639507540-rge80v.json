  "text": "okay so basically, the college has a facebook group and nobody\u2019s really posted anything on it. i want to post an introduction but i don\u2019t actually know if i\u2019m supposed to or not. also, i don\u2019t want people thinking i\u2019m trying to be qUiRkY because of my introduction,, like i\u2019m being completely honest in it but i still don\u2019t want people thinking i\u2019m trying too hard ig? here\u2019s the introduction:\n\nhi everyone!!\n\nnobody\u2019s really posted anything here so i guess i\u2019ll start by introducing myself. here are a few things about me:\n\n- my name is [insert name here] (as seen in my profile)\n- i\u2019m hoping to major in math or political science (or maybe both) but that could change by the time we have to choose our major\n- i\u2019m also interested in mythology, chemistry, and astronomy/astrophysics, and art history but i\u2019m not gonna pursue those\n- i some of my favorite things to watch are doctor who, marvel, good omens, and the umbrella academy\n- i love to listen to audiobooks and my some of favorite books are Scythe by Neal Schusterman and An Absolutely Remarkable Thing by Hank Green\n- i\u2019m part of the academic team at my school, which is sorta like quizbowl but with different scoring\n\nalso, i don\u2019t really use facebook\u2014 i just made it for this\u2014 so my instagram is [insert instagram] if you want to dm me or follow me. be warned: my instagram is mostly pictures of my cat.\n\nlooking forward to seeing you guys at [college]!!! (ahhhh, i\u2019m so excited!)\n\nany notes??\n\nalso, ik this isn\u2019t strictly admissions-related but idk where else to put this so,, heh",
