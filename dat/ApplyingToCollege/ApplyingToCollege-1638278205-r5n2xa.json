      "text": "most colleges nowadays will brag about using liberal arts and allowing students to customize their curriculum, etc etc. the only schools where you won\u2019t find this are ones where you apply to specific majors/departments/schools and are limited to those schools for your time.\n\nhowever, LACs like williams and swarthmore are drastically different from a research university with a liberal arts-y curriculum. the biggest difference is that they don\u2019t have grad students. at a typical university, some of your classes will be taught by grad students, and most of the research opportunities/professor focus will go to them (or so say the advocates of LACs). true LACs are undergrad only \u2014 colleges, not universities. and they\u2019re a lot more likely to practice what they preach about liberal arts curriculums.",

      "text": "The distinction was much clearer earlier... You had your Liberal Arts Colleges which were governing bodies of their own, and then you had Research Universities which had multiple colleges and graduate schools under them... But many LAC's have graduate programs now and facilitate research opportunities, and many Universities have been adding or enhancing the liberal arts into their undergrad curriculum.",
