  "text": "Hey, so I've applied to Rutgers, and they require me to fill out the SRAR (Self Reported academic records)\nSo under the class rank option, it says 'Decile', and the drop-down goes from 1st Decile, all the way up to 10th Decile.\n\nMy question was, does the 1st Decile denote you're in the top 10% of your school, or the 10th Decile?",
