  "text": "Hello,\n\nBasically, I have been preparing / shaping my resume around architecture major, and I realized only several months ago that architecture is shit. I realized that architects spend more time talking about regulations and constructability of a building than actual designing. Also, they need to work like shit for more than 5 years just to earn as much as other professions earn within 1 year right after college. \n\nI initially decided to pursue architecture major because a job survey said that I might consider being an architect, but it apparently is shit. \n\nIn short, I have been following wrong path for years, and I have just realized that I need to follow different path.\n\nThe question is, how should I fill the column that asks for my intended major and write \"why this major\" essay?",

I mistakenly believed that it would be like minecraft.",

      "text": "why would you base your entire career/major over a job survey? Did you not think to research further on what type of degree, schooling, experience, etc. goes into it? For YEARS, it didn\u2019t cross your mind that architecture might not be as simple as playing minecraft? It didn\u2019t cross your mind that some sort of licensure or registration is required after schooling? Are u dumb? \n\nIf you want to live rich and work leisurely go into something like business or stocks. Or find out what you actually want to do and research about that job instead of picking it off a career quiz or asking internet strangers. Go undeclared or whatever.",
