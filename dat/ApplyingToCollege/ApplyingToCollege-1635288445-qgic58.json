  "title:": "Oxford University, England states that you must have 3 APs at score 5 to qualify for admission - do they have to be related or as long as they meet the required subjects, are they fine? For example, can I apply to E&M with APs in Calc BC, Italian Lang, and AP Music Theory or is it a de facto reject?",

      "text": "It would qualify as meeting the minimum and then would be compared to others.\n\nSo not automatically rejected, but it might not stack up well against an applicant with Calc BC, Physics C, US History, English Literature, and Computer Science A.\n\n(Hopefully Italian isn\u2019t as a native/heritage speaker.)",
