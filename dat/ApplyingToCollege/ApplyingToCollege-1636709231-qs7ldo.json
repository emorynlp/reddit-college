  "text": "Q.1 In which program of study do you think you would like to major at Princeton? Your choice is not binding in any way.\n\n\\--- I want to become an Astronomer and hence should I go with majoring in Physics or Astrophysical Sciences? I know this might sound stupid, but what is the difference between choosing anyone of it? Should I go with Astrophysical, considering that i want to take up astronomy in graduate school or should I go with Physics?\n\n(or do I choose AStrophysical sciences in 2nd choice?)  \n\n\nQ.2 In addition to the major you noted above, please indicate which certificate program might interest you:  \n\n\n\\--- What is this about? How does a certificate program differ from a major? Is it a must to take? Say, I want to major in Physics, which one should I choose? or is it \"Hobby\" specific stuff?  \n\n\nQ.3 Parent, Step-parent, or Guardian 1 Position/Title  \n\n\n\\--- What do I write here? My dad owns a buying and selling business. More like a salesperson. So, what do I write in the position/title? And my mom's a homemaker, so what do I write in there?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ.4 Is it compulsory to send the graded writing papers for Princeton? Say, there were no exams or anything such \"writing\" stuff in our school, then what do I do?",

      "text": "Q1. Probably doesn't really matter. Both those two majors more or less look \"the same\" to an admissions officer trying to fill out a class. Astro is perhaps a bit more niche than physics, so if that's a better representation of what you want to do in grad school you should list it. \n\nQ2. This is asking about what are effectively \"minors\", though it isn't like many schools where every department has a major and a minor. There's a specific list of available certificate programs that you can look up and check your interest in.\n\nQ4. No, it's not compulsory. There's a FAQ on their admissions site completely devoted to the graded paper, and it says in several different answers \"If you are unable to provide a graded written paper, we will still review your application, but we will have less information with which to review your file.\"",

As for Question 4, while it technically isn't compulsory, with such low acceptance rates, it essentially is. I've currently enrolled at Princeton, and I can tell you I have yet to meet a person who did not submit a graded paper.",
