  "text": "I applied ED to Columbia and I forgot to submit my SAT score. Apparently I was supposed to indicate on the application portal whether I wanted my scores to be considered or not. I also forgot to enter my scores in consideration for the national merit scholarship.\n\nI was rejected but it hurts a lot more because I know I didn't do everything I could. I also spent months studying and it feels so wasted ):\n\nIt's 2am and I've been crying my eyes out for the past hour this sucks so much.",

But even though the score is great, tons of people are getting denied from Ivies this year with near perfect scores, legacies, etc \u2026 so don\u2019t feel like not using the score would have definitely changed things.\n\nMy advice is to get out more strong applications before the early January deadline unless you have already done that.  You will get into multiple top 10/20 colleges with that score.  Good luck!",
