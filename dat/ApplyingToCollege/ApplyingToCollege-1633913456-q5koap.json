I was planning on doing the 2 required and then another 2-3 from teachers who know me well in different ways. Also does anyone know what the hell the Recommendation 2 (Optional) means? They keep saying submit 2 from your 11th or 12 grade core classes, but then at other points contradict themselves and say only 1. What are the requirements?",

The Admissions Office does not operate in a vacuum...live in the very same world you do and read apps last year which was even more impactful. If GU wanted 4 recs, it would have been requested.",
