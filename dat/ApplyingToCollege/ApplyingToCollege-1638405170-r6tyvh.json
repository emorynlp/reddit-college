  "text": "My early action deadline for some school is tonight, and both my guidance counselor and english teacher haven't been responding. My english teacher previously edited my essay, but he didn't really give me any edits besides fixing grammatical errors. My guidance counselor was supposed to do a final edit of my essay, but she is out because of covid-19, so I have no clue what to do. I know it is very last minute, but this would be very appreciated. \n\nCan I share my essay with anyone for some edits/suggestions?",
