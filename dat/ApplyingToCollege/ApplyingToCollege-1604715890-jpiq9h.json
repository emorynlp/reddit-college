  "text": "I just had a lil existential moment (idk if you could even call it that) but I am just so grateful for my position in the world. So many are hungry, without clean water, without education, being persecuted, in wartime, experiencing natural disasters, etc.. The fact that I am applying to higher education after having received k-12 education is something I need to be more grateful for. Idk just thought I'd share, it's been a nice little reflection moment to realize how fortunate I am so that I don't lose perspective and don't take things for granted. Of course, our goal should be make use of our fortunate upbringings to better the world, but when you think about it, there's just so much darkness and it's so overwhelming :( that's why our positions are so valuable ... everyone on here is so kind and talented and smart! I definitely have faith in our futures. We can use what we have to help someone somewhere (obviously in a genuine, non-White Man's Burden way lol). Um chile anyways... keep things in perspective y'all! Yeah idk where this was even going. Bye luvs :0",

Its great that people appreciate their conditions of living and that we call this being grateful, but the implication is that if you dont do this then you're ungrateful. Which is my main qualm.\n\nYou have EVERY right to hate your circumstances and to be discontent. I dont give a fuck you feel happy that youre not starving. My main gripe is that, implicitly, gratefulness implies you SHOULD feel happy to not be starving which is idiotic.\n\nYour happiness/unhappiness shouldnt be dependent on  how many people are worse off than you",

Like ok, so what? People have it worse but you're upset right now, it doesn't take away from this situation and you don't need to push your emotions aside because people are dying or whatever. However, I still don't think gratefulness=happiness. As for ungratefulness, idek. I don't think of it like that, that if you aren't grateful you're ungrateful, but who knows lol.",

          "text": "Thanks for bringing that up, I agree with the idea about happiness. I didn't mean to imply that we all should be \\~happy\\~ right now or that everyone less fortunate and more fortunate is supposed to be happy. I was thinking more along the lines of being grateful for the things we do have  and recognizing that people are fighting for this level of education around the world. Basically, through all of the stress over applying to college, I don't want to lose sight that I am so lucky to be able to do this. Not that I need to make myself feel good or bad about my situation. I should be thankful and appreciative rather than simply \"happy\" for myself. I don't think being grateful necessarily \"creates\" happiness. At the time I posted the original post, it felt more sobering, not at all upbeat.",

      "text": "This is a pretty dumb outlook that a lot of A2C people tend to have (A2C attracts these types of people). It\u2019s not a helpful outlook at all. You should not be \u201cgrateful\u201d that you are going to college. You are not \u201clucky\u201d to go to college. Education is a very basic right. Plus, anyone who wants to go to college can in civilized society. As long as you haven\u2019t completely failed in high school. It\u2019s a pretty low bar. \n\nI\u2019ve also noticed a very irritating trend in which A2C students try to make it seem as if their accomplishments are due to luck or their financial circumstances or something outside their control. It\u2019s not. Your accomplishments are due to your own hard work and intelligence. You should be \u201cgrateful\u201d to yourself. \n\nIt\u2019s also not your responsibility to use your \u201cfortunate upbringing\u201d (whatever that means?) for anyone\u2019s benefit other than your own unless you choose to do so. You don\u2019t owe anything to anyone.",
