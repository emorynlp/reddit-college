  "text": "Hello. I'm a current HS senior who is planning to apply for UC colleges, but I am stuck with a problem. I just finished reviewing my UC application submission, and to pay for the fee, I had to input my credit card information. I had to do this a few times because each time I try, my attempt failed the \"Address Verification\" checkpoint. So as a result, I had to submit my UC application without technically paying. However, on my UC \"Fees and Payments\" page, it says I have a \"Pending\" credit card payment of 210, despite not actually paying.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this type of problem, and how can I fix it? The website is telling me I should wait 2\\~3 days more but the deadline is today. I tried calling them, but I got no response (I think its because there are already so many people calling them)",

I used a different credit card and it worked well.\n\nI was able to call UC about this address verification problem and they told me to make sure my billing address matches the address I type, so log into your bank account and verify your billing address :)",
