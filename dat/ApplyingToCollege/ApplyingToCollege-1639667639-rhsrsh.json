  "title:": "Why do ED rejections feel like such a personal insult?",
  "text": "I know it shouldn't be. I know it doesn't represent who you are as a person, yadda yadda. Idk if it is because I spent the last 3-4 years of my life dreaming of a different outcome or because all my effort, all the late nights studying for SAT and writing essays, all the time spent doing ECs just went down the toilet. All that simping for the school and all I got was a giant middle finger by the office of admission. \n\nI tried to keep my head up but I've been locking myself in my room to do RD essays for the last 24 hours and I feel pathetic. Ice cream did not help so it is worse than I thought it was. Respect for those who took their ED rejections with a grain of salt, I wish I had your mental resilience :( \n\nAlso congrats to those who got in ED, and thanks for listening to my rant\n\nFuck you tufts",

I do suggest giving ice cream another try tonight tho. \n\nHonestly there\u2019s just no rhyme or reason to decisions and as much as I love Tufts, they absolutely make some of the most fucked up shittiest decisions around. \n\nHere\u2019s some more yada yada \u2014 it is NOT a reflection on you. It\u2019s a reflection on the reader, on their institutional needs, and probably the rotation of the universe on that day. \n\nBut it\u2019s totally fine to feel shitty right now. In fact you should allow it. College decisions can be really hard to deal with when they don\u2019t go your way. My best advice is to allow yourself to feel the pain. Get really mad or sad for a few days. Bash pillows. Angry Cry. And then get ready to move forward. \n\nI wrote a lot more about how I made it through some of the toughest times in my life and some suggestions to help you make your way through in a post last spring. https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mnr8uz/hey_seniors_if_your_decisions_disappointed_then/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nI hope you\u2019ll find something useful there. The pain sucks but you will make it through. I promise. \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\ude0a",

And you will be.\n\nAlso I heard Tufts has herpes so you dodged a bullet.",

They\u2019re going to get rejected from 90% of the schools they apply to, because each school can only accept 10% of applicants.\n\nEven if early decision increases your chances some, the situation is still the same. Most people don\u2019t get into the school they want to go to, but qualified students will likely get into a top school. Just work hard, apply to a lot of colleges, and try your best.",
