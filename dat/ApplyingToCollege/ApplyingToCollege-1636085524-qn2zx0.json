  "text": "Hello, info about me- international student but have been schooling in the us for past 8 years. But considered an international student by visa. \n\nNo one been able to help me out or counsel me because of this background. I'm eligible for merit scholarships given by the universities in America? Is it really better to apply for the t20 because im worried about them giving me aid. \n\nMy family are in middle class zone, as most families are in America. To much money to considered low income and too less to be able to pay for college without going into debt. \n\nIn addition to the t20/not all the t20 but like 3, ive going to apply to other universitys/colleges like Amherst and Emory.\n\nI'm really struggling on what to do, and what direction to take",
