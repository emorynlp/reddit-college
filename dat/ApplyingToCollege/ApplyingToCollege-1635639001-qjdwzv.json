  "text": "On one of my applications I was doing confirm submission section which requires you to sign and date. On the common app they have format \"October 30, 2021\" as their guide I accidently put in \"10/30/21.\" The submission went through fine, so did it understand the date I put in, I'm just freaking out a little right now because I'm nervous one of my applications may not have worked.",
