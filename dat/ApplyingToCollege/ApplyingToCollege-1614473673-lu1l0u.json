It\u2019s very strange and uncomfortable to see parents living through their children and forcing them to make every move for their parents instead of themselves, and this case especially makes me feel terrible for the girl. She got into one of the best IVY LEAGUE schools and her mom is still latched on to her? Where does it stop for these types parents??",

But I see parents posting thing about the college process it\u2019d be better if the kids did, like they are taking over the process and doing it themselves, and then just telling the kid how to do it. Kids who aren\u2019t self motivated enough to research these things on there own are being hand held too much. I see a lot of parents doing a lot of the process for the kids, instead of them helping the kids do the process.",

At first, you fear your kid not getting into a good school and then you hope and pray they don't self-destruct on their own.\n\nI guess you have to see both sides of the coin. Some kids are mature enough to handle this stuff on their own. Others need to be monitored to make sure everything is going fine, with help available, if needed. Some of the examples that I have read here are definitely some extreme examples. Also, the parents who chastise their kids for not getting into T20 or lower, holy crap, that's messed up and is undeniably mental abuse.",

Your comment of \"So my comment to some of the kids who THINK they did it all... you might just have a crafty Mom who did it behind your back.\" is very unrealistic for me. My dad doesnt know any of my log ins so theres no possible way he could fill in stuff beforehand. I chose the schools and scholarships (list provided by my counselor/school) I applied to. Also because I'm doing everything online this year, he hasn't seen an application except for me complaining about essay prompts :p\n3. Theres nothing wrong with you filling out the stuff you did and him doing the writing stuff cuz it works for you, it's just not a relatable for a some of us here. My dad wouldn't mind being more involved, but I would feel suffocated and would much rather do it alone",

This is the time for all of you to take ownership and responsibility for getting things done, because you'll need to do this once you get to college. Parents need to help guide the process because they have financial interests, but also because a 17 year old doesn't have the same depth of perspective that they do. It is the partnership that will produce the best results. I don't work at a University any more but love this forum because it reminds me of the students I used to work with and miss very much. Soon my son will be a freshman, like all of you, and I truly believe you guys are going to change the world. Just remember, your parents love you and, while not perfect, are usually trying to do our best. Good luck and much success to each of you.",

Every kid is different, and every kid's needs are different at different times in their lives.   \n\n\nMy older son needed a fair amount of micromanaging when he was applying as a high school senior. I never had portal logins or anything, but was fairly on top of what needed to be done.  He was in tough classes, and going to state for his high-demand sport at the same time as applications. Fast forward three years when this same son was applying as a transfer student. (Decided to stay home and do CC.) I did nothing except act as a sounding board.  I still had my own process - following online forums and researching programs, and such for my own entertainment - but he was in charge of everything, and very self-directed.  He just needed more help when he was younger primarily because of his maturity and skills (or lack thereof).\n\nNow I have my younger son applying, and what I do, again, looks totally different from the previous application periods with the older kid because he has different needs.  \n\n\nA decent parent knows what the kid can do and what the kid needs help with, and also knows when to let the kid struggle a little, and when the struggle would be too much.  Of course there are the exceptions of parents who just don't get it right, but in most cases, it's hard to judge from the outside as every kid has their strengths and weaknesses that parents know and outsiders can't really know.",

So it confused me how parents who I know would take probably 3 hours to explain how to get on the portal and everything it means don't just let there kids worry about it and play middle man for them as well.",
