  "text": "\nI\u2019m a sophomore in high school and I want to get into a top college like Duke but I feel like my ECs are weak and I haven\u2019t accomplished anything at all and the first semester is ending soon. I wasn\u2019t able to do anything freshman year because of COVID. My school doesn\u2019t have any good ECs so I\u2019m only involved in 3. Im in math club, debate, and I play a sport that I\u2019m not that good at. I don\u2019t know what other ECs I can do outside of school. I wanna major in biomedical sciences. I don\u2019t really know what to do now because there aren\u2019t any good opportunities for me. Please help and give me advice.",

Don't go joining random ECs thinking it'll \"look good\" on a college app if it's just gonna stress you out. Do the things you'll enjoy, study well, and anything else that happens, happens.",

      "text": "My friends and I go to Duke and this what we think: \n\n1) It should be fine to not have had much done your freshman year due to COVID, most people are probably in the same boat\n\n2) You could try to do things that better your community such as volunteering \n\n3) For ECs, quality over quantity is more important. If you can focus on a few ECs and do well in them or hold leadership positions, that is more impressive than being in 8 ECs and just being a participating member\n\nPS You will hear people that do like 10ECs but most applicants will likely not have that\n\nEdit: Formatting",
