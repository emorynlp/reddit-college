I mentioned a few safeties and Purdue. He was like \u201cPurdue?! Wow, you must be really smart!\u201d And I didn\u2019t tell him about Northwestern, Dartmouth, Yale, Notre Dame, and Harvard. Of course, I can\u2019t predict getting into any of them, but I feel competitive among other applicants. The idea that I gained respect for my brain by only applying to Purdue opened my eyes at that I\u2019ve accomplished a lot, including learning English to the point when my math teacher wants me to become a writer (moved to the us a few years ago).",
