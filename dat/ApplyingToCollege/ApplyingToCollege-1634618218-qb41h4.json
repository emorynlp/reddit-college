      "text": "When you say \"regardless of costs\" you mean \"I'm attending for free\"?  Probably Chicago.  Maybe Michigan or UVA.  Maybe Rice.\n\nChicago: seems to have more of a culture of \"scholarship\" as opposed to students just looking to make bank.  Also somewhat more economically diverse than its peers and more respectful of its students' (and faculty's) speech rights.\n\nMichigan: I like college sports, and in particular football.  Almost every department is highly respected, campus is beautiful, lacks the try-hard grinder atmosphere at Berkeley and the oppressive Bay Area focus on tech.\n\nUVA: similar reasons to Michigan, but with fewer STEM bots.\n\nRice: High concentration of smart and interesting people, but the *lack* of prestige (relative to other schools that are similarly selective) might serve to filter out some of the types I find irritating.  Also, several of my friends from HS went there and, to man, they give it glowing reviews.",
