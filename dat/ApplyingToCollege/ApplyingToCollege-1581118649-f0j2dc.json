Don\u2019t believe everything people say\n\nBerkeley and Ucla don\u2019t care about test scores as much as the very prestigious privates, contrary to what you would suspect. If you\u2019ve been following UC news, the UC executives are actually planning to rid the SAT and other tests since they believe it\u2019s not an accurate representation of how you\u2019d perform in college (they have already done that for transfers). This can explain why even though Berkeley and Ucla are the most applied to schools in the world, the average sat scores are still a lot lower than the top privates\n\nAlso, although the top prestigious privates religiously advertise that they are holistic, which they are, they still take in a way higher percentage of high income kids compared to low income kids in contrast to public elites like Berkeley and Ucla, which have much more representation from all socioeconomic classes. \n\nStill, take my analysis of the college admissions process with a grain of salt as I\u2019m not an admissions officer, but I just disagree with your reasoning and argument about how Berkeley cares more about test scores than the top privates, which I think is the exact opposite. The Ivy League seems to have like a standard of what your score should be, but the public elites are just much more holistic about test scores imo, at least based on statistics and common logic. It also makes more sense for privates to want to try to boost their prestige than publics, as the salaries of the education leaders of the public institutions are all public, which is not true for leaders of private schools who could potentially benefit much more out of a more prestigious school. I understand my logic for this topic might have some holes, but I just wanted to provide a counter to show how some common perceptions about the college admissions process by this sub\u2019s community might not be true",
