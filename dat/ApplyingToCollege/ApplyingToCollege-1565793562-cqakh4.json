  "title:": "UPDATE: Applying to college with a 1.4 GPA.",
  "text": "Hi everyone! I made a post last fall as a senior in HS regarding my low GPA, basically asking if I had a chance at getting into any school other than community college. I decided to log back on and update anyone who read my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9or8i0/14_gpa_do_i_have_any_chance_anywhere/) and/or cares.\n\nI was able to get a fee waiver so I applied to ten schools. I emailed each school with a brief explanation of my circumstances and asked for my applications to be analyzed with more weight on my senior year grades than my previous three-years. Four schools told me they'll write a note about it in my file, three assured me that they review the applications holistically, and three straight up said no.\n\nOut of the ten schools I applied to, I was accepted into two, waitlisted at two, and rejected from the other six. I interviewed with, and was accepted into a private school in my state with about an 82% acceptance rate. The second school I was accepted into has a 96% acceptance rate. One of the ones I was waitlisted to was my absolute top choice.\n\nFor a while, I considered attending the private school I got into, but I just didn't love it there, the campus feel wasn't for me and I'd have preferred a bigger school. The other one that I was accepted into is beautiful but across the country.\n\nI decided to go with community college. I took 16 credits this summer with a 4.0, and recently began the Fall semester where I'm taking another 16. I'm applying to a few schools as a Spring 2020 transfer, including my top choice which I was previously waitlisted to, but I haven't decided for sure if I want to transfer this Spring or wait until Fall 2020.\n\nFor all those with low GPAs, for whatever reason, don't lose hope! I remember feeling so depressed about how low my GPA was. My high school was very competitive and had high standards, I used to see other girls crying in the library because their GPAs were 3.8s instead of 4.2. There is nothing wrong with community college or schools with high admission rates. If I was able to get accepted into two schools with a 1.4, you'll get into college. Don't stress too much!",

For the 1st 3 years of HS. he would always show up late or miss the 1st period class. Would leave school early. It got worse through the years. Was able to do sports first, to not being able too. Eventually being more absent on a daily basis. When Senior Year came by, he ultimately couldn't attend. Since,  I've rarely ever get a text from him from time to time. Last I heard he was taking a gap year before attensing college and doing an internship. I really hope he gets his life back on track as well. Good luck.",

And there is nothing wrong with community college: I've worked in and around higher ed for a long time (20+ years) and the community college faculty I've met are the most committed, most caring people I've ever talked to. \n\nBesides, although it may not seem so at the moment because you're not at your #1 pick, no matter where you go the first two years are usually mainly gen ed requirements that you could take anywhere. You're getting them under your belt, saving lots of money, and raising your GPA. And you're learning stuff! I'd suggest not transferring until you finish your AA. By then you'll have a much better idea about what you want to do and you won't be wasting money paying for gen-ed classes at a fancy private institution. \n\nNice job! You made a great choice! And if anyone at the school you end up transferring to tries to make you feel lesser because of your CC experience, f\\*\\*k 'em: you're going to graduate with less debt (if any) and made a smarter choice than they did.",

But I graduated, don't even know what my GPA was considered and never took a single ACT, AP, SAT etc test or any of that kind. Now fast forward several years and I currently go to UC Davis, one of the top rated Public universities in the country, same rated in the top 10 and even 5. It was because I learned how to learn by simply paying attention and make sure to understand the information rather than memorize it. I then attended Community college and got all A's and B's which is what got me accepted to Davis. \n\nMy advice is to GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE FIRST. Even if you got decent grades in HS. You greatly increased your chances of being accepted at a university since they consider transfers top priority and you save a ton of money for the same exact degree. Don't ever let any make you feel down because you went to a CC, when CC in my experience has better professors than many universities. And when you graduate from that university with a bachelor's, masters etc degree with CC first, there's no difference than someone who did all years there other than the price of what it costs you!",
