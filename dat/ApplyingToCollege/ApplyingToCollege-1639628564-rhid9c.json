  "text": "In a moment of monumental idiocy, I entered the incorrect birthplace on my REA application. There is absolutely nothing I can do about it now as decisions are being released tomorrow. Unfortunately, I only realized this a few hours ago. My question is this: will this have a significant impact on my decision?",

I spelled my name wrong and put the wrong state on my college applications (both much more significant things). Guess what? I still got into my dream school (t20). Birth place doesn\u2019t matter, it does nothing for identification purposes and therefore won\u2019t impact any decision. If it does bother you, you can always email admissions to note that it is different than what is stated in the app.",
