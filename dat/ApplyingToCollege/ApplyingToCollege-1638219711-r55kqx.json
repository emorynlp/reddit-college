You come onto this persons post after she explicitly states she means no harm no prejudice in her response then come and claim if a white person did it (which they have) there would be people mad and angry ( which they aren\u2019t) completely ignoring the entire post just so you can make this comment? I\u2019m so sorry I assumed your emotions you were just so curious  I couldn\u2019t tell.",

          "text": "Being that we are literally a minority number of students on any given PWI campus, and our predecessors have experience varying levels of discrimination and inequity. It is important that students of color, particularly those who identify partially/fully as African/African American or black decent find a platform in which ideas, thoughts, experiences and feeling can be share, supported and directed. \n\nThis thread is not to exclude, because by nature, a person of \"non-color\" or non minority largely has benefitted from the advantage of being just that, a non minority. Non-minority/White/Caucasian historically have been labeled majority, and still are.  I am sure many of  the the AA/Bl  A2C'ers  look forward to attending schools where we can interact, collaborate and learn with people of all backgrounds. Please remember, we didn't create this history of this country and its practices (particularly negative ones), we are simply trying to change the trajectory of the negative. \n\nFeel free to scroll through this thread, as we do scroll through other threads. Everyone is simply trying to get a since of the competition, experience, and determining the environments in which we can best thrive academically and socially, and be successful in obtaining a degree.  I can honestly say that is the one thing we all have in common.",
