  "text": "I've been relatively okay with my extracurriculars up until now, but somehow anxiety has started to set in and I can't stop comparing myself to these insane Einsteins who somehow manage to do every activity under the sun perfectly. It's making me feel super lost tbh. Like how are people out here publishing research papers in prestigious journals AND running international nonprofits AND winning olympiads??? It baffles me.",

But no doubt, a good few of these kids accomplished these things at the cost of a real life or personality, or even resilience and adaptability. You did you and that\u2019s what\u2019s important.",

I had the same dilemma but wayyy later in the game bc of covid. felt totally lost when i was filling out my activities. however you\u2019d b surprised how many things you do actually count and how you can finesse them a lil in the description to showcase what u learned from them! it\u2019s hard to try to put urself in a written all for everyone but it\u2019s better to put things down that you enjoy then pulling things out just to have on an app. good luck!",

With this in mind you will be supporting yourself both inside and out which is the key to happiness. I know this may sounds corny but it is very true and a perfect time to start being true to who you are-its a great habit something most kids your age struggle with. Good Luck !",
