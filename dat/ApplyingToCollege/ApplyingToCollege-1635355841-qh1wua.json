  "title:": "Recommend a University to me?",
  "text": "Hello! Basically, I have no idea whatsoever what university I want to go to. Can someone please recommend a university/universities to look into based off of traits I like in schools? Thanks!\n\n-One not ridden with scandals\n\n-A challenging curriculum. I\u2019m looking for a very challenging course load and a university that provides that.\n\n-Not too small. I really don\u2019t want to go to a high school sized university haha, but I also don\u2019t want massive 300+ person lectures? I suppose I mostly want a good teacher/student ratio.\n\n-Not in the middle of nowhere- has to have good shops and stuff nearby\n\n-Safe!! Mostly the area directly around campus must be safe and not dangerous with crime\n\n-Good research programs.\n\n-Preferably not in the South\u2026 Basically I\u2019m not wanting to go to Louisiana, Mississippi,Texas, or Alabama unless it\u2019s an HBCU.\n\n-!! Great study abroad programs!! Where I can go to a partner institution for a semester or something\u2026\n\n-Food\u2026 omg a school that has amazing or just not subpar food really? or that has a good restaurant area nearby.\n \n-Culture, okay this one isn\u2019t really binding but I\u2019d love to be in an area that has an immense amount of culture/history surrounding it.\n\n-Last one!!! I\u2019d love it if this school was in a more democratic/liberal area, as I have grown up in the opposite essentially my entire life.",
