  "text": "I\u2019m in 10th grade and I\u2019m thinking about dual enrollment. \n\nHow much does it cost?/is it free?\nHow many credits can I take, and is it only for a certain amount of time? Like can i take some classes this year than more classes the next two years? \nIs it worth the time? Or should I just wait until I graduate? \nBasically any information you have about dual enrollment, I\u2019d like to know lol.",

If you are in one of tuition states, you can save $ thousands $ of tuition, each year, if pass class.,\n\n\nCollege will sometimes limit students to 1orc2 classes per semester. Other colleges have no limits.\n\nCheck State Dept of education for program info.",

      "text": "Cost and other details depend on your  high school's rules. Some high schools may cover the cost, subject to certain limitations. \n\nAP courses may be a more reliable way to go.\n\nOne possible downside of dual enrollment, college grades are forever. That is, most grad school admissions will include dual enrollment grades when they calculate your college GPA. This can be a risk if the course turns out to be harder than you anticipate.",

This is all for my school so idk if its same for you.\n\nCost: about $100 per class, you can get a fee waiver  \nCredits: However many a college student can take, yeah you can take 10 classes (or more) a year but then you suffer  \nTime: the school year or for classes its the duration of any standard college class  \nWorth the time: I have no idea  \nWait until graduation: It could give you college credit, if you think you can handle it theres no reason to wait imo\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is probably all school specific though",

      "text": "I agree with the other commenters that DE programs vary significantly from state to state. In my state DE is \"free\" up to 30 credit hours with the college. That also means we can take multiple years of DE, but once we cross 30 CH we have to pay thousands out-of-pocket per class.\n\nIs it worth it? For me, HARD YES. I'm taking classes at a level I never imagined I would experience in high school. You aren't treated like a high schooler either (none of my professors know I'm a high school student). This does mean you need to be more independent about tracking assignments and doing the work, but nothing can better prepare you for college than being in college itself. Depending on the school, you might even get to use the school's amenities (like the gym and library) and attend events (I went to the Diwali event for my school lol).\n\nIf you plan on going to an undergrad school that accepts transfer credits, that's even better. You can even start knocking out requirements for your intended major in high school and then make use of transfer credits once in undergrad to save quite a bit of money.\n\nThe only major drawback is that your schedule gets a lot more hectic. It's harder to commit to new extracurriculars since you will most likely already have to tailor your DE schedule to your current schedule. I also called it \"free\" because transportation costs aren't typically covered under DE programs.",
