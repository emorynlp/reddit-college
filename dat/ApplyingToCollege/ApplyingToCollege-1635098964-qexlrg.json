      "text": "Traditionally, \"full ride\" refers to a merit scholarship that covers both tuition and living expenses.  Be careful to distinguish between merit scholarships and meeting full financial need, as need-based aid is, as it sounds, based on your particular financial need (as calculated by the college, not what you think you need).\n\nTry r/IntltoUSA, google schools that meet full need for internationals (paying attention to which ones are also need blind for admission, a small number, or vice versa, need-blind but don't meet full need). Also google schools that give merit scholarships to internationals. For merit, you would want to look for less selective schools.",
