  "text": "Essentially, I failed a couple classes at my high school and retook them over the summer using METHOD SCHOOLS, which is an online program. On my transcript, those grades are referred to as \u201cout of district.\u201d The issue is, I just submitted my application and then found out I was supposed to report those grades as another high school - \u201cmethod schools.\u201d I did in fact report ALL my grades- failed and summer retaken- correctly, but I did it all under my actual high school . I emailed for help but they weren\u2019t helpful in the slightest. Am I screwed basically?",

      "text": "LOL idk how i found this and idek if ur still worried ab this but bruhhh i had the same problem. IT WAS WITH METHOD SCHOOLS ALSO. i went back and forth whether or not i should add them as another school. i did at first and then i decided not to cuz i was like whatever itll probs be less complicated. then i asked my counselor ab it to make sure and she kinda scared me at first cuz she said technically i should have, BUT it doesnt really matter. she told me it wont affect my admissions decision so i was like ok then o wells lol",
