  "text": "Essentially, I failed a couple classes at my high school and retook them over the summer using METHOD SCHOOLS, which is an online program. On my transcript, those grades are referred to as \u201cout of district.\u201d The issue is, I just submitted my application and then found out I was supposed to report those grades as another high school - \u201cmethod schools.\u201d I did in fact report ALL my grades- failed and summer retaken- correctly, but I did it all under my actual high school . I emailed for help but they weren\u2019t helpful in the slightest. Am I screwed basically?",
