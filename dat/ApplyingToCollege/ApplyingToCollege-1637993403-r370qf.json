Someone on this thread already aggregated the average rankings of US News, WSJ, Niche, and Forbes (edit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/pu8r0a/ultimate\\_ranking\\_of\\_the\\_top\\_100\\_colleges/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/pu8r0a/ultimate_ranking_of_the_top_100_colleges/)). The overall ranking had Columbia at 7 (behind Harvard MIT Stanford Yale Princeton and Duke), which is probably more reasonable than putting Columbia at 2 like US News.\n\nBut aside from using US News, you can determine the best schools by standards like student achievements and how the schools fair in cross admit battles against each other. For the biggest student achievements like Rhodes Scholarships in the past several decades, HYPSM all lead the pack (cementing them as T5) followed by Duke, Brown, Columbia, and Chicago. For measures like cross admit preferences, Harvard, Stanford, and MIT lead, followed by Princeton and Yale, followed by Caltech and Columbia, followed by Duke and UPenn, followed by UChicago and Brown. So as we look at more of this stuff we get a fairly consistent picture of what the best schools are.",
