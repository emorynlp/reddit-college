I was applying to Pomona College and they had a section of fun/random questions on their application (like \"what's your favourite way to cook a potato?\" and \"if you opened a restaurant what would it be called?\"). One of the questions asked for 3 fun facts about yourself and I did 2 very cool and personal ones but then couldn't think of a third. I ended up putting this in as the third thinking that although I probably won't be the only one, it might hopefully make the admissions officer laugh.\nI guess it wasn't funny enough because I got rejected. \n(Overall, don't worry about it, I got rejected for other reasons and it's probably harmless to put this. I just wanted to share this story)",
