  "text": "Please how do I make it stop. All I think about is college 24/7. I worry about not getting into my top school, worry about not being able to afford it, and when im not doing that, I think about how great it'll be to go there. It never leaves my head. And the decisions don't come until february?? How am I supposed to survive another month and a half. Hearing all of my friends get into their top schools just makes me so excited and fuels these thoughts. It's never ending!\n\nTbh this same thing happened with my SAT score. I spent my days scrolling through reddit and trying to decipher every question and whether or not I got it right. It consumed my mind for two whole months. It just feels so much worse now that this is actually life changing.",

Your mental health matters, and it\u2019s okay to step back \u2764\ufe0f",
