NYU is also need-blind for domestic students, so your income shouldn't benefit or hurt your chances.\n\neta: if you have low stats like you said in your last post, and if you're a NY resident, apply for HEOP too. my bf's sister had a real low gpa and sat score (<1300, <3.0) but was really promising due to her ECs and whatnot and it helped her not only get in, but also with more than a full ride.",
