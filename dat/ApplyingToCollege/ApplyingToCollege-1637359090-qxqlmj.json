As I heard someone say once about Harvard grads: \u201cI\u2019m impressed that someone got IN to Harvard\u2026 but I\u2019m not really impressed that they got OUT of Harvard.\u201d\n\nIn a perfect world, we\u2019d take a group of 10,000 people who were accepted to and intend to enroll at an Ivy League school for fall of 2022\u2026 and then randomize half of them to attend an Ivy League school and the other half to attend non-Ivy League schools.  Then we\u2019d follow both cohorts longitudinally for 20-30 years or so and see whether there was any difference in earnings, career path, job satisfaction, quality of life indicators, etc.",

      "text": "As someone who graduated this year, I can only tell you that students at Ivies get a lot of exclusive opportunities which are only open to students from top schools (not necessarily an Ivy). Those exclusive opportunities tend to be prestigious, which can help build an impressive resume and make the student stand out among candidates who are looking for jobs or trying to get into medical/law schools. Does attending a more selective school guarantee future success? Absolutely not. Not all students at selective colleges can get those opportunities and sometimes \"[overmatching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J-wCHDJYmo)\" can even cause bad consequences.\n\n\u201cUndermatching\u201d \u2014 where a top student opts for a lower-tier college, even though they could likely get into a more selective school \u2014 sometimes can put them at a disadvantage. However if they can stand out in the undermatching environment, they can turn the disadvantage into their advantage, since it is much harder to stand out at a top school. Here is an example of someone who [chose UCR over UCLA and UC Berkeley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_HK0Cx3cXY) and won a jackpot (free med school tuition).\n\nIf you'd like to see an example of how prestige can help in med school admissions, I'd recommend that you take a look at [University of Michigan M.D. 5-year admissions snapshot](https://medicine.umich.edu/medschool/sites/medicine.umich.edu.medschool/files/files/tracker/UMHS11838_5YearAdmissInfographic2020.pdf).",

Being among the best students at a large state school might give you better opportunities than an Ivy (it certainly did for me).\n\n>top level educators\n\nEvery solid college does.
