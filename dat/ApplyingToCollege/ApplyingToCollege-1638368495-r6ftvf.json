  "text": "Basically the title. \n\nI gave the SAT once and scored 99th percentile but I wanted a much higher score to have a decent chance at a Top10 Schools. So I posted on a couple of websites that I am willing to tutor for the SAT and now I am getting paid $13/hour for 10 hours/week to practice for my December SAT. It is also a very cool extracurricular that shows some blah-blah skills that colleges care about.",
