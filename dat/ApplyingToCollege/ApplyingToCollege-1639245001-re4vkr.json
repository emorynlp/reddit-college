  "title:": "NYU Prof's Predictions about Elite Colleges: Confirmed?",
  "text": "edX (founded by Harvard and MIT, originally as a non-profit) is now a for profit \"benefit\" company after being recently bought by 2U for $800M cash.\n\nIn May 2020, Professor Scott Galloway of NYU Stern did [an interview](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/05/scott-galloway-future-of-college.html) with *The Intelligencer* and gave his predictions for higher ed (specifically elite colleges), stating:\n\n*Ultimately, universities are going to partner with companies to help them expand... Big-tech companies are about to enter education and health care in a big way, not because they want to but because they have to.*\n\nHe explained that given the increasing demand (like Harvard apps rise to 60k), elite colleges would expand their enrollment online to create cheaper classes, partnering with Big Tech companies to create \"MIT@Google, iStanford, or HarvardxFacebook.\"\n\nThis news seems to confirm his predictions, as edX, one of the biggest players in online education, has become a for-profit company. Companies edX and 2U claim that this partnership is to reduce inequality and expand education (which, there is some merit to support), but many disagree.\n\n*\u201cPhilosophically, I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s opinion has changed\u2014edX sold itself to the highest for-profit bidder,\u201d said an official at one edX partner college. \u201cBut in the cold light of realism, edX was primarily a marketing partner, and it will arguably be a better one in combination with 2U.\u201d* ([source](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2021/11/17/2u-completes-purchase-edx-creating-free-degree-platform)) Krishna Rajagopal, a former Dean at MIT, quit his position in protest. Others at MIT created a new non-profit platform with open-source MIT courses.\n\nSome courses 2U recruits for and advertises through its platform are expensive. An online master's in social work at USC cost $115,000 (the same cost as the in-person equivalent), leaving many graduates in debt.\n\nGalloway goes on: *'At universities, we\u2019re having constant meetings, and we\u2019ve all adopted this narrative of \u201cThis is unprecedented, and we\u2019re in this together,\u201d which is Latin for \u201cWe\u2019re not lowering our prices, bitches.\u201d'*\n\nHe predicts that soon, a lot of colleges will go out of business like department stores in 2018. But, it won't be T20s.\n\n*There will be a dip, the mother of all V\u2019s, among the top-50 universities, where the revenues are hit in the short run and then technology will expand their enrollments and they will come back stronger. In ten years, it\u2019s feasible to think that MIT doesn\u2019t welcome 1,000 freshmen to campus; it welcomes 10,000. What that means is the top-20 universities globally are going to become even stronger. What it also means is that universities Nos. 20 to 50 are fine. But Nos. 50 to 1,000 go out of business or become a shadow of themselves.*\n\n**So what's in it for the Big-Tech Companies?** *People ask if big tech wants to get into education and health care, and I say no, they have to get into education and health care. They have no choice.... Let\u2019s look at Apple. It does something like $250 billion a year in revenue. Apple has to convince its stockholders that its stock price will double in five years, otherwise its stockholders will go buy Salesforce or Zoom or some other stock... That means, in the next five years, Apple probably needs to increase its revenue base by $150 billion... Those big-tech companies have to turn their eyes to new prey, the list of which gets pretty short pretty fast...*\n\n**Ultimately, elite colleges are BRAND NAMES.** *The strongest brand in the world is not Apple or Mercedes-Benz or Coca-Cola. The strongest brands are MIT, Oxford, and Stanford. Academics and administrators at the top universities have decided over the last 30 years that we\u2019re no longer public servants; we\u2019re luxury goods. We get a lot of ego gratification every time our deans stand up in front of the faculty and say, \u201cThis year, we didn\u2019t reject 85 percent of applicants; we rejected 87 percent!,\u201d and there\u2019s a huge round of applause. That is tantamount to the head of a homeless shelter bragging about turning away nine of ten people who showed up last night.*\n\n**Not only that, but elite colleges are the most profitable luxury goods.** *The ultimate vehicle for a luxury item is to massively and almost artificially constrain supply. Birkin bags are $12,000 because they create the illusion of scarcity. I\u2019ll have 170 kids in my brand-strategy class in the fall. We charge them $7,000 per student. That\u2019s $1.2 million that we get for 12 nights of me in a classroom. $100,000 a night. The gross margins on that offering are somewhere between 92 and 96 points. There is no other product in the world that\u2019s been able to sustain 90-plus points of margin for this long at this high of a price point.* (And keep in mind, the bulk of those profits are *not* going to professors, whose salaries have barely increased as profits have skyrocketed.)\n\n**So, if elite colleges are just luxury brands, what's their value to students?** *Not education. It\u2019s credentialing. The most value-added part of a university is ... the admissions department. They have done a fantastic job creating the most thorough and arduous job-interview process in modern history, between the testing, the anxiety, the review of your life up until that point, the references you need. If I\u2019m applying for a job at New York Magazine, I\u2019d give you a list of references and you\u2019d call them. You don\u2019t ask the references to write a two-page letter. Universities now do background checks to see if you\u2019ve ever had a DUI or been accused of a crime. They look at your social media to see if you\u2019re abusing alcohol or if you\u2019ve made racist or bigoted statements. We\u2019re screening people like crazy.*\n\nElite colleges offer the credentials for future employers. Companies aren't allowed to use IQ tests when hiring, but the SAT test was created and designed to be a general cognitive aptitude test (although it is extremely flawed, but clearly some people still think it's useful). If you apply to JP Morgan as a Harvard graduate, you're signaling that your SAT score was in the 99.9th percentile, or in Harvard's range of 1460-1580.\n\n**Why won't most people choose to go to lower-ranked, in-person colleges, instead?** *The cruel truth of what pretends to be a meritocracy but is a caste system is that your degree largely indicates or signals your lifetime earnings. When kids get out of business school, they say, \u201cI have an offer from Amazon and I have an offer to go to work for a regional bank, and I\u2019d much rather go to work at a regional bank.\u201d I just tell them, \u201cStop wasting my time. You\u2019re going to work for Amazon.\u201d ... Going to UCLA versus Pepperdine starts you at a 10 to 30 percent higher salary coming out of school, which, over the course of your lifetime, when you add in salary increases, just creates a different life.*\n\n**So what's going to happen to campuses?** *I worry they\u2019ll still exist, but they\u2019ll be just filled with rich people. A four-year liberal-arts-campus experience is going to become something that\u2019s largely relegated and positioned to the children of rich people.*\n\nMaybe we should count ourselves lucky. These might be some of the last few years where on-campus education is still the norm, at least in the US. In a decade... who knows?",
