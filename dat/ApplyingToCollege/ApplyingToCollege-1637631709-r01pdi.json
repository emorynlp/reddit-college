  "text": "Hello A2C I am currently a junior thinking about my admissions process next year, trying to figure out my major. I was wondering if I could apply to a major at a T10 university with a higher acceptance rate and switch my major the first day of class. Help would be appreciated :)",

      "text": "Depends on the school and the major. \n\nIf you're trying to switch from Sociology to Psychology, that's one thing (although you might like Sociology if you like Psych). \n\nHowever, if you're trying to switch from the arts and sciences to engineering, well, that's a lot different (and typically harder). \n\nI wouldn't overall wouldn't recommend doing it, unless the majors are somewhat related. If you have to transfer schools within the university, that's going to make the task VERY hard.",

      "text": "applying as a major can go about three ways:\n\n1. The college has you apply to a specific school within their college. If you then want to transfer out of that school, it's probably going to be dependent on how much space there is in the desired school and the college's transfer policies\n2. The college doesn't ask for you to declare a major until sophmore year or later. then the major you apply as probably won't matter much because they know people change a lot in their first years (the majority of people change majors at some point in their college experiences)\n3. the college prioritizes people of that major for classes (cs majors get first pick on cs classes, med majors get first pick on med classes, etc.) transferring majors after the school year starts could put you behind in terms of credits because everyone has already registered for classes\n\nin conclusion: there's no significant benefit to applying as an obsure major just so you get in. espically because t10 colleges will look at how much you have done in your supposed field of interest. for example, if you say you are super interested in art history but haven't taken an art history class or done any extracirriculars related to the topic, it will show them that you aren't a strong candidate. My advice: pick a major that you are passionate about and show colleges that passion",
