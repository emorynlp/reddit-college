  "text": "Friend: Hey, can you help me with this essay?\nMe: Sure. *reads long, melodramatic essay about how my friend suffered academically junior year due to trauma from a racist incident where students from our school spray painted racial slurs on her house.\nFriend: *Is black, but has never faced racism or any real adversity in her life. What do you think?\nMe: *confused None of this ever happened.\nFriend: *Perfectly casual Well, yeah, of course not. But I had to think of a good excuse for my grades last year. Do you think it\u2019s believable?\nMe: *Becoming increasingly furious You know someone who\u2019s qualified will be rejected if this essay gets you accepted, right? You\u2019ll be taking someone\u2019s spot.\nFriend: *Stares blankly Well, yeah, it\u2019s a competition. Admissions officers expect you to come up with a sob story.\n\nWelp, by that logic, guess I should also make up a sad story about how being Latina has led to me to suffer a bunch of racism\ud83d\ude44\ud83e\uddda\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I swear if I was in your position, I\u2019d legit be throwing hands on the spot. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a girl or what not, these hands are RATED E FOR EVERYONE. SO SCREWE YOUR FRIEND",

I\u2019m way older than most of the commenters here, and far more aware of what AOs do when reading essays - and even then I\u2019m not going to pretend to know what the right course of action is for you. \n\nWhat I will say is this: inventing non-existent racial trauma for person gain is disgusting. There are lots of reasons why. It\u2019s worth asking yourself, is my friend showing me a side of herself I didn\u2019t know was there? Or is this serious lapse in judgement caused by not fully understanding the grotesque transgression this essay represents?\n\nYou aren\u2019t asking for advice on what to do in your post, and I don\u2019t know enough about your circumstances to know if you\u2019re in a position to do anything at all. That said, if you\u2019re going to stand on the sidelines while someone weaponizes stories of racial injustice for their own selfish gain, please be deliberate and thoughtful about why you make that choice.",

They are usually looking for success stories.  Students who are leading student organizations, helping their community, etc.  They aren't interested in sob stories, they are interested in adversity stories, but only if they overcame them and learned something from it and became leaders in some way.  Universities also want to see why you want to choose them over any other university.\n\nIf this person has lower grades they won't even read the statement.  If their GPA and SATs are good enough, a story about a racial incident won't grab their attention.  If this student then somehow rose to the occasion as in reached out to the city, police department, started a community education campaign, got interested in politics so she wants to get into public policy and make a difference in her community; and if she can relate it to Harvard's programming, student clubs and organizations, the professors, the research, the internships and how that will help her get to where she wants to be.  That is a different story that Harvard's admission would love to hear.\n\nShe's not going to take anyone's spot based on a sob story.",

We all know at this point that the schools have a set of standard numbers and if you don\u2019t hit that benchmark, you don\u2019t get to the next round of vetting. This is ESPECIALLY prevalent at higher schools. \n\nHonestly, good on you for not putting too much info in your post, but I\u2019m going to assume a lot of things here sorry for that. \n\nIf you best friend had a severely bad junior year, she already doesn\u2019t have the numbers for Harvard. If she just got like two Bs or something then she\u2019s being annoying about this whole thing. Writing about this incident that didn\u2019t happen is whatever, because at the end of the day it sounds like it isn\u2019t written up the the level a Harvard essay is supposed to be at. You don\u2019t wanna hear \u2018melodramatic\u2019 when you write your essay. We all fib on our essays, this one sounds like it could be a legal case, so she definitely will get clocked on it. Also, it\u2019s not like she\u2019d be ACTUALLY taking the spot of someone else who \u2018deserves it more\u2019 because it clear then that she actually worked her ass off in high school for all of her APs, Honors, IBs, and graded and whatever to get there.

She trusts you and then you you go ahead and post it on reddit. I guess you are jealous that she already completed her essays and that it is so well done. \nGo ahead and polish your essays- Im sure they re gonna be excellent as well.",

As her best friend she knows this isn\u2019t true and being around her all time, I\u2019m sure she knows how her classmates treat her. It\u2019s not an issue of race or even playing the \u201crace card\u201d as some like to say. It\u2019s an issue of flat out lying about having undergone a traumatic event that never happened",

You don't know what they are going through; you are NOT in their shoes.\n Is she in the mind of that girl to know it isn't true? \nHas she grown up in the same conditions?\nThat girl could have been through hardships and all. Be respectful towards others.\n\nPosting this crap on social media actually shows how unethical and disrespectful she is.  Instead of whining over others work focus on your essays",
