  "title:": "Should I do an extra course or an extracurricular?",
  "text": "So, I\u2019m a junior right now. I am currently volunteering at a local hospital (and hold a leadership position there), work on my school newspaper, am a master tutor for NHS peer tutoring (time commitment is negligible though), and am a retreat leader for my school. In total, I work 8hrs per week at the hospital (on the weekends mostly), 5 hrs per week on the newspaper (mostly in school), and 2 hrs per week on retreat leading. It sounds like a lot, but I have it set up where I currently have nothing to do after school tues-fri. I have straight A\u2019s and rigorous classes, so academics are not a worry for me- I feel like I need an after school activity (both for my profile and personal productivity).\n\nIn terms of sports I am sailing in the spring.\n\nMy school offers an online AP psych course through BYU that I can do after school. It shows up on my transcript with a grade, but it is not considered in my GPA. I am considering majoring in psych currently, and I want to know more about it before I choose that major. Important to note that my school does not offer an AP psych class itself, just BYU.\n\nI am split between this and another extra curricular. What do you think would look better on a college app- extra course outside of school or extracurricular?",
