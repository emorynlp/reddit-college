  "text": "I took the SAT on October 13, but the scores don\u2019t come out until November 3rd. I\u2019m applying to Brown ED, and while I have a score from a previous test that I am going to submit, I am confident that I improved my math score on the Oct 13 test. I emailed Brown\u2019s admissions office, and they told me they would take scores from up to the latest October test date. Does that mean there\u2019s a way to submit my Oct 13 score for ED?",

You'll have your scores this week.",
