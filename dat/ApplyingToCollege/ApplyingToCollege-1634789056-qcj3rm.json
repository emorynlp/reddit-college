  "text": "I an determined to ED to Northeastern and it is my dream school. However, both of my parents disagree and won\u2019t support the decision. They want me to EA or RD. I an considering EA but if I do decide that I am dead set on ED is there a way around needing your parents to sign the ED agreement?\n\nEdit: regardless of what school I go to I would be supporting myself financially and would not be relying on them. Money isn\u2019t the problem they are just dead set on me needing to go to an ivy even though after extensive research and talking to several professionals I\u2019ve confirmed that an ivy would not work for me and Northeastern gives me a much higher chance of success and is a way better fit for me.",

          "text": "We are very poor so our taxes with fafsa alone reduce tuition to less than 10k because Northeastern offers really great need based aid, and the rest I can pay off with my job and scholarships that I\u2019ve accumulated. I do gain benefits from them through our financial situation but that is the only way they would be contributing. Worst case even with the least possible aid I\u2019d get I would only have to take out about 4k in loans a year and that is well worth it to me and I\u2019m in a position to be able to easily pay those off during undergrad itself.",
