      "text": "The swag request emails *have* been getting out of hand lately.  When it's the copy-pasted message sent to 400 schools asking for \"paraphernalia\" or the email titled \"sending emails from a spreadsheet\" also sent to 400 schools, those are pretty standard.  \n\nThe thing about the swag requests you gotta understand, sometimes people are just outrageously lying and it's honestly disheartening to see.  \n\nLike, do you want a free t-shirt so bad you email 400 schools with \"I attended your school last year and forgot my sweatshirt\" and it's even sent from your high school email account?  \n\nDo you want a free t-shirt so bad you say it was, and I wish I were joking with this one, you say it was your sister's dying wish before she passed from COVID-19 to have a shirt from 400 colleges?\n\nMost of these emails I have filtered out because trying to slog through a dozen emails with no subject or with just someone's name or some variation of \"an unusual request\" is frustrating.  Literally anything with \"merch\" \"t-shirt\" or even \"my address is\" gets sent to another folder.  But that's because I don't have to read them.  My colleagues do read through them ALL on the off chance that someone has a real question -- and it takes up hours from our work day.  Hours that we could otherwise be using to get people who have applied through our system.\n\nI know you get bombarded with emails from colleges all the time.  I remember applying to college.  I *get it*.  But the thing is, you sign up for those emails.  You can unsubscribe at any time.  **We can't unsub from you**.  And we don't want to unsub from you because there are so many of y'all with sincere interest and questions.\n\nWe keep getting these disingenuous emails that are so robotic, so unpersonalized, sometimes even straight up mean! (Had someone reply to our own cut and paste reply with \"I didn't want a *t-shirt* I specifically requested *sweatpants*\" like, wtf man)\n\nObviously I can't stop you from doing anything.  But just realize, there are real people behind email addresses, even if they seem like faceless machines.\n\nOh, and if the person who just sent their PayPal link reads this: that was the best one haha. Cut out the middle man, don't even bother with a shirt.  Galaxy brain right there",
