      "text": "If im not mistaken, there is a section of the common app that wants you to talk about how covid affected you (if it did at all). In the additional information section you could write it there as well. Imo just be direct. You dont need a fancy essay about how you overcame family financial difficulties, death by pandemic, etc. state it straight up. They want to know how to adequately judge you based on ur circumstances\n\n\"I had issues maintining my focus during school because of my family's financial situations. I've made up my schoolwork since then, have tackled a new job to help with finances, but it had still heavily affected my performance during junior year.\"\n\nBut please correct me if im wrong",

          "text": "This is correct. The COVID-19 additional information section (and the normal additional information section, for that matter) isn't another essay, it's a place to state any circumstances that affected you as an applicant that weren't reflected in the rest of the application. \n\nI think OP may be talking about writing the Common App essay on something related to COVID-19. This is not recommended because it will be very difficult to write without either being clich\u00e9 (\"the coronavirus may have caused a lot of problems for other people, but it wasn't so bad for me because it gave me the chance to do x thing, which taught me y lesson\") or sounding like you're just complaining about the problems it caused for you.",

              "text": "No I actually meant about the Covid 19 prompt in the additional writing section. Does it only have to be about obstacles I have faced/overcome? I started an initiative in my neighbourhood to give out home cooked meals to the less unfortunates. Is this something I can mentiom in the essay?",

The initiative you started is a great accomplishment, and you should list it in your EC list and maybe talk about it in another essay if you want, but not in the COVID-19 additional information section.",
