  "text": "TW, potentially a few sensitive topics.\n\nI will try and put this as simply as possible. I did not have good grades last year. I\u2019m a senior boy, very ADHD, have gotten through school on memory, comprehension and speaking with teachers most of my life. Last year I was incorrectly medicated and struggling online already. When my school went back in person, I was not permitted to go with them. Obviously, already a suboptimal situation, one which I feel fine briefly mentioning in the COVID-19 question. The complicating element, which truthfully was the largest individual factor affecting my academic performance, was the abusive relationship I was in at the time. She was the only social contact I was permitted. She would coerce me into things I didn\u2019t want to do, delete messages from my parents, scream at me for breathing the wrong way (literally) etc. She was in and out of the hospital for SH and ED. She expected me to be at her house every day, every hour I didn\u2019t have school. She would implore me to lie to my parents, or do so herself. She implicitly threatened self harm to get me to spend more time with her, and continually yelled at me that it wasn\u2019t enough and her mental health was worse for it. It was already five hours a day minimum. If I said I had work, she would suggest I do it there and become irate if I disagreed, but if I tried to do it there she would likewise become furious. On an average day, I would receive a text or call as soon as she knew my last class was done, arguing with me to come over immediately. When I wanted to leave, she would pick an argument on some minute action or a trait about myself and intensify it past midnight to get me to stay (admitted herself.)\n\n\nI don\u2019t really feel like continuing. In general, it was just hell. I had really no ability, time or bandwidth to do well in school. I\u2019m also ashamed of it, and feel like I\u2019m exaggerating/lying. I haven\u2019t talked to my counselor, parents etc. about it, the latter at least never in full detail. In regards to applications, I don\u2019t know what to do. I really appreciate any advice.",
