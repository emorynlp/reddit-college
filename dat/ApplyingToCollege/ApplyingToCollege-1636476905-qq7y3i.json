  "title:": "Made a mistake on CSS profile - How to submit correction?",
  "text": "I've actually been quite proactive on the financial aid process - I've done extensive research and planning, and even submitted both my FAFSA and CSS forms on 10/2, having gone through all the details with my mom. I had asked her to prepare all documents (house value, mortgage, loans, all other assets). \n\nIt was only after I submitted both forms and was going through my mom's official documents for the IDOC did I realize that my mom neglected to provide me information on her stocks (apparently she bought fractional shares twenty odd years ago and forgot about it until now), and because of the recent rallies on the stock market due to 2020, the amount which I left out on my forms is actually quite considerable. (Prior to getting the official stock statement from her broker my mom swore that the value is 'negligible')\n\nI know it's relatively easy to submit a FAFSA correction, but what about a CSS correction? There is a button on the CSS profile page for me to correct information on the CSS profile, but I did some digging across the internet that said to print out the profile, handwrite any corrections, and email the scanned document to each school (and it is in fact what some schools like USC ask for). Unfortunately the information for the schools that I'm actually applying for aren't very clear on how to submit corrections. Would this be something that I need to email each individual school about? Does anyone on this forum have any idea/experience towards this kind of stuff?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRANT: GOD DAMMIT WHY IS IT SO FUCKING STRESSFUL TO DO FINANCIAL AID APPLICATIONS!!! I've been more stressed about school work and everything before, but I at least know how to improve my academics and everything (study more). But all this financial stuff is a completely different level. Well whatever. Better the pain now than being buried in debt 5 years later........",
