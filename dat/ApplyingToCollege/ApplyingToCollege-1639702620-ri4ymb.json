  "text": "I got a status update today saying that they saw some strengths, but they needed more information before a decision. I applied to Seattle University which has an 83.2 acceptance rate. The average gpa is a 3.6. I have a 3.9 gpa and lots of extracurriculars. My cousin and brother applied regular decision and they got in. \n\nI\u2019m so confused why they want more information and to send mid year transcripts in",
