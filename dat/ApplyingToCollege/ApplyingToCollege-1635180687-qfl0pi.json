  "text": "So, my school basically has never had ppl applying to US and hence they assume everything works the UCAS way. I legit had to file an application just to get my LORs. Why, just why. Also, I had to fight it out with the staff to actually receive the LORs from teachers I know. They wanted to send a fill-in-the-blank style generic LOR for all my subjects.
