      "text": ">The University of California has slammed the door shut on using any standardized test for admissions decisions, announcing Thursday that faculty could find no alternative exam that would avoid the biased results that led leaders to scrap the SAT last year.  \n>  \n>After a year of study, faculty leaders recommended in February 2020 that UC continue using the exams for admissions, citing data in a highly anticipated report showing that standardized tests may actually help boost enrollment of disadvantaged students.  \n  \n>  \n>But that controversial conclusion set off a flurry of countervailing pressures, including a report attacking the faculty recommendations. In May 2020, the regents ultimately voted to eliminate SAT and ACT testing requirements.  \n>  \n>The Smarter Balanced test only provided \u201cmodest incremental value\u201d beyond high school grades in predicting a student\u2019s first-year UC performance while \u201creflecting and reproducing inequality\u201d in educational opportunities for underserved students, committee co-chair Mary Gauvain, a UC Riverside professor, told regents on Thursday. Using the state exam in admissions decisions could benefit some underrepresented students who test well but have lower grades, the committee report found, but would disproportionately favor Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and could reduce admission rates of Black, Latino and low-income applicants.  \nTony Alpert, Smarter Balanced executive director, did not comment on the findings that the test reflected racial and economic disparities. But he said in a statement that he was excited about working with UC to use Smarter Balanced\u2019s tools to help improve teaching and learning. The faculty said the state assessment could be used, for instance, to help place students in writing classes after admission to UC.  \nBut the committee could find no alternative UC admissions test without the broader problems, Gauvain told regents.",

When they claimed they would look for a test that was better, or create their own, pretty much everyone saw this as a pretense for getting rid of testing.\n\nIt was clear from the leadership ignoring the advice of the educators and experts that recommended continuing with the tests that they had only one objective, with no interest in a fact-based analysis.",

Because they don't have enough time to prepare, unlike rich kids, they may score much lower. There's so much more that goes into being low-income. It's not just about prep. And the way you spoke just shows how privileged you are. Some kids work 40hour weeks to help their families out. Others might not even have access to computers or reliable internet. It's that narrow-minded thinking that is truly fucking up this world. You're making it seem like low-income kids don't have it hard. Fuck this bullshit. Bye.",

The answers are also not subject to teacher biases (which may be more prevalent in low-income students) or grade inflation/deflation.

I live in a low income rural area and even here you can go to your local public library and get free internet and computer access. Same deal for school.

Affluent students definitely have more opportunities than low-income students, don't get me wrong, but SATs at least give low-income students a chance to play on the same field as their wealthy peers.\n\nDo people know how much extracurriculars cost? How much having a dedicated hobby costs? How much time you have to spend managing club activities, volunteering, etc. when many students need work away their entire evenings? Kids who have money to spend get the opportunity to *participate* in those extracurriculars, while low-income students are put at an extreme disadvantage for not being able to commit. There's also the issue of inequality between schools and how teachers hand out grades...\n\nStudying for the SAT does not need to include expensive textbooks, mock tests, and official study material. I literally studied one month before my test, 2 hours per week, by using CollegeBoard's online resources and my old algebra homework. Didn't even touch an SAT prep book. Many schools are also paying for first time SATs, so if you're lucky enough to attend those schools, low-income students won't even have to pay for their test. It's a one-time fee otherwise. Pennies in comparison to how much time and money students need to invest into ECs. \n\nStandardized tests like the SAT aren't perfect by any means, but at least they're more attainable to low-income students than a strictly holistic approach.",

What's realistic for them to do the best that they can with college apps. Nobody is even considering the fact that maybe, just maybe, there are low-income students just trying to get through the system without needing to struggle for equality everyone knows will never exist. Equality is utopian. \n\nAbolishing standardized testing will only make things worse for low income families. If you take away a pillar and add 10 smaller ones in its place, it's the affluent student who has the resources to climb all of them while the poor student struggles with managing even one. The more decisions deviate from standardization, the easier it is for wealthy families to manipulate smaller factors in their favor. They have the privilege to involve themselves in things that a poor student working 40 hours a week can't even dream of joining, nevermind compete against. \n\nAnd nobody's even talking about the gas cost when it comes to travelling for the ECs lol",

It's very easy for private schools in other countries to do stuff like inflating grades so atleast with the SATs, the playing field becomes fair. I've literally seen how it helps in my country, where without SAT scores, poor me would not look as good as kids from expensive private schools where grade inflation is huge.

Any other system in which attendance rate is equal across income groups conditional on test scores would accomplish the same thing.\n\n> First, we find that low- and middle-income students attend selective schools at much lower rates than their peers from richer families with the same test scores.  As a result, simply equalizing attendance rates across parental income groups conditional on test scores would reduce the under-representation of low-income students at selective schools by 38%.\n\n> Second, at the most selective schools (Ivy-plus), the middle class is heavily under-represented relative to others with the same test scores; equalizing attendance rates conditional on test scores would increase the fraction of such students from 28% to 38%, about 30% of the way to the \u201call college goer\u201d benchmark.\u00a0 However, doing the same for low-income students would only increase their share from 3.8% to 4.4% of the class, closing just 6% of the gap.\n\nAdditionally:\n\n> Prior work shows large gaps in the expected outcomes of college students from high- and low-income families; equalizing attendance rates for students with the same test scores would reduce the outcome gap by 15%.\n\n https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/undermatching/\n\nedit: changed admissions to enrollment to be consistent with the study's findings, my previous statement was incorrect. I had confused attendance rate with admission rate; as the authors in the study note, there is no data regarding admission rates by income group conditional on SAT scores. The disparity in attendance rate by income group conditional on SAT scores could be due to a disparity in application, admission, or matriculation rate by income group conditional on SAT scores (or any combination of the three). Hence, increasing the importance of SAT scores in admissions would probably benefit low and middle income students, but maybe not.",

Based on this fact, I claimed that increasing the importance of the SAT in admissions would increase the proportion of low and middle income students at elite unis, though I never claimed that the SAT *should* be more important in college admissions (I'm not sure).\n\nEdit: my claim may or may not be correct. I had confused attendance rate with admission rate. You are correct that I misinterpreted the quotes I cited from the study, though my claim may or may not be true anyways (I didn't read the whole study, it's 112 pages long, maybe they mention something about admission rates by income group conditional on SAT scores somewhere else idk).",

                              "text": "For UC admissions, there is one application, but students have to select (and pay if no fee waiver) each one they want to apply to. In a way, it\u2019s the common app, UC version. Each UC however has different admission criteria that often frustrates applicants because no one knows the secret sauce, and admissions seem unpredictable once kids meet some minimum requirements (read over past years\u2019 acceptance threads \u2014 kids were outraged last season, but guess what, they were also baffled when the UCs looked at SATs). This is also true for t10s; unless a kid has done something incredibly unusual or amazing, it\u2019s hard to predict if and which t10s will send out acceptances. \n\nYou have a valid point tho about the UC dataset; it could be different at Ivies+. Recent reporting from the NYT shows that most kids at the Ivies are well-off. The stats also show (in the reference you linked earlier) that poor children, while not represented as much as they could be, also attend. It\u2019s the middle class that is poorly represented at elite schools. I would guess most of the middle class squeeze comes from inadequate financial aid and has less to do with SAT or GPA.\n\n6 of the 9 undergrad UCs are at t40 or better (and the lowest ranked is still around t100). In the UCs, it turns out that the highest ranked UCs have the most income inequality. It will be interesting to see how those numbers look over the next few years with test-blind in place. \n\nIn the UC data set, GPA was correlated but *much* less than the SAT to socioeconomic factors. The arguments on here that GPA reflects SES is true, but it\u2019s to a *much* lesser degree.\n\nThe real question is why keep the SAT. It used to correlate with intelligence better, but as it\u2019s been redesigned again and again, it correlates less and less. IQ is not supposed to go up or down dramatically, yet on this same thread we have kids proud of all the hours they put in at Khan to significantly boost their score. The article you linked doesn\u2019t address this or the changes to the test to correlate less at all. Maybe if all students had no idea what was on the test and no one could prepare, it would correlate better, but older versions of the test used to be trickier & could be gamed a little more with strategy/ability to figure something out vs knowledge. \n\nThe next point, is it a predictor of college success? I linked in another comment an opinion piece by the Dean of Admissions at WPI:\n\nhttps://hechingerreport.org/opinion-the-power-of-unfair-standardized-tests-is-finally-thankfully-diminishing/\n\n\u201cWPI\u2019s student data since adopting the test-optional admissions policy in 2007 shows no significant difference between test score submitters and non-submitters in retention or graduation rates \u2014 two of the most important student success metrics in higher education. If the test scores aren\u2019t needed to make good admissions decisions but do reinforce inequality, why would universities continue to include them \u2014 even optionally \u2014 within their selection processes?\u201d \n\nInterestingly, in the paper you quoted, the only research referenced to back up the claim that the SAT helps predict college success is by the College Board. \n\nI\u2019d also like to point out the obvious: a big factor in college success is unsurprisingly income. It\u2019s a lot easier to be successful when you don\u2019t have to work a lot of hours or stress out about food & shelter (the number of college students with housing insecurity is shocking). While obviously academic ability is important, some of it is circumstance. If one doesn\u2019t correct for things like this, I bet the SAT is predictive. \n\nI used to think that an income correction would balance admissions, and if you were to actually look at some of the research I linked, it does help. It would be a positive step, but it doesn\u2019t help completely. \n\nThat researcher at Berkeley I linked would provide you additional perspective if you take time to read it.",

Of course, the best predictive validity came from SAT combined with GPA. The worst predictive validity came from using only GPA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor instance, among students admitted with SAT scores below 700, 35% left UC after only one year and only 50% graduated within seven years; among students admitted with SAT scores above 1400, only 3% were not retained past freshman year and 92% graduated within seven years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor any given high school GPA, a student admitted with a low SAT score is between two and five times more likely to drop out after one year, and up to three times less likely to complete their degree compared to a student with a high score.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTurns out people who do well on the SAT tend to do well in college. High SAT scores are hard to achieve in means other than high ability. Again, it's no wonder the UC task force advised against getting rid of the tests.\n\n[https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/\\_files/underreview/sttf-report.pdf](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/underreview/sttf-report.pdf)",

I used to like the tests myself, actually, because like a2c, I did well on both the SAT and GRE. By the time I took my GRE though, I started to have some test skepticism (darn those classes making me think about what something measures), and that has evolved into not supporting use of the tests. \n\nThe article mentions, but does not go into detail, the criticisms of the original faculty report. I will quote the relevant part from the article since it\u2019s behind a paywall: \n\n\u201cWhen demographics such as family income and parent education level are included in the prediction model, the results reverse and **high school grades are actually shown to be more influential than the SAT or ACT,** according to Geiser's analysis, which was based on data presented in an appendix to the task force report. \n\nTest scores are much more closely correlated with family income and education than high school grades, he said.\n\n**His conclusion parallels similar findings in numerous other studies** and underscores the need, he said, to drop the tests because the cost to disadvantaged students outweighs any limited benefit in helping UC campuses decide who will succeed if admitted.\u201d\n\n**bold is my emphasis**\n\nI hope you guys notice that Geiser used the data from the report that recommended the SAT to discredit it! Really, that the first report didn\u2019t look at obvious confounding factors & variable bias is an academic shame \u2014 all researchers should know to do this. \n\nIn addition to not being more predictive than GPA, I also think it\u2019s a huge time waster. You know what I\u2019d rather see kids do? Read a book. Play around with code. Play sports or enjoy nature. Do fulfilling ECs. And **if a student is poor, they might work a part time job or help family (jobs really are the most overlooked EC).** Studying for the SAT teaches one to be good at the SAT, which other than for college admissions, is not useful compared to other activities. \n\nAnother point frequently brought up is that without the SAT, how do schools deal with grade inflation that varies across schools, but don\u2019t you guys know, this being app season, that\u2019s what school reports are for??? If you go to a school with grade deflation, that\u2019s accounted for by overall lower grades at your school reflected on the school report. At the UCs, they don\u2019t take individual school reports, but they have data on most CA schools regarding GPA, and they adjust that at regular intervals, which accounts for inflation/deflation. That in fact is how they determine the statewide top 9% guarantee for UC admission (Merced). \n\nOthers have made this point, but I\u2019d also like to emphasize it: time is a huge factor in test prep. Time *is* privilege. Some of you may be poor, but some poor kids have parents that insist upon them studying and making top grades. Contrast that to another poor student who has to take care of younger siblings or work or deal with abuse. They don\u2019t have the same time to put into Kahn et al. \n\nNow, it is true that the leftover factors looked at by college AOs are not inherently fair, either, but why keep one which doesn\u2019t add to the equation when family income and parental education are taken into account? \n\nThe UCs have the prerogative to test out test blind. They can monitor how students admitted with test blind policies compare to prior years with test scores. If it\u2019s a total disaster, I\u2019m sure they will modify admissions policies, but other schools have looked at how students perform who submit scores vs not, and they haven\u2019t found a significant difference:\n\n\u201cWPI\u2019s student data since adopting the test-optional admissions policy in 2007 shows no significant difference between test score submitters and non-submitters in retention or graduation rates \u2014 two of the most important student success metrics in higher education. \u201c\n\nhttps://hechingerreport.org/opinion-the-power-of-unfair-standardized-tests-is-finally-thankfully-diminishing/\n\nAs you can see by the wall of text, this is something I feel is supported both by data and a sense of fairness. It sucked last year for applicants who had studied hard to get top scores only to learn that those amazing scores wouldn\u2019t be considered, but this year, nothing has changed for the UCs.",

For instance, many highschool teachers in Egypt will lower your grades if you don't take private lessons with them. This doesn't extend to senior year grades simply because the teacher has no control over those, but when your GPA is based on years 9 to 12 this can be disastrous.\n\nStandardized tests, despite all their flaws, have one undeniable advantage: they're completely objective, there's no factor affecting your grades on the test other than how well you do on the test. Now of course this is impacted by how well you *prepare* for the test and how much time you have to do so, but you can't buy or connect your way into a stellar score like you can with ECs and GPA (thanks to private tutoring, which is much more effective for GPA than standardized tests).\n\nWhile standardized tests can do better to help low income applicants, the concept of a location and curriculum-independent test is as close to objective judgement as we're ever going to get.",

Wealthier schools have WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY more of them and wealthier students have way more time for it. Essays? It's possible to get tutors for that with a MUCH higher benefit than SAT tutors.\n\nIt's possible for a poor person to work for a better SAT score. It may be much harder to come up with the money and time to study, but it is possible. What are you supposed to do if your school doesn't have many ECs and has no funding to create more? What if you don't have time, as ECs are a much more difficult time commitment than studying for the SAT. You can't look at just grades because of the sheer number of people with 4.0 UW GPAs.\n\nThe entire system means that poor students are disadvantaged in college admissions. But getting rid of the SAT eliminates one of the only ways to overcome that system right out of high school.",

They also likely have easier access economically to certain extra curricular activities that have a hefty cost. \n- Thus, there really isn\u2019t a point in taking one thing off that a rich kid might have an advantage of, when the rich kid would have an advantage on a lot of other parts of the application too. Overall, I think the only thing that could be considered to take off an application is demographics like race, gender, and name. In my opinion, having the household income and knowing what classes the school offers / what kind of school they go to, covers the differences there",

Lol). Standardized tests absolutely don\u2019t work for everyone and they have had too much weight in the past, but some people like me do well on those types of tests and would like them to be considered because I\u2019m proud of my score and think it helps me. That\u2019s where I think a test optional system is best. If you don\u2019t submit a score it\u2019s simply not a part of your application and has no negative effect, and if you do submit a score they\u2019ll consider it. My parents were gonna make me take a test anyway and I spent time studying for it so I\u2019d like schools to acknowledge that.\n\nWhat I do like about test-blind admissions though is that it encourages kids to spend their times doing something other than studying for these tests. My parents are still giving SO much weight to them and are making me do more than I want to for them. I took the ACT in October and got a 33, and I figured I would take it one more time just to raise my score by a point for the Ivies im applying to. My parents are also making my take the SAT in December though which is completely useless and will only make it harder to keep my grades up and study for the ACT at the same time. My parents grew up under a system where the test was required and different schools only took one of the tests, and maybe test-blind policies will show them that times are changing and that we\u2019re moving towards an educational system where it\u2019s simply not worth it to make kids spend a ridiculous amount of time studying for these tests. That\u2019s all not mentioning the fact that socioeconomic status plays a big role in whether or not you can get a good score.\n\nFinally, taking away test scores just seems like a band-aid covering a much larger wound: the entire application system benefits rich people. If a poor person does well on a standardized test but has trouble submitting homework on time because they work part-time jobs, it kind of sucks that they can\u2019t submit scores. It ignores the larger issue",

Kids who aren\u2019t the best of the best but are still smart enough for AP might even have lower GPAs than some straight honors kids. But at the same time, SAT is also biased. I got a 1380 my first time around, but because of my financial circumstance I was able to get tutoring and get it up to a 1520. That seems unfair to kids who weren\u2019t able to get the same tutoring opportunities I was. Then again, essays are massively effected by wealth. Though I didn\u2019t have tutors, my family is highly educated and has helped me tremendously with the articulation of my essays. People with a less educated family may have it worst when it comes to learning how to properly convey a message. In the end, there is no way of winning, but just from a personal perspective I think having a test optional ability is the best option, not necessarily removing it entirely, because in my opinion, SAT scores are determined by your ability to do the test, not actual skills. I\u2019m very good at math and absolute dog at english, but I still managed a 750 by learning how to answer question.",
