      "text": ">The University of California has slammed the door shut on using any standardized test for admissions decisions, announcing Thursday that faculty could find no alternative exam that would avoid the biased results that led leaders to scrap the SAT last year.  \n>  \n>After a year of study, faculty leaders recommended in February 2020 that UC continue using the exams for admissions, citing data in a highly anticipated report showing that standardized tests may actually help boost enrollment of disadvantaged students.  \n  \n>  \n>But that controversial conclusion set off a flurry of countervailing pressures, including a report attacking the faculty recommendations. In May 2020, the regents ultimately voted to eliminate SAT and ACT testing requirements.  \n>  \n>The Smarter Balanced test only provided \u201cmodest incremental value\u201d beyond high school grades in predicting a student\u2019s first-year UC performance while \u201creflecting and reproducing inequality\u201d in educational opportunities for underserved students, committee co-chair Mary Gauvain, a UC Riverside professor, told regents on Thursday. Using the state exam in admissions decisions could benefit some underrepresented students who test well but have lower grades, the committee report found, but would disproportionately favor Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and could reduce admission rates of Black, Latino and low-income applicants.  \nTony Alpert, Smarter Balanced executive director, did not comment on the findings that the test reflected racial and economic disparities. But he said in a statement that he was excited about working with UC to use Smarter Balanced\u2019s tools to help improve teaching and learning. The faculty said the state assessment could be used, for instance, to help place students in writing classes after admission to UC.  \nBut the committee could find no alternative UC admissions test without the broader problems, Gauvain told regents.",

Because they don't have enough time to prepare, unlike rich kids, they may score much lower. There's so much more that goes into being low-income. It's not just about prep. And the way you spoke just shows how privileged you are. Some kids work 40hour weeks to help their families out. Others might not even have access to computers or reliable internet. It's that narrow-minded thinking that is truly fucking up this world. You're making it seem like low-income kids don't have it hard. Fuck this bullshit. Bye.",

The answers are also not subject to teacher biases (which may be more prevalent in low-income students) or grade inflation/deflation.

I live in a low income rural area and even here you can go to your local public library and get free internet and computer access. Same deal for school.

It's very easy for private schools in other countries to do stuff like inflating grades so atleast with the SATs, the playing field becomes fair. I've literally seen how it helps in my country, where without SAT scores, poor me would not look as good as kids from expensive private schools where grade inflation is huge.

Of course, the best predictive validity came from SAT combined with GPA. The worst predictive validity came from using only GPA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor instance, among students admitted with SAT scores below 700, 35% left UC after only one year and only 50% graduated within seven years; among students admitted with SAT scores above 1400, only 3% were not retained past freshman year and 92% graduated within seven years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor any given high school GPA, a student admitted with a low SAT score is between two and five times more likely to drop out after one year, and up to three times less likely to complete their degree compared to a student with a high score.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTurns out people who do well on the SAT tend to do well in college. High SAT scores are hard to achieve in means other than high ability. Again, it's no wonder the UC task force advised against getting rid of the tests.\n\n[https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/\\_files/underreview/sttf-report.pdf](https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/underreview/sttf-report.pdf)",

In fact, household income has a higher correlation to essays than it does to the SAT. By your logic then, essays should've been eliminated over the SAT. \n\nBetter support systems should be put in place for lower-income students that doesn't involve eliminating valid and effective admission criterion.",

I\u2019m not really on their side either, as I don\u2019t know how this will affect them. I just think people here are massively overvaluing what a good SAT score means. My original post was saying that rich people do get an advantage in the SAT, which you admitted is true. So we agree!\n\nAnd essays are kind of stupid too, at least in the probable way they\u2019re evaluated by admissions officers. Everyone thinks they need to write all flowery and shit and they\u2019re even more easily tutored for. I wouldn\u2019t be opposed to changing the way they\u2019re looked at either.",
