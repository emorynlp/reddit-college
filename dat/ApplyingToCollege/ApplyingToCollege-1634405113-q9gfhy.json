  "text": "Hi guys! I\u2019m planning to apply to Brown University for a science major. I\u2019ve been playing the viola for about 7 years but I am not really confident in my playing. My sister says that I should submit a music supplement because it would be weird if I say that I\u2019ve played it for 7 years but chose not to take advantage of their art supplements. But, I heard that it can be detrimental if I\u2019m not AMAZING at my instrument, and I\u2019m planning to include clips of me playing in the video portfolio. Is my sister right? Will the AO find it weird?",

          "text": "I disagree. When you send in a music supplement it gets sent to the music professors at that university, and they rate it on a scale. The aos usually do not even look at it as they know that their music knowledge is limited. If the professors rate the score low, it can even harm your application. Only send if you are confident in your ability. This is coming from a former juilliard precollege student applying to unis.",
