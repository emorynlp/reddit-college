  "text": "So I was finalizing my application for my early actions, and I saw in the recommendations and FERPA part that my counselor has uploaded my transcript, but for the teachers, at least for the ones I've added for that college show \"teacher evaluation: not started\"\nSo I asked them if they got the mail yet and she said no. So will they get the email to upload the lor after I've payed and submitted my common applications?\nOr am I missing something",
