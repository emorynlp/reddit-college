  "text": "I have 1500 SAT - 700 RW and 800 M\n\nI am an international student and English is my second language. I tried really hard, but my score doesnt seem to improve.\n\nSO I want to go to DUKE, desperately. Should I go test optional?\n\n\" Reading and Writing 720-770, Math 760-800 \"\n\nThis is the sat score range. It's 1480 - 1570 and I'm 1500, which is higher than lowest 25%. But my RW score is below the 25%. I heard that international students have to get at least 1530 to get into T20s. \n\nCan anyone help? Some say that I can just submit 1500, but most of my friends and school counselor recommended me to go test optional...",

              "text": "I think the risk is worse not submitting it.\n\nIf not submitting will seem like you are hiding something, they would probably assume it was  worse than a 1500, as 1500 is atleast above their 25th percentile.\n\nSAT scores, GPA, and rigor are more so qualifiers for admission, not so much an aspect of strength or lack thereof in an application. A 1500 will not be looked at much differently from a 1530, maybe even a 1550, and it certainly qualifies you for admission.",
