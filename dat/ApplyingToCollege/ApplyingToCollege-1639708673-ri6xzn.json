  "text": "So, I was deffered and I got some questions for those of you who know\n\n\n\nWhen should I send a letter of continued interest?\n\nFor supplemental materials, specifically musical but other things as well, can they be submitted still and if so, does the slideroom portal accept them if I was an rea? Also does slideroom have a waiver?\n\nWould you recommend an additional letter? I already submitted 3 teacher letters, would it be best to send one that comes from a career and tech background or academic? Thoughts?\n\nDefferal rates? Rejection rates? Rea rejection rates? Rea  deferral admitted rates?\n\nAnything I should be including that I haven't thought of?\n\n\n\nThank you guys and good luck with your applications!",
