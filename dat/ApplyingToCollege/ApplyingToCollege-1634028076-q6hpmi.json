      "text": "name a book; briefly describe what the book is about; say how it challenged a perspective you had on the world/society -- what was your understanding beforehand, what information in the book opened your eyes (little details? a specific story in the book? the viewpoint the book was written from?) \n\nthe book could be either fiction or non-fiction, i think the question is looking into your abilities to pull themes from a work as well as get an idea of your personality -- what is complex to you? What nuances do you pull out of literature? (And ofc it's also testing your ability to write something concisely)",
