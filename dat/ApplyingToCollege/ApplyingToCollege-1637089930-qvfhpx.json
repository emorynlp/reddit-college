  "title:": "i don't know how to feel or think after hearing my grandfather passed away",
  "text": "I heard this morning that my grandfather passed away. I don't know when. I only know how. Unexpected heart attack. He was such a healthy person, but I guess someone can be too healthy. He always went to his local senior/community center to meet up with his friends and hike up mountains. He was in the shower and the sudden temperature change might have contributed to it. \n\nIt was 7:28 in the morning. My mom has been begging me to wake up and get ready to go to school. \"Five more minutes.\" She got a phone call from my uncle. He doesn't call usually so my mom was worried and excited to talk to him. I was in and out of consciousness until I heard her choke up and ask repeatedly, \"What are you talking about? What do you mean?\" My sister was silent, she's usually so talkative. I was so tired this morning but just pure panic made me throw my covers away and stalk up to her. \n\nMy mom waved for me to get ready as she cried. I wanted to know. But I still heard: \"What do you mean Father passed away?\" \n\nIt felt like some cheap joke, a slap in the face. He was so healthy. Fuck, I even talked to him just a few days ago. I remember slumping against our piano and dry heaving. I couldn't stop crying. I was so selfish this morning when my mom and my sister both felt the loss. My sister, my poor sister, she came up to me and hug me. That small fucker is not affectionate yet she still put aside her confusion to comfort me. \n\nI felt so angry. Powerless. And fucking hurt. He never got to see me graduate high school. He never got to know where I committed to college. He fucking promised me that he would be there when I graduated law school, he would be there when I get married to the love of my life, be there when I'm inaugurated as the president of the United States. But he's gone before he got to see his favorite granddaughter change the world. \n\nHe had high expectations for me. He knew I was going to do something remarkable. It never felt like pressure, it felt like a guiding hand for me. And now he's gone. \n\nIt feels so surreal. I was fortunate enough to never have experienced loss but it feels like fucking shit that the first person to leave me was my closest grandfather. Someone who I called everyday. But also someone who I had to brush off because I was working on college applications this weekend. I'm so angry I didn't say goodbye. And I'm so angry that he had to die alone, no matter how peacefully, without his favorite daughter of granddaughters by his side. \n\nI'm so angry that I can't go say my final goodbyes because he lives in Korea. I'm just so fucking angry that the next time I see him, it will be to light incense in front of a large mound on his family's plot in the mountains. \n\nMy grandfather passed away.\n\nMy grandfather passed away.\n\nNo matter how many times I say it. No matter how many different ways I say it: clinically or in Korean. I can't believe it. I miss him. A lot already.",

      "text": "the exact same thing happened word for word to me during May. He was also my closest grandparent and it was the first time I ever experienced a loss like that. Completely unexpected and he was also exceptionally healthy. He played golf every morning and was 74 years old. He didn't have diabetes or hypertension either. One morning I wake up and he's gone. It hurts for a long time and the pain never goes away but it does get better. Wishing you the best of luck and always remember that he will be with you wherever you go.",

I am also applying to colleges and it was his absolute dream to see me attend a prestigious school. I know it hurts a lot. I can only begin to imagine your pain because for me even a year later, it still hurts. You should carry on for him. Make him proud because no matter where he is, he will always be looking out for you. Take care!",
