  "text": "In need of that fat aid from unis, since im a low income citizen living abroad (I'm domestic everywhere, I don't qualify for in-state anywhere). Whenever I look for colleges that give good aid it always gives me T20s. I know T20s would probably give the best aid, but realistically, i'm not getting into a T20, they are all high reaches for me. \n\nPlaces that i'd specifically like to know about are unis in California and Hawaii, however anywhere in the States is fine.\n\nAnything helps, thanks",

USF, Texas Tech, Iowa State are a few examples.",
