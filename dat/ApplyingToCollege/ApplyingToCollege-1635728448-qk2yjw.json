  "text": "So, I'm an international student and the whole CSS profile process is overwhelming. What type to documents to send to the AO/Financial Aid to qualify for a CSS fee waiver? $25 plus $16 is really expensive in my currency. I'm going to ask if they accept ISFAA as well. I don't want to put my parents to burden because they suffered a huge loss on their income plus their support my grandparents.",

          "text": "if I'm going to email them (most of the schools I applied don't state if they offer waivers) do I need to show supporting documents or a brief explanation is enough?\n\nBaylor University has 'attach supporting documents' on their request a CSS  profile waiver section. I'm not sure what would be the best supporting document to provide since financial documents differ from country to country.",
