  "text": "Hello r/ApplyingToCollege!\n\nI am currently a junior in high school and have a question about the value of my job for college admissions. I have been very involved in theatre for years and have been the sole light and sound technician for my district\u2019s theatre program (6 main stage shows + one acts yearly) and when the previous light and sound tech (adult) quit their job the district hired me. So I now work ~20-35hr/wk doing the same theatre I always have as well as band concerts, choir concert, assemblies, etc in addition to my 5 APs and other courses. Recently they started pulling me out of class for my job. I hate it. Overall it takes a ton of time and the pay also isn\u2019t great though I don\u2019t need the money. \n\nMy question is would I harm my application by quitting? I think I have a valid reason (the school pulling me out of class to work), but I want to make sure before I decide to quit. \n\nI\u2019m trying to aim for schools like UCLA and Pomona if that matters.",

It looks good but it doesn\u2019t need to be current for the job. ( you can still list it on your app for the years you did it) - It looks better to focus on your grades.",
