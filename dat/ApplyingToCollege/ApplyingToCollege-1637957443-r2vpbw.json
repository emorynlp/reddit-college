  "title:": "How bad is it that I have not applied to any schools yet?",
  "text": "I\u2019m aware that this is not an ideal spot, and while my schools don\u2019t have a deadline until mid January, it puts me at a disadvantage applying later than sooner. I\u2019m applying to 6 schools, only 1 of them being rolling admissions. The Common App is done for them all, but I just haven\u2019t finished my essay and am waiting for my teacher to finish her recommendation. Keep in mind, i\u2019m not a genius so i\u2019m not applying to Harvard or Yale, but the list includes Virginia Tech, JMU, NC State, Appalachian State, Binghamton, and UNC. I want to get them in, but I just haven\u2019t finalized my essay, and would rather take an extra week to get an amazing essay versus rushing the app with a boring essay. \n\nThanks",

      "text": "Not a VA resident, but  think that Virginia tech fills most seats in popular majors in the EA round. JMU should be OK. As long as you are a reasonable applicant, App St and NC state should be ok. Note that Engineering at NC state is substantially harder admission-wise than A&S, if you are going in that direction. UNC you won\u2019t be at a disadvantage, but you need to be a strong candidate to get in. I don\u2019t know enough about the admissions process at Binghamton to comment.",

      "text": "You\u2019re fine; a lot of people are in your boat too.\n\nFor Virginia Tech - really try to get that in by their Early Action deadline of December 1st. (might be 2nd, I can\u2019t remember.) They fill up almost all of their slots with EA applicants, and their regular decision acceptance rate is shockingly low; roughly 14 percent, compared to their early action acceptance rate of like 60 percent.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/roanoke.com/news/local/more-have-applied-to-virginia-tech-so-far-than-all-of-last-year/article_0bf9f574-3677-11eb-b632-db22eeadc33b.amp.html\n\nBest of luck. :) \ud83e\udd83",
