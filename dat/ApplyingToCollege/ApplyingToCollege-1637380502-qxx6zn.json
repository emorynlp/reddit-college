  "text": "Hi all, posting for my neighbor's kid again. Their current military service forbade them from having social media accounts so I'm asking on their behalf.\n\nKid: Hi all! Recently got admitted to UW Madison (CS) and Purdue (DS) for a Spring 2022 intake. While I received the Purdue offer much earlier and was mentally preparing for my undergraduate studies at Purdue, UW Madison's offer has throw me into a conundrum.\n\nI'll just preface this by saying that at either University, I plan to finally major in CS. So even at Purdue, I'll be working on switching to a CS major.\n\nFortunately for me, fees is not a concern. Both universities have a good reputation, but differ in terms of location and atmosphere.\n\nI currently live in a city, so feel that UW Madison may be a good fit for me. But I'm not attracted by the party or social scene at Madison, and don't feel too attracted to the desolate nature at Purdue either.\n\nAny suggestions?",

          "text": "Kid: How about job prospects? Have you heard of better internship opportunities at Madison? From my Purdue experience thus far, I have seen that they have very good CS career fairs, and there are a lot of opportunities for Co-op programs and placements after graduation.\n\nFrom my basic research into Madison so far however, I see that the career fairs are fairly oversubscribed, and that because CS majors are so easy to transfer into, classes are always packed. Also, it seems that Purdue's starting salary is higher for CS grands than Madison.\n\nI know it seems like that I am disparaging UW Madison, but that is simply because I have had more experience with Purdue thus far and really want to make the right decision here for my future.\n\nThank you for advice though!",

It hasn\u2019t gotten easier since [this article,](https://www.purdueexponent.org/campus/article_14851194-dd66-11e9-8ea0-1764f0ba0b05.html) and there were rumors it was just going to be dropped as an option.\n\nThat, plus very comparable programs, and in-state tuition in Madison seem to make that a better choice.\n\n(fwiw, my daughter is a very happy recent Purdue graduate.)",
