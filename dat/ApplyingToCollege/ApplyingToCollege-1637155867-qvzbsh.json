If you\u2019re currently too slow, just find passages and read them each day, at max speed without losing comprehension, then find someone and verbally explain it to them. You can\u2019t consciously learn reading faster, you just have to develop the skill.\n\nI suggest New Yorker articles\n\nIf you don\u2019t have enough time to do that, learn some of the strategies online. Try searching r/act",

By \u201cmax speed without losing comprehension\u201d I meant about the same as what you\u2019re saying (the highest speed that allows max comprehension, even if that speed is slow), but I realize now that any phrase starting with \u201cmax speed\u201d sounds like I\u2019m suggesting rushing.\n\nOP, take ^ to heart. Reading through the passage and understanding the first time is a LOT faster than checking back on every question.",
