              "text": "You usually can't.  \n\nWhat you can do is compare the grad rate to peer institutions - how does a school you are looking at do compared to schools that admit similar students?  Consider similar both academically (grades/test scores/etc.) and financially - percent of students taking out loans and average debt on graduation.\n\nEven when you are looking at schools that aren't very selective, there can be significant differences in the level of support they provide and it can translate to a higher graduation rate.",

      "text": "Be sure to look at all of the factors. Some schools have low 4 year but high 6 year graduation rates, based on the number of students who enroll in co-op programs.  Or professional programs that take longer than four years.\n\nTo pick a school that provides granular data, Purdue moves from 60% to 84%. Engineering goes from 57% to 88%, as Co-op is quite popular in Engineering. The College of Pharmacy goes from 22% to 80% because that\u2019s how Pharmacy works. These both factor into the school total.\n\nIt may be an indication of the type of student admitted, the level of support provided to students who struggle to adapt to college etc.\n\nIt\u2019s a good metric to look at and investigate, given the investment in attending. But it\u2018s a complicated metric.",

      "text": "It means fewer students earn a degree within 6Y of starting as freshman.\n\nTypically weaker students are less likely to graduate, and the same is true for poorer students.\n\nMany public schools, as part of their charter, admit students who are comparatively weaker academically than the set of students admitted to more selective schools.  Most are also not able to meet 100% of students' financial need.  As one might expect, fewer of these students successfully graduate.\n\nWhat you should not assume is that because A has a 6Y graduation rate lower than B that \\*you\\* would be less likely to graduate from A than you would be from B.\n\nOne example:  UT-Austin's 6Y grad rate is around 88%.  The grad rate for students admitted to its selective \"Plan II\" honors program is 97%, on par with top Ivies.\n\nNow, what you *might* ought to care about is a school's 6Y grad rate *compared to other schools that admit a similar caliber of student*.  If A and B both have the same 25/50/75 SAT scores and roughly similar GPA profiles, but 85% of students at A graduate in 6Y while only 65% of students at B graduate in 6Y, then that might be cause to prefer A over B.",
