  "text": "Title. Basically I\u2019ve done extremely well in all my STEM, English, and Social Studies classes throughout high school, with an A+ in all of them. However, I do have a couple B\u2019s in elective/options classes, like foods and speech and debate. I was a bit concerned because I was wondering if top colleges give these classes as much weight or include them in your recalculated GPA, since most schools don\u2019t offer the same electives or options classes.",
