  "text": "hey guys, as I am filling in the UC activities and awards section, I was wondering if yall think it'd be necessary to fill an activity in if I have already written a PIQ about it (student government president)? \n\nUnfortunately (or perhaps fortunately?), I already have 20 activities and awards that I want to include and while my school counselor said it'd be fine to not include (As it's already in my PIQ), it's still slightly concerning. \n\nWhat do you guys think?",
