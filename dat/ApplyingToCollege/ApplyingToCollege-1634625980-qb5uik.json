  "text": "What are some colleges that I should avoid? For example, Soka University of America being cult-like and the majority of the students being rich Japanese kids with connections or Minerva University which is like a scam. Both have fake reviews and testimonials. Anything else I should take note of other than these and for-profit colleges?",

      "text": "I'd be leery of schools with a very low financial grade.  IIRC Forbes puts out a list every year.  On the other hand, many schools in this category are desperate for high achievers and will pay you to attend.  So, pros and cons.\n\nPersonally, I'd also not want to attend a school that is primarily commuter (unless finances made it my only option).  You may also want to avoid schools that are steeply bent in a particular ideological or theological direction from wherever you happen to be.  e.g., if you're not a conservative evangelical Christian then you may want to avoid Liberty.  (Some people apply this principle too liberally and avoid schools like, say, Georgetown or BC; I don't recommend that.)",

Wheaton College in Illinois and Wheaton College in Massachusetts aren't the same school.\n\nWhen someone recommends Purdue, they are usually talking about the West Lafayette campus - going to Purdue Fort Wayne is not the same at all. CU Denver and CU Boulder aren't the same school either.  It's the kind of thing that everyone recognizes with the UCs, but I've seen multiple students on here not recognize that for the public systems in other states.\n\nI would be wary of schools that were for-profit and now claim to be non-profit.  Grand Canyon University for example.",
