  "text": "I thought the hard parts in getting into Harvard would be the high grades in high school or finding the passion and I was glad because I have these but right now I feel really stuck because when I tried to compare my essays with accepted essays I found that my essays have really basic and easy words and when I used next admit essay scanner I found that it\u2019s not that good at all so what do you guys think I should do to add good words and enhance my essay so I could get accepted as it\u2019s my dream school. Or it\u2019s just impossible to do something like that in 15 days ??\ud83e\udd72\nPlease help\nBtw I am an international student and my first language is not english",
