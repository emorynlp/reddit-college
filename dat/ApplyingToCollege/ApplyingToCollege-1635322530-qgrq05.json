  "text": "Okay so in freshman year ( I was 13), due to some wrong calculations, my robotics project set on f!re as soon as I plugged it in. No one else was injured (I have a permanent burn mark on my finger) but since we had to use a fire extinguisher to set off the fire, it directly went into my permanent records. \nI'm an international student applying for a CS major, will this hurt my chances? I didn't get suspended for it and neither were my parents called, but it was simply added to my permanent record by the school, something that will be reflected in my transcripts. (It wasn't intentional at all, a wire hadn't been soldered properly by me and that caused a short circuit).",
