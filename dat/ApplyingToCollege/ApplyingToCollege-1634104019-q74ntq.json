I\u2019m taking calc 2 right now as are many of my friends; we all have different homework questions, different quiz formats, and some of us have curves while some of us don\u2019t. Whichever college you commit to, look through course evals before registering for your classes. \n\n(Not to mention that grading \u201cfairly\u201d is a very subjective notion)",
