  "text": "I made an observation over the past few days that there has been an uptick in questions about UC admissions, less than a month before the deadline :D\n\nSo, I am here to answer all of your questions.\n\n# Tale of the three Stats, how the UC GPA is composed!\n\nThere are 3 different UC GPAs. **Unweighted, Weighted-Capped, and Weighted-Uncapped.**\n\n**Unweighted:** This is simply an average of all of the different courses you have taken, **that are within A-G, and are in 10th + 11th grade.** Summer before 10th grade is calculated as 10th grade, and summer after 11th grade is calculated as 11th grade. Pluses and minuses have no impact. A = 4 points, B = 3 points, C = 2 points, D = 1 point. Consult your high school's A-G course list to make sure you are using the right courses. This is considered for admission into all UC schools.\n\n**Weighted-capped:** This is the typical UC weighted grade system. It gives an extra point to **UC-Honors approved** courses, AP courses, community college courses, and IB HL courses. You are allowed a maximum of **8 extra points** between the 10th and 11th grades, and you are allowed a maximum of 4 points in 10th grade. This is considered for admission into all UC schools except UC Berkeley and UCLA. However, it is used to determine **eligibility** to all UC schools. In state requires students to have a 3.0 **weighted-capped** UC GPA, while anyone out of state must have a 3.4 **weighted-capped** GPA.\n\n**Weighted-uncapped:** This is the UC weighted grade system considered at UC Berkeley and UCLA. It gives an extra point to all **UC-Honors approved** courses, AP courses, community college courses, and IB HL courses. It sets no limit on the number of extra points considered. \n\n# Some Important Points\n\n* Grades of a D or an F are awarded **no additional honors points.**\n* University of California uses **weighted and capped UC GPA** for eligibility.\n* Make sure to check with your CC that their courses that you with to take are **UC transferable**. If they are not, they will not factor into your GPA.\n* Only AP and IB Higher Level courses are considered as UC honors courses for GPA calculation purposes.\n* Any pass/fail courses are **not included in UC GPA**, however, they are used to fulfill requirements.\n* Repeated courses can only help your UC GPA if you initially received lower than a C the first time around.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n# Important links\n\n* Check your school's A-G CourseList here! [Subject requirement (A-G) | UC Admissions](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/subject-requirement-a-g.html) (instate)\n* Check the general A-G CourseList here! [A-G general course list](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/freshman-requirements/subject-requirement-a-g.html) (everyone)\n* Check our u/rogerhub\u2018s fantastic UC GPA calculator!

The problem is that out of state honors is supposedly not weighted and according to their instructions should be listed as nonhonors. That would mean they\u2019re getting thousands of applicants who have taken AP classes for pretty much 80% of their sophomore and junior year classes. I don\u2019t get the sense most people are taking that many APs sophomore year. Or they\u2019re actually weighing the out of state honors. Any idea which?",
