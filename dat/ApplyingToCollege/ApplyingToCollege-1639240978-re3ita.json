  "title:": "Upwards jump from junior to senior year but downwards trend all other years. How will this affect my admissions chances?",
  "text": "I've had a steady downward trend since freshman year until this year (senior year) when everything went up by a lot. It's gone like: \n\n3.9 --> 3.6 --> 3.4 --> 3.8  (Weighted)\n\nI've done all honors and one AP all years except for regular level math courses in sophomore - senior year. I know that colleges don't like seeing downward trends but I feel like sophomore/junior years could be considered exceptions because of covid and online learning... as well as some major personal factors like divorce/moving/hospitalization that happened those years.  \n\nWhat could this say about me as a student, and what kind of impact will this leave on my apps? I'm going crazy because deadlines are coming so close lol",

      "text": "Most colleges use holistic process and will understand your individual circumstances if you explain it well in your essays (stress more on how you managed under trying circumstances). Anyways there is only minor trend up or down in your gpa - not like going from 2.7 to 4.0",
