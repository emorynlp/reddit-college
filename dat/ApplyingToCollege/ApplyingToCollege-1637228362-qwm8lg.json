  "text": "So I just had my Stanford Interview. it lasted JUST 20 minutes and the interviewer seemed in a hurry. We had a two-way conversation and he did seem interested in what I was saying, but was constantly interrupting me almost politely. The questions he asked me in order were-\n.\n1) If you could chose 5 people in this world to put in the same room to have a conversation, who would they be?\n.\n2) Tell me about your high school experience. What was your greatest achievement?\n.\n3) Going forward what do you want yo achieve in life?\n.\nThen I asked him 3 questions.\n.\nNo introductions, he cut straight to the chase.\n.\nfreakin hell i am stressed.",
