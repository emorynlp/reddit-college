  "text": "There is literally nowhere on the Apply Texas application that have a space for AP tests. I already submitted my application through Coalition and I was hoping that I could add them in the portal after, but there is no space to do so.\n\nDoes anyone know how to report them?\n\nEdit: So I did report them on the Coalition App via the \"Additional Testing\" section but it doesn't show up on my \"reported tests\" parts of the portal or on my application pdf",
