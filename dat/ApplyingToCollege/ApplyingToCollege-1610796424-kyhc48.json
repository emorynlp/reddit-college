Also the UK is far from perfect where if you go to uni in England, Whales or northern Ireland you have to pay tuition which lead to something like \u00a350000 because the average tuition is about \u00a39000 per year. Whereas is Scotland if you lived in the UK for more than 3 years and have a permanent address in Scotland that doesn't look like you are trying to rip off the free tuition you get free tuition.",

I got into my top school which doesn't take demonstrated interest into account, but im going through a scholarship appeal, and demonstrated interest is certainly important for that because they want to know I'm actually going to attend. \n\nSo first thing, I attend an honors college info session. They bring up a PowerPoint thats literally *screenshots from the website.* I kid you not. Its word for word the same info and then they showed a video about it that was already on their YouTube channel. \n\nSo I assume this is a fluke, and about a month later I decide I want to tour. In person tours are not really an option right now because the school is in NY and I would have to quarantine in the state for 2 weeks per state law in order to tour. So I decided on a zoom tour, which the website claimed would be 2 to 3 hours of highly detailed touring. So I hop on the zoom, and the first thing they do is show a 5 minute \"tour\" video which is basically a pan over of the campus. (BTW, the video is on their YouTube channel and i had already watched it). Then they go through a PowerPoint which, once again, is screenshots from the website. \n\nLike wtf? Why even have these info sessions which don't cover any new information. Its a total waist of time",
