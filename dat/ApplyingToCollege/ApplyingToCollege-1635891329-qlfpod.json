  "text": "I recently submitted my college app for UT Austin's priority deadline, and one of the required questions is \"Please share background on events or special circumstances that you feel may have impacted your high school academic performance, including the possible effects of COVID-19.\"\n\nI thought this was optional, so I didn't spend my time revising and editing it, and, when I realized it was required, I put ONE sentence about how my academic performance was affected due to my mental health, but if you looked at my transcript, you wouldn't see any evidence of it. \n\nI already have auto-admission (as of right now), but I really want my major. How badly do you think it would affect my ability to get my major? I feel so dumb.",
