  "text": "Ive been looking at Udub recently and was thinking about applying. However, Ive been seeing some posts about the acceptance rate for oos students into engineering is insanely low, like 2-3% low. Is that really true? and does that make it not worth even applying? (realistically speaking)",

So basically I would be in the same pool as the 3% kids.\n\nI\u2019m honestly just in denial. There\u2019s no point in applying for me at this point if the chances of me getting in are that low.",
