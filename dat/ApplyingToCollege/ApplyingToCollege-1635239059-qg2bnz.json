  "title:": "Question about EFC",
  "text": "I'm applying to colleges like Dartmouth and UChicago which have pledges that if families make under 60-65K they don't have to pay anything and I qualify. So my family can pay about 5-10K USD a year and I'm planning to include that number in the CSS, coz I'm worried about other colleges that are need sensitive for internationals. So if I say I can pay 5-10K will they still give me the full ride under their pledge?  Also should I consider just putting 0 in the EFC part or is that too risky to do that as an international?",

As an international, if you have sufficient assets and income and still put in less ( 'How much would you be contributing'  textbox) than what their estimate it, then your admission chances are lower in need aware institutes.\n\nIn OPs case, I agree that his family income is less so my above comment will not hold for him but what I mean is it matters.",
