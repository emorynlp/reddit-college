  "text": "Hey,  \n\n\nI'll be applying to Yale REA next week and as it stands, one of my teachers might not be able to write me a LOR by the deadline due to extenuating circumstances. Can they be sent 3-4 days after the deadline? Yale's website isn't super clear about this. It says:  \n\n\n> The admissions office will make reasonable allowances for late school documents in situations where it is not possible for teachers and counselors to meet the application deadlines. \n\nDoes that mean I have to get my school to inform them upfront? and how long of a time frame exactly is their reasonable allowance?  \n\n\nTIA !",
