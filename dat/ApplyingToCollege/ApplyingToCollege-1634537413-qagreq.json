  "text": "its 2:10 am here on the east coast i have like 5 assignments i need to do in AP enviro, a whole bunch of latin assignments + latin test today, and i have upcoming tests i need to study hard for but i just don't have the motivation to do it\n\ni've been so consumed with college apps and worrying about results...my ed1 school results come out the day after my birthday and everyone at my school is toxic enough as it is about college apps but now everyone's been asking around trying to scout out competition or just flat out refusing to tell anyone about anything\n\ni'm hoping it gets better because november is riddled with breaks but this shit really does suck\n\nidk i just needed a place to rant if anyone else is going through senior year burnout let me know and we can collectively wail in our misery",
