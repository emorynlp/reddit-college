I volunteer for a magazine where I write articles and recruit other students to write one too. Last year the total number of articles written for the column I\u2019m in charge of is 15. If I got people to write 21 this year, is it misleading to say I \u201cincreased the number of articles written by 40%.\u201d I mean it sounds better but the different isn\u2019t significant lol",
