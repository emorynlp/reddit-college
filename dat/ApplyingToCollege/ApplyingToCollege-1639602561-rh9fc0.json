You can (and should, unless you are *accepted* somewhere you are ok with) apply anywhere else you are interested in.\nYou have until May 1 to send a deposit to another school. If the timing gets close, you may have to put down a deposit at your second choice. \n\nYou may come off the waitlist after May 1 and get an offer. At that point, if you accept NYU you will lose your other deposit.\n\nGood luck.",
