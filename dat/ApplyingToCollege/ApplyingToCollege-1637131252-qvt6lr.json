  "title:": "Princeton announces new legacy-only admissions policy",
  "text": ">Last Thursday, Princeton announced that it will \u201cend all non-legacy admissions,\u201d starting with the Class of 2026. From now on, the University will only admit relatives of alumni, with preference given to applicants descending from several generations of Princetonians.  \n>  \n>The decision follows Amherst College\u2019s recent [announcement](https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2021/10/amherst-college-legacy-admissions-princeton) ending legacy consideration in its admissions. Troubled by the policy change, Princeton released a statement indicating a desire to forge its unique approach to admissions.  \n>  \n>\u201cWhy should we follow in Amherst\u2019s steps? They\u2019re not even an Ivy,\u201d the Office of Communications wrote in a press release.  \n>  \n>\u201cWe feel that the best way to continue our tradition of excellence in education is to limit our student body to those who look exactly like the generations of Princetonians who came before them,\u201d the statement said.\n\n[https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2021/11/princeton-legacy-only-admissions-policy-amherst](https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2021/11/princeton-legacy-only-admissions-policy-amherst)",
