  "text": "I hear a lot of people saying that you should write about interesting things you've done in your Common App/supplemental essays. However, I don't want my essays to basically rehash what I've already said in my Activities list. I want to talk about the things beyond my ECs that make me tick, the things that make me randomly stop and think about them. Is that fine?",

The main point of the common app is to convey who you are as an individual to the reader. If you think you can really highlight your character/values/something intrinsic to you THROUGH your EC's, then yeah, include them. Otherwise, don't feel pressured!",
