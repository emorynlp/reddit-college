  "text": "Any recommendations on colleges that are decent at engineering but don't have too many questions that ask \"Why Engineering\"? I have most of my regulars done and thought that it would be nice to apply to some schools as engineering for fun, and even though I've done mostly finance EC's, I've always found engineering somewhat interesting. \n\nFor example Ohio State is one, since they don't ask for any supps and its just marking the box that you want to do engineering. Or some other schools that fit the bill would be colleges that make it really easy to transfer between majors/ sub-schools (outside of the ivies cause I'm not built for those). V-Tech could be another one since their questions are more personality based and less academic centric. \n\nAny other recommendations?",

I care about whats best for my future, which could just be sending my application to more schools than I can count. If that hurts other kids, so be it.\u00a0",
