  "text": "we all worked SO HARD in high school, always to be told to take the sidelines at rewarding events because \u201cyou\u2019ll get your chance when you\u2019re a senior\u201d and \u201cyour time will come.\u201d Obviously no one could\u2019ve predicted this but I still feel lied to and cheated nonetheless. We\u2019ve had to watch every single class above ours get rewarded in so many ways and it sucks that we get nothing. \n\nClass of 2020, we deserve everything that was planned for us and more. We won\u2019t even get to say goodbye to our classmates or get our yearbooks signed or walk across the stage that we worked 12 years to get to. Fuck this #RIPClassof2020\n\nEDIT: i didn\u2019t expect this to blow up so much so i wanna clarify some stuff. this isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault and i\u2019m NOT saying we should bring these events back. i am gladly staying home because it needs to be done. i also acknowledge that this is a first world problem and i am privileged that this my biggest worry and nothing worse. it is what it is, i am just saying it for those of us who are sad that it\u2019s ok to be sad.",

If this pandemic continues till September, I doubt univeristy will start again until we have successfully contained it? Who knows this might happen earlier than we expect, but the way things are now, September looks unlikely. You know what would hurt your economy more, if you open up everything too soon, the second wave will hit you just as hard as the first. I just hope there's more green around the corner, but the way politicians are talking about it and giving us no clear date or they keep extending the deadlines, they know it's going to be a while, and they are afraid if we know this, we will riot.",

Covid is yet to peak in US and it's a very real possibility that Fall 2020 classes will be held online. And a lot of students will also look to defer because let's be honest, no one wants to start University online.\n\n\nAll these factors will likely lead to a lot of people rejecting acceptances or asking for deferrals, which means waitlist acceptances would increase\n\n\nEdit: As a lot of people have pointed out, Dr. Fauci has stated that he expects the virus to die down by summer. This would mean that schools would likely be open in fall. Obviously, he is an expert and it'll be great for everybody for this virus to disappear as soon as possible, but in my humble opinion, I believe he is being extremely optimistic. Conservatively speaking, I personally (and again, I may be wrong) don't see schools opening in September. \n\nI would say expect the worst. That way, you can be pleasantly surprised instead of hoping for the best and being disappointed.",

While we'd still need to take extra precautions, and there'd be alternating periods of lifting and imposing restrictions, there's a good chance that Fall 2020 won't necessarily be online.

By doing some math they accepted around 135 extra students to compensate for the expected drop in international attendance. \n\nOr Dartmouth which increased their RD acceptance rate by 1.1% which allowed for another 150 students to be offered admission. They\u2019re international population per class is around ~120. \n\nAlso more people are going to get waitlisted this year because we just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. Yes more people may get pulled from the waitlist but the rate can stay the same because they increased the waitlist offers.",

I\u2019d planned on hanging out w ppl a lot during senior spring and making up for everything I\u2019d missed before. Now w corona I feel like a clown for not taking advantage of all the earlier social opportunities and I\u2019m mad at myself for not having a biiit more fun. Even after I got into college early in December I still made myself grind until after spring break in April. Ugh :( glad to know there\u2019s someone else who gets my vibe haha",

Where are my siblings, I'm gonna go hug them...\n\nI don't know how to express it, but your comment....everyone should see this. You are so right. I admire you and how you've persevered through all these hardships. I can relate, to a much lesser extent (I have autism and a chronic stutter, bio-father left the picture as a toddler, and my mom and I essentially squatted all around the CDMX area fighting for survival and trying to make ends meet for 3 years before risking everything and crossing the border into the U.S., and I've reached the point where I was accepted to take summer courses at UCLA, which were cancelled). I wanted to say that \"I'm surprised you don't have more upvotes\" or \"if I could give you an award I would\", but that seemed too superficial to me. Too quick and easy. This was deep. This was genuine. This doesn't deserve that kind of disrespect. And I don't know how to properly respond to this. I'm young, I was born and raised into the era of technology, the era of social media, the era of likes and reposts and followers and instant gratification and competitions for attention. And so I'm innately better at superficial recognition typical of generic attention-seeking posts and promoting this kind of behavior instead of dealing with thought-provoking material that actually matters, and I hate that that defines my generation. I applaud you, and I wish the best for all of you, considering the circumstances. You all deserved those rewarding experiences, and I fully agree with your message to not bottle your emotions in. In times like this, that can be more dangerous and damaging than the virus itself. Now more than ever, we need to take care of ourselves and be there for each other, because while our exact circumstances may vary widely, while some (such as myself) are much more well off than others, we all are dealing with emotions and feelings that are legitimate and cannot be ignored or denied. More people need to see this. Thank you so much for sharing this.",

This entire situation has me falling back into a depression that I went through not even a year ago.  I fought my entire junior year through court visits to press charges after being sexually abused my sophomore year. I was sure that this year was going to be my redemption year. That after all the pain and suffering my family went through, that we were on the path to healing.  \n\nThe beginning of senior year was ironic and crazy. We had a fire drill every Tuesday or  Thursday and a power outage every Wednesday or Friday. Sometimes we had both on the same day. That was our first six weeks. Thought it was hilarious how cursed our class was. That the school would fall apart after our class graduated.Haha. \n\nWe had it all. But now we are all stuck at home. Bored out of my mind. I, a procrastinator, am so bored that I finish my work days before it is due. Then I sleep and cry. I know that what is happening today is horrible and scary. That people are dying. I don\u2019t like feeling sorry for myself. But I can\u2019t help it. \n\nI was so excited to go to my first and last high-school dance. I would have my first dance with my bf. Just the fact that I would be able to experience prom with my best friends. We even had plans to hit up Taco Bell afterwards since we are all too poor to want to go anywhere else. To walk the stage and see my family and friends there. \n\nAfter graduation I was supposed to spend a year in Japan (While taking online classes) with my father. I was looking forward to hiking Mt.Fuji, visiting shrines/ temples, going to the clear white sandy beaches, experience an entirely different culture, bullet trains, and most of all the cherry blossoms. I was born in Okinawa but we left before I was 4 and I wanted to go back to see Japan since I hear it\u2019s so lovely. \n\nI\u2019m sorry I just whined about all my first world problems. But I really don\u2019t care. It just feels good to get this off my chest so I can focus on scholarships and trying to find something to do so I don\u2019t get sad every time someone mentions \u201csenior year\u201d. I hope everyone is holding up okay.  I\u2019m sorry for all our losses, what ever that maybe be, and I hope the in the coming months we find ways to ease our minds.",

Think about those things before you complain about experiencing discrimination\u201d. Of course, this is going to sound like I am comparing senior award cancellation to racial discrimination, HOWEVER I am actually demonstrating how the idea that one should ignore comparatively minor issues because others experience major issues is a seriously flawed argument and should not be applied in our case.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t pretend like we\u2019re the only ones with problems, yes, but we shouldn\u2019t ignore our problems just because others are experiencing more hardship than us - we still have the right to be upset.",

I get that you feel robbed of something that\u2019s glowingly portrayed in teen movies, but peps who peak in high school will be just that. Take solace that you have your health and prepare yourself for the future. And get used to being lied to- when you see your investments fall a million points because nobody took care of the disruption in the supply chain or the Fed printing money- the government shirking its duty, your partner gambling your money, life can be full of disappointments, so here\u2019s your first lesson, a rude awakening to the real world.

Several years down the road we\u2019ll probably have this mindset and would agree with you, but right now in the moment it sucks.

It feels like this chapter of our lives isn\u2019t being closed. Yes, it\u2019s trivial in the long run, but for now it hurts and we just want to get it out.",

Of course will get downvoted in a HS Senior thread and it does hurt, but every generation faces some unusual circumstances that drastically affect life. 9/11 was an event that changed and shaped our country and affected home/travel/school life. Your great grandparents faced a decade of the Great Depression and many never fully recovered mentally from that those days. If you were in the poorer side, it drastically affected ones ability to enjoy life and many of them spent the remaining days \u201cenduring\u201d life, waiting for the next negative event, instead of enjoying it. Hard times build tough people.  Others grew hardened to life and developed a strong sense of self and perseverance.  You as seniors will grow tougher knowing how unfair and cruel life can be now to develop that identity. You will appreciate special events even more. You know how many seniors and 8th graders take for granted ceremonies that they joke and roll their eyes at all the speeches? Heck, even college students do that. Now, you have a chance to grow a new appreciation for your school life, awards, and the people that helped you get there. \n\nIn the grand scheme of things, this will be a minor blip in your life that you can turn into a positive. It can still hurt, but you can make this into something great. \n\nOk, downvote away.",
