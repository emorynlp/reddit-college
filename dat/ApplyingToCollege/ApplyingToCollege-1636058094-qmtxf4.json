  "text": "So basically, I rushed a good portion of my application. Mainly the activities section and supplemental essay. (I'm an absolute idiot I know) I actually rewrote my descriptions after I submitted on Nov 1 for a different college, and I was like, holy crap did I write that? But the issue is, the college I applied to on Nov 1 won't have these updated descriptions. How much will this reduce my chances?",

      "text": "It really depends on how big the difference is. I'm no professional (just another HS student), but I'd think that what colleges want to know about your activities are how much responsibility did you have to take on, what did you do (help community, build robots, tutoring, etc), how committed were/are you, and maybe what did you take away from it. More eloquent wording will help, but if you got the idea across it probably won't be a huge impact. But the supplemental essays are a whole different story. Those essays are the chance to show AOs who you are, tell them what makes you unique, humanize yourself and become more than words and numbers on a page. A rushed essay is probably worse than rushed activities, but, again, it really depends on *how rushed* it was, on how much weight the college puts on these things, etc. There's no way to know how much it'll impact your chances, but these things are important.",
