If you are a US citizen/domestic, you do not need to worry about aid (at least for private schools) as they are need blind for the most part. If you an intl, you're chances become much, much lower. \n\n\nFor a full ride/acceptance to any top tier uni, you would need at least a 1500+, preferably 1530+. A good GPA and great ec\u2019s are also requirements. Good essays and letters of rec help as well.",
