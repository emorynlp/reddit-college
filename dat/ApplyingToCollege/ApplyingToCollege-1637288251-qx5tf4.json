If you live off-campus there's been a few burglaries, but violent crime is very rare.\n\nAlso WashU sends everyone an email whenever a crime is committed on campus or in WashU affiliated off-campus housing. Whether it's petty theft or armed robbery, everyone will know exactly when, where, what, and how the crime happened.",
