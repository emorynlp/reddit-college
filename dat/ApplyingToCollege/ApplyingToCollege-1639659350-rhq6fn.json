  "text": "Edit: \\^ just to revise my question a bit, I meant to ask how much it'd impact my college apps, and what I can do to make up for it.\n\nUpdate: My friends are supper supportive and i couldn't be more thankful. Also TYSM to all the helpful responses, it makes me feel so much less anxious\n\nHi, just to give some context, I was just suspended for taking a pair of air pods that I found on the ground after one of my classes and failed to report them (I def had the time to so there is no excuse for that whatsoever).  I understand the mistake I've made and since the incident has just occurred I'm not sure what the full consequences are or if I'll be able to expunge my record.\n\nAs a student I've always done fairly well and I have a 3.9 UW GPA with a 4.5 W GPA; this is also my Junior year (which def makes the situation worse...). I'm a part of various clubs, and I partake in many extracurriculars + volunteering organizations (I also have a national award in a sport). I'm aware of how badly this reflects on my character, but I also know that I'm much more than this. I just want to know how badly this can impact my college applications, and what I can do to balance out my horrible behavior.\n\nI know that I should be busy reflecting on my behavior rather than my future college prospects but I can't help but worry about college and how this impacts all the effort I've put in. Please don't be too harsh on me in the comments :) thanks.\n\nedit: Knowing that I am the one in the wrong, I don't even know how I'd go ask for it to be expunged... should I talk to my teachers (since they've probably been notified of the suspension) or is that useless? I hate that I'm trying to minimize the consequences I deserve but I can't help but worry about my future.\n\nupdate: Just wrote an email appeal to have my record expunged. :') ( Handbook states that I have to turn one in within one school day, which I think is ridiculous because realistically I didn't have enough time to even reflect on myself)  \n\n\nSecret edit: guys im a she not a he LMAO",

      "text": "Anyone saying this is a permanent L and you have no chance is just off base. I have had multiple students with police arrests get into T20s.  This was wrong, but it's not like you committed armed robbery - you found a pair of airpods and didn't report them.  Yes it was a mistake, but I don't think it's impossible to come back from this.  Here are some tips:\n\n1.  You should explain this story in your disciplinary action section.  Don't write a detailed or immersive essay about it - just share the facts, then reflect on what you learned, how you grew, etc.  Be honest, contrite, and mature.  As they say, show them the phoenix, not the ashes.\n\n2.  You need an ally.  If there is a teacher or guidance counselor who knows you well and can speak positively about your character, strengths, etc it would be good to talk about this with them when you ask for a LOR. They can advocate on your behalf, provide explanations without sounding like excuses, and share the mitigating factors (e.g. that you simply found them and didn't report them rather than stole them directly from someone surreptitiously or by force, that you understand this was wrong and have already made amends, etc).\n\n3.  Was this ISS or OSS?  Was a police report filed?  Will this show up on your high school transcript?  Have you talked to your guidance counselor about this?  These questions will all help inform and define your strategy going forward.",

      "text": "The mistake is behind you and from your post I understand that you also have realized the consequences of your actions. And I choose to take you at your word as well! :)  \n\n\nSo, now I think the most important aspect is the mitigation of its impact (aka damage control) :   \n1. First approach your principal, school authority or responsible administrative body and explain your actions and the intent. And (politely) request if this can be expunged from your permanent record.   \na. If the answer is a yes, well great! Learn and move on.   \nb. If they refuse to do so, well you got more things on your to-do list.   \n\n\n2. Considering you have this on your permanent record, focus on how to represent intent, event, retrospection and growth accurately in your application. There's (most likely) a separate section to explain the same.   \nDO NOT elaborate on why the mistake was trivial but rather on what you learnt from it and how you've grown as a person. It might also be wise to portray the positive aspects of your personality through other parts of your application.   \n\n\n  \nI hope I was of some help! :)",

You can explain it, and your other qualifications may very well overcome this significantly, but nevertheless, it did hurt your chances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt sounds like your doing pretty well besides that, so that being said I wouldn't at all worry. Did you ding your chances? yes.\n\nWas it by a huge amount? No, especially if you follow the other commenters steps to mitigate it like getting a relevant LOR and explaining it clearly, concisely, and in a mature manner.

Secondarily, teachers, but their LOR's should focus more on academic and in-classroom personal qualities.. not sure I agree that they need to even subtly try and explain away this unrelated-to-their-class instance.",

              "text": "glad it helped! I will say, I'm not sure I'd even tell my teachers about the instance.. if they already know, explain it, but otherwise I wouldnt bring it up myself especially when I'm asking them for LORs.\n\nThey might feel like they should try and address it, but really, doesnt every college require a counselor letter anyways? they dont need duplicate information, so my advice would be to get close with your counselor and try and give her as much as you can to write her LOR\n\nthey're the best one to counter any initial negative sentiment they have from that instance, and it would only take a couple sentences from them. They may even address it directly themselves and frame it in the light of improvement and like you said 'being more than that one instance' \n\nnot the same for everyone, but my counselors been my #1 resource for everything at school\n\nedit: I'd definitely contest it, and your counselor may be able to help you a lot here. How much time did you legitimately have? an hour? hours? days? were you busy? did you have exams you were focused on? mind wandering elsewhere?\n\n\nforgetting to turn in an item you found immediately isnt a crime, and like another commenter said, if you didnt turn them off then that really supports the case of just forgetting to turn them in / getting busy, which isnt stealing..\n\nI'd go to your counselor like:\n\n\"I'm so sorry, I was just so busy and my mind was focused on exams and 100 other things, I was going to return them immediately but I had class and assignments to get done, and I got busy and next thing I knew, hours had passed and i was accused of stealing\"\n\nI'd plead my case by being like \"look, i could understand some lesser punishment than stealing, since I shouldve turned them in immediately, but getting busy and forgetting I picked something up to return for a few hours isnt stealing. So punishing it the same isnt right, and brands me as something I'm not.\" \n\nmost districts have a system of several levels of appeals, so depending how much you care, that's another route, and it usually cant hurt to try.\n\nkinda unrelated, but just shows you that especially if you're in a public district, sometimes you have to get creative and fight for yourself if you just want to make the issue go away:\n\none time I found out that the reason my district was punishing me was bc of one other student targeting me (he wasnt the brightest, admitted to it in a discord with mutual friends..which of course got back to me)\n\nthat screenshot alone was enough to get my punishment lifted, him admitting to fabricating evidence to get me punished, yet the school admin did nothing even after I sent it to them..\n\nDropped an anonymous email to the board of trustees with an explanation in full, with evidence in the form of screenshots, and an explanation of how the school did nothing but ignore it and continue to listen to that 1 student.. (also sent evidence undermining his credibility in general)\n\nlow and behold, problem wasnt just fixed the next day, an apology was waiting for me.\n\nso really I'd say just go through whatever arduous process your school has, and if that still proves fruitless, explain your situation and take it further.. punishing you for stealing isnt right. You didnt steal it, and you never had any intent to steal it.\n\nother commenters are right that this dings you significantly if its legitimately on your record as 'Stealing'\n\nif theres a full explanation, colleges would laugh at it\n\nbut the fact they're willing to go after you at all for this kinda gives me some stinky vibes\n\nedit2: so, were you busy and forgot? or what happened? feel free to dm",

There are no interviews, teacher recommendations, essays etc.   We toured there in August.  The campus is beautiful and Montreal is a lot of fun.  It's my son's 2nd choice after Princeton.",
