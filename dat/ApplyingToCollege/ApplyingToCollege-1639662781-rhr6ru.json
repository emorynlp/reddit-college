  "text": "reposting since i probably shouldnt have asked at 12am right before shitpost wednesday:\n\n\nHello!\n\nI'm getting ready to submit all of my applications and I noticed my activities section was a little weak so I wanted to redo it. I have this huge EC where I took on a lot of different roles and am not sure how to describe it. Should I split it into two activities based on the specific role I'm trying to describe? Or elaborate in the additional information section? \n\n\n\nFor context, the EC is a weekly Newsletter I run. I was a leader of both the  writing and design teams and designed for it myself. But, I also was a contributing staff writer. My column specifically involved me interviewing members of the community and I've done hundreds of them over the last 4 years. It's a huge time sink which is why I want to highlight it but it's hard considering I want to highlight my other roles as well. \n\n\n\nI tried googling this but got conflicting info. Any advice?",
