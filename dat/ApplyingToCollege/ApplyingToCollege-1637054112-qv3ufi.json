  "text": "hey guys. i\u2019m a 11th grader, of India, and I really want to get into Ivy leagues. (sorry if it sounds too aspirational or vague). my school offers NO AP courses/exams whatsoever. \n\non top of that, the SAT subject tests have been made redundant. \n\nwhat do I do? + I read somewhere that unless you register for APs by November of the previous year, you need to pay an extra fee? is that true? can someone please help me out with this?\n\n+ is it that I need to have a particular course in mind in order to take the APs? will college credit only be valid if I take the APs in the subjects i\u2019m wishing to study?",

Depending on your test center\u2019s policy, some will allow you to register after the Nov 15th deadline for a higher fee (every regular testing subject goes from $190 each to $230 each; every late testing subject goes from $230 each to $270 each), and some do not offer registrations after the deadline.
