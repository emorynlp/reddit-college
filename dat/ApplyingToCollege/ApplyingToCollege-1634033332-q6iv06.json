      "text": "My advice, which admittedly won\u2019t work for everyone: spend a little time making it cringier. You fear the cringe, and you aren\u2019t confident you have the perspective to identify it accurately. So face the fear then laugh it out of your system. \n\nTry a few different flavors of cringe. Middle school airhead cringe. Too many flowery phrases and adverbs cringe. I\u2019m deliberately trying to piss off the AO cringe. Or maybe channel the voice of your cringiest relative. Whatever strikes your fancy; have fun with it. Don\u2019t spend much time on each of these rewrite exercises, but quickly plow through the essay.\n\nThen stick this creative writing exercise in a (metaphorical) drawer and go play volleyball. On a day your head feels clear, come back and rewrite the essay for real. The subtle pitfalls you can\u2019t yet put your finger on should work themselves out.",

I feel good about this one.",
