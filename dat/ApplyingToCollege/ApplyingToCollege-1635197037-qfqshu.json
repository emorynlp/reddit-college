  "text": "Hi,\n\nTo explain my question, are EA applications due at 11:59 PM on the night of November 1, or are they due at, like, the midnight going into November 1? Sorry, my teacher still hasn't written my LoR and says he'll have it done by Friday, and my counselor isn't reliable enough to send my transcript with haste, so I'm sorta panicking...\n\nThanks!",
