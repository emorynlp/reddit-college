  "title:": "Fellow Chinese-Americans... how are you feeling?",
  "text": "Mods, feel free to remove this post if you think it doesn't fit, I just thought I'd post it here since it has something to do with college, although not entirely.\n\nAmong the surge of recent social & political events, I'm sure most of you have heard about the \"Secure Campus Act\" recently proposed by Republicans, which wants to ban Chinese internationals from US colleges due to spying (you can search up more about it). Many people have referred to it as a \"modern day Chinese Exclusion Act,\" whether you agree with that or not.\n\nAs a Chinese-American, I may not be directly affected (not international) but I still feel a lot of conflicting emotions because of this. First of all, it's coming literally in the middle of the covid-19 crisis, where Asians overall have been stigmatized, and the Chinese especially. Second, although like I said the bill is not necessarily targeted to Chinese-Americans, I feel like it's only increasing the stigma towards Chinese people/Asians. You only have to look under Instagram posts to see what people think... covid-19 brought nasty as hell comments about us Chinese people (need I rehash that?), and the campus bill thing has a lot of people saying things like \"the Chinese deserve it \\[i.e. racism\\].\" Of course, like any other country, China definitely has its share of issues; I'm not going to deny them. But I've noticed a lot of things people say are based off the actions of the Chinese governments or a minority of the Chinese population (like idk *anyone* who's eaten a bat before??) and generalizing it.\n\nI grew up in a very Chinese household, surrounded by family friends who are also Chinese. I've always been proud of my heritage and China's background - it's one of the oldest & most sophisticated culture/country, with so many significant traditions and values. I've never wanted to be any other race/ethnicity because I've always loved being Chinese (culture =/= government btw). But with all these controversies inflaming the racist stigma around the Chinese/Asians, I've been feeling... a lot. People make me feel like I should be ashamed for being Chinese, when I know their facts & assumptions are wrong. I feel more embarrassed in public because I wonder if people are judging me based on those things. I feel *scared* sometimes. But because of that, I feel so angry as well. The same people who preach BLM on their stories (which is good!) are telling me that it's not racist to discriminate against the Chinese. ...I should *not* be ashamed, embarrassed, scared, to belong to an ethnicity that I'm proud of, yet society seems to keep pushing this on me.\n\nIdk... are any other Chinese-Americans (or other ethnicities too :)) feeling similar or have thoughts on this situation? I'd like to know how people my age are feeling about this, outside of my friends/school, esp. since this sub has a decent Asian population I believe. This turned into a mini rant, so again mods you can delete this if you see fit. But thanks for reading.\n\nBTW... I am very aware of the other health, social, & political issues the world is facing rn. This is just about the issues with China specifically :)\n\nEDIT: what the crap I'm shook at the awards... thanks so much guys\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a",

People act like Chinese-Americans should be held accountable for what a small percentage of China/the CCP does. My parents don't want us to get harassed and told us to identify more with our Maori/Viet side which is pretty heartbreaking.\n\nEvery time I see an IG post with any Asian at all, I have to mentally prepare myself for the comments. People across the globe eat unusual food. People eat snails(France), carp sperm (Czech Republic) and fermented shark (Iceland). People will see a video of a (Korean!) mukbang host eating an octopus and people will just spam it with \"chinese eat disgusting things\" \"dog eaters!\" and \"corona!1!1\".",

Being feared, treated with suspicion, reported to the authorities, etc. simply for following a religion\nAnd the list goes on.\n\nNobody is saying that white people cant experience difficulty. It happens a lot that people are bigoted or even just rude based on race, and yes white people do get flak!\n\nBut I think it's a little insensitive (and also untrue) to say that white people have it \"just as bad as everyone else\".",

Your argument \"these heinous acts borne of racism and hatred don't happen to that many people so it's not that big of an issue\" is weird, bro. These extreme instances are also just extremely shocking and horrible manifestations of larger societal issues. White people don't face the same systematic struggles and discrimination as some others, even in the really small things like being allowed to wear your hair the way that it grows out of your scalp to school and formal settings. \n\nI don't have the energy to argue with you, tbh. Since you're on this sub I assume you're gonna go to college someday; I hope that there you will expand your understanding of the world and open your eyes to new perspectives a little more.",

It\u2019s sucks - trust me.\n\nNo offense, but the actions of your ancestors are entirely out of your control. You can apologize for their actions but you can't claim responsibility for it - did you start the war? did you participate in it? No, you were just born to people who did, which is by no means your fault or responsibility. Your country/government *as a whole* may have some responsibility, but you as an individual really do not. \n\nSimilarly, Chinese & Chinese-Americans do actually admit the legitimate wrongs done by China. For instance, I don't know a single person who condones the treatment of the Muslims - all the Chinese people I know speak out *against* it, and against the CCP overall (my first gen immigrant parents are very against the CCP). Trust me, there's a ton of public denouncing of the CCP, I'm not sure why you think all Chinese people support it? There are people denouncing wet market practices & many nonprofit organizations helping covid-19 victims. \n\nThe biggest issue is the CCP. There are so many Chinese people who have admitted the wrongs and stand against the CCP's actions, but people like you do not take it seriously because the CCP doesn't do anything. News flash: The CCP isn't representative of the thoughts & beliefs of all Chinese people, and Chinese people can't control the CCP's actions. (& honestly, the Chinese population had *no* control over where the virus originated. *maybe* the government did, *maybe* \\- but that doesn't represent Chinese individuals.)\n\nSimilarly. As you said, some cops have apologized sincerely for the actions of others. But people continue to generalize the actions of a few to the entire police force & point out the corruption in the system. They're not listening to the apologies of individuals. They are waiting for the action of the police system as a whole, for the action of the US government.",

It's the same with the BLM movement; basically nobody gave a shit about the CCP or black on black crime until people needed to flip the narrative to downplay the plight of Asians and African Americans respectively. (in no way am i equating my problems with that of which african americans face)\n\nOn a different note, it also sucks that there seems to be a sense of anti-blackness within Asian communities, mainland or American alike, when we need to be standing together in solidarity; so many Asians have been blinded by their relative success and privilege but the racism brought by COVID19 has shown that in the end, it doesn't mean shit",

Asian Americans really only started moving here en masse around that time too. And during WW2, most ally nations were running propaganda campaigns against Asians as a whole. I think all of this ties into the fact that, Americans as a whole find no problem being racist to Asians. I'd say most Americans are also incapable of telling the difference between Asian cultures and lumps them all in as the same, which also gets shitty because well to the average white \"Karen\" anyone from the the eastern side of the planet is \"Chinese\" now.\n\nIts a shame but when you think about it, it sadly makes sense why it's so easy for the average American to be racist towards any Asian.",

Despite only making up 13 percent of the US population, Black Americans are two-and-a-half times as likely as white Americans to be killed by the police.

Thousands of black people are murdered unjustly, and that's not even including the police brutality.\n\nalso black people deal with racism EVERY DAY outside of police brutality. someone saying fuck Chinese is not equivalent to black people making up 35-40% of incarceration while only being 13% of the country. If African Americans and Hispanics were incarcerated at the same rates as whites,\nprison and jail populations would decline by almost 40%. \n\nAfrican Americans and whites use drugs at similar rates, but the imprisonment rate of African Americans for drug charges is almost 6 times that of whites. African Americans represent 12.5% of illicit drug users, but 29% of those arrested for drug offenses and 33% of those incarcerated in state facilities for drug offenses.\n\ncovid discrimination does not equal the work place discrimination black people face. it does not equal the discrimination in our education systems, living conditions, legal systems, etc. Racism affects black people's day to day and has since the beginning of time in America.

Historically, Asians have supported blacks too. Asians4blacklives, the yellow and black panthers, yellow peril for black power, even MLK worked with Asian activists. There are hundreds of more examples. \n\nThe reason why you never hear of this either is again because of those same white institutions. \n\nYou have to realize we didn\u2019t choose to be a model minority, that myth was placed on us by whites. And for millions in our group it\u2019s an outright lie and it actually actively hurts them. Today, There are millions of undocumented immigrants in our community, there are working class, ppl who\u2019s faced systematic barriers, chinese racially prosecuted by the FBI, the list goes on. Some places we have the highest poverty rates of any race. \n\nWe have the largest economic disparities within any racial group. So yes there are those who are privileged in the Asian community but when you make those blanket statements about Asians not experiencing this or should be doing this, realize that you\u2019re undermining a huge part of the population. And contributing to the model minority myth that these whites love to employ.  Rich Asians often love projecting their own privilege over the entire Asian community, and undermine those who are far less privileged within their community.  \n\nI understand your message has good intentions but you need to realize that you may be one of those Rich Asians contributing to the problem if you have had the privilege to ignore the deep rooted racist history and the hundreds of current injustices those within our community faces.

                              "text": "My biggest issue with the og poster of this thread was the expectation of protests specifically for covid related asian discrimination. Asians have every right (and should) to continue to fight against the issues they face in America - wanting the same response as the current BLM movements happening for (specifically) covid related asian discrimination doesn't make sense because it takes the entire context of BLM out. What's happening now is not just about GF, or situation based racism. It's systemic. I wouldn't have an issue if they wanted protests for all the racism asians face in America, bc that's a lot more than just covid.\n\nI 100% agree with what you said (I would like more sources for the largest economic disparity within a racial group - I would like to read more about this). No  one chooses to be the white person's model minority - I understand and respect that, my perspective just came from the fact that there just happens to be many asians who buy into that and benefit from it. Lots of asians also happen to be quite racist to black people (not all, but many. this issue has been self identified as well). I will read more about The Yellow and Black Panthers and other similar organizations of poc solidarity. I would like to learn more about that lynching and overall enslavement of asians in america (this was pre 1960's yes? Asians were treated horrendously in the first half of the 1900s here. Were asians here before the 1900s? I think there's a lot of reading I need to do) I think in my posts I mainly focused on 1970s and on when the majority of the current asian population immigrated here. I do know they had education standards and requirements to come here, so that may have contributed to the model minority mindset. I do apologize for the blanket statements, I did use general statements when addressing asian struggles versus black struggles, and that's not a fair comparison. \n\nI would like to end on how you mentioned a divide between wealthy asians and the large population of undocumented immigrants (and immigrants overall) who make up a large part of the asian community. Do you think the struggles they face are because they're asian or because they're immigrants and/or poor? Are the struggles they face uniquely because of their race or is it more based in their socioeconomic status (is this status for them caused by being asian?) or experience as an immigrant? Can you highlight some of the systemic barriers? What I'm trying to question ultimately is how much of these struggles are predetermined by race rather than situation, because some of those struggles are faced by immigrants and low/middle class people regardless of race. Is the asian-ness what's causing them to be in this situation?\n\nAlso, I am not asian, I am black (an immigrant to America though, so that puts me in a different perspective ig.) I was hesitant to make those posts bc I don't want to detract from the point of this discussion, which is specifically for Asian related struggles. The comparison with the current protests and covid discrimination just really irked me. I definitely have had the privilege to not learn about the deep rooted racism and injustices of your community, so please do educate me on them.",

I\u2019ve gotten all the stereotypical questions about how my English is so good (I was born here), where I\u2019m *really* from, if I eat dog, if I can read some random Asian language, etc. Whenever I worked in group projects or gave presentations, you could always feel the sense of relief some people got when they realized I\u2019m fluent in English and competent. With the pandemic, I fully expect this treatment to get worse, no matter where I go in the world. It just makes me want to scream and remind people that I\u2019m a *freaking American too*, not a wild animal or communist. What really gets me is seeing Asians denigrate other Asians as being \u201cwhitewashed\u201d- so I can\u2019t win. You\u2019re either too Asian or too white.\n\nSo yeah, I get the frustration of black people.

There isn\u2019t explicit racism, but what is implied through body language such as weird stares makes me feel uncomfortable and sometimes even unsafe. My physical appearance is obviously something I can\u2019t change, but I feel like I adapt a lot of my behavior to fit in with the general population which means feeling embarrassed to eat Asian food in front of others or speak Mandarin on the phone with my parents. \n\nI feel like a lot of the ignorance comes from people having a hard time separating the actions of the CCP vs the actions of the general Chinese people. \n\nHowever, as someone that has gone to China and have interacted with mainland Chinese people; there is a lot of hostility against outsiders. Hostility which mainly stems from government propaganda and the lack of interaction with foreigners in many areas. In many first-gen Chinese immigrants, it\u2019s apparent that they still hold some negative stereotypes of other minority groups (just see the way African Americans are described in Chinese) that can only be described as racism such as following African Americans within their stores or calling them derogatory names in Mandarin. I can understand why other minority groups might hold less than great impressions of the Asian/Chinese community, but I think this is the time for POC to stand together as one and fight against the systematic racism that is ingrained into American society.",

People seem to think that the actions of the CCP are representative of the thoughts and beliefs of Chinese people as a whole, when that's far from reality. Most people don't support the CCP at all - my parents hate it - but \"Chinese people/China\" always becomes equated with \"CCP.\" \n\nAnd yeah, China & its people definitely have our fair share of problems, especially hostility to foreigners like you said. So I definitely also see why other minorities may be hostile to us as well. Although I haven't been to mainland China much & had that many interactions there, the racism towards groups like African Americans comes mainly from the older generations (in the US at least, I think). Their actions & beliefs are still persistent, unfortunately. I hope that our generation will be able to make a greater stand against this with other POC & fight against the stereotypes we're all oppressed by.",

Honestly, I wasn\u2019t even aware that I felt this ashamed of my culture, or that racism against Asians was a genuine problem, until relatively recently.\n\nObviously, Asians are privileged in the sense that we don\u2019t face police brutality, we usually aren\u2019t viewed as violent, etc, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have our own issues. That doesn\u2019t make it okay to justify racism against us.

Even when I was younger, I realized that racism against Asians was \u201cokay\u201d. I was just taught to accept it, because being offended by it just meant I was too sensitive. But, I know now that racism against Asians is not okay.\n\nYes, we need to speak up about the injustices of other POC! Especially at a time like right now, we should all do our part in ensuring that everyone gets treated equally.

The first part of the exclusion act allowed teachers , merchants, skill workers and business owner to stay. Then they banned them all in the amendment. This is what Tom cotton is already doing. Banning all Chinese nationals from studying in STEM. They know what they are doing and it's never a straight forward process. Just see the recent camp  on our borders. People get densentized to that shit and the right can push their agenda again to exclude more people.\n\nLet's say we have a Muslim ban now, you may be shocked but you won't be as shocked as when they did it the first time.

The creators describe it as \"A comedy series about the modern Asian American experience\", but it talks about Asian American issues really well.\n\nEpisode 1 has some good lines:\n>We get the sampler platter of racism. We get the mozzarella sticks of being new, freeloading immigrants. We get the potato wedges of being communist enemies of the free world, and a few buffalo wings of segregation via internment camps. And now to top all that, people are saying we get white privilege?...What other ethnic group in America gets to try on every kind of stereotype?\n\n>We get it all, but we don't say shit, and we won't say shit because no one thinks of us in those individual cases.\n\n>Many of us are immigrants, but we don't have the same illegal alien stigma that Latinos have. And we're viewed as foreign enemies dating back to World War II, and now with China and North Korea, but we're not villainized as people from the Middle East. And we do have a level of privilege due to our high economic status, but we're not scrutinized like white people. And lastly, there were literally laws made to segregate us in the past, but unlike the black community, the effect of that institutionalized racism is not as prevalent in our communities decades later.\n\nI agree with Yappie that all minorities have their struggles, that Asians especially occupy a strange place in American society, and that we can and should talk about our struggles without needing to devolve into an \"Oppression Olympics\" with other minorities.",

Now, liberals want us to \"use our privilege to fight racism against blacks.\" These people were silent when young black men were beating up an old asian woman, or when a man kept spraying down a random asian person on the subway. You were silent when my race was being discriminated against but expect me to defend yours? What kind of bullshit is that? And what kind of privilege do I have? My parents escaped as refugees because their country was too dangerous. They came here poor and had to build up everything, but even now we're still at the bottom. I was homeless, I had nothing. I worked for everything I have, yet somehow I'm privileged? \n\nSame thing with those on the right, who suddenly flipped the script on asians being \"bat-eaters\" to the \"model minority\" just to bash on protestors. Like fuck you man, just a week ago you were calling me a \"spy\" or racial slurs, now you want to use me for your bullshit political narrative? Just admit you hate minorities. I don't fully support the protests because there is some hypocrisy about wanting other races to stand up when you refused to do so when Asians were being mistreated, but I recognize that their foundation for protesting is legit. \n\nI realize I'm just using this comment to vent my frustrations.

However, I don\u2019t ignore the racism that Asians face, in fact, it was Black people that rallied behind Asians during COVID because we understand what it\u2019s like to be targeted.",

People began actively boycotting businesses from as early as January. \n\nTo add on about college, there are times when I attend college fairs or meetings that I hesitate to even put down Asian because I feel like there are so many implications with it. Before the college process began, many family members even warned me that when it comes to scholarships and colleges that I won\u2019t be viewed as minority.

It is harmful that Republicans even floated the idea of excluding people of a certain country. Are they from the country that the US has tensions with? Yes, but it's not a very serious tension and it is highly unethical to simply block people from a certain country due to what their government is doing. Historically this has never happened until wartime and even then it gave rise to further acts of racism such as the Japanese internment camps. To call it a \"secure campus\" act is to claim that we need to secure colleges from people of a certain race, which is racism at its core definition - discrimination by ethnicity. It seems to be an excuse to further their agenda of partisanship to extend into higher education, something that I believe should stay out of politics in general.\n\nAnd what are the further implications? Does it mean that they will push for guidelines to be vague, something along the lines of \"anyone that looks Chinese\"? Typically when such proposed laws like these are passed they tend to be followed by waves of harsher and harsher laws of similar agendas.",

I was treated as any other person until COVID-19 started picking up in the US, and that's when my friends and I (all Chinese or Korean-American) were confronted in a Walgreens by a group of other customers with some racist, violent remarks being thrown our way that I won't go into here.\n\nWe eventually defused the situation when some employees intervened and told them to fuck outta there, but it really did drive home the fact that we are only *allowed* to exist here. Our presence here is *tolerated,* and it's conditional. Other Chinese people around me (including my family) have commented on St. Louis being a racist shithole, and it was one of the things I was concerned about coming here. I don't agree completely with what they are saying, but that short altercation did nothing to help matters.",

There are human rights and freedom of speech (to some extent, but it's complicated). I agree with you though, the genocide of the Muslims is horrible along with some of the CCP's other actions. The CCP is honestly one of the biggest reasons for racism against Chinese people, because people think their actions represent the thoughts & beliefs of all Chinese.

First thing I wanna say is that the Japanese internment camps were HORRIBLE and I don\u2019t condone them. But during that time, Japanese internationals were most definitely not allowed to come over and study here. Which makes sense. Why would we allow a country that we have a stiff with to take advantage of our resources?\n\nChina is in poor standing with the US government; a full out war in economic spheres. The CCP is terrible, and I know you know this too, and it has recorded history of infiltrating top universities and research with students. It makes me think: if they\u2019re going to play the game like that, why SHOULD we allow the CCP to continue sending students here? If we\u2019re at such a large stiff with them, why are we continuing to let them infiltrate our schools? I know you recognize the intent of the bill pretty well.\n\nOn the flip side, I do feel bad for all the mainland Chinese students that face the shitty consequences of growing up under the CCP who wouldn\u2019t have access to the wealth of US educational resources. I can clearly see the racism that would be enabled against Chinese-Americans and other Asian-Americans. The whole COVID-19 upsurge in racism is bad enough.\n\nBut what matters more to you? Racism or national security?",

      "text": "As a Chinese-American, I know that stigma in our country towards us has been increasing, especially due to COVID and more broader anti-CCP/China sentiment in the U.S. I\u2019ve faced racist name-calling (chink, yellow, dog-eater, slanted eyes, etc.) my entire life, as I\u2019m sure most of you have, though recently it has felt more widespread and prevalent. It really saddens me, and I really wish average Americans were able to distinguish between Americans of Chinese ethnicity and the Chinese Communist Party when directing their rhetoric. I was born in the United States, and I fully identify as an American, yet I love and respect my Chinese heritage and it frightens me that some don\u2019t consider me as American as they are simply due to my skin color. I am just as American as you are, and I love my country as much as you do.\n\nAt the same time, though, I think we all need to recognize that the SECURE CAMPUS Act (the so-called \u201cChinese Exclusion Act 2.0\u201d that would ban citizens of the People\u2019s Republic of China from completing graduate or post-graduate study in STEM fields at U.S. universities), is a necessary part of a complex response needed to fight the influence of the Chinese government in the United States. It sickens me that we as Americans foot the bill as taxpayers for hundreds of billions of dollars worth of technology and innovation \u2014 from F-35 blueprints, to critical oncology research, to hypersonic missiles \u2014 only to have OUR achievements and successes stolen from us at no cost and illegally copied by the Chinese government. In addition to that, no matter what you think of the current protest/police brutality/Black Lives Matter situation going on in the U.S. right now, China has subjected its own citizens and citizens of other countries to draconian, dystopian practices that are unparalleled in the world in their cruelty (except maybe in North Korea). From concentration camps for Uyghur Muslims, where inmates are taught that the Communist Party is superior to Allah and where there have been reports of executions of innocent people for organ harvesting purposes; to the suppression of Tibetan culture; to 1984-esque \u201csocial credit\u201d scores for citizens; to the imprisonment and execution of political dissidents and pro-democracy agitators; to the lack of freedom of speech, religion, press, or assembly; to the rampant and underreported use of capital punishment and extrajudicial executions; to the lack of free and fair elections; to the repeated violations of the Sino-British Joint Declaration guarantees of freedoms for Hong Kong \u2014 the list goes on and serves to definitively underscore the brutality of the Chinese Communist regime and how they must be treated as an international pariah.\n\nRacism against Asian-Americans, and particularly Chinese-Americans, is a growing problem in the United States. It\u2019s disgusting, and we as a society must fight against it at every turn. However, these new laws that are being proposed to limit the influence of the Chinese government are necessary and totally justified in my opinion. I think the labeling of the SECURE CAMPUS Act as a \u201cChinese Exclusion Act 2.0\u201d is disingenuous because it only applies to current citizens of the PRC (Taiwanese, Singaporeans, Malaysian, etc. citizens of Chinese descent would not be affected, along with any other person of Chinese descent as long as they are not a PRC citizen). It\u2019s not targeted at a particular race; rather, at a particular government which is run as a one-party authoritarian regime and frequently undermines America\u2019s interests at every turn. It might be unpopular on this sub to defend the SECURE CAMPUS Act, but I don\u2019t care \u2014 we as citizens of a free democracy must not allow the Chinese Communist Party to go unchecked, and we must counter their influence whenever possible, even if we have to take the unfortunate step of limiting educational opportunities for PRC citizens (though it is within our rights as a country to do so).\n\nAmerica also has its own problems that it needs to address, but that\u2019s a separate conversation.\n\n**TLDR: Racism in the U.S. against Chinese-Americans and Asian-Americans is growing and it must be stopped, however our government needs to counter the  influence of the Chinese Communist Party and the SECURE CAMPUS Act is just one part of a broader initiative by the U.S. to do just that.**",

In fact, I was born and raised in Hong Kong, so your comments about the CCP's continuous infringement on the promised autonomy of HK really hit home. \n\nI think my main worry about this act is that I really, really, really hope this isn't communicated in the wrong way to the public. Especially with COVID and the way Trump has dealt with China, I feel like it's really easy for this act to give off a message that turns out to be more anti-Chinese people as opposed to anti-CCP.  The bill is intended to prevent the Chinese GOVERNMENT from taking advantage of the US and its accomplishments, and this, undoubtedly, is a very important thing to be concerned about. However, with our current administration and how clickbait-y news is nowadays, I'm quite worried about the amount collatateral damage this will cause to Chinese-Americans' (and also probably Asian-Americans') reputation in society.",

My family is mainly from Beijing, but my aunt and her family live in Shenzhen/Hong Kong. It's so sad to see the freedom and liberty that Hong Kong was promised by the CCP thrown out the window at the first politically expedient moment. I think it really goes to show how little the international community, especially Western countries, can trust the Chinese Communist Party's word. Soon I fear that Beijing will suspend democratic elections, ban the pan-democracy parties, or just decide to just get rid of the Legislative Council entirely and rule HK directly. It's a really sad situation that I wish was getting more international attention.",

                  "text": "Are you seriously saying U.S. media is propaganda controlled by the U.S. government? That's simply a lie. It's not true. I don't know how else to say it. CNN, Fox News, CBS, ABC, NBC, WaPo, NYT, etc. are all independent corporations that the U.S. government has no control over. The U.S. government can't control the content or censor anything unless it's a publically-funded news outlet such as VOA.\n\nImagine if Trump tried to tell CNN to print something or take something off their website because it offended him. Imagine if Obama had tried to tell Fox News what they could/could not say about him on TV. They would be laughed at and probably have had a humiliating story printed about their failed attempt to influence the media.\n\nIn contrast, the People's Daily, CGTN, Xinhua, Global Times, CCTV, and every other mainland news outlet is completely owned, funded, operated, and censored by the Chinese Communist Party. Nothing gets printed, spoken about, or discussed without going through censors. Before my mom immigrated to the U.S., she was actually a culture reporter for China Youth Daily. She told me that every story had to have its content approved by two different supervisors/censors before it could be published.\n\nThe only independent news outlets in China are in Hong Kong (SCMP, HKFP, etc.) I wonder how long they will be able to stay free of central government control with the new national security law.\n\nYour claim simply isn't true -- it doesn't \"go both ways\". There's a simple and clear difference here -- one country has freedom of speech, and the other does not. One country has a free press that holds its politicians to account, and the other does not. One country allows the free practice of all religion, the other does not and goes so far as to actively persecute certain religious groups.\n\nI'll ask you this -- if you think China has such a free press, why don't journalists ever criticize Xi Jinping or the CCP? Why doesn't China's media ever attack the government politically? It happens all the time in the U.S. media -- watch Sean Hannity/Tucker Carlson/Laura Ingraham if you want to see the Democrats get criticized and attacked, and watch Rachel Maddow/Chris Cuomo/Don Lemon if you would like to see the same happen to the GOP.",

I understand quite well the freedoms that are \"enjoyed\" by Chinese citizens. Chinese people cannot access the internet without being subject to the Great Firewall and state censors, Western social media apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, & Twitter are blocked, and content containing political dissent or criticism of the country's leadership is scrubbed from WeChat/Weibo/QQ etc. by censors. Political dissent is a crime punished by imprisonment in China. The CCP literally banned Winnie the Pooh from China because Xi Jinping got offended that people were using the cartoon to mock him.\n\nUyghur Muslims are put in concentration camps in Xinjiang simply because of their religion. The Catholic Church is not allowed to operate in China. Beijing calls the Dalai Lama a terrorist and tries to control Buddhism. Pracitioners of Falun Gong were executed by the hundreds of thousands and had their organs harvested.\n\nAll the major news and media  networks (People's Daily, Global Times, CGTN, CCTV, Xinhua, etc.) are funded by and have their content controlled by the Communist Party. Western media outlets  are heavily monitored and censored, and journalists are often deported for printing stories Beijing doesn't like.\n\nI am well aware of what freedom in China is like -- it's effectively nonexistent. The only freedoms that exist in China are those that the government wants to exist. The same cannot be said of the United States, where our freedoms are enshrined in the Constitution and cannot be changed or limited by the government without a constitutional amendment.",

So, they decided to eliminate Falun Gong: state propaganda outlets called Falun Gong practitioners \"terrorists\" and \"criminals\" and brainwashed the population into hating them, hundreds of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners were imprisoned without trial, and are subject to physical abuse, psychiatric torture, and even execution. Thousands of innocent Falun Gong practitioners were executed for organ harvesting purposes.

I recognize that the vast majority of reporting done on China by American media is done in a negative context, but what they report is true. When the media reports on the plight of the Uyghurs, or the national security law in Hong Kong, or Falun Gong, to portray the actions of China in a positive nature would be to distort the truth. American media outlets are not predisposed to attack China in the interest of the U.S. government -- as I've said, our media outlets are independent of any government and couldn't care less whether they are promoting the interests of the U.S., China, or any other country. They have their own agenda as a corporation. The same cannot be said of Chinese media, which is entirely owned and operated by the state.\n\nI realize that the majority of Chinese people don't feel persecuted by their government. My family in China lives a happy life, and their daily lives are not affected much by Zhongnanhai. However, they are not ethnic or religious minorities, and they do not actively engage in political dissent. They are not pro-democracy agitators, and they do not speak out against the Communist Party. My points are not directed towards people like them but towards those that oppose the rule of the Communists and wish to see structural change and reform in China --- they are not tolerated by the central government and are subjected to imprisonment, torture, or worse. That is a major problem. Dissent must be tolerated, and free speech must be accepted by the government even when it directly opposes their wishes. That is what is missing in China, and I will continue to call out the CCP until they allow that to take place.",

That's why you can't compare this to a Muslim ban, or a Hispanic ban, because the bill is not based on ethnicity or religion. It is based on citizenship. The law would have the same impact on a white person that was a citizen of the PRC as it would a Han citizen of the PRC. Also, this bill targets those who wish to get their education in the U.S. and then immediately return to China and live their life there -- this is not about immigration. The individuals targeted under this bill are PRC citizens who wish to remain PRC citizens and are only coming here to take advantage of our education system and learn from us so that they may use their education to benefit their own country.\n\nThe simple fact is that there are dozens of cases of PRC researchers that have been caught stealing classified material, trade secrets, or other sensitive information and attempting to smuggle it back to China on behalf of the CCP.

Nevertheless, I still feel personally affected by the racist side effects from the hot mess we\u2019re all in.\n\nI\u2019ve read some of the other comments, and it appears that a good number of Chinese-Americans here grew up in predominantly white areas and has experienced issues in the past because of their unique heritage. I grew up in a very mixed/diverse area, but I was still bullied by other minorities. Growing up, I was one of the few Asians in the classroom for every grade level, and was the only Cambodian or Chinese. Got bullied by black kids and Hispanics/Latinos, which is why I stopped caring about the problems of every other race aside from Asian American issues. It turned me into a banana. (You can\u2019t just bully me because of my heritage and expect me to stand up for you when you\u2019re having racial issues, you\u2019re being a hypocrite. You\u2019re on your own, pal. There\u2019s a reason why a small number of Asians participate in things related to the problems of other minorities). When I got to high school, there were a lot of Asian students that I met and they pulled me out of my banana phase. They were mostly Vietnamese, but hey, we Asians need to stick together, right?\n\nFast forward to current events, I\u2019m beyond livid at the number of hate crimes that have been committed against Asians recently because of this pandemic. I see videos of elderly Asians getting attacked by thugs and it makes me wish I could be there to fight those f**kers. To have the audacity to attack our parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles and record it for the whole world to see... it makes me sick to my stomach. Everyday, I fear for my parents\u2019 safety as they go out to work to support the family. Anything could happen in this day and age. People who know me are aware of my Chinese heritage, but right now I\u2019m debating whether or not to keep that hidden from people I meet in the future and just solely identify as Cambodian American. Sure, I\u2019m also ethnically mixed, but it\u2019s not enough to fool people since it\u2019s been pointed out multiple times in the past that my skin is very light for a Cambodian. I\u2019m mostly ethnically Chinese, so ofc I look Chinese, and I\u2019m proud of my roots. But is my pride worth jeopardizing my safety?",

Racism is a tricky subject because I think unconsciously, everyone has learned biases stemmed from stereotypes, their environments, their own homes. Even people who are totally 100% anti-racism and pushing for change. Especially when you live in an area where \u201crace\u201d really isn\u2019t a thing that you confront everyday and you are surrounded by privillege, you don\u2019t realize the biases that you have when you actually meet people. You haven\u2019t heard the struggles of others in different environments, different life paths; other times, you assume these struggles. \n\nMy parents insist that they are not racist (who would say they were?), but have many preconceived notions about other races, like Mexicans and African Americans and Jews, even white people. I have fought these little quips every time I hear them, but truthfully I don\u2019t know. I would be dishonest if I said I didn\u2019t look at someone and assumed wrongfully of their identity. I hear little things in my head that I have to beat with a little stick. So are assumptions normal? Are we able to fix them? Or is to train ourselves to acknowledge our own assumptions and to work every day to allow ourselves to be open? To accept people of all walks of lives for far beyond our initial ideas?\n\nI am privileged enough to be surrounded by opportunity and to not encounter the rampant, obvious racism that occurs in other areas. But this means that underneath there\u2019s a system and highway of racism that occurs everywhere, including, shamefully myself. Until recently, I idealized the sports loving, party going, wealth laden, carefree culture of my local community. I rejected my own culture. I threw out my lunches in middle school because I was ashamed of the pungent smells that would flow out of my thermos. Right now, I am learning more about and supporting the Black Lives Movement. It\u2019s time to talk about race more than ever. Accepting our own biases and finding ways to grow from this is an important step in undermining racism in a country that is so wonderfully diverse.",

While I understand your concern, and can see that you are weighing these issues very carefully (good on you), I don't think this is necessarily as extreme as you would be led to believe. \n\nFirst of all, anyone who compares this to the Chinese exclusion act (IK you didn't but it was mentioned) is participating in horrid intellectual dishonesty. The bill was a complete ban on immigration because Americans were both racist and concerned for their jobs. It served only to maintain a minority that could be discriminated against. \n\nThis bill, on the other hand, is about diplomacy. In recent years, there have been a large number of Chinese (and some American) students who have sold research that our government funds to China. Right now, we are in somewhat of an economic feud with them and their current government, if in control of greater extents of technology, has the potential to dominate global markets. If this occurs, you can start to see the spread of their totalitarian regime across larger extents of the world. It has already started in many parts of Africa, China now controlling major economic hubs in the region by giving funds and building infrastructure, much of which they have control over. \n\nTo cap this, this bill is being discussed. It does not ban Chinese immigrants, instead disallowing them from being granted visas solely to go to college in the US. This may not be ideal, but in times of chaos, it may be necessary. If we continue to allow the Chinese to participate in their violations of human rights and theft from our county, we would simply be participating in appeasement. By creating situations like these and cutting China off from the resources they so desperately want, they may be forces to reassess their treatment of citizens and other countries. (There are also waivers for specific groups)\n\nI understand your feelings- modern society has been defined a lot by race.

Let's define \"ethnic group\": a community or population made up of people who share a common cultural background or descent, according to Google. Okay, so people from India tend to share a cultural background and similar descent. \"Similar descent\" often leads to more similar physical looks as well, but that is *not* how I, or Google itself, defines an ethnic group. You can argue East Asians look similar, but they are still separated into groups such as Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, etc.\n\nSimilarly... I mentioned \"people from the Middle East *who speak Arabic*\" are called Arabs. Where did you extrapolate \"only based on their physical looks\" from? There are many other ethnic groups in the Middle east, such as Kurds and Palestinians. They possibly look similar to Arabs, but again I did not claim that this is how this \"categorization\" works. Please don't extrapolate from what I said.\n\n\\----\n\nAccording to Google, the definition of an \"XX-American\" is something like \"Americans of XX heritage *or descent*.\"\n\nIf you are Korean with no cultural connection to Korea, you are still Korean & you are still Asian. Describing yourself as an XX-American doesn't mean you have to embrace XX culture or be proud of it - if you are descended from it, you are XX. If people don't like it, it might be because they feel like they have to celebrate/be proud of their other culture/background, but that doesn't have to be part of it. I mean, if people want to identify themselves as just \"Americans,\" go for it. But on official forms and such, you'll find that they still have to at least indicate the race they're descended from.",

So are German Americans, Spanish Americans, etc etc. Maybe they're less commonly used, but it's definitely applicable to \"white\" people.

Like I said, just because you have a certain ancestry doesn't mean you're part of that culture. My boyfriend is half Japanese (& half large mix of Europe), but he doesn't really identify with his Japanese side - doesn't know the language, doesn't celebrate its holidays, follow its traditions, etc etc - so like you he identifies more with the American nationality aspect. But if someone asks him \"what he is,\" he's still going to mention his Japanese aspect, & on forms he puts that he has Asian descent - you know? Like he doesn't feel like he belongs in the cultural aspect & such, and he doesn't need to since he's comfortable with America & that identity. But I guess I'm just saying that the Japanese ancestry is still *there*, it's not something he can get rid of, but you don't have to personally identify with it. If that makes sense? Idk",

The policies toward international students are getting harsher too and I do feel I\u2019m being suppressed at least on job marketing. \nAfter George Floyd\u2019s death, I\u2019m experiencing mixed feelings of angry and shame.. I\u2019m angry at police\u2019s brutality and some people\u2019s apathy or racism, and I feel shame that I didn\u2019t actually go protest cause of the pandemic. Other than that, i started to think about all my privilege as an Asian girl and my identity benefits me in many aspects. A simple example, I only received several driving warnings when I were supposed to receive tickets... and now those benefits make me ashamed.. \ni should probably make an appointment for therapy session...",

When you\u2019re an American you can avoid these types of stuff by hiding your Chinese identity but my fellow Chinese friends and I can\u2019t. I could hear comments about us all the time, how we \u201ctry to please the teachers\u201d when we study literally for our own futures. And when you get good grades and awards it all comes down to the fact the you are Chinese. \nWhat\u2019s hard for us Chineses who already come to the US for high school is that we don\u2019t feel belonged in China anymore cuz we choose a different path, and we can\u2019t blend in American society as well. Literally now I\u2019m in China and my middle school friends are still at school I don\u2019t even know who I can hang out with. And when I call my American friends in English while walking down the streets ppl stare at me all the time.

My mother and all her side are from and live in Hawaii which is definitely more diverse and accepting than the deep south which we live in now. I went to a predominately white, private school and always felt uncomfortable with the fact that I wasn't completely white. I mostly can pass as white but with some prominent Asian features from my grandmother ( my mom has always said that I look the most Asian even though my mom is half white and Asian ). So luckily I've never really gotten called anything but, I was always horrified to tell anyone at my that I was part Asian. Our school had Korean exchange students for a while until all the redneck bumkins at my school started being extremely racist they were asking all of them if they ate dog, warning everyone to keep their dogs away from the Asians, saying they were dirty, asking if they could see because they have squinty eyes, mocking accents, pulling their eyes to mock them, and saying they were hideous because of their Asian features. slowly they all left and I became the only person who was remotely Asian left. I only told my friends that I was mixed but they always invalidated me when I tried to learn more about my Chinese and Korean culture \"even though you look kinda Asian you're mostly white you shouldn't try\". Even though I'm not fully Asian there was serious racism and struggles for the Koreans (who everyone still called Chinese even though they were all Korean) who went to my high school, so I definitely feel uncomfortable with the new issue with calling Chinese student spies and am afraid it will make the ignorant like my peers at my old highschool even crueler to Asians especially of Chinese descent.",

As much as it does piss me off that people take sides without much knowledge of what they do, their ignorance is something ive learned to ignore, because theres really nothing anyone can do but them. To be as racist or as violent as some people are in this country, is less a matter of what happens here and more what happens here gives them an excuse to act on their twisted sence violence and racism. Since theres not much I can do about it, I dont really concern myself with the problem and go about my usual american/vietnamese life.\n\nIt does though seens rather weird how it is racist to say anything about black people, though asians must take the brunt of whatever people say like its not the least bit racist and theres not really a blm equivilent for asians that defend asian people quite so, at least that i know of. I do know theres s subreddit like r/stopasianracism or something but i think it sounds kind of stupid bc its mirroring like the blm movement that id rather not stoop to. More so it should be all racism in general, but i understand the need to specify how asians do get the brunt of it, aside from the eurasians of course.",

But please know that the silence from some individuals doesn't mean the entire race is silent. I know that many of us *have* called to end racism before. Maybe we need to shout it louder so that everyone can hear. But I hope that we can stand with other minorities instead of being divided from them.",

                  "text": "I understand that I won't be changing your view anytime soon. I'll just list leave a few facts from history here that you can fact check yourself. \n\n1854: Supreme Court case People v. Hall ruled that Chinese Americans were not allowed to testify in court, the same as African & Native Americans.\n\nMay 6, 1882: The Chinese Exclusion Act was signed. This banned all Chinese immigration into the US & all challenges were unsuccessful; in 1902 it was made permanently illegal (obviously got lifted later on). The Exclusion Act followed decades of racism & discrimination towards the Chinese, largely due to the Gold Rush. Search up \"anti Chinese propaganda\" and you will find a multitude of racist depictions that were widely shown & believed at the time. There was *serious* anti-Asian sentiment. \n\n1892: Geary Act of 1892. Chinese residents in the US had to carry special documentation at all times, or they would be sentenced to hard labor or deported.\n\n1924: Immigration Act of 1924. Severely limited immigration from many countries like Mexicans, certain Europeans, and Japanese, because they were considered \"undesirable.\"\n\n1942: Due to Japan's alignment with the Axis powers, there was VERY severe anti-Japanese sentiment. Search up \"anti Japanese propaganda\" and, similar to 1882, you'll find a *ton* of racist propaganda. Dr. Seuss himself was anti-Japanese and created many racist cartoons. This was representative of America's overall sentiment at the time. \n\n1942 to 1945: FDR signs Executive Order 9066. This forced *every single* Japanese-American (around 120,000) to leave their homes - they didn't have a choice. They were sentenced to Japanese internment camps for the majority of the war, where living conditions were very poor and many died. Why did this happen? Other than already-present racism towards Asian Americans, America felt that the actions of Japan meant that every single Japanese-American was a spy.\n\n2020: Covid-19. I'm not elaborating on this for obvious reasons.",
