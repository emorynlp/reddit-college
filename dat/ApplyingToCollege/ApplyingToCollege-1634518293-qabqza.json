  "text": "So I\u2019m applying REA to Stanford and one of the supplementals prompts applicants to write about something meaningful to them and why. I find that to be a very broad question but after doing research most sources recommend using this prompt to tie in an EC or volunteer experience. However, I want to write about leaves, like how they\u2019ve become meaningful to me as a result of my grandfather. Do y\u2019all think doing so is a good idea or no :/ ? I really need some advice/outside opinions. \n\n(I\u2019ve written an essay from both perspectives and undoubtedly the leaf one is better so I just want to know if I should keep revising the volunteer one or if it wouldn\u2019t be detrimental to stick with the leaves)",

          "text": "Yeah maybe research should be used lightly. But from purusing different websites the jist seemed to be using this supp to expand upon a mentioned activity. I could also have tunnel vision given that I\u2019m well aware my EC\u2019s are the weakest part of my app, and I\u2019m projecting that insecurity onto the information I\u2019m obtaining.\n\nAnyways,\nSo you think writing about the leaves/my grandfather would be an appropriate topic for the essay?",
