Instead, check out alumni participation rate, i.e. the rate at which alumni give \\*any\\* money whatsoever.\n\nMost Ivies clock in around 22-24%.  Princeton and Dartmouth significantly higher.  Various LACs in the 45-50% range.  This suggests either something is fundamentally different about the the \"experience\" at the LACs, and/or something is fundamentally different about the students who select into them.",

I certainly don't endorse alumni giving rate as the \\*single\\* meaningful measure of the education a school provides.\n\n(Though, I could see it being \"more meaningful\" than many/most people give it credit for.)",
