          "text": "  \nSeptember 27, 1989  \nOne of the more absurd concerns in recent years has been the  \n\"better dressed, better looking\" syndrome, in which the type of  \nclothing worn has been used to raise doubts concerning the quality of a U of C  \nstudent.  \nMeanwhile, the suspicion that the quality of a U of C  \neducation has deteriorated and continues to deteriorate lurks in the shadows  \nand gets comparatively little airplay. Which says something about the  \nUniversity of Chicago, and those of us who work and study here. Apparently,  \nwe're much more concerned over appearances than we are over substantive  \nmaintenance, fretting about our makeup and ignoring the sag underneath.  \nFortunately, we've got a lot of places we can point our fingers at for that:  \nThe administration, of course, for being uncooperatively  \nsilent; the faculty, for concentrating too much on their intramural squabbles  \nand not enough on the University as a whole; the students, because most are  \napathetic and those who aren't are too hysterical to be taken seriously; the  \nuniversity newspaper, which in the last few years seems to have been intent on  \ndestroying itself and its credibility with its community through infighting,  \nlack of ethics, and sloppiness.  \nEveryone's got someone to pin the blame on and the buck  \nkeeps getting passed in a circular path.  \nHere's a fact that may interest you. What the University of  \nChicago is has nothing to do with what it's supposed to be. What it is is what  \nyou are and what you decide to do with your time here.  \n...  \nThe University of Chicago is great, not for what it is, but  \nfor what it can be; those who've understood this are those who've given the  \nUniversity its greatest achievements and its biggest headaches. Sometimes  \nsimultaneously. Robert Maynard Hutchins, who gave the U of C plenty of both,  \nsummed it up in 1930 when he wrote to Mortimer Adler, \"There's going to be  \nno University in the world like Chicago, and besides we could have a hell of a  \ngood time.\"  \nJohn Scalzi, editor in chief",
