  "text": "Hi!\nI'm an international student hoping to transfer to a US college.\nAs an international student I had a couple of questions I hope\nyou guys could help me with.\n1) Is there anything I should take note of?\n2) Are there any unspoken rules? Such as a limit to the number of\ncolleges I can apply to at once?\n3) Should I take the SATS although this year is stated as a\n\"SATS optional\" year?\nThanks!",
