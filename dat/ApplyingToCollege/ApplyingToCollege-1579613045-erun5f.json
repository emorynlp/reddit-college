Mine was that the major I wanted to study had no equivalents in the universities near home. Now, I didn't move out of state, but ended up dorming 100 miles away from them. By making them unaware of my true intentions, my parents were more cooperative with their financial papers, but, after that, though, I just moved on with life. Once I got what I needed from them, I kind of just left them and the stress they gave me behind.",

Dorms and meal plans run about 15k a year. I most likely will stay here and commute to my local UC. I just don't want to spend the rest of my life paying school loans.
