  "text": "I've seen THE do reputation rankings, but I'm assuming this is reputation in the academic sphere. I've never even heard of half the unis on that list. Here's my list - I've based it on: \"If I were to survey 100 random people, how many would know of each university\"\n\n1. Harvard (obv)\n2. MIT\n3. Stanford\n4. Yale\n5. Princeton\n6. UC Berkeley\n7. Columbia\n8. Duke\n9. Wharton \n10. UPenn\n11. Caltech\n12. UChicago\n13. Brown\n14. Cornell\n15. UCLA\n\nYou can prob put Oxbridge right beneath Harvard if you want to consider international schools. LSE, UofT and McGill would be somewhere bw Duke and Caltech (they're defo known more globally).\n\nAgain, j my opinion.",

(Referring to name recognition, not necessarily prestige.)\n\nInternationally, I\u2019d say NYU carries a lot of prestige.",
