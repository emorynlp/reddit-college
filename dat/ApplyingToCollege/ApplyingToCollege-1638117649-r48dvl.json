      "text": "Every school determines what need is. USC I believe has some very competitive scholarships for tippy top students but otherwise aren\u2019t really known for being generous. If you are finding out that most schools are out of budget then look for schools a tier or two lower than what your stats suggest to you. They\u2019re much likelier to want you more if you\u2019re in the top of the applicant pool. If your parents can pay cash $10,000/yr then add fed loan of $5,500/fr year plus a few thousand from working in summer, you have a budget of $18-20,000/fr year. That covers room and board nearly everywhere with some leftover towards tuition. Definitely keep running NPC\u2019s everywhere and expand your search, plus research any scholarships you might qualify for like agreements with other states where you pay reduced tuition. Good luck, it truly sucks how expensive college is.",
