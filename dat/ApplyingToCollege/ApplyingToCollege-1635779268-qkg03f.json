  "text": "I was unable to get letters of rec from a stem teacher because my math teacher for freshman/sophomore year moved away and my cs teacher retired. This was all during the pandemic. I also explained how my junior year was entirely online and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable asking junior year teachers as I didn\u2019t think they understood me as well as my sophomore year ones. Should this go under Covid-19 essay or additional information?",
