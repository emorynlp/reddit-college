  "text": "I'm doing my AP Lang final speech on how CollegeBoard is a corrupt, inefficient monopoly whose programs exacerbate the very systemic inequalities they claim to be fighting. \n\nY'all got any screenshots of the CollegeBoard site crashing/being terrible or any CollegeBoard-related memes? More specifically, screenshots I could put into my presentation? \n\nI'd like to decorate my slides with some memes & student complaints that aren't coming from just kids at my school to emphasize the point that their user interface is sloppy AF and even though they have absurd amounts of money & resources to fix these issues at any point, they DON'T.\n\n:) thanks in advance! \n\n(yes, I also posted this on r/APStudents)",
