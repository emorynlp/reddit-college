  "text": "I'm an international student. I remember wanting to go there back in 2019 when I was in 9th grade. It was a mere interest and I kind of forgot about the whole application plans I had due to school and stuff. But now I suddenly want to go there again after I stumbled upon the college application to-do list I made 2 years ago  \n\n\nhere's my ecs  \n\n\n\\-I'm really into physics and has been doing a physics blog. I've won an IPhO bronze medal (2020).  \n\\-I was also the leader of a national service program in our school for 11th and 12th grade.  \n\\-I've been also doing music production and have produced 2 albums (instrumental; mostly orchestral, experimental, ethnical)  \n\\-I'm also into speculative zoology and worldbuilding. I've been drawing a lot because of this\n\nI've heard it has gotten a lot more competitive, i don't really have any awards besides that one bronze medal (I wanted to participate this year too but I was under a lot of stress earlier this year and didn't even try)  \n\n\nI haven't taken the AP exams and the SATs. I missed out on the whole application process. I assume it's over by now. Should I wait & apply next year or just go to a local college this year?",

What are you doing during the gap year?\n\nAP tests are irrelevant - in fact schools are trying to discourage kids form trying to transfer too many AP credits. Also if you took the courses a while back, your knowledge may be waning and you never want to \"jump off the deep end\" into advanced courses at MIT - you'll drown - some repetition is always healthy!\n\nThe rest of the apps - assuming your grades/rigor is up to par - highlight any relevant research/independent projects that you might have done. Write well about them.\n\nMake sure your essays are uplifting/original and don't put readers to sleep and DON'T FOLLOW popular patterns ... (like relative sick/dying => my desire to become a doctor) ... write about I dunno ... drunk muon particles?\n\nGood luck! MIT is a spectacular place, but getting in doesn't have to be a bitch of your existence. If your local school is good enough (depending on where you're from MFTI? Tsinghoa? IIT?), you can always go to grad school to MIT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheers",
