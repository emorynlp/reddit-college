  "title:": "(STORY) Don\u2019t be so fucking hard on yourself man",
  "text": "From a young age I\u2019ve always felt like I was never enough. Never enough for my parents peers and myself. I indulged in self help, bouncing from one self help to another self help book. I set timers to be on my Uber productive shit doing everything in one day. You name it, trading stocks, I learnt, French, I learnt, cooking, I learnt, python, I learnt, piano, I learnt all in one day everyday. What I realized was how much of a toll it took on me. I didn\u2019t hang out at all because it was a \u201cwaste of time\u201d, I didn\u2019t watch tv or movies because I could be doing something more productive, I felt like a fucking robot. This was my life for years. Until someone asked me\u2026\u201dWhat do I do for fun\u201d - I sat there and grinned boasting about every single meaningless activity I\u2019ve done. Until he cut  me off mid sentence and said, \u201cOne thing, just one thing that\u2019s meaningful to you, something\u2026you know\u2026that brings the inner child out of you\u201d. I sit there contemplating  on what makes me feel like a child. Is it going on water slides? Nah haven\u2019t been on those in the past 7 years, rollercoasters? No, Music? It\u2019s a distraction.\n\nSee all of this time, I warped my entire day based on the sole idea of having a productive day, filling out my day with meaningless bullshit for the sake of productivity. Made sense why I didn\u2019t have friends to begin with, I couldn\u2019t answer a simple question about a meaningful interest. In retrospect, it makes me so sad/mad, I\u2019ve been so hard on myself for years, even before high school. I\u2019ve been In so many dark places my entire life, whether physical or emotional. But convincing yourself that, that specific type of productivity is toxic and is actually hurting you mentally, Is one of the hardest things to do.\n\nThe effects has made me become an over-achiever who obsessed over every little detail until it\u2019s perfect. All I\u2019m saying is don\u2019t be too fucking hard on yourself, I don\u2019t want people making the same mistakes I did",

      "text": "I can relate to this so much. Since junior year, I have the exact same mindset. I want my life to be more \"productive\". As results, I stopped hanging out with friends because I think it's a waste of time, I rarely watch any movies at all, and I never going out to anywhere except on saturdays, even when I'm out, my mind is haunted with the thought of \"if i'm having fun like this, I wouldn't get into my dream uni! I'm so unproductive!\". I have no friends now.\n\nNeedles to say, It resulted pretty well, my grades improved. I took several tests on junior year that let go a heavy pressure in me in senior year, but I still have so many tough exams to go through.\n\nSomeone asked me too, \"what I usually do for fun\", and I literally have no idea what to say, because my life has been bland and repetitive. I never thought of doing anything meaningful for fun anymore. I have no other choices and I still have two major entrance exams to do that will determine my future. It's kinda sad, but it is what it is.",

      "text": "Ah. I can't relate no more. I have got not a single friend. Not a meaningful hobby. Not a meaningful day. I loved playing chess, watching movies, hanging out with friends, but I quit ALL THAT. Everyone is just an acquaintance of mine now. Beside my studies and ECs, I have got no life. What I do is just study or meaningless procrastination. Just, so fucking fed up. And now I find myself in a shitty situation as such. Deadlines, pressures, exams, self-doubts and NO FUCKING person to comfort. I talk to my family. All they discuss is about my app process. I got no friends, just you people. So, what I did was divide my mind into two parts with whom I talk. Other than these I have NO ONE.\n\nBut fuck YEAH. I will do well. I will go to college, doesn't matter good or bad. I WILL MAKE FRIENDS. I will work with PEOPLE. MY PEOPLE. I will do great. IT'S JUST 4-5 MONTHS OF STRUGGLE, TO SAY THE LEAST.\n\n**I CAN DO IT. OH YES AND YOU, YES YOU, CAN DO IT. AND THIS IS WHAT KEEPS ME AWAKE AT NIGHT. THIS IS WHAT KEEPS YOU AWAKE AT NIGHT OR WAKES YOU UP EARLY IN THE MORNING. FUCK YEAH. WE CAN DO IT!!!**",

I've got basically no reason to present to AOs to provide a reason for them to admit me. And say, I don't get in anywhere with good aid, I'm still probably likely going to graduate with sub-par grades. I know it doesn't precisely seem like ruining, but I've destroyed the end result of all the work I put into my academic life. And, I'll be ending HS with a grand total of one friend, so it's a bit of a distress right now.\n\nEdit: I'm sorry about the sentence structuring errors, my head's a frenzy rn.",

You will never regret learning something useful, while watching netflix and getting drunk on parties is surely something to regret.

Besides, studying is just so much more meaningful than the things teenagers do for fun. You are coming face to face with the truth of the universe. At least that\u2019s how I feel. On the other hand, partying dosnt usually teach you anything or even give you any valuable friendships. In fact, when I tried having that \u201efun life\u201d, some bullies noticed me and picked me as their target. Hence, I regret every second spent partying, while its the opposite for studying.",
