  "text": "[https://admissions.camden.rutgers.edu/paying-for-college](https://admissions.camden.rutgers.edu/paying-for-college) Here's the Rutgers Bridging the Gap Program. It seems to not matter if I wen't to Rutgers first because I think I'd qualify for the \"**$0 - 65,000: 100% of the difference\"** but my cousin has **20k in debt** and I think she qualifies for the \"**$0 - 65,000: 100% of the difference\"** so I just want a second opinion on whether I should go to community college first to save money.\n\nMy dad got really mad at me when I said I wanted to go to community college first so that's why I'm wondering if it makes a difference.",
