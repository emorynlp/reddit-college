  "text": "\nHi all, I am confused with what I should do. My teacher has written my recommendation letter and has asked to put in her email in Common App, but I want to apply to most ( if not all ) colleges through their own application portal. Does that mean that I need to invite them every single time through each portal? If so, should I just use Common App to make it easier for her?",
