  "text": "Might sound a bit broad question, but i\u2019m curious how much of the college app is actually based on luck. Like say a person has good test scores/grades but have a average top20 kid EC\u2019s, then that person\u2019s acceptance would likely based on luck? Idk i feel like while there is always a reason in why a person gets in, at the same time a lot of it has to do with luck. Wish colleges tell us why we get rejected\ud83d\ude3f",

      "text": "luck definitely plays a big role, it's all about what the college feels they have a need for that specific year. For ex, if one year all of the flute players are about the graduate, they need a lot of flute players and will accept more. But in the next year they don't need any more because they just accepted a bunch. It's all random and out of our control after a certain point- especially for the average t20 applicant",

      "text": "Yeah I think there is a lot of luck. I mean, so many people have top stats and great extracurriculars and we\u2019re all unique and all that. I can\u2019t even imagine being an AO at a T20. I feel like, in the end, you\u2019d have to find minor/silly reasons to accept or reject some candidates, since sooo many students are qualified. And yeah, it would be so nice to know why we got rejected\u2026Like then at least I could attempt to fix the problem before submitting it to other schools",

If you talk to admissions people they will often say, especially with essays, sometimes the mood or experiences of the person reviewing your application will affect whether you are admitted (obviously they try to make it fair but nothing in life is 100% fair - with essays sometimes your essay will really resonate with someone and sometimes it just won\u2019t impress another person)",
