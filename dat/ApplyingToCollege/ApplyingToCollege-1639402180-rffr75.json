  "title:": "Not an applying question but how do I find out what courses are required to move on to next semester?",
  "text": "I am worried about my grades and need to do well on my exam to pass the core courses. I think I have two electives? Student success and College Communications (like English pretty much). They both very annoyingly put their final assignments due the day before all my exams. Which I probably will not be finishing on time. So I\u2019m trying to figure out if I need these courses to move onto next semester and can take them again.",
