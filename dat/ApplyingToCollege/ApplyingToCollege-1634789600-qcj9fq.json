  "title:": "Should I ask for a letter of recommendation from a Master\u2019s Student?",
  "text": "I am planning to ED to a school, and I also lucky to have an excellent mentor who is the lab manager of my lab but is also a masters student at my ED school. I have worked with her for many hours over the course of the past 8 months and she knows me and my project well; she can vouch for my self-interest and commitment to the lab. However, I have only talked to the PI of my lab twice in real life, so I did not ask for a letter of recommendation from him. Lately though, I am wondering if I made a mistake since the PI has a PhD unlike the grad student. Or is the grad student I\u2019m asking a letter of recommendation from the better choice since she knows me better, is still qualified since she is lab manager, and is already at my ED school?",

      "text": "I\u2019m in a similar situation, I\u2019m doing research with a PhD student at my dream school and a PhD graduate from said school working as a post-doc. They both wrote my letter, but we\u2019re all doing the project together. Personally, I\u2019d go for the grad student if they know you better.",
