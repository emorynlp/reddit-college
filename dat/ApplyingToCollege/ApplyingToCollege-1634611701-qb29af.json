  "text": "Hi! \nMy research was accepted /is being presented at a conference later this month and I was wondering how I would list it on my common app?\n\n I am the second author on it and it's based on the research I did this summer as a part of another activity. Would I list this as an honor, in my description of the activity, or in the additional information section?\n\nThank you so much!",
