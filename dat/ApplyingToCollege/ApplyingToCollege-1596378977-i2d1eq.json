  "title:": "Somebody plagiarised my common app essay",
  "text": "So look I like writing, and I started writing my common app essay like from fuckin end of junior year and mostly ended up scrapping them. So around April-May 2020 I kind of had like a first draft of something I wanted to put on my app. I naturally wanted people to review it now I was careful and everything with who I was sharing my essay with, the first 2 people I shared it with there was solid proof they were in college. The first one was kinda not helpful (not trying to be ungrateful just all they did was correct punctuation so) but the second one was bomb like that guy was a freshman and started this essay reviewing service recently and basically did it for free for me cause I was one of the first people. (This was all on college confidential btw) \n\nI was sooo happy that when the third dude emailed me (I put my email in the chat cause I hadn\u2019t unlocked the pm thing on cc) and said that he was a sophomore as Harvey Mudd~ I kinda, sorta, didn\u2019t check his post history. And yea so that dude ended up helping me with my essay but also telling me that he was a junior too (oop-) and was gonna take a few lines here and there cause he had a shit gpa and needed an awesome essay and told me not to worry cause he\u2019d just be applying to state schools. So like a normal person I freaked out anddddd didn\u2019t do anything tbh for quite some time. \n\nAnd about 2-3 weeks ago i was re-reading the essay it seemed pretty average to me so I thought why not just move on write a new essay. Which I did, and I like this one more than the previous one cause I was trying to hard to be qUiRkY or whatever in the prev one (seriously though I referenced Dora like wtf I really thought I did something there didn\u2019t I?) anyway I see it as a blessing in disguise cause I like this essay more (but ya never know there was a time I loved the previous one too)\n\nMy point is bitch, I got lucky cause I shared it early and got scammed early. Nobody got time to get scammed now okay? All of you people we gotta write supplements, and the common app essay. DONT BE A DUMB BITCH LIKE ME OKAY? Cause I don\u2019t doubt that you can write a better essay in its place, you probably can. But we don\u2019t have that much time now aight? Also that dude had the fuvkin audacity to add a girl\u2019s nude in the google doc that I allowed him to edit and tried to talk dirty to me after he was done reviewing it. People are shit. Honestly. Just take care of yourselves please. \n\nThere are a lot of very smart people on this sub. Yeah. This post isn\u2019t for you. This is for my fellow gullible girlypops out there. Just check who you\u2019re talking to and if their identity can\u2019t be confirmed then fuck it. We\u2019re not that desperate for reviews.",
