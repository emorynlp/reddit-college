  "text": "So im going to go into IB next year and im still trying to decide what courses I want. I'm thinking about going into medicine but for that Id need Bio and Chem at HL and im probably gonna take Global Politics at HL as well. Thing is medicine is hard so my backup plan is to go into Politics (Thats why Ill take Global Politics), which was actually my first choice but i changed to medicine cause theres no money in the field of Politics. However, most good universities need like full 6s in HL and if I find Bio and Chem to be hard i probably wont be able to get 6s in them, thus ruining my chances to do both Politics and Medicine. So I'm kinda stumpt on what to do, do I go with full Politics which would be easier or Medicine with a chance at Politics. There's also the fact of trying to find internships or extra courses on Politics which is really hard where I live, it being a monarchy and all, not many people are interested in Politics. Can anyone who did IB help me?",
