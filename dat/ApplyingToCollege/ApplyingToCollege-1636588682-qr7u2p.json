  "text": "Hey guys, I know I should\u2019ve already had my college list down and I applied to a few colleges early action anyways. However I found out my ACT score was better than I thought so I may have a better chance at out of state. Stats: 30 ACT superscore, 3.8 GPA and a strong list of extra curriculars. Is there any schools that would give a decent amount of money for those stats?",

(South Dakota State, etc.)\n\nNOT examples: UMich, UCLA, U of Washington, etc - very pricy to attend as an OOS student. No need-based and very little merit-based aid - $55000 to $71000 to attend as an OOS student.\n\nSorry if that didn't make sense. Message me if you have questions about specific universities. Thanks!",
