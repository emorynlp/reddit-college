I applied ED Columbia, had an alumni interview, and after 45 minutes of really interesting discussion, he literally said (I kid you not) \u201cYou are incredibly intelligent and well rounded and you are the perfect fit for Columbia. WHEN you get in, please let me know. I am going to write a stellar recommendation to the admissions committee for you.\u201d Overall my stats and ECs are pretty good imo. I ended up getting rejected. You seem like a strong applicant so don\u2019t worry about the interviews too much. Obviously try your best and exemplify yourself, but as long as the interviewer doesn\u2019t say anything bad, you will be fine.",

              "text": "Honestly, it was pretty disappointing. Obviously, I wasn't expecting to get in considering its an ivy, but it definitely boosted my confidence. In the end, with schools like Columbia, there are so many qualified applicants and you can't really predict anything. Of the 4 people who got into Columbia ED from my school, 3 were legacies. Don't get me wrong, they were all very qualified, but you can kind of surmise a major factor of their acceptance. It's the college admissions world we live in and the only thing we can do is try our best to write great essays, work hard in school, do well on standardized tests, and participate in our communities. The rest if up to the colleges. And sometimes, things don't go our way, whether it was a better candidate, the school wanted more diversity, took an athlete over you, or even took legacy. It sucks, but we just have to keep looking and work our hardest. I have no doubt that everyone on this sub will get into a college they are happy with considering everyone is literally brilliant. Personally, I recently applied Early Decision 2 to the University of Chicago and honestly, I think I love it more than Columbia. I know that's the attitude a lot of us have towards our RDs after getting deferred or rejected from EDs/REAs, but I have genuinely fallen in love with the UChicago, and I spent days working on their essays to hopefully convey that love. Now it's out of my hands and I just have to hope UChicago agrees that I'm a good fit. I guess we'll see? Anyway, that was a long response, but best of luck to you and your college admissions decisions!",

They are alumni so they have been in your shoes. Specifically tho, they do a lot to try and keep your hopes high and comfort you. I found that my interviewers constantly reminded me that I had a very strong application and I was very well rounded. You feel great about your achievements but in reality, they may not have said their comments with the highest sincerity. As many of the comments to this post will say, interviews are not super important. They are a chance for the college to know a little bit more about you. But you know how else they can know more about you? Through your application and your essays. You probably repeat a lot of things in your interviews that are already in your essays. Anything new you might have said would likely be so simplified by the interviewer that the university likely never even knows about it. Don\u2019t stress! You\u2019ll be fine!",

For starters, every applicant gets an interview - even if they are totally unqualified based on scores/grades. And the interviewers get no information about the candidates (just their name and high school).  I interviewed a student ED this year who was the most impressive candidate I'd seen in 5 years, and I said that the school should do anything they could to admit her. I've never said anything like that. She was rejected. I've interviewed about 25 students, and I think 2 have gotten in. I cannot tell you a single reason why those two got in and not the others. I'm sure there were reasons, but the interview wasn't one of them. So don't stress about the interviews - just relax, be polite, answer the questions, ask a few of your own questions, and call it a day.",
