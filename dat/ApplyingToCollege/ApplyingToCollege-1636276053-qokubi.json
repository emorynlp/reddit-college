  "text": "For two of my internship activities, i mistakenly put academic Activity as the category. I have submitted that to UT Autin. Is it fine?\n\nAlso for one of my activity where I was part of a startup, i didn't write what the startup does, but one of my essay is completely about that activity where I have mentioned what the startup does. Should this be fine as well",
