  "text": "I didn't include my SSN on Common App because I'm not applying for need based financial aid. But I want to be eligible for merit scholarships, so I submitted a bunch of applications EA/priority deadline. Now I'm worried that I won't even be considered because I didn't submit a FAFSA by that deadline. \n\nCan anyone provide some insight? Is FAFSA even necessary to be considered? Can I submit it after the priority deadline or is it too late?",

      "text": "Aid deadlines are often later than application ones, and if it's for merit aid and not need based the priority date may not matter.  I would certainly submit the FAFSA still - it's a free form that should be pretty quick to do, usually well under an hour.\n\nSome schools require it for merit aid, but many don't.  Often they just want it because merit aid could impact other parts of an aid package (obviously not in your case).",
