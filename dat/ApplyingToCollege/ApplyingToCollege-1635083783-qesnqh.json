      "text": "Sit down with them and go over the numbers line by line, looking for missing decimals, extra zeroes, any other typos. Mistakes do happen!\r  \n\r  \nPSA: colleges use the FAFSA form to help calculate need. However, FAFSA EFC, by itself, does not tell students what they can expect to pay at a particular college. It is not enough info. Many colleges require additional forms such as the CSS Profile or the college's own form, considering both income and assets and often noncustodial income and assets as well, and each college has its own level of available resources and uses its own unique formula in calculating need.\r  \n\r  \nRun the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.)\n\nIf the *need-based* estimate does not make the college affordable for your family, then look for *merit scholarships*. ***Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves.*** Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college.\r  \nAlso look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats. Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/; see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family.",

It's a big state school with tons of programs, lots of research, a super pretty campus, and nice scholarships. Lots of parties too, if you're into that (I am not). As a West Virginian, it's probably the only college in WV that I'd consider. It's no Harvard, but it does have plenty of opportunities for a stellar price (cheaper than community college for me). What matters is what you make of it, especially if you're going to grad school and nobody will care about your undergrad.",

      "text": "I'm a parent.  Yes, as unrealistic as that cost might be for your family, that could be your EFC.\n\nThere's a book called Paying for College Without Going Broke that breaks down the FAFSA calculations pretty well.  Essentially, the formula calculates about 40% of your household after-tax income and about 5.6% of assets toward your EFC.  It's the income part that really hurts.  I don't know anyone who could just spend 40% of their income to their child's college.\n\nA few recommendations:\n\nGo through and make sure your parents put the information in correctly.  The questions are complicated, so it's worth making sure they didn't double enter or anything.  An easy quick check is to multiply their income by .4.  If that's less than $80k, there's an error someplace.\n\nTalk to your parents about how much money they will actually be able to contribute.  Ask for this number as \"per year for four years\".  In other words, if they say, \"We have $50k saved,\" that's $12,500 per year for four years, not $50k for your first year and nothing for the next year.  In addition to college savings, ask about support from current income.  Be polite and not entitled in these conversations. \n\nWith an EFC of $80k, you won't qualify for much student loans in just your name/credit.  Ask your parents if they're willing to cosign student loans, and if so, how much per year (for four years) they would be willing to cosign.  Cosigning makes them responsible for the debt if you don't pay, so respect their decision.\n\n Once you have an idea what your budget really is, apply to schools that you expect to be in that range (either lower price to start with or are known to offer merit aid).\n\nMy family is in a similar situation (full pay at any college, but don't have - and wouldn't pay if we did - $75k a year for college costs).  After merit scholarship, we pay about 15% more than in-state rates for our daughter to attend a state flagship in a nearby state.  She's happy and getting a good education at a price we can actually afford.",

If your parents have saved a lot of money or have a second vacation property or just make good money the expectation is that those resources should be used for college before you are given financial assistance. \n\nBut you can cut your costs in a lot of ways \n\n- go to community college to get your GE and major prerequisites done (do a semester, a year, an AA or just take classes in summers starting with 2022)\n\n- pick a school that gives good AP credit (most state schools do) and pass those tests\n\n- do a study abroad with a sister school that has cheaper tuition/living expenses \n\n- live at home or with other family for at least part of your college time, and or pick cheaper apartments because dorms are one of the biggest expenses and right now there are a lot of online classes that could allow you to do this more easily\n\n- go to school where you might get merit aid scholarships, and/or one where tuition and housing costs are less expensive \n\n- find a part-time job that comes with tuition reimbursement (check out Starbucks free ASU degrees, UPS tuition reimbursement, and even Target/Walmart/ATT/Amazon/McDonalds are starting to offer attractive benefits because they need people. It\u2019s not unheard of for students to get a part-time job or internship with a generous company, and then switch to take a full time job and finish up school part-time on their employer\u2019s dime\n\nOur EFC was really high too. When we explained to our daughter that we just couldn\u2019t bring ourselves to pay full price for NYU (I\u2019d rather buy her a house for $320k!) because in the long run her salary would be the same if she went to a lower tier public university, she kind of made it a goal to get the best college value for her money.

Having a PhD used to be a big accomplishment but with fewer academic jobs out there it may make more sense to get a masters and start working in a real job. Most of the Phd programs I know of are paying less than $60,000 a year \u2026. Peanuts in expensive cities. Opportunity costs are real and giving up a great salary, 401k matching and stock\nOptions for 5 years adds up to real $$",

The opportunity cost is real, and the stipends don't pay that great, and that's not getting into the potential harm to health (both physical and mental). It depends a lot on why you're doing a PhD; doing it just for money and earning potential is a futile endeavor. Being in a lucrative field and then getting a masters and/or leveraging your undergrad internships will (usually) get you good $$ and much faster.\n\nThat said, my intention in relaying this information is less because I think a PhD is a great path that everyone should do, and more because I've met tons of people (many of whom are parents, some of whom who even have kids applying to PhD programs) who don't realize that many PhDs are funded. (Though in this case, the parent I was responding to is quite familiar with how this all works.) At best, they'll save a lot of $$ and breathe a sigh of relief when they find out; at worst, they either miss out on a career path they really want (since many industry jobs do require PhDs) or shell out money for shady programs.",

I don\u2019t believe that any school simply accepts the EFC coming out of FAFSA.  They do, however, take the data that FAFSA uses (often with additional data) and calculate their own \u201cdemonstrated need\u201d figure for each applicant.\n\nTL/DR - anyone who wants to understand the cost of attending college cannot stop with the EFC that comes out of FAFSA; they MUST run the specific NPC for the school(s) they are interested in.",
