  "text": "I'm a AP student in hong kong. If you don't know, CollegeBoard introduced new policies where everyone around the world has to take APs at the same time, regardless of timezones. \n\nWell, lucky for me, the times they set just happen to be 0:00 am (12am?), 2am, and 4am. I understand that they can't find a time for everybody, but honestly how do they expect us to take AP tests at such an ghastly hour?",

Like people in the western hemisphere can take form A, and then people in the eastern hemisphere can take a different version at a reasonable time. It would take a lot of pressure off of the systems to not have everyone in the world on at the exact same time, and international students can take it at a reasonable time. Anyways I hate the college board but they own me so.",
