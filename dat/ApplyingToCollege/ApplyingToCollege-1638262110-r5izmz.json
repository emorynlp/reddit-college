  "text": "So basically, in 2017 I took a math class at the local community college to skip a high school class. After graduating high school, I go to a different college and am now looking to transfer to a UC. In the application it says I need to list all colleges I've been to. Does this include the college I went to in 2017? If so does that effect my GPA at all? Right now I have a 4.0, but I got a got a B in that class from 2017.\n\nThanks!",
