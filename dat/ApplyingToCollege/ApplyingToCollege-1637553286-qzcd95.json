It is actually located in a really vibrant neighborhood in Downtown Brooklyn.\n\nTandon used to be called the Brooklyn Polytechnic before NYU took over, and it was a very highly regarded institute even back then, which is why many top companies used to recruit there.\n\nSure, it isn't a good option compared to UW in this case, but it is still a great option compared to many other alternatives.",

I wouldn't say Downtown Brooklyn is dynamic compared to the surrounding neighborhoods; it has a tendency to empty out at 5 pm. That's just the nature of an area with so many courts and government offices.",
