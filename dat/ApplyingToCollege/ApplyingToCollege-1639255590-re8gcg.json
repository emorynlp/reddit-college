  "text": "I applied rea to stanford and on the application portal it says something like the financial aid documents can\u2019t be processed until the decisions come out. but on their website it says admitted students will get their financial aid package by the 15th (release day). my confusion is how are they gonna release packages without even knowing how much we need?",

So, they are already working on admitted students packages, and I assume they will be ready by the 15th; they just can\u2019t confirm or deny because that would give away if you were admitted or not.",
