      "text": "UCs give no need-based aid to out of state or international students. So, think of full pay as a requirement to attend if you are out of state or international. $65-70k per year.\n\nIf you are domestic, Ivies are need-blind, so full pay will not help you. If you are international, it is better to be able to pay than not for some schools, though keep in mind that acceptance rates for internationals to top US schools tend to be around half the overall rate.",
