  "text": "[Repost because the first didn't get many responses]\n\nTo start out, I am a National Hispanic Scholar, and as of two days ago, no one had really reached out to me about it. However, yesterday I received a handwritten note from a member of Northwestern's CLAVE program (a group that works with their admissions department) encouraging me to apply next year and gave me his personal email. Will this help my chances of being admitted next year if I apply ED? Or is this not necessarily a sign of interest in me as a student?",

      "text": "As I said earlier, they bought your name from CBRP. End of story.\n\nNot to be confusing, they do want you to apply!  And Hispanic helps, as you are an underrepresented minority (URM).  But all they know about you is that you received CBRP (so, you scored high enough on PSAT for your state, had a high enough GPA assuming that's still required, and are Hispanic). They do not have personal information on you such as actual GPA, transcript rigor, or SAT score.",
