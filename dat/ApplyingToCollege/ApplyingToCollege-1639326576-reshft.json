  "text": "I'm applying colleges on Common App, and, even though most applications are due until the beginning of January, I'm planning on sending them a bit earlier:  by the end of this week.\n\nThe thing is that my school's semester ends a week from Tuesday, and new grades, a new GPA, new class, etc. will all be out before the application deadlines but after I'm planning on applying. Am I supposed to update colleges on all that stuff? Do I send an email; is there a place in Common App?\n\nThanks ahead to any/everyone who replies!",
