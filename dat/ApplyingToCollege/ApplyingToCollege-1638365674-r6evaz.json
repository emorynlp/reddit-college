Here's NYU alumni living in NYC working at Goldman Sachs with a job function of \"Finance\":\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/school/new-york-university/people/?facetCurrentCompany=1382&facetCurrentFunction=10&facetGeoRegion=us%3A70\n\nYou can pick a certain school and major, then see where alumni are employed.  Here's US-based CS alumni of UIUC whose job function is \"Engineering\":\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-illinois-urbana-champaign/people/?facetCurrentFunction=8&facetFieldOfStudy=100189&facetGeoRegion=us%3A0\n\nYou can pick an employer and job function (and possibly geography) and see what schools employees came from.  Here's US-based Nvidia employees whose job function is \"Engineering\"  (surprising amount from San Diego State and NC State):\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/nvidia/people/?facetCurrentFunction=8&facetGeoRegion=us%3A0\n\nJust remember that much of this is down to those schools \\*inputs\\* and not necessarily the value-add from the school itself.  Students who are super-smart and super-driven select into top schools.  Being super-smart and super-driven correlates with getting a fancy job.",
