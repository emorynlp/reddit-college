  "text": "I am an international applicant, planning to apply RD to Duke (Environmental Science). Which college would be easier to get into (acceptance rate and competition-wise)? Pratt Engineering or Trinity Arts and Sciences? Also, I want to then switch to CS, so can someone please guide me through this? Thank you! :)",

      "text": "I\u2019m a Duke student studying CS. Pratt and Trinity are both about equally difficult to get into (especially given you\u2019re an international student). The general education requirements for the two schools are very different, so look up the differences between them and pick the school you think you\u2019d enjoy more. \n\nAs for switching into CS: there\u2019s a CS major in Trinity and an ECE major in Pratt. It\u2019s no trouble at all to switch from a different Trinity major to CS, or from a different Pratt major to ECE (majors aren\u2019t capped here, and you can\u2019t even officially declare a major until your sophomore year). Switching from Pratt to Trinity or vice versa is a little more annoying \u2014 you have to make up the backlog of general education requirements for the school that you\u2019re switching into, which takes some time \u2014 but it\u2019s easy to get approved to do so. Hope this helps.",
