  "text": "freshman year i got all A\u2019s and B\u2019s, junior year i got all A\u2019s and B\u2019s, and this year i\u2019m maintaining A\u2019s and B\u2019s, but sophomore year i wasn\u2019t in a good place mentally and i got 3 C\u2019s first semester. second semester i bumped those up to B\u2019s, so at least improvement can be seen, but i\u2019m worried what that will look like to admissions reps. :(",

      "text": "There are a great many \"good schools\" that will still love to have you with three Cs on your transcript.  If you mean highly selective colleges (i.e. below about a 30% admit rate), then unfortunately your odds of admission will be somewhat low.  Most T20s reject the majority of valedictorians who apply.  It may depend on what else is in your profile though because admission is holistic.",

      "text": "I do think if your overall application is strong, it would be relevant to know what the three classes are that you had a C in. Like if they were in core disciplines they\u2019re going to hurt you a little bit more. It sounds like if you think you can score high on the SAT or AC T that even though most schools are test optional that would be helpful in your case to bolster your case a bit. \n\nAlso if you have an otherwise strong application, not sure what schools you were interested in, but be sure to Include whatever is the top public school in your state on your list of schools. Your home state schools will have a greater interest in furthering your education and so that might give you a shot if you are at a state that has a state school that\u2019s in the top tier however you define top-tier that would be where those three Cs would probably be the least penalizing.",
