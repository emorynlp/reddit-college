  "text": "I'm quite literally consistently getting 50s on my math tests. I'm in BC Calc and expected it to be hard but not absolutely impossible, and I made the mistake of not just signing up for AB Calc at the beginning of the year. I think I can handle AB Calc (though idk is there a big difference?), so would it be better for me to drop down to AB Calc in the middle of the year and save myself from getting a C on my transcript? Or do colleges really not like seeing someone drop down?",
