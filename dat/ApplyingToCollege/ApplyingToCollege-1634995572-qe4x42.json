  "title:": "Can my current degree plan allow me to get a job as an Astrophysics researcher at a University?",
  "text": "I am currently in my 12th year of Secondary school, graduating in 2023. I plan to study Physics and Philosophy at university for undergrad+Masters because I want to work in Physics research but delving deep into philosophical questions is something dear to my heart that I don't want to give up.\n\nAfterwards, is it possible to enter a PhD program for Astrophysics or will that not be possible without an astronomy-based Masters qualification?\n\nThis is from the perspective of an international student from Asia hoping to study in either the UK or US.",
