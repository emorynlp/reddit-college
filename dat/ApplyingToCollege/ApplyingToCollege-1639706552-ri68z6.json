  "text": "You\u2019ve heard this a thousand times, but it\u2019s true: it\u2019s not a comment on you or a testament to your abilities. There are so many factors that go into the admissions process that are out of your control. \n\nIf the username didn\u2019t key you in, I am a senior at Cornell. I was accepted into a few \u201celite\u201d institutions years back. But, the excitement of that quickly wore off.  Flash forward four years, I wish I had been rejected. I\u2019ve really not enjoyed my experience at all. While there have been positive things that came out of my time here, it wasn\u2019t worth it. It didn\u2019t fulfill me in the way I thought it was going to, because I still had the same struggles when I went to college. The only difference were the new, Cornell created struggles. It\u2019s not all it\u2019s cracked up to be, and while it might not seem like it, a rejection can be a blessing. \n\nI\u2019ve always had the chance to see the byproducts of admissions. Having been on campus for nearly four years, it\u2019s clear to me that the admissions committee really tries to seek out students to fulfill certain roles. You might have been an excellent candidate, but you didn\u2019t fulfill a certain role they were looking for.",
