Novel.\n\nThe fact that IVY league enrollment has changed little since the sixties while their endowment has soared is a crime.\n\n[https://www.ricethresher.org/article/2021/03/rice-announces-twelfth-residential-college-student-body-expansion-approved#:\\~:text=The%20undergraduate%20class%20is%20expected,campus%20will%20increase%20to%203%2C525](https://www.ricethresher.org/article/2021/03/rice-announces-twelfth-residential-college-student-body-expansion-approved#:~:text=The%20undergraduate%20class%20is%20expected,campus%20will%20increase%20to%203%2C525).",

Houston is also the most diverse city in the United States with large communities of people that have cultural roots in other countries.

I've had students get in and enroll there every year for the last four or five and they all LOVE it.  They really do seem to admit students who fit what they're looking for, so if you want to go there, you **simply must** read the post below which explains in vivid detail exactly what that is.\n\n#[Understanding What A Particular College Is Looking For - A 5/7 Case Study With Rice](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gb1xm2/understanding_what_a_particular_college_is/)\n\nOne more thing about Rice - they are rolling with fat stacks of financial aid.  Seriously.  If you have typical assets, a family earning $130k-$200k still gets half tuition.  Families making $65K to $130K get *full tuition*.  Families making less than $65K get a **full ride (including tuition, fees, room, & board).**\n\nMore fun Rice trivia:  All of their General Announcements are available if you search their website, dating back like 100 years.  So you can read up on their course offerings, majors, and even admissions requirements from ages ago.  If anyone is interested I can dig one up and post the direct link.",
