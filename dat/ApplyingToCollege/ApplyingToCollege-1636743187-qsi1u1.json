  "text": "I got accepted to both for Mechanical Engineering, was wondering if one was a better choice than the other? As in like teachers/clubs/internship opportunities/whatever. The financial aid was the same for both since I am in state.\n\nI know A&M is higher on the US News list, but was wondering if there were any alumnis here that had anything to say.\n\nThanks in advance :)",

I am a pursuing a degree in environmental engineering at tech and I am in the accelerated masters program. The civil and mechanical professors are absolutely amazing here but if you are interested in electrical, comp sci or any other engineering field I would advise to not join this institution. Overall tech is a great school and on scholarship I spend less than 5k per year for tuition and honestly, you won\u2019t find that anywhere else.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to convey is if you have the funds go A&M then go there. Texas tech is a great school if you are pursuing a field related to mechanical or civil you will have connections with professors and be prepared for the professional field.",
