(This is so common that some portals may even have a way to do so there.)\n\n(Apply ED only if: (1) it's absolutely your first choice, (2) it's definitely affordable according to the *Net Price Calculator* estimate, (3) you don't need to see financial aid or scholarship offers from other schools, and (4) you will be prepared to withdraw all other apps upon an acceptance from your ED college.)",
