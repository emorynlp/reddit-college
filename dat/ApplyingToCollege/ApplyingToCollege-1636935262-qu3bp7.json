I\u2019m not sure how your school works but mine uses scoir and on there I can see a scatter graph of everybody who applied to that school and what the outcome was. It shows us their test score and GPA and we can see what percentile they were in and when i look at competitive school there\u2019s always people with really strong grades and test scores that don\u2019t get in and then i always see somebody with like an 1100 act and 85 GPA that got into cornell so never assume you\u2019re already rejected.",

I\u2019m confident i\u2019ll get into most the schools I applied to but unless i get a good scholarship I can\u2019t afford any of my top schools. Instead of just being sad i look more into the schools i can afford full price (like public in state schools) and start to get excited about those so even if you get rejected you still have a few other schools you have a good shot at that you\u2019d be excited about going to",

I promise in 5 years when u r graduating from college you won't give a shit what schools rejected you. \n\nAnd I second the other commenter that you should fall in love with some safeties. Even if you don't end up going, it's nice to a have a backup option you love.",
