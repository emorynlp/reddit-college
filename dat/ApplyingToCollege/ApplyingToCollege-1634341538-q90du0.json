  "text": "Title. Stuck in a similar situation and I'm wondering what everyone's personal opinions are on this. To be more specific, lets pretend its entirely US and\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLocal school is top 3,000, not impressive in any regard\n\nCompetitive uni is top 20 in the nation\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLocal will have everything paid for. Competitive its a gamble and you're only guaranteed to have half of it paid for, other half you do not know. What would you do and why?",

But going to the local school for free is a big gamble because not a lot of employers want to take the risk of hiring an unknown top 3,000 when they have T20 applicants. The lines really begin to blur about going to a top 100 school for free and a top 20 school that you have to pay to attend. In that situation, I\u2019d reconsider and evaluate the ROI for each school, and consider whether the T20 would actually be a better investment. However here, I think the choice is pretty clear.",

If not, are you entering a career where you'll have the income to pay off loans relatively quickly?\n\n\\- What are you majoring in? As people have noted, some fields like Law really prioritize prestige whereas others don't. Also, every school has its strengths and weaknesses and your local one might not be as bad as its overall rank suggests depending on your major.\n\n\\- Other options: You have WAY more options than these two schools. If you think a T20 is a strong possibility for you, you can probably get free tuition or a VERY good scholarship at something better than your local T3000. \n\nOverall, it really depends on you. Prestige is usually overrated (I'm probably competitive for ivys, but my top school is T50 or T100 depending on which rating you look at) but at such a low ranked school you might start to suffer. But it really depends on what you're planning on studying, too. IMO try to keep your options open for as long as possible and check out some other schools too!",
