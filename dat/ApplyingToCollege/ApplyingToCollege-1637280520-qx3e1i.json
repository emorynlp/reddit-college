  "text": "So I have been struggling with mental illness for a while now but it\u2019s gotten to the point that I can no longer attend in-person school. I am a senior this year and I am in AP Lit and AP Calc but they don\u2019t offer AP classes for \u201chomeschooling\u201d (sorry, I don\u2019t really know if homeschooling is the right term lol) so I\u2019d have to take honors classes instead. I got a really good GPA throughout high school and my application is generally pretty strong but I\u2019m terrified that this will completely ruin my chances of getting into the schools I want.",
