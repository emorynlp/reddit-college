  "title:": "Naviance locking me out of inviting teachers through common app",
  "text": "I applied to colleges last year with my school using Naviance to submit LoR and student transcripts. Due to unforeseen circumstances I had to take a gap year. Now looking at my old Common app account I cannot add my teachers or my counselor due to being connected to Naviance. I spoke with my counselor and she said that the school can no longer send my transcripts through Naviance. I contacted common app support and I got two possible solutions:\n1) Contact my school Naviance administrator to opt out of naviance(which is impossible if my school made submissions through naviance this year)\n2) Contact Naviance support.\nI emailed the Naviance support and received the school opting out solution as a reply.\n\nThis leaves me with:\n-Neither common app or Naviance or my school being able to help me.\n-No way to add my teachers on common app.\nWhat should I do?",
