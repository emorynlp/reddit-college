  "title:": "Questions about ED WashU Grade Reporting",
  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\ni am applying for ED1 for Washu and had a question regarding what grades are required for ED. I know for a fact RD asks for your semester grade, but I heard ED/EA grades depend on the school? on my school\u2019s site they say that my quarter grades are unoffical and will only be seen by the students and parents. However, on the WashU site, it says theyll ask my guidance counselor for my unofficial quarter grade which is really worrying me. I currently do not have the BEST grades and am super worried about them..",
