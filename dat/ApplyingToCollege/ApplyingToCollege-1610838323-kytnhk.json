I think you have it wrong, bruh.\n\nThey encourage getting students with diverse perspectives but have NO quotas. That's illegal. I never said it's ideal but what you said is simply untrue. They train and gear the Admissions officers to set their standards to a certain level. That's why Colleges always admit more students than they can house. Despite having a waitlist.",
