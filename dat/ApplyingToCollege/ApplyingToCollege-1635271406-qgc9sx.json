  "text": "My son is planning on majoring in philosophy, He isn't on reddit so I am asking. He is looking at Williams, Cornell and Vanderbilt because of the financial need we have. We can't afford Pitt or any other public university outside of ohio. Don't think he could get into Harvard. Anyone have any thoughts on which one (or another) we night have missed?\n\nThanks in advance.",

If either of those interest him.\n\nMany/most of the top LACs are meets-full-need schools, so he could apply to several of them if he wanted.  Amherst, Swarthmore, Bowdoin, etc.",
