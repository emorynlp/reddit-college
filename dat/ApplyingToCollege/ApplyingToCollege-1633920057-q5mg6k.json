  "text": "I\u2019m currently a junior in high school and it feels like time is moving too fast.  In two years, I won\u2019t be in my hometown anymore.  I won\u2019t see the people that I\u2019ve seen everyday for the past 10 years, I won\u2019t go home to complain about my day to my parents, I won\u2019t see my favorite teachers, I won\u2019t talk to my friends as much as I used to, and everything just won\u2019t be the same.  It\u2019s hard to believe that life moves so quickly.  My dad keeps on telling me that life changes and you grow as a person and that I\u2019ll still be me when I\u2019m in college and afterwards, but I honestly can\u2019t believe that.  My personality and thoughts will be there, but it\u2019ll be totally new.  I always wanted to start new in college and reinvent myself as the new \u201crosamundpie\u201d, but now I\u2019m not so sure.  There\u2019s something comfortable in the close net of friends I\u2019ve developed throughout middle and high school and the way that everybody in my hometown knows each other.  I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to go out into the big world and deal with the ups and downs of life by myself.\n\nWhen I was younger, I would try to hold water in the cup of my hand for as long as possible.  Inevitably, all of the water would drain out and I would just be left with wet hands.  Even then, they would dry after a few minutes.  I guess that\u2019s how life feels right now.  There\u2019s something so beautiful and intangible and perfectly imperfect about high school, but it\u2019s coming to a close.  The water is running out.  And it\u2019s not just high school -- my entire childhood.  Once I graduate, a chapter of my life will close with a certain permanence.  Sure, there will be high school reunions and my brother will still go to the high school for a few more years, but it just won\u2019t be the same.  There\u2019s a certain environment and various cultural phenomena that I won\u2019t be able to replicate.  All the songs that are \u201cin\u201d now won\u2019t be cool twenty years from now, and everybody will grow up and change and get jobs and have their own little families.  I\u2019m trying to value the time I have right now, but the past few months have gone by in the blink of an eye.  It\u2019s currently the end of the first quarter, but I feel like we\u2019re still only in the first few weeks of school.  Maybe I\u2019m silly and immature for wanting to prolong that sense of innocence and openness and possibility that comes with childhood.  But don\u2019t we all want to?",
