  "title:": "Choosing between personal essay topics",
  "text": "Hi A2C, I'm struggling with my Common App essay topic choice so I'm asking here. Context: HS junior, planning to apply for CS major; college list not fixed yet. I have two ideas for the Common App essay:\n\n* Writing about sailing (a hobby for \\~3 years)\n   * My parents think this is good (and very very good). They think this is a topic that can show my \"preserverence, hardworking, dedication\" and whatsoever.\n   * I personally do not have a passion in this. I do sailing from time to time, but in no way super enthusiastic. I'm not into sports.\n   * I currently have a draft on this; I wrote how I overcame the fear of drowning (and being in the water in general) through sailing, which I'm presume matches the theme of \"overcoming hardship\".\n   * Anonymous peer-reviews mostly say it is OK and I did a good job in putting emotions into it. But certain emotions are actually exaggerated and I'm kind of uncomfortable about that.\n* Writing about me being trans and my passion of softwares and programming (both of which has a looong span of \\~6 yrs), and the connections between them\n   * By no means do I intend to make my essay some kind of politically-correct nonsense. We all know that is an incredibly bad idea.\n   * With that said, being trans is an integral part of my living experience with certain touching moments.\n   * And (not sure if by coincidence) that was intertwined with my passion in tech:\n      * My \"transness\" made me isolated in middle school and that gave me the chance to spend lots of time with computers and programming;\n      * Coping with depressive moods often by learning about programming and other CS theories;\n      * It is a stark contrast when I got my first internship in tech and my new colleagues really *don't misgender me,* compared to when I was misgendered at school all the time.\n   * But this series of events and depictions of mental statuses are way harder to word than simply writing about sailing.\n      * If I write too much about tech, the essay becomes very dry and boring;\n      * If I write too much about my mood, the essay becomes some kind of sad rant;\n      * If I did not manage to link the events well, the essay will feel scattered and mushy without a clear timeline.\n   * My parents are mildly (?) transphobic and they certainly won't like me to write on this topic. If I intend they won't refuse; but they won't give any good words to it.\n\nI'm still in junior year by now so there should be enough time for me to consider and switch between topics. But still I'd like to see your takes and suggestions on this: should I choose a topic I'm not particularly interested in (and not very related to the major), but easier to write a good (with some definition of \"good\") essay about; or a topic I'm really passionate about and relevant to the major, but harder to compose overall?",

      "text": "I agree that it\u2019s too early to deciding on essay ideas. Keep brainstorming throughout junior year, because that\u2019s almost a whole year for growth and experiences still. For me, junior year had the most integral experiences I wrote many of my essays about. \n\nThat said, between those two ideas, I think the second is better. For the most part, leave your parents\u2019 preferences out of what you write. It\u2019s your essay about who you are, not who your parents want you to be or want you to pretend to be. It sounds like the topic is much closer to you heart and can produce a more genuine essay, which is what you want. If you\u2019re already brainstorming ideas, you can start writing you essay early as soon as summer break hits, and that should give you enough time to work through the difficulties of balancing the composition of your essay.",

      "text": "Coming from someone who is biased (I\u2019m a sailor), I think intertwining of more genuine facets of your identity (trans + cs) would be much more powerful. Even though it will be more difficult to balance, the end result is likely to be much stronger and more personal to you. Maybe use cs as the backbone of your essay and give snapshots to your evolution as a person and finding a place where you feel you belong. This structure would allow you to lightly bring in cs, while showing character traits that are not seen elsewhere in your application. \n\nYou have a strong topic and lots of time. Write what feels like you and the authenticity will show. Good luck!!! \n- From a senior who just applied to college",

      "text": "Wait until summer before senior year to do this. No reason to do it this early, before half a YEAR of experiences that could give you essay ideas. If anything, look at Dos and Don'ts regarding college, essays, applications, etc. \n\nShit, when I was a junior last August I had just learned that the SAT is pretty important. I didn't know shit about college applications until about October or November of my junior year. I can still pull up the text messages of me asking my friend how the SAT works, and whether I have to register for it, during September 2020.",
