  "text": "Hi everyone, I am a senior in high-school and am planning on going to the University of Cincinnati next year. I am fascinated about the brain and the rest of the nervous system, and have hopes of becoming either a neurosurgeon or an orthopedic spine surgeon. But I am also very interested in chemistry. I applied for neuroscience as my top choice for major and chemistry as my second. So my question is which major do you think will prepare me for medical school more, neuroscience or chemistry?",
