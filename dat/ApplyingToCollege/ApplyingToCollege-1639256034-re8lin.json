  "text": "Hello! So let me give you the gist of what happened. \n\nI got accepted to 3 colleges for my major and was offered to 95k to 100k scholarships. \n\nThis particular college is in Boston but here is the thing. I got accepted to this college but not for my major. I want to become a nurse and I wasn't accepted to the nursing program but I did get accepted to the school with a 96k scholarship for four years. \n\nI wasn't given a reason why or how I was denied of the program. I have a 3.7 GPA meet all the requirements and wrote a good damn essay and had the best LORs despite my learning disability and the situation at home. \n\nI just left a message as to why I got denied but yeah I feel kinda bummed out. Ahhh I guess I should move on. \n\nAnyways what do you guys suggest? I kinda need some advice.",
