  "text": "Hi all!\n\nSo the deadline for BU's trustee scholarship is due in 4 days, but I haven't started the application yet  (I'm a bad procrastinator). BU is one of my top schools so I'm trying to figure out if I should apply by the December 1st deadline or wait till January for the regular decision deadline. On the one hand, I would have better-written essays if I waited till January and would also have more opportunities to demonstrate interest (which I've done none of at this point) or I could apply to the December 1st date with slightly more questionable essays but get to apply to the scholarship program. Applying by December 1st also shows demonstrated interest, but I'm not sure if it would be weighed more or less heavily compared to going to virtual tours/info sessions if I waited till January. Any thoughts on what I should do are welcome to be shared, thank you in advance!",

Keep in mind it\u2019s 600 words plus the why Boston essay so you have slot on your plate and is it worth it to compromise the overall integrity of your application for the trustee scholarship is another question you should ask",
