  "text": "  This sounds really dumb, but...\n\n\n  Basically, one of my parents committed a misdemeanor level crime and I mentioned it in a short answer question. They've already gone through court and all that, but is the college going to reach out to my parents/law enforcement? I never specified that the crime had been addressed by law enforcement.\n\n\n  Sorry, I just saw something on a college's website that said they would report \"instances of abuse\" mentioned in applications, and that got me worried even though it's not the same deal \ud83d\ude05",
