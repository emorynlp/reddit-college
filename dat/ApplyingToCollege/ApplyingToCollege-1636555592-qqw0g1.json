  "text": "As I'm filling up a form for my college's online or on-site appointment I can't see my preferred course in the choices but I saw \"CITE (IT, CS, IS, and ECM). I've asked my peers about this and they said it's the same with the BSIT course. I just want to know it also has the same curriculum with BSIT, hope you can help me here",
