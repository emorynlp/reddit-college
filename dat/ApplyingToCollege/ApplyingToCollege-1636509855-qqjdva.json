  "text": "I just got my interview email today and my person was somewhat of a theater/ English major type and I\u2019m over here with stem\ud83d\ude2d I obviously don\u2019t plan to make the interview all about stem but how can we find some common ground? Kinda scared but then again does it necessarily matter if your interest don\u2019t align like the stars? Can anyone share a similar situationthey were in when interviewing?\n\nAlso, does an interviewer get any info on who their interviewing or do they just get a name & an email? Sry guys just super nervous",
