              "text": "Not exactly. Most (or all) T20's allow you to change your major easily, so it's rather pointless to admit by major.\n\nWhat they do, however, is that they look at what subjects you seem \"interested\" in to create a diverse class profile. Harvard mentioned that they do look closely at applicants with \"different\" or \"unusual\" interests, e.g. those interested in Latin. To some extent, you *might* have a point with humanities acceptance rates being higher, but this is a very complicated deal that only admissions officers can really answer.",
