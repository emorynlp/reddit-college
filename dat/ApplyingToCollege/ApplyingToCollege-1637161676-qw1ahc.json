  "text": "Im an international student and well, let\u2019s just say that getting a good grade in my country is a lot harder than in the us. I\u2019m taking the highest grade (6) being from 98-100%. Also, grades don\u2019t matter for our college so teachers don\u2019t pay any attention to your gpa\n\n\nSo when you look at my 4,7/6 in comparison to Americans it looks shitty, but if you compare it to people from my country, it\u2019s pretty good.\n\nDo the AOs take that into account?\n\n\nEDIT: Also we don\u2019t have class rankings here",
