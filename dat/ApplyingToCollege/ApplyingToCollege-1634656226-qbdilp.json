  "text": " hello  everyone, im not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask this, but I  want to study statistics as an undergraduate in college and am unsure where to apply early between Wharton and Yale. I know this preference is  very subjective, but I want to hear some opinions if thats ok. Thank you in advance!",

      "text": "Wharton grad here! Wharton gives a BSc is in Economics. If you concentrate in stats, you take an extra 4 stats courses (basically a minor). Wharton is also ED. Whatever you learn in Wharton stats isn\u2019t more \u201cbusiness-ey\u201d than what you learn anywhere else\u2014 the business part comes from the rest of your degree, which includes core courses in marketing, management, finance etc. Feel free to dm me if you have questions about Wharton!",

          "text": "To go further on this: Knowing people in Wharton's stats department... they tend to dislike business applications. However, those business courses restrict the ability to take more math/stats and, like it or not, business applications are what many students are interested in. Also, econ does have some very good statisticians/econometricians (e.g. Frank Diebold).",

              "text": "I\u2019d like to qualify this somewhat. We have stats electives electives that are business applications (e.g., marketing, management, actuarial), but if you\u2019re looking for business applications in statistics, that\u2019s not always our stats dept. Data science for finance is in the finance department, for example, and so on. \n\nAlso, as someone who studied both math and stats at Penn, I can say it\u2019s not that restrictive if you plan it well. 30% of Wharton undergrads also majored in something outside of business. It\u2019s v doable",
