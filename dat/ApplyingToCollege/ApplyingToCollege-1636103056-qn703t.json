  "title:": "Counselor submitted an incorrect transcript and wants to replace it with the right one",
  "text": "My counselor just informed me that one of the additional transcripts she submitted contains a formatting error that messed up a table of scores (apparently the table got moved by one cell so some of the summations are off. I\u2019m not sure what she means but yeah). She got the transcript reproduced from the school system before submitting it and apparently they messed it up and she just noticed. She wants to replace it with the corrected version. The school report is already submitted. What should she do? Should she contact common app or the college? (My ED college gave her a seven day grace period initially when she contacted them about a late rec letter so she should still have 2 days). Should she upload the corrected one in the optional report 1 section? I only applied to one college so far so what can she do to make sure all my RD schools receive the correct transcript when I apply in December?",
