  "text": "They reject the persona you create through your application. Most don\u2019t even know what you look like. They\u2019re evaluating you based on grades and how you describe the things you\u2019ve done over 4 years in like 1000 words. \n\nI see so many people having their self-worth destroyed from rejections and deferrals. Colleges don\u2019t know anything about the real you, they only know what they can learn from the <1 hour they spend with your application. And they have so many other qualified applicants that it seems like it\u2019s not even normally personal. I know this has been said before but with so many people posting about how much they\u2019re crying or feel like life isn\u2019t worth anything anymore, please just remember this. Of course it sucks to be rejected or deferred, but it\u2019s not the end of the world. We\u2019ll all do great wherever we go anyway since we\u2019re the kind of people who spend our free time talking about college admissions lol.",

We have to *somehow* sift through who gets to go and who doesn't which often involves beint incredibly picky and rejecting many brilliant applicants\" \n\nThe first thing about rejection is to not take it personal. Recognise that they *have* to reject people and it's impossible to do so 100% fairly. At many universities, they have become more and more over subscribed throughout the years and it can actually be the case that you were just unlucky to be born when you were as it was much easier in the past. For example I was rejected from Oxford but I knew from my ranking that if I had a applied in 2014 or earlier I would have probably gotten in. But I was too young at that time.",

Sometimes it's just one too many people with a point higher of a GPA or one more club than you. Maybe someone's writhing just stood out slightly more. Don't forget those people that apply to colleges they don't want to go to \"just to see if they can get in\" even if they got accepted ED into somewhere else that can make the application pool more competitive and hold up spots. This year there's especially more applicants than normal due to multiple factors, especially colleges being test optional this year. It's going to be alright",

Some people aren't only applying to T20 5.0 GPA and all that. But even if they are and ended up getting rejected, especially with how many qualified/over qualified people this year are getting rejected and thus going to matches or safeties (if they weren't before), it could be significantly harder to get into even \"lower tier\" schools. This year there are a lot of people who might have gotten rejected from everywhere or almost everywhere they applied to, especially depending on how many places they applied to and which colleges they are.\nEdit: wording",

Some people have bad ideas of safeties and consider them to be schools with 40% acceptance rates. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say how many over/under-qualified people are getting rejected this year yet, since we haven\u2019t seen how regular decision results go. Either way, I\u2019m pretty sure total college applications are down this year, so it shouldn\u2019t cause state schools with high acceptance rates to start rejecting people who otherwise would have gotten in.",

But regardless, I don't think it matters what you feel safeties should be, my point is that it was kind of harsh for no reason. I think college applications, including to safeties, can be influenced by a lot of different things (including parental influence). Not to mention you could be extremely confident that you would get into a certain school but still not get in (especially if, again parental influence did anything there). That might mean later on for rd or something you could go to a community college. But that would still mean they got rejected from all their initial colleges",

I get that more are getting rejected than usual but it doesn\u2019t mean that most qualified applicants got in before.

My point isn't that I disagree with any of what you said, I'm pretty certain we're on the same page. I'm saying that your comment about \"it must mean you have a criminal record you don't know about lol\" was kind of a jerk thing to say despite you making an otherwise positive post.

I think its something that would bring a lot of people's feeling of self worth down and it could really make some people feel shitty about themselves, and despite it being a good opportunity to mention those options (like community college) you kind of made a joke out of it and it came off as \"something's just wrong with you lmao\" even though your post was like \"they didn't reject you, they rejected your application :).\" Like some people will get rejected from all of their colleges, including all their safeties, for a variety of reasons (yes, including just bad planning) and I felt this post would have been the place to encourage people and give actual help/advice",

All my friends are going to T20s and I just felt like maybe I should be aiming higher?
