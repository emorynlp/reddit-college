  "text": "If my counsellor approved my Common App fee waiver can I use it for any college I\u2019m applying to? Is it normal that in the college specific questions the \u201cCommon app fee waiver\u201d option does not come out? Does any college on common app accept the common app fee waiver? \nThank you in advance!",
