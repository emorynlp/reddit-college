  "text": "Idk if aesthetically pleasing is the right phrase to use, but I think it looks classier, let me give you some examples \n\nUniversity of Michigan vs Michigan University \n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania vs Pennsylvania University\n\nUniversity of California-Los Angeles vs California-Los Angeles University \n\nUniversity of Chicago vs Chicago University\n\nUniversity of Columbia vs Columbia University \n\nUniversity of Northwestern vs Northwestern University \n\nUniversity of Duke vs Duke University \n\nUniversity of Cornell vs Cornell University \n\nUniversity of Notre Dame vs Notre Dame University \n\nUniversity of Stanford vs Stanford University \n\nThere definitely are some exceptions to this rule, I think that \u201cYale University\u201d is better than the \u201cUniversity of Yale,\u201d but I\u2019ve found the rule I\u2019ve explained above to be right about 70%-80% of the time\n\nObviously this is only my opinion, I don\u2019t know shit about creating good aesthetics, so if you are someone who actually knows how to do that and wants to write a dissertation on why I\u2019m wrong and should never speak on anything ever again, I welcome it",

      "text": ">University of Pennsylvania vs Pennsylvania State University\n\nJust names for different campuses: Philly vs Flagship in State College\n\n>University of Michigan vs Michigan *State* University  \n>  \n>University of Chicago vs Chicago *State* University\n\nDifferent schools with \\_\\_\\_ State usually being the Morrill Act ag-/engineering- focused school. In the second case, Chicago State is an HBCU. Same holds for UNC vs NCSU.\n\n>University of Columbia vs Columbia University  \n>  \n>University of Northwestern vs Northwestern University  \n>  \n>University of Duke vs Duke University  \n>  \n>University of Cornell vs Cornell University  \n>  \n>University of Stanford vs Stanford University\n\nEww no. Private schools usually have the \\_\\_\\_ University format. That's because they were named for a person (or region: Northwestern, Columbia, CWRU) and so putting University last is like how we use possessives in English. You wouldn't call something the University of Cornelius Vanderbilt because it is Cornelius Vanderbilt's university, hence Vanderbilt University.\n\nUniversity of \\_\\_\\_ usually implied a public university and the state or city they were mandated to serve. You also ignored the University of <State/Province> {-|,|at} <City> format variation which can lead to confusion: UChicago vs UIC, UdeM vs UQAM, USD vs UCSD.",
