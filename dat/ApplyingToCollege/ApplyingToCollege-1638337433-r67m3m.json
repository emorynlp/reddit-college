  "title:": "Questions about letter of rec!",
  "text": "I\u2019m planning on applying RD to a few schools (I applied to one school already, but it didn\u2019t require lor); and I know nothing about letters of rec and I\u2019m panicking. My main problems are: I still don\u2019t know what schools I want to apply to (I know it\u2019s bad; I plan on having a solid list of schools by the end of this week), and I haven\u2019t requested any letters of recommendation yet. Anyway, I\u2019m confused by the whole process of requesting/sending letters of rec, and I really need the following questions answered:\n\n1. Is it possible to request letters of rec before you even know what schools you will use them for?\n2. Do teachers send it directly to the school or do they send it to you?\n3. I\u2019ve heard that you\u2019re not supposed to read your letters of rec, but then how do you send them to colleges if you can\u2019t see them?\n4. Do schools usually require them to be written by a counselor, or can they be written by teachers, or does it just depend on the school?\n5. Does it matter what subject the teachers who write your lor teach? I was planning on having 2 English teachers write mine because they genuinely know me the best, but will it look bad if they both teach the same subject? I don\u2019t have as good of a relationship with my math/science teachers.\n\nPlease help :(",

      "text": "1. Yes, LORs shouldn\u2019t be specific to a college anyway\n\n2. You invite the teacher as a recommender on the common app, and they make their own account via an email that\u2019s sent to them where they will upload their letter \n\n3. You don\u2019t send them. The teachers upload it themselves. \n\n4. Different colleges have different LOR requirements. Many top colleges at least will require 1 counselor LOR and 1-2 academic subject teachers LORs. \n\n5. Some colleges have a requirement like MIT, where they ask for 1 stem rec and 1 non-stem rec. If you\u2019re applying for a stem major, some colleges may require that at least 1 rec is from a stem teacher. If your colleges don\u2019t have any such requirements, imo it\u2019s not ideal but it\u2019s not a problem.",

          "text": "Agree with all of this. Ask asap to give your teachers a heads up when apps are due and that you\u2019ll be making the formal request via common app. Allow teachers to plan since they will likely write for more than one student. \n\nSome colleges require up to 3. If you\u2019re a humanities majors I would ask from two humanities and one STEM teachers. If you\u2019re a STEM major, ask for letters from two STEM and one humanities teachers. That should cover it.",

      "text": "ok so no, you don\u2019t need to know where you\u2019re applying so ask ASAP and let them know you need it finished ASAP. You\u2019re guidance counselor is the one who will send the letters so the colleges u apply to once they\u2019re ready. You\u2019re counselor is also the one who should send your transcript. Some schools require a letter specifically from your counselor you can see on common app under requirements if they require a counselor one. if not, a teacher will do just fine. but usually if they require a counselor they also want a teacher to go with it. And for your last point, I would try to get a teacher from a different subject. It doesn\u2019t have to be math or science but it would help to get another subject, but it also depends what you want to do.",
