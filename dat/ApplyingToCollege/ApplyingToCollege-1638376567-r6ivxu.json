  "text": "On the UC website, they said that they don't give honors credit for anything but APs and IBs for out-of-state students. Doesn't this automatically put is in a disadvantage for their calculated GPA because it means that our honors courses don't even count for a weighted GPA boost but for the in-state kids it does?? \n\nLet me know if you guys know this works. My anxiety keeps getting worse",
