  "text": "I want to take a gap year, I feel that the pros outweigh the cons and I'm planning out all the goals that I want to accomplish during this year. My counselor told me I still have to apply to universities before I start my gap year;  is that really necessary? Couldn't I take a gap year, do 1 or 2 years at a community college, and then transfer into a university? I don't really have a lot of guidance which is why I'm grateful that this sub exists.",

      "text": "You can do whatever you want\n\nI'd *advise* that you apply to a few colleges to see where you get in/in case you change your mind in May/June when everyone's deciding and you get hit with FOMO (or just defer and enroll after your gap year if you end up not wanting to go to CC)\n\nYou could also take a gap year and apply during your gap year and go directly to a 4-year after that\n\nOr you could also take a gap year and jump into CC for a year or two then transfer\n\nAnything works, it's up to you",

      "text": "It definitely isn't necessary. In fact, applying (for 4-year) during your gap year is by all accounts a great way to increase your chances, because you can prove to universities that you are prepared. Students who take a gap year before college tend on average to do better. AOs are aware of this. Make sure the goals you want to achieve are relevant to what you want to study, and I highly recommend gaining some work experience if you can.",

      "text": "You dont have to apply before the gap year. I applied to just a couple reaches before my gap year to shoot my shot, just so I could defer and relax. I didnt apply I safeties as I wouldnt have accepted since  I wouldve just reapplied in the gap year anyway.\n\nI'm applying to safeties, matches, reaches and the full range properly now. You have a lot more time in your gap year to make a better app so it's all good.",
