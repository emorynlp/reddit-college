              "text": "That\u2019s why I said it was controversial. I went from cc to top public to top ivy, can say the resources at the top ivies are the best but the professors at the ccs cannot be topped, they hang around 24/7 for their students to learn and improve from in ways that the other schools do not. Many of them have extensive research backgrounds and just gave that up for a chill life of teaching \n\nAnd making friends at a cc and building a community is way easier than at any university, same with building your resume\n\nMost people overlook it because they just don\u2019t understand what they have",

I went to a public elementary/middle school in a low income neighborhood where the teachers were super-dedicated and focused on helping us succeed. I transferred to an out-of-district wealthy suburban school for high school and the teachers seem much less helpful/available, although they were still very good. I think it\u2019s because it takes a certain kind of dedication and level of compassion to teach in certain places. Maybe CC is the same thing. I still think you will get a better or more hands-on education at the T20 or HYPSM because the resources and everything else that the uni provides outweighs the individual caring and dedication of the professors.",

                      "text": "That's actually a really interesting observation. I consider the CC to be the 'poor' school that attracts the people that wanna be there because they love teaching and the big schools are the 'rich' that attracts the big minds who sometimes just wanna do research and sometimes care about the students too\n\nThe students at a uni will be more motivating to be around for sure and there are tons more opportunities, but the professors at a CC and even the mental health and career counseling resources / tutoring have no wait times there whereas at bigger schools you have to make appointments.",
