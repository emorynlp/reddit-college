  "text": "First it's the mail. Multiple letters/packages every day - some booklets, some posters, some post cards. Maybe I shouldn't have signed up for student search? But whatever, I do have a trash can. Not that big of an issue - some, I've actually appreciated.\n\nThen the e-mails, and now's when it starts to become a problem. Roughly four emails every single hour from colleges - I can't even clear them fast enough. Sometimes, the email sender is a person instead of a university name to get me to click on the email just to see \"Aidan, why haven't you applied yet?\" Sometimes, they try to be trendy; \"Aidan, it's a no bones day! Make sure to sit inside with some nice hot chocolate, in a nice warm blanket, and do nothing (except apply to OUR university!)\". Sometimes, they make me legit worried that I'm missing something; \"Aidan, you're about to miss the EA deadline!\" where I panic until I notice that it's from a community college fifteen states away. Sometimes, they're just creepy! Case Western emailed me at 11:20AM today, saying \"I'm glad to have found you, Aidan.\" Yeah, better get on that application straight away! Let me just check under my bed first, then I'll get right on it, Case! It almost feels dystopic to scroll through my email, with EVERY SINGLE EMAIL beginning with \"Aidan,\" like the colleges are almost trying to be personal with me. I think it would work a lot better if they started the heading with my social security number - it'll be so relatable, I'd HAVE to apply! I literally created a whole new formal email just for college admissions, and the only thing it's hooked up to is my application portals and CommonApp. Probably should keep those lines clear, just in case I need to do something! Well, imagine my surprise when, in the middle of the night, a university have never heard of tells me all about their pre-med program (I'm computer science). I can't escape the spam anywhere! \n\nAnd now they're CALLING ME. Like telemarketers, I'm getting phone calls on my landline asking for me (because they've heard how cool and awesome I am)! It's crossing a line when you literally embed yourself into my home life to advertise your college admissions. I can throw out the mail. I can ignore the little red dot that signifies 9,999 emails on my phone. I can't, however, ignore a landline ringing off the hook when I'm trying to eat dinner with my family. Especially now that I need to regularly check my email and phone for important stuff from the colleges I *actually applied to*. The other day, I got yelled at by my teacher after my phone buzzed and I checked it. Maybe it's my mom, asking for something? Or perhaps it's a friend, needing help immediately. Who else would text me at 10:30AM on a school day? Oh, no; it's just one of the schools I briefly looked at on CommonApp, asking me to add them to their college list! That's not creepy!\n\nWhat the hell is next! Are they going to start going door-to-door, asking us if we've heard of the University of Cleetus Bartholomew? Are they going to start calling me out of class to sit 1-on-1 unprompted with an advertising representative? Are they going to start leaving flyers on my car window, parked in my garage (Hopefully Case Western isn't reading this)? Are they going to steal my commonapp, apply me to their college without me even knowing, and then start advertising me my *acceptance* to their college instead of my *ability to apply?* \"Aidan, you've been accepted! You're one button away from committing - but first, we've already scheduled you for an open house (it's in your living room in five minutes!)\".\n\nThis got out of hand. I'm sick of the college advertisement process. That's all.",

The pandemic has also had a dramatic impact on the number of students choosing to attend college and may also be impacting the kinds of colleges students plan to attend (spending less money, choosing a school that is more affordable and/or closer to home).\n\nColleges already lost millions of dollars during the pandemic.  They need full enrollment, especially students whose family would be full-pay.  This is especially true at small liberal arts colleges, which have small margins.\n\nSo, basically, some of these colleges are desperate for students and money.",
