People on this sub have a tendency of saying \u201cI\u2019m scared I won\u2019t get in anywhere\u201d with \u201canywhere\u201d literally only referring to T20s. You will get in somewhere for sure (with the possible exception of intls asking for lots of aid), although it may not be a T20. And that\u2019s fine. T20s reject plenty of applicants far above average each year, and a rejection from them is not an indicator of your future potential unless you choose to let it be. \n\n(Personal rant incoming)\n\nAnd maybe it\u2019s A2C, maybe it\u2019s wider culture as a whole, but people really seem to have something against being \u201caverage.\u201d You do not need to be exceptional in every field, or even just one field. The majority of people aren\u2019t and aren\u2019t as miserable as some people here are over feeling \u201caverage.\u201d Being average is fine. You can be average and be happy. You can be average and find personal success. By hating the notion of being \u201caverage,\u201d and assuming one can never be happy or satisfied if they\u2019re \u201caverage,\u201d you lock away more possibilities for yourself, if anything. Normalize accepting being average.",
