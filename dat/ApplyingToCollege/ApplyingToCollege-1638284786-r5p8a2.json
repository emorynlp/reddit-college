  "text": "I applied early to UVA and was wondering if I should submit these first quarter grades to them as they do allow it.\n\nAP Physics C Mechanics: (A-) \nAP Calculus BC: (A) \nAP US and Comparative Government: (A-) \nAP Statistics: (A) \nBusiness Law: (A+) \nDual enrollment English: (B)\n\nI would submit without hesitation but that B in English makes me reluctant.\n\nThanks for the help and anything is appreciated.",

I know the waffling feeling though. I sent sat to Duke ED,feel like it\u2019s my weak link in my app but hard not to send it although hovering a tad below 50th percentile. My hope is I\u2019m not rejected due to 2-3 questions on the sat( I had time to retake 770 for 800 since it was sophomore year but wasn\u2019t thinking of Duke at the time.   Are you in state or oos? I\u2019d assume oos or you\u2019d be pretty confident for uva",
