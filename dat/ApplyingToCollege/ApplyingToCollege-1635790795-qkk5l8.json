  "text": "I\u2019m looking to complete some transfer credits before I transfer (obviously lol), but I\u2019m unhappy with the current accommodations at my online college. They don\u2019t offer any tutoring on the weekends or after 5pm EST. Has anyone gone to a online college that they really liked? \n\nSome of the classes I need to complete include biology, evolution, ecology, bio lab (which tbh I\u2019ll probably do in person), biological diversity, and foundations of life.",
