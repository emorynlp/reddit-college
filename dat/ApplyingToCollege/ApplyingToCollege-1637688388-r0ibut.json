  "text": "Hi, are Vanderbilt scholarship essay prompts shared with us only after our submission of application form? I saw a link on their website but it said 'sample' on it. Hence, the question. \n\nAnd if they are given on the fly, are the prompts different for everyone or are they same prompts?\n\nThanks!",
