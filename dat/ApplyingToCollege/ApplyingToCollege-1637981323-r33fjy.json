  "text": "Honestly, while writing supplements I have been looking at a lot of the guides on how to write college essays, such as from the collegeessayguy and prepscholar. Initially I felt like the guides helped my find ideas for my essays, but now I feel like they just box me in. I feel almost obligated to follow those guides in a sense. Do you guys recommend just writing how I feel fit?",

      "text": "i think you should just write what you think is best. i know exactly how youre feeling\u2026 i took a college essay writing summer course, sent my essay to my schools college and career center, had two teachers give me advice on how to write it, spent hours reading guides and the like. after i went through several different essays i felt didnt work and submitted one i felt okay about, i realized the essay doesnt feel original or unique at all. it just follows the flow of others. \nTL;DR: scrap the guides. scrap the professional language or specific outlines. write what makes you happy and what you think will really show your voice to AOs. youll write an amazing essay and be proud knowing it came from your own mind :)",
