  "text": "I know almost for a fact I'm going to get B's in some of the community college courses I'm taking this year. They're going to bring down my GPA, so I was wondering if colleges may take me updating them newer grades in the spring (February-ish) with not only a higher unweighted GPA but also new and improved grades from my community college courses (dual-enrolled)?",
