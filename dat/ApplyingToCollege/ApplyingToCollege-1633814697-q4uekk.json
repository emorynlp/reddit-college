  "title:": "Bowdoin vs. MIT",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently trying to decide between committing to Bowdoin or MIT as an athlete. Bowdoin has done a preread and has essentially said that if I commit there I will get in (they can\u2019t guarantee admissions but seem confident). On the other hand, MIT has offered me a position on the team, but I still have to get in, and they do not tend to get all of the athletes they want (the percentage is hard to find but seems to rarely be higher than 50% of the desired athletes admitted). This has put me in the position of committing to a top school and being done with the application process, or trying to get into possibly the best school in the world, with a much more prestigious name than Bowdoin, but potentially being screwed if I don\u2019t get in. \n\nI have visited both schools, and enjoyed the visit to Bowdoin significantly more, but MIT seems like it sets up graduates to be very quickly placed into extremely successful professional careers. I have also thought I wanted to go to college in a city, and Brunswick is far from that. However, I am worried that MIT would be a grind for 4 years, and the students at Bowdoin seemed happier and more relaxed. While I do want to attend a top academic college or university it is also important to me to enjoy my time there, and I\u2019m not sure how much that will happen at MIT.\n\nIt would be very helpful if people could provide some input, especially if they have personal experience with either school. Right now I am leaning towards Bowdoin, but it is hard to say no to MIT because of the name and prestige that comes with it. What do you guys think?",

Yes, in terms of rankings (ofc idk what ur major is so I can\u2019t be too specific), MIT is better but that doesn\u2019t mean that Bowdoin is setting you up to fail. They have ample resources to get your career started or to get you into grad school (and you can always go to MIT for grad school) and you can even do an internship at Boston over the summer if you\u2019d prefer. Yes, college is about making connections and kickstarting your career but it is also about getting the most out of those 4 years which only happens if you\u2019re happy at the place you\u2019re at. It also sounds like you have a better chance at Bowdoin so all the better.",

I loved the school on my visit and enjoyed the team a lot, as well as the other people I met and the vibe around campus. I'm a decent bit of a nerd and I wanted to do some kind of STEM. I liked the size and the location in Cambridge a lot. I did not get in  (I had priced the probability around 20%).\n\nI ended up getting recruited to Bowdoin for RD, went for a visit and liked it a lot. Went there and had a great time. Studied math and computer science. Work in finance/tech now.\n\nSchools are both great, although a bit different. You really cannot make a wrong choice, especially if you aren't going to do STEM (MIT is just unbeatable for that, and compared to a liberal arts school...). I would expect MIT STEM is a fair bit more work than Bowdoin, but I'd expect MIT non-STEM is mostly the same amount of work. I had wanted to go to school in a city, but I ended up very happy at Bowdoin because all the other factors made me not miss the city life.\n\nMy general recommendation is, if possible, to visit and spend as much time as possible with students at each school. Obviously you'll get a tiny sample that may not be representative, but I think understanding what the people and vibe a lot is a good indicator for if you'll fit in and like it.",
