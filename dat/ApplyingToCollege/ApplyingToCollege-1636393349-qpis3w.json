      "text": "This all depends on the college. Some admit students to the college only and have them declare later. Some accept students into the college first and then the major. I do think that there\u2019s not that many who apply undeclared so it wouldn\u2019t be detrimental if you put that you are undeclared. They\u2019re looking at your entire app package, not just your major. \n\nThe concern you would need to consider is if not declaring a major affects your ability to register for classes that prioritize the students who are in their major/dept. that have impacted classes (or major). Some colleges has extreme hurdles for you to major in engr or CS if you weren\u2019t admitted into those majors.",
