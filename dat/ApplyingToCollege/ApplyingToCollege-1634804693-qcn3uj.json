  "text": "I just realized that I accidentally clicked on the wrong Common App personal statement prompt before submitting my application to Columbia. I meant to choose \"The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?\", but I accidentally chose \"Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?\" instead.\n\nI've mailed the admissions office asking if I can change it. Is this a horrible mistake? I honestly checked my entire application 5 times over before submitting but completely missed the fact that I clicked on the wrong prompt. What else should I do? What can I do? In your experience, is this a deal-breaker? ",
