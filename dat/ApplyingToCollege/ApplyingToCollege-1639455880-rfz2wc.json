  "text": "very sick. need to write like 40 more supplementals. \n\nshould i include the fact that i got covid during application season and struggled with my supplementals because of it very briefly (1 line) in the \u201ccovid essay\u201d part or does it just sound like an excuse? what would be the best way to word it if i did? would colleges even care? \n\ni think i may be on the verge of pneumonia. not sure. \n\nthank you!",
