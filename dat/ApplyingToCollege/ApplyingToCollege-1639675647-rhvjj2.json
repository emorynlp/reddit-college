  "text": "Heres a previous post that contains the context: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/rhq6fn/got\\_suspended\\_for\\_theft\\_will\\_this\\_hurt\\_my\\_chances/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/rhq6fn/got_suspended_for_theft_will_this_hurt_my_chances/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) \n\nNot 100% sure that my teachers even know of my suspension (though they probably do), but I do know that my counselor does. Not sure if I should ask to talk to them one on one because honestly I don't know what I'd even say? I feel like I'd just be making excuses for myself or like begging them to believe I'm a good person. I never had a bad rep in class so I know they don't think I'm a horrible person but what am I going to do, they have to write my LOR too.....",
