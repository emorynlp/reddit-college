But I really like material. I have a 3.8 gpa. Should I look into this more or try something else because I\u2019m not naturally good at it?",

      "text": "Copying my comment from another thread:  \nFirst, most people have a lot of errors when they first start coding. When you get more experienced, you'll start making fewer but more confusing errors. Even professional software engineers (like me) make plenty of mistakes.  \nSecond, it's really hard to judge your fit with CS from a high school course. I've heard quite a few horror stories of high school cs courses that were much improved by college courses. I'd take at least one course in college just to see if it goes better.  \nThird, ask yourself how much it matters to you that it's hard. Are you ok with struggling through something fun, or do you want your chosen major to be easy for you?  \nIf there's something else you really enjoy, consider that too, but I wouldn't give up on CS quite yet.",
