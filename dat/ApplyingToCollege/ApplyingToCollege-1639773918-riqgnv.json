If the rest of your application is strong, I\u2019d suggest going test optional. If you feel as if the rest of your application is lacking, then I\u2019d submit it. I got in last year test optional, so it\u2019s not impossible as most people make it seem. UVA focuses more on 4 years of academics than one 4 hour test, so even if it was significantly lower it wouldn\u2019t impact your app severely.",
