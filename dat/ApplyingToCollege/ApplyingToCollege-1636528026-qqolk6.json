Like my counselor said I don\u2019t need to take a Spanish or any language class but everyone else has taken one. What do I do?! Should I sign up to take a Spanish class or is it really not required? I\u2019ve used assist as well to see their agreements but it doesn\u2019t help much tbh. What do I do?!",
