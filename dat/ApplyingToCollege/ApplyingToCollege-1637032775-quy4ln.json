  "text": "I\u2019m a senior trying to apply for UCSD Fall 2022 semester. I know one of the requirements is to complete one year of Visual and performing arts. I have taken one semester of guitar in my freshman year and one semester of Adobe Visual Basic in my sophomore year. \n\nCan those two be added together to get one year of visual and performing arts? Or does it have to be the same class?",
