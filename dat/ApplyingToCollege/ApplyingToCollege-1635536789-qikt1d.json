You can hate and insult your wife and not be a misogynist. If he said something about women and kitchens to her or something of that vein, then you have an argument for sure.\n\nFor #3, fired by Elon himself? Then you surely have an argument. I\u2019m sure that he would respond accordingly if incontrovertible proof of sexual assault were displayed before him and executives. Regarding this story with this engineer, I hope that the case is expanded on, name and shame, etc, because that\u2019s fucked up. But this story reads as extremely fishy, with her having a meeting where they were supposedly incredibly condescending, and Tesla releasing a statement that Gaby wasn\u2019t.\n\nFor #4, the \u201cred pill\u201d means a lot more than just anti feminism, although that is a common theme on the right. Also, if I remember correctly, that was a tweet that he sent, where he literally ends it with a rose, which is indicative on Twitter of Bernie and his followers. Provided this was with misogynistic intent, that would have had to be the only part of \u201cthe red pill\u201d, that were speaking about. It\u2019s a libertarian symbol adopted by those, typically on the right, that has the government, and want to think for themselves.\n\n#5 has to do with transgenderism, not misogyny, but I get your point that this take is ignorant and in bad taste.",

His overall treatment of women, sexist jokes, and personal accounts from all of his past female colleagues can tell you more than enough. You can look at Grimes\u2019 personality amd appearance change, (which all of his wives have done), and notice how Elon changes them to be \u2018better\u2019. Also, look up red pill and it\u2019s meaning.

Search up \u201crose Twitter\u201d, if you don\u2019t believe me.\n\nNarcissism != Skepticism, we can speak about the gu/ personality issues all day but none of his reported comments really scream sexism like the way they should if we\u2019re going to build an argument regarding it. \n\nI would like for this supposed overall treatment of women and sexist jokes to be further corroborated. Regarding Grimes\u2019 personality and appearance change, I would see that as a benefit to her as she is adjusting to her new lifestyle. I wouldn\u2019t want my partner to really have the same \u201ctheme\u201d as Grimes does and I would personally persuade her away from it.\n\nLike I have said before, the red pill is a libertarian symbol of what they believe to be self awareness and freedom. I can see why you would think it is a misogynistic symbol, as there is heavy overlap, but that is not what the red pill symbol is at its core.\n\nThe replies under his post are shifty people who made the replies themselves and believe that Elon is on their side because they share a few ideals",
