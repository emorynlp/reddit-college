  "text": "I heard colleges don\u2019t like seeing people who drop their level senior year. I am planning on taking Ap Spanish, Ap Art, Ap calc, Ap gov next year. Possibly ap physics. I have taken all the possible AP science classes in my high school - as I\u2019m planning on majoring in stem. I don\u2019t like physics and ik I won\u2019t do well in physics (the material does not match with what I do well with). I don\u2019t want colleges to think I\u2019m just going easy next year because it was pretty difficult doing all the Ap sciences (except physics) in the first place. Thoughts?",

              "text": "My point is, if I can be the AO\u2019s advocate,  straight A\u2019s help but are no guarantee. Schools have their own method of calculating GPA and they take into account the courses being taken.\n\nIf it\u2019s between two kids with all A\u2019s, for example, but one shows that the course load wasn\u2019t as challenging, those straight A\u2019s are not alike. Additionally, even if a kid gets a B (God forbid) but he got it in a challenging and \u201crigorous\u201d course, it shines brighter in my mind because you tested yourself\u2026 and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen in college and beyond. \n\nIt\u2019s up to you. But seeing how you\u2019ve never really experienced physics yourself in any real way, I feel your judgments may be premature. I will also add that in STEM fields, memorization doesn\u2019t solve all problems. Creative and conceptual thinking is an added tool\u2026\n\nGood luck!",

I realized a little too late that not taking any ap history classes meant I would have to pay for these classes in college. I was hoping that this move would\u2019ve been a little beneficial to me. I also like Spanish and art (I\u2019m being encouraged by my art teacher to take Ap Art) - I think it would be nice to continue doing advanced classes for fun since I don\u2019t draw unless I actually have a deadline in a class, but I will think a little more about them.\n\nI may be a little too cautious with this, I\u2019m only going based on what I hear my around me which is falling grades in Ap physics, this includes people you would consider straight-a students. I guess my thinking has been a little limited\u2014 going solely on gpa I mean. I haven\u2019t challenged myself in history so I also felt that Ap Gov might be that challenge(?). As opposed to me taking all the challenging ap science classes since freshmen year, which is a clear point that I have challenged myself in science. Thank you for that reasoning about the challenging courses, I think that rly gave another perspective",

I feel like the whole college process has students really twisted up and creating stresses that do not need to exist\u2026 and decisions that end up having no bearing in their pathway (which ends up being a waste of time and heart).\n\nYou will have opportunities within the process to explain yourself, why you did this and that, and what you learned about yourself in difficult times. These things can come out in essays, interviews, etc. \n\nGood luck and all the best wherever you go. Keep it all in perspective.",
