  "text": "I'm 14. I'm taking AP Calc. I screwed up BIG TIME\n\nGenuinely, even if I get 100% on every other test I end with a C+  \nSo, I'm converting my grade to a pass/fail system. The thing is all my other highschool math is an A (A- in sem 1 of precalc- I did this in like a week so its pretty good)\n\nObviously the Pass grade is better than what I'm going to get but is this okay? The pass grade? Will I be penalized?",
