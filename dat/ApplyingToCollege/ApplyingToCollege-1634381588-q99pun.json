  "text": "Google isn't giving me shit, and I'm desperate for any help on how to apply to/contact med school since I'll have to do that sometime around december - february this coming year. I have a 1330 (superscore) SAT score which is low yes but the colleges I'm applying to needs a 1200+ score plus I have the coming december trial to improve my score. I'm planning to study in turkey and I have 2-3 colleges in mind but I need help starting, like what do I do? How do I approach them and increase my chances of being accepted? I'm really new to this applying to college thing and I would really appreciate some urgent help. Anything at all! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(PS: sorry if the flair is inaccurate I tried my best to label it)",

There are some med schools that have an early assurance program that you can apply to during your sophomore year of college that use your SAT score before requiring you to take the MCAT (ie. Mt. Sinai).",

If so, then you apply to those after 4 years of undergraduate study.  Med schools don't care about your SAT score; they care about your MCAT score (and grades).",

They should spell out what their requirements are when it comes to what tests you need to take, what classes, etc.",
