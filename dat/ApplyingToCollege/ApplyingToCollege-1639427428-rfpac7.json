  "text": "ok. here\u2019s the deal. I want to get into Dartmouth SO BAD but I only recently came to this conclusion\u2026 my stats are pretty above average (probably a bit below average in Dartmouth\u2019s eyes) but my essay writing is on par I\u2019d say. I\u2019m thinking about writing a full blown on-my-knees-begging-them-to-let-me-in letter and submitting it as an additional material. is this stupid? I mean I know it is but if it\u2019s well-written how stupid is it? I\u2019ve already written most of it lol\n\nedit: ok so it's definitely beyond stupid. got it. not submitting it. thanks for the responses!",
