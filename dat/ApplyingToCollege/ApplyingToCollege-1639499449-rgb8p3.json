  "text": "I recently received an application fee waiver from uwash at st louis over email and I'm not even eligible for a waiver otherwise. Why do some universities send these out over email to some students and how do they select these students? Btw, I'm not applying to uwash at st louis despite their very generous fee waiver for no apparent reason.",
