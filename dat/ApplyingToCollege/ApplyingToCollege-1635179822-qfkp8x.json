  "text": "so i'm currently the only person in my school who's still virtual this year, as i have a severe health issue that prevents me from returning. i'm on good terms with all of my teachers, but i don't always get the opportunity to participate, nor do they see much of my personality (i join class through a google meet & sometimes they forget i'm there lmao). i'm not sure what i can do to ensure that i can get solid LORs despite this, and i was wondering if anyone has any advice/strategies they used last year",

      "text": "I\u2019m a pretty reserved student in the classroom so I can somewhat relate (teachers didn\u2019t see me participate much and I didn\u2019t speak much). I wrote a resume including all sorts of things I\u2019ve accomplished throughout high school as well as made some of my best personality traits shine. I sent the resume to the teachers I wanted a LOR from. Not sure if you\u2019d want to do this but it worked out for me!",
