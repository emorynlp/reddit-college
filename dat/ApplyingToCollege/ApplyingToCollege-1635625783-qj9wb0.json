  "title:": "The Case For Northeastern CS (and the university as a whole) - an experience / pros & cons list told by a current NEU junior",
  "text": "# TLDR: Joining Northeastern was the best decision I've made in my life. This post is broken down into 2 main parts:\n\n1. My experience at the University (mostly focused on CS but I talk about some other things)\n2. A Pros and Cons list on why Northeastern might be a great choice to add to your college application list.\n\nI hope that after reading this post you're able to decide whether to add the university to your list of applications, remove it from your list of applications, or maybe even turn it into your dream school :) Oh and also feel free to ask me any questions in the comments or check out r/NEU to get another look into our university!!\n\n# Part 1: My Experience at Northeastern.\n\nYou can skip this part if you want (recommended if you don't have time), I talk about some of the same points in the Pros and Cons section as I do in this one but it's a lot of reading to get through so I don't blame you. Now on to my story...\n\n**My first semester (1st year fall)** Fun fact: I switched my majors 2 times freshman year, even though throughout high school I was 100% sure of the fact that I wanted to become a researcher when I graduated college. I entered as a bioengineer, really wanting to focus on nanotechnology or stem cell research. Now at the time of entering college, I was a bit lost about my career. I did some stem cell research at a university during high school but lowkey found it kinda boring. I thought that by studying the field in college and maybe doing a co-op on it, I would be more excited about it, but no, in engineering classes I still felt a bit of the same worries; was bioengineering was right for me?\n\nThroughout the semester I ended up talking to people of various majors and determined that chemical engineering may instead be the right major for me. There were indeed a lot more career prospects that I saw, making me feel that even if I did not enjoy research, I could just transition over to something in the industry. At the same time of switching over to chemical engineering, I made a few friends with Computer Science majors, and although they were always stressed about completing their work, it seemed a bit fascinating to me. I hadn't written a single line of code before college, but them explaining the work that they were doing was really interesting. And so due to this, I decided to pick up a CS minor, electing to take fundamentals of computer science 1 in my second semester. I also was required to take intro to chemE in my second semester as I had committed to at the time becoming a chemical engineer, a commitment as you will soon see was pretty short lived.\n\n**My second semester (1st year spring)** It was time to delve into these major specific courses and actually time to do what I like, right? So it turns out chemical engineering is actually really boring, it's all about pipes &amp; fluids, and less about nanotech. I'm sure if I stuck it out I could've actually learned about nanotech is the higher up courses, but I genuinely did not find intro to chemE interesting. The lack of interest coupled with covid hitting that semester and transitioning to online, I really suffered in the class and did not find it enjoyable at all. My computer science class on the other hand was the complete opposite: the professor was amazing, I succeeded in all of the coursework, found the material extremely interesting and actually ended with an A in the class. Now I was at a crossroads: should I switch over to CS, abandoning my dream of becoming a researcher, or should I stick out the terrible classes in chemical engineering? I was extremely worried about the cost of switching majors, and I was essentially dealing with the sunk cost fallacy. My resume was very much geared towards research, and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to find any experience if I switched majors to computer science the semester before searching for co-ops. I decided to take the jump anyways, and am incredibly happy with the result of it all.\n\n**My fourth semester (2nd year spring)** Finally the moment I was waiting for since the day I submitted my deposit to Northeastern: starting my co-op search. I spent my third semester catching up on the CS classes that freshmen usually take as well as working on a few side projects to sharpen my skills and become familiar with what Software Engineering is like. Searching for a co-op with no experience is really hard, let me tell you that right now, but I can't even imagine what it's like for an internship when you're competing with CS majors from all over the country and world! At least when searching for a co-op on Northeastern's portal, its an internal search between Northeastern students, with positions from January - June and July - December reserved for Northeastern students only. It took me 400 applications, 20 interviews, and a whole lot of failure to finally receive 3 offers at $20/hr, $26/hr, and $33/hr. The effort that it took for these offers was insane, but it was amazing to see the fruits of labor which Northeastern definitely set up for me to grab. Northeastern's co-op portal is an incredible resource which I am truly grateful for, and is the sole reason I am in the position that I am in right now. I ended up taking the $33/hr offer (at a major F500 company), laying down the foundation for my internship search this semester.\n\n**My fifth semester (3rd year fall)** This semester is present day, where I'm currently on co-op and applying to internships/co-ops for next year's summer and fall. Now this search was done externally of Northeastern's portal. Northeastern's job portal is an incredible resource up to a point, but I was determined to get an internship offer at a big name company to set up for an amazing full time job. Throughout the past 3 months I have interviewed at Amazon, Microsoft, Zillow, MongoDB, HubSpot, JP Morgan, DataDog, and Gap, received interviews which I canceled at IBM, Two Sigma, Walmart, Capital One, and actually ended up getting 3 offers, with one from Microsoft which I will be accepting! Now, all of the offers pay tremendously (each at $50+/hr including housing and stipends) which I am extremelllly grateful for, but I am more so grateful for just getting these offers. One year ago I was unsure on the fact if switching majors one year into college would be harmful to my career, but it ended up being that the exact opposite occurred. In every interview I had, I talked about the work that I have been completing in my current Software Engineering co-op, work that all interviewers were incredibly impressed with. Northeastern's CS classes also provided me with the knowledge needed in order to complete the coding interview aspect of the interviews successfully, and let me remind you, I had absolutely 0 experience coding prior coming to college. **At the end of the day, it does not matter where you get your degree, but rather what you're able to do with it, and I think Northeastern is the embodiment of that statement.**\n\nTLDR: Even though now I'm in a completely different major and field as I originally planned to be in, Northeastern's opportunities are allowing me to graduate with 3 co-ops/internships at amazing companies, with a major change, just in 4 years. I don't know if there are any students in other colleges that have been able to replicate the same experience as mine, but the fact I was able to get an intern offer at Microsoft with just about a year of CS experience is mind blowing. I'm the happiest I'm ever been for my career prospects and it's all thanks to Northeastern; I have no idea if it would be possible without it.\n\n# Part 2: Pros and Cons - why I believe Northeastern is a great addition to most students' application list.\n\nSome of this info may be a bit outdated as it's been 2 years since my matriculation so take everything with a grain of salt, but I believe it should still *roughly* be the same. Also I list out alottt of points so hope reading them isn't all that boring.\n\n**The Pros:**\n\n* **No additional essays to apply.** One of the biggest issues with applying to colleges is the pile of essays that each school requires. During my application season, the limited factor of time really required me to select which colleges I wanted to apply to extremely carefully, but since Northeastern has no essays, it really was a no brainer to add it to my list. Worst case scenario I get rejected. Best case scenario I get in and it unlocks 100s of opportunities. Yes an additional application is $75 but that's about like 3 hours on co-op so nothing in the long run of things.\n* **An amazing campus.** This ties a bit into my next point of location but Northeastern is essentially **an Oasis in the city of Boston**. There's plenty of greenery, study/hangout spots, and food so you definitely won't feel cramped, but at the same time, the ability to walk a few steps off campus and be able to explore a huge city is amazing. Walking from one point on campus to another is at max 20 minutes so the compact size really allows you to get to classes quickly on foot and is something I quickly grew fond of. One important point to consider is that Northeastern may not have the most beautiful buildings in the world like the Ivys do, but they get the job done.\n* **Location.** Boston was personally one of the reasons I decided to choose Northeastern and it definitely lived up to my expectations. The city of Boston is so perfectly walkable it's great for exploring with friends, walking down the street to grab a quick bite or groceries, or maybe even just relaxing in the parks and watching the sunset. Boston is also home to an insane amount of other colleges, really allowing you to interact with different people and get an extreme amount of different viewpoints. **The city is nothing short of diversity** so it's a perfect opportunity to learn as much as you want.\n* **The student population.** One of the biggest things I overlooked when choosing a college was whether the people were competitive or collaborative. Some schools like Berkeley are cut throat with everyone trying to get ahead of the curve, but at Northeastern it is an **extremely collaborative population**. No one puts another down but rather we all try to help each other out and really try to help fellow students achieve the goals they want. Being in a career oriented population is a truly unique experience which is wonderful to be a part of. Second, people come from all over the world to attend Northeastern. I know people from Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, California, New Jersey (this is a joke 25% of students are from NJ), Texas, etc. There is so much diversity within the school it's really unique getting to know everyone and what their life was like prior to college. Lastly, I wanted to point out about an unspoken Northeastern pride that's not really shown as we don't have all that many sports to watch, but come to just one hockey game and you'll be blown away. It's insane how helpful the students are to each other, the diversity of it all, and it's something I'm really proud about for our school.\n* **Finances.** There are so many ways that Northeastern allows you to get a cheaper tuition that literally no one should be paying a full price for the university. [Raise.me](https://Raise.me) is a site that allows you to gain micro scholarships for small things like getting an A in a class or winning an award, and these micro scholarships slowly build up; in my case I ended up getting 10k off a year but since my deans scholarship was higher it was ignored. (side note, the time period to submit [raise.me](https://raise.me) may have passed for this year but Juniors, I definitely recommend looking into it). This brings me to my next point, deans, honors, and merit scholarships. Most students get a deans scholarship, going from 10k to 20k off a year. I had a terrible GPA and even I got one! Honors scholarships, getting half off every year, are a bit harder but nothing that tough for someone who has the stats to get into a T-20 but got unlucky. Merit scholarships are via getting National Merit on the PSAT with I believe students getting half off. If you don't get a scholarship it's okay though! Northeastern financial aid is also really generous (at least according to my friends) and usually meets any need required. The only case where I would not come to Northeastern is if I were required to take out more than 40k loans per year but I don't think most students at the university are doing that. Definitely doesn't hurt to apply and see how the finance side turns out.\n* **Cutting down on classes.** This point is something that Northeastern doesn't really advertise but I think they should. As I talked about in my experience, even with a major change I am able to graduate in 4 years, with 3 co-ops/internships (13 months of experience total). And so how did I do this? AP credit! Northeastern **takes anything above a 4 and takes in so many different ap exams.** Didn't take AP exams in High School? No worries, Northeastern also offers a unique opportunity of Challenge Exams. **Challenge exams are essentially AP exams but at no cost** and also allow you to get rid of some requirements. There is literally no downside to them [(here is an FAQ if you are curious)](https://admissions.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Challenge-Exam-FAQ-2021-Update-6.9.pdf) . Yes, you may need to take some summer classes, but Northeastern really allows you to cut down on these classes through different outlets, and with that allowing you to save a lot of time and money.\n* **Switching majors is easy.** In my experience I mentioned how I switched majors two times. The university was extremally supportive about my decision. In fact advisors were incredible encouraging about my decision to do so and helped me come up with the perfect plan to still graduate within 4 years and 2 co-op cycles. All of the classes I took just kept transferring over as schedules have a lot of flexibility in requirements. Even though when I came into Northeastern I did not think it would need to be important to have this flexibility, me switching majors was unforeseen and I'm glad the university was able to take care of me.\n* **And lastly the obvious answer, Co-op.** Northeastern is an extremely career oriented school, and as I described in part 1, my experience using Northeastern's co-op system has been nothing short of amazing for me and I really can't express how helpful it truly is. I can guarantee you that at any other school being able to switch majors and immediately receiving an internship in the field would be close to impossible (ok maybe not at a top 20 but those students are built different). If you're looking to get into the same companies as Stanford, MIT, or Harvard kids but don't have the credentials in High School for those colleges (like me), Northeastern offers the perfect chance to even the playing field just by a little bit for your full time career. Don't get me wrong, I know the prestige isn't the same at all but if you are worried about succeeding in a life post-grad, I think Northeastern provides a great number of opportunities to ease any troubles. Something that some people worry about when it comes to Northeastern is graduating in 5 years but let it be known that this is entirely optional and I think 4 years &amp; 2 co-op cycles is more than enough to get you the experience needed to be successful.\n\n**The Cons:**\n\n* **An extreme need to be Independent.** A need to be independent is present in all colleges, don't get me wrong, but at Northeastern it's a tad bit extreme. Being part of such a career oriented school it really requires you to think early in life about what you want to do, give 10s of job interviews, figure out housing in different parts of the country, and overall not that much handholding. If you end up doing an out-of-state co-op you can feel a bit alone as well (I know I definitely have with seeing a bunch of friends go to Halloween parties), so it's something to be wary of when choosing a co-op location. Even though I've listed being independent as a con, a small part of me is grateful that I have become independent at such a young point of my life. And although there is a need to be independent, there still is a huge support system around you in case you feel lost at any time.\n* **Lack of party culture?** I put a question mark for this point because it can be a pro or con depending on how you are as a person. Yes there are still parties at Northeastern but not to the extent of OSU, Rutgers, UMich, etc. Essentially there are no absolute ragers on campus; if you're looking for one of those go to BU, MIT, or Harvard frats. Northeastern has more of a chill type vibe, just hanging around friends and hitting up the occasional party if wanted. There is quite literally no peer pressure to go or not to go to parties. If you are looking to party, there is a very high chance you'll find something but it's just not constantly shoved down your throat.\n\nOops that was a bit long wasn't it. In my opinion a college should be chosen based on the opportunities that it provides and Northeastern is nothing short of that; **overall, I believe I've gotten my money's worth out of the university.** Anyways thanks for listening to my spiel, sorry for being such a Northeastern shill but I've really enjoyed my experience as a Northeastern student and hopefully I've been able to provide a bit more information on the school !",

Like besides living expenses how much money do you obtain from Co-ops to pay off your student loans?",

Since I have my scholarship and my parents have enough money to cover the rest I\u2019ve been lucky enough to not need to take out any loans, but if I were to I would probably put the 2k/month into that. Next summer close to all my income will go towards investing (7500/month) since Microsoft covers housing but once again I\u2019m very lucky. Next fall is unknown but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be close to 7500/month as I\u2019m trying for another big name. In case you were curious with the math, it\u2019s around 85k pre-tax for one 6 month co-op, one 3 month internship and one 4 month co-op at those provided rates.\n\nIn short, with CS intern pay you definitely have enough money after taxes, housing, and food to invest or cover a few loans if necessary. I\u2019m mostly an outlier with these salaries but just wanted to let people know it\u2019s very attainable.",

I had to take 2 summer classes just to catch up on my major switch but that was fine. If you want to do a minor you might need to take some summer classes but it\u2019s entirely optional. \n\nI think as long as you can get rid of 4 classes using ap credit you\u2019ll be able to do 4 years 2 co-op cycles with no summer classes. If you have more than 4 classes worth of credit you might even be able to do 3.5 years (graduate in december) 2 co-op cycles!",
