  "text": "A few weeks ago, preparing for the onslaught of guests for Thanksgiving, we decided to do a little \"Spring Cleaning.\" As we started going through the old boxes of toys that we had forgotten about, I stumbled upon a Magic 8 Ball.\n\nI did almost throw it out. But then I remembered reading the post about the Stanford coin-flipper. And I had an idea. I shook the ball, asking the damned question that tortured me day in and day out, always lurking in the back of my mind\u2014*Will I get into MIT Early Action*\u2014just to see where it landed. The answer? **Without a Doubt**. \n\nSo this started a ritual: Every morning, before getting out of bed, I groggily sit up and reach for the Magic 8 Ball, even before my phone (Yes, I know, unbelievable, right?). For the past 17 days, I have only gotten positive responses: Yes, Outlook Good, Most Likely, etc.\n\nAt first, I was afraid the Magic 8 Ball was rigged. *Maybe it only has positive answers?* I was wrong. Just to alleviate my concerns, I asked it a blatantly false question: \"Are Hot Cheetos better than Takis?\" To my surprise, the answer was \"Don't count on it.\" It was correct again.\n\nNow, I'm just sitting here, waiting for my decision. If I get accepted, be on the lookout for an eBay auction for a really magical 8 Ball.",
