      "text": "You are asking the wrong question. Acceptance rates are meaningless because far too many students apply to scholarships without researching the scholarship goals and criteria and thus waste their time submitting an application.

Most of the scholarships you list appear to be in the leadership realm. You might also consider the Robertson Scholarship and the Jefferson.",
