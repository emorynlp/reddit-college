  "text": "I'm literally spending every waking hour completing work and I'm miserable. All of my college apps are finally done but I still have 5 finals and 2 projects due next week. Today I reached a point where I honestly couldn't care less. I stayed up until 3 am last night completing an EC application and woke up this morning to find out it's been extended to 12/8. WHY COULDNT THEY DO THAT LAST NIGHT!?!??!?! I put in all that work to get everything done on time but now all the people that missed the deadline get an extension. If a program is extending a deadline then they should at least let us know before the deadline.\nAlso, my application required me to submit a photo of myself and I had technical difficulties so I submitted a different photo than the one I wanted. Should I email them and ask if I can change the photo I submitted? Or is that weird?",

I know the craziness isn\u2019t over and it feels like you can\u2019t stop, but you can. You\u2019ll be healthier for it \u2014and your work will be stronger.  Go outside. Take walks. Put away the screens for an hour. Hang out with friends and just chat. It\u2019s important",
