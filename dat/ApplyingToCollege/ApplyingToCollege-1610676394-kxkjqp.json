  "title:": "Reflections on my process (as someone who came into college with the sole intention to transfer)",
  "text": "Hey guys, \n\nI've been meaning to write this for a while but not gonna lie, got a bit lazy lol. I'm currently a sophomore on the pre med track at the University of Washington, and not gonna lie, I *really* didn't want to go here. In high school, I was like a lot of you guys are - I was roasted on chance me and assured I would get most of the schools I applied to. After all, I did have a 36 ACT, 4.0 GPA, and relatively strong EC's. When I got my results, I was devastated to say the least. It looked something like:   \nHarvard - WL, reject  \nYale - reject  \nStanford - WL, reject  \nJohns Hopkins - WL, reject  \nPrinceton - reject  \nMIT - reject  \nColumbia - reject  \nBrown - reject  \nDuke - WL, reject  \nCornell - reject  \nBerkeley - reject  \nUCLA - WL, reject  \nMichigan - WL, reject  \nUW - accept   \nUNC Chapel Hill - accept  \nUCSD - accept\n\nNeedless to say, I was devastated. I only got into schools that I considered \"bad\", and schools that I had only applied on a whim. \n\nSo, in April, I went to my biology teacher (who wrote my LOR) to tell him that I had only gotten into \"pretty bad\" schools like UW UNC and UCSD, and that I was going to take a gap year to reapply to the same HYPSM + Ivies. My teacher listened to me, and was pretty appalled by what I had to say. He told me in no uncertain terms that I was an elitist asshat (which I was) to call UNC and UW bad schools, especially as a prospective pre med. He told me that while he couldn't control me, he wished that I thought through my decision and didn't dismiss UW, UCSD and UNC. Something about talking to him made me feel icky about my gap year decision, and around this point, I realized that I could transfer. So, I spontaneously committed to UW (because it was the cheapest lmao), since they all seemed relatively equal for pre med, and weren't exceptionally different according to various college rankings, and were all good for bio. (in high school my neuroticism extended to having a spreadsheet with a bunch of THE US, THE Global and US News Rankings, but that's a story for another time). \n\nI'll admit it. During orientation, I was that annoying kid who was obsessed with transferring and thought he belonged at Johns Hopkins. And then I met my roommate. This guy, was an actual legend. He was so impressed that he was here. And, he had a truly inspiring life story. (Not trying to doxx this guy, so I won't go farther). And, despite this realization, I was still cocky as fuck and wanted to transfer more than anything. Fall quarter of freshman year was humbling. Still under the illusion that I was the greatest genius since Einstein, I thought it would be a fantastic idea to take 4 weeder classes. And, yeah, as you can guess that did not go well. Looking back, I actually got the best math professor at UW (everyone at UW would agree with me) ,a great chem professor, and a relatively good lecturer for bio, and yet pulled only a 2.8 GPA. (So, I probably would have failed if I didn't have good profs). \n\nI was crushed. I saw my friends at my state school having a swell time, and meanwhile I was at this school which I considered garbage, and I was flunking. But, during winter break, I realized that I wasn't going to be able to transfer. And that there was no point crying about it. At this point, for better or for worse, I was at UW. And, that wouldn't change. So, I started seeking out opportunities. During winter break, I must have sent 30 emails to people at Harborview Medical Center, UWSOM, the Allen Institute and Fred Hutch. To my surprise, despite my 2.8 GPA, I got about 10 responses, and started research at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center. **As a freshman with a** ***crappy*** **GPA, I had the opportunity to do research at one of the best, if not the best cancer center in the world.** Damn. That really fucking worked out. And, I was in the coolest fucking city (I lived in LA as a kid until I moved out of Cali, can't even compare) in America, surrounded by amazing people. \n\nI got a 4.0 **every** quarter after that. (Though I'm already fucking this one up, lmao). I'm looking at a publication and a presentation at a conference. (Backed by a leading cancer researcher, no less). I had shadowing opportunities in **literally** any specialty I wanted. Classes were fun, labs were especially fun. And, all this from a school which I dreaded going to. Look, I know that UW is still a great pre med school, but frankly, I didn't see it that way. And, I'm sure there are some prestige obsessed kids like me. It will be okay. Everything will be okay. Use my story to learn. \n\nGood luck!",

It annoys the shit out of me to be browsing my school's sub and see that one guy who's obsessed with transferring to Stanford or something. OP, I'm glad to hear that you've changed your ways.\n\nAnd I definitely think it's super inspiring that you can find absolute geniuses at so many 4-year schools out there. If they don't feel the need to transfer, why should anyone at all?(with the exception of people who actually need it for their mental/physical health and athletic recruits).",

All around good grades (well, meh ECs) and for a while I also looked down on some colleges.\n\nI haven't gone to college yet, but I'm trying to reverse that mindset, especially since I'm going to get rejected from like all of my schools lol.\n\nFor a while I thought, \"whatever, I'll just resign myself to going to UCSD\", which is really the wrong way to think about it, especially since the UCs are already better than 90% of universities. \n\nSo I guess try to realize that there are smart people wherever you go, and more importantly, that people can be kind, complex, and interesting no matter where you are, whether it be in the middle of the Amazon or in Hollywood.",

I used to hate my state schools but college apps are a literal crapshoot and realized I might have to stay in-state so I decided to find the positives in schools that aren't \"prestigious.\" If y'all have the same mindset I used to have and think that non T20 schools are shit, go back and check yourself PLEASE; I'm 99.9% sure it's rooted in elitism (like me in the past lol). College is what you make of it and no matter where you end up, passion, eagerness to learn, drive, proactivity, and an open mind are the ingredients you need to reach your goals (as cliche as it sounds). Gaining admittance to a top tier schools doesn't automatically equal success and going to a lesser ranked schools doesn't automatically equal failure. As long as you're secure in yourself and strive to grow, you'll be fine in college and eventually, the workforce :)",

And, in retrospect,  I was probably right in that I did try my best. \n\nBut beyond that, I guess it was just the thrill of SSS and graduation, and I was actually doing some fun things at that point. \n\nI mean, if you can afford the fees, never rule out a school because you might get rejected.

However, some UC's are still safeties for some people, and without being aware of the applicant's situation, it's hard to say which UC's are/aren't safeties. \n\nThis doesn't mean they don't have competitive admissions, or that they're not good schools - they do and they are, even if they're safeties for some people.",

It's about meeting a certain academic threshold, and then winning the lottery by having some essay/talent/story/hardship that sways your particular reader. They have more than enough money and applicants to be arbitrarily picky about who they select. For every 5 students rejected, I'm sure 2-3 of them would have easily succeeded in the institution.\n\nBut, if I may ask, why do you want to go to a private university so badly?\n\nI'm not denying that they have advantages over most schools, but most people don't really benefit from them. Are you planning on getting a regular job (engineer, business, etc)? In which case, you can almost just as easily get in from most public schools. It's nice to have great networking connections, but your public school friends will also get promotions as time goes on, and will become a fairly powerful force as well.\n\nI've noticed the biggest discrepancies when you're at the tippy-top, like when you want to go into politics, C-suite/company ownership, or academia. From my experience, most people don't want these trajectories, so public schools would more than suffice.\n\nIf we're talking about going to top graduate programs (Master's, MBA, PhD, JD, etc), GPA, GRE/GMAT/LSAT/MCAT are the main factors (assuming decent university status). And, at the end of the day, you'll always have more networking contacts from a public school than a private school.",
