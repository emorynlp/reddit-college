  "text": "Already applied to Cornell ILR ED and I was watching their info session today just because I\u2019m bored, and they mentioned how their supplement was the most important part of the application. My supp wasn\u2019t bad by any means but I was really counting on my ecs, personal essay, and recs to be the defining factors of my application not my supplement. If I\u2019d known that earlier I definitely would\u2019ve spent more time on it.",
