LET ME USE THE COMMON APP.\n\nPlus the whole \"change the world\" stuff is BS. You're prepping people for regular ass jobs not fucking world changing scientists or entrepreneurs. I'm just trying to get a degree to become a financial analyst!! I'm not gonna have some world changing impact, so I shouldn't have to pretend like I will for the sake of getting into a college.\n\nAlso ApplyTexas is the worst fucking application system yet... AND I NEED TO FILL OUT A SEPARATE APP FOR SCHOLARSHIP CONSIDERATION?? Consider my automatically like everywhere else lmao. Please. I already have too much shit to write...",

And UT thinks it's a special snowflake and does only Apply Texas for idk what reason (I think TWU does that too) but anyways. And you can't delete a school you added onto your list. I understand UCs having their own portal but apply texas, nah.\n\nEdit: my bad UT accepts coalition. But TWU does only apply texas like why ugh.",
