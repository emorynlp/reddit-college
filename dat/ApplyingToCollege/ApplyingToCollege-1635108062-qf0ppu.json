And UT thinks it's a special snowflake and does only Apply Texas for idk what reason (I think TWU does that too) but anyways. And you can't delete a school you added onto your list. I understand UCs having their own portal but apply texas, nah.\n\nEdit: my bad UT accepts coalition. But TWU does only apply texas like why ugh.",
