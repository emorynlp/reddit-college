  "title:": "How optional is Test-optional for STEM majors?",
  "text": "How important is it for me to send test scores as a stem major? I feel test optional is only \u201coptional\u201d for humanities and journalism majors\u2026 I got a 1320 SAT score (630 ERW, 690 M) and I want to apply early decision to UPENN (SEAS) . My August SAT score was 1240 and I legit didn\u2019t do anything to improve the score, I just got better sleep. If I studied, I could get around the 1400s or maybe the 15s for the Nov 6 test. I\u2019m also an URM and if I got around the 14/1500 range it would definitely give me a boost. I know Penn accepts the November 6 SAT score for early decision applicants. Soooo do I sign up for the Nov 6 SAT??",
