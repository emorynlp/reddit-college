Preppy vibe, if you know what I mean. (i.e. lots of kids probably played Lacrosse or rowed in high school; expect to see lots of Lululemon.)\n\nThat's about all I can tell you. My cousins used to live just outside Hartford & we've walked around campus a few times, and a girl from my old swim team committed to Trinity for swim, so I'm pretty familiar with it.\n\nBest of luck. :)",
