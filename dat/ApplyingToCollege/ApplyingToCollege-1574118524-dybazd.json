  "text": "These kids worked their butts off to become top tier athletes so that they could earn a spot on a D1 or top tier university's team. And these schools have elite athletic programs with large followings of fans, so they have to make room in their class for these athletes or they wouldn't have a competitive team. They earned their spot in these colleges, albeit a different way than most, (sometimes harder if they still have really good gpa / sat score) and its just a shitty thing to say to them that they took someone else's spot.\n\nEdit: (parantheses)\nAlso, my argument is not for or against atheletics in universities, it's something that's already there and plays a big role in universities",

      "text": "I myself haven't actually said this, but I think they have a kind of jealousy towards athletes, which I can kind of understand. In my school (I imagine others as well), sports is heavily funded and valued while the more academic clubs and activities almost never get any attention. For example, I'm in my school's Science Olympiad team, and last year we made it to the state competition and were very proud of ourselves because it was the first time in years our school had accomplished this. We only got a short congratulations in the morning announcements, which no one listens to. In contrast, the sports teams have banners up all over school and special recognition in the weekly news videos we have.\n\nThis is not to say that athletes don't work as hard as others; they sacrifice a lot of time to pursue their sports, and I respect that. It just feels like consistently getting the short end of the stick in terms of positive feedback from peers and others.",

Nothing wrong with doing ur academic competitions for your own purposes, good for you actually, but don't expect it to get a lot of attention from normal people lol",

There's more to college than just academics purely. If you don't like it then that's your problem, but for the majority of people, they actually care about sports and want to have some sort of school spirit/excitingness in their life during college, and sports fills that for so many. If you find random weird academic competitions as super exciting, that's your thing. Just realize that for the average person sports are pretty fun and interesting, even if its just for a way to hang out with friends and celebrate your school pride and have some sort of social life. That's a huge part of the college experience for most people. In comparison, very few people give any sort of crap at all about academic competitions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nColleges openly advertise their athletics as part of the experience of the school. The NFL never has for a second claimed to be an institution for education. Nobody buys NFL tickets for educational value.

There's no reason to believe that the development sports leagues have a substantially increase in fans just because they are affiliated with a school, or that the school should care about it's fans. \n\nFurthermore, 40k isn't that much. Let's assume that a generous 1/3 of those in attendance were students. (Michigan had 2x the number of people attend on average than # of students, Penn St 2.6x, Ohio St. 2.19x). So 13.3k students per game, at an average of 6.79 games per team. Total attendance of 90,500 students at all the games. So it's $177 per person per game. There exists a  significant discontinuity there. \n\n\n>If there was no benefit to the university why the hell wouldn't they cut the program entirely?

Whenever we get to World's we just get a short \"congrats\". The most we've gotten was when we won all of our state offseason competition, and they spliced together 5 seconds of footage of our comp with 5 seconds of footage from an entirely different comp. It's sort of a meme at my school how the football team gets so much coverage only to say they lost and \"we'll get them next time\". That being said, I still think sports require so much dedication. They've got to make sure they're eating right, keeping up their training, etc. At my school they take weight training class, so that adds on to their 2+ hour total. There's a lot of pressure because they know there's only so many spots, and therefore understand all their work could be for nothing.",

It is not for the betterment of the students but just to line their own pockets. They were literally selling students rights away for a video game until they had to stop or else pay the students money.\n\nYour argument that they are the only game in town doesn't mean they are at all altruistic or helpful, just that they have a stranglehold / monopoly on student athletes.\n\n[I take issue with your use of the word decent.

Maybe you can elaborate?\n\nThere's very few schools that make a accounting profit on their athletics. Even fewer will make an accounting profit. I.e., if you invest $100 million on your football program to get a $101 million payment a year later, you made an accounting profit of $1 million. However, because you could have just thrown that into your endowment and gotten $7 million instead, you really lost about $6 million on the football program. So the schools with little positive returns aren't making money, they are losing it. \n\n>With Texas and Tennessee, beyond the direct millions in profits the athletic programs are already returning to the schools, there's the indirect benefits of increased alumni engagement and resulting donations -I don't know how much this would be to be fair,\n\nI highly doubt anyone but the schools, if that, has that data. \n\n>As for the other schools that are losing money on their athletics programs, I wonder how many of those are actively recruiting for sports + reserving seats for athletes\n\nThat's 75% of D1 FBS schools. Those are the big ones doing the recruiting and saving spots, though many of those are probably big enough where the reserved spots for athletes is a much smaller portion of the student body. At a school like NU, it makes a much bigger difference.",

All that you do for time value of money would be to discount your future cash flows by your opportunity cost (which increases exponentially for each year) and then add those values up to then get the real present value of the investment. In your example, the opportunity cost is 7% (100 million invested elsewhere gets 7 million profit), and the present value of the year 1 cash flow would be 94.4 million. This implies that in year 2 we would need at least 5.6 million dollars in present value to be profitable, so we'd need to solve for X where X/1.07^2 = 5.6. This works out to about $6.4 million needed in year 2 to get a positive return, and if the stadium took in $101 million in year 1 they'd easily surpass that goal.\n\nNone of this has anything to do with the reasons why a college wouldn't care to see a financial return on their athletics programs.",

Now other schools this prob won\u2019t apply but the Ivy League has a rule that financial aid is given ONLY based on need . So this means athletes that get in can (and many do) quit and still not be at risk of losing any of their financial support to get their degree.  I saw many horrendous gpa\u2019s and crap test scores by rich Connecticut private school kids who were good soccer or field hockey players . I knew many and most (I\u2019d say about 80%) would quit in the first year or two. \n\nFor the Ivy League it\u2019s like the back door entrance to a good degree . Once you get in you don\u2019t have to play any sports or keep up any type of GPA to continue getting financial aid . \n\nSo fuck that . I think they should rescind all offers and aid to athletes who commit to our school only to drop out within the year . They were admitted for being an athlete and short of a career ending injury I think they should be obligated to stay on the team . \n\nBc as it stands, the next year the coach has to recruit even more people and YES they take deserving students\u2019 spots.",

By applying to the colleges that set these rules, we perpetuate the same exact system. \n\nI really don\u2019t think you understand my point. Colleges tell us the standards by which they admit people. They show us that they will accept kids with low grades if they are legacy/URM/athlete/etc. We know all these things when we apply to schools. We have all the admissions information beforehand. And we still apply to highly selective schools, even with the knowledge that less qualified students will get in and we may not. By applying to these schools, we accept that reality. We accept the rules colleges have set for us. To then turn around and be outraged that athletes/URM/legacies have an advantage is wildly disingenuous. *You knew that fact when you applied, and yet you still applied.* No one forced you to apply to schools that admit students \u201cunfairly,\u201d but you did. Clearly, your desire to attend the school overcame your outrage over their admission practices. \n\nAlso, let\u2019s clarify some things. Did I say that applying to a school means that you agree with everything they do? No. I said that applying to a school means you accept the terms on which admission is decided upon. Not that you agree with a school\u2019s stance on anything else\u2014only admissions. \n\nWhile it was kind of you to dig through my history, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re mischaracterizing my comments on the cost of college. I specifically say that I accept the tuition price of college, as I see a return on that investment that I think is fair. For textbooks, I do not see that return on investment; thus, I will use old textbooks/share/borrow/etc. when possible.",

We choose if and where to attend college, and acting like we are coerced into the college admissions process is an insult to anyone who does not have the opportunity to participate.\n\n\nWhether the practices are right or not is irrelevant. The practices are the way they are because colleges choose them that way. If people truly felt that the practices were unfair or wrong, then they wouldn\u2019t apply to the school. Since people do apply to the school, the college has no incentive to change its behavior. By applying to schools with admission systems that are unfair, you signal your tacit acceptance of those systems and perpetuate the system itself. That is how the argument is disingenuous. The outrage doesn\u2019t extend far enough to actually affect behavior. If it did, maybe the system would change.\n\nHonestly, choosing to attend a school does, implicitly, signal acceptance of the entire school. Even if you object to parts of the school, those objections weren\u2019t powerful enough to effect your decision-making. Attending a school signals that, on the whole, you accept the bad parts of the school. You can work to change them, of course, but you do accept them as not bad enough to prevent you from attending. In other words, you can bear any objections you have.\n\nEven if I did say something bad about a college, what would that prove? If I truly found the college objectionable, I just wouldn\u2019t apply there. If I would still apply there, I would be admitting that the objectionable parts of the college are not objectionable enough to affect my actions; therefore, I can\u2019t really complain about them.\n\nAs for tuition, my take is simple: if you are attending the college, you can\u2019t really complain about tuition. Can you make it known that you would prefer tuition to be cheaper? Absolutely. In fact, interest articulation around issues like that is extremely important. But complaining about the \u201cunfairness\u201d of high tuition is not just interest articulation. It\u2019s complaining about something you don\u2019t like because it hurts you in some way in an attempt to make yourself feel better about it.\nThat\u2019s the entire crux of my argument: there\u2019s a difference between complaining and expressing a preference. It\u2019s fine to express preferences from within the system. It\u2019s not fine to complain about the unfairness of the system when you are tacitly endorsing that system by being included in it. Of course, tuition is an entirely different beast than the admissions process\u2014you have many more options to express your preferences to the college over tuition, but with the admissions process you only have one option: your choice over whether to apply to the school or not. In that way, it\u2019s not really a great parallel, but there are still similarities between the two.",

The same can be said about Walmart, Hyvee, or any other store or business.\n\nColleges these days aren't just operating as a school, they are operating as a business to grab and get more students to come to their college. So they can't just do that on academics alone, so they have clubs, organizations, different perks being there, scholarships, sports, and more to get the most and the best students.

My university had terrible teams that functioned more as a way to recruit smart kids who didn't want to give up their athletic interests completely. But on the subject of image and reputation -- tuition does not cover very much of university costs. They depend on corporate sponsors, alumni gifts, government aid, etc. They do prioritize research that can help them with those goals. All of those things force universities to deviate from their core values much more than something like athletics. I say all of this from personal experience, and I went to a school that truly values the knowledge it produces. I can't even imagine what it's like overall.",

You can improve your test scores by great amounts in months through rigorous studying. Meanwhile, a couple months of rigorous training and improvement for a sport is ***not*** enough to get you recruited for a college sports team, especially a high level one. Most of these people have been playing competitively and dedicating massive amounts of time into their sports since they were kids.",

As a college student, I can attest that a lot of athletes are not on par academically with the majority of students on campus. This hinder the educational experience of other students, such as through lower caliber of intellectual discussion in the classroom.\n\nAs a side point, some athletes act like they are entitled to their spot at the college they\u2019re in. I believe no one is entitled to the spot in highly-selective colleges. There are certainly dozens of other students who deserve your spot - it is just they were not lucky during the admission process.",

Some athletes can and do attend universities on the basis of both their academic and athletic merit, and I applaud those people for their dedication to their schooling and their craft (sports). However, this is NOT always the case. There are certainly plenty of students who are admitted to universities that they otherwise would not be qualified for because they could play a sport well. In my opinion, that\u2019s absolute bullshit. Schools should be solely academic institutions, not also minor leagues for professional sports. There\u2019s enough issues with qualified, smart people not being able to attend the college that they\u2019re best fit for, if they can even afford college. Having recruited athletes usurp positions from qualified students (even if it\u2019s only a small percentage) exacerbates the multitude of issues with our college system and only serves to strengthen the notion that it matters more that one is rich or athletically talented.\n\nThat being said, those people do work incredibly hard mastering their craft and there should be an avenue for them to foster their skills for either professional or Olympic play without having to sacrifice the integrity of the college and university system.",

They don\u2019t need to have a robust profile to get into top school. They just need decent grades and test scores (look up academic index). Students who get into elite colleges academically have spent years building their story and marketing it to colleges, for lack of a better term. Recruited athletes have a much easier time with the application process. Also, schools are first and foremost schools, places of knowledge, learning, and high academic caliber.

If the spots for athletes didn't exist, I'd wager that a lot of them would put more time into studying and academics to achieve the same statistics as their peers. It's fair to criticize the fact that the schools prioritize athletes so much in admissions, but the people themselves worked their asses off with the understanding that it was an avenue into college. Also, the idea that recruitment is a cakewalk compared to admissions is ridiculous - they've been spending years honing their skills, with the knowledge that their chances can be ended by an injury or just not being good enough. I'd argue the hours are comparable, and probably more towards athletes as you go down in school prestige.",

At the same time, I think there's a discussion that can be had about the role/importance/purpose of athletic programs at universities--but there's no right answer there and different universities have different philosophies. Personally, for example, I'm a fan of how MIT approaches \"recruiting\"--but I'm obviously biased.\n\nUltimately, I think when people get mad about athlete's \"taking\" a spot, it comes from their own views on how colleges should prioritize athletic programs and value student athletes. Unfortunately, they don't realize what the larger issue is at hand and resort to taking it out on people who benefit from the \"system.\" \n\nIt's not really productive to engage with those people by arguing about how much time is put into sports and how hard athletes work--again, I think it really comes from different philosophies about what the role of athletics is in contributing to a university's mission.",

There are many schools who don't place high importance on sports and still maintain a high level of prestige, income, and alumni involvement (ie. my university).\n\nDifferent schools have different models and priorities and I think it's fair to both acknowledge the monetary/other benefits of a strong athletics program and, in accordance with one's own idea of what an institution of higher education should accomplish, believe that athletics programs are overemphasized within the model.",

The whole point of it is regardless of who you are if you work hard and you get the results necessary you can get into the school of your choice. Because guess what, that valedictorian who was the leader of two clubs worked Omega hard. The same is true for that D1 level athlete with a 3.5 GPA and 34 ACT. Sure they worked in different ways but they were excellent in their own field. The whole point of recruiting and college acceptances is taking into account what level of excellence they achieved.

In other words, an athlete with a mediocre GPA being given money from the college which might otherwise have been used on an academic scholarship and therefore making scholarships _even more competitive_ for an academic basis. There\u2019s also the issue that once in college, atheletes are likely to get special priveleges when it comes to matters of maintaining their grades and accusations of sexual assault getting glossed over or ignored entirely.\n\nI\u2019m not at all implying that all student athletes are just dumb and don\u2019t deserve to go to college. Student atheletes put in incredible work. But the point of going to college is to get a degree, not play a sport. Partial scholarships for sport, sure. Even musicians can be offered scholarships. Yes, colleges make money on sports and college sports are how major league teams often recruit. But that system is bullshit, and athletes benefit from it while others are faced with constantly mounting challenges in not just admittance, but scholarship qualification. \n\nI went to overseas to university in the UK, and while I\u2019m not sure what academic scholarships might exist and how common or rare they are, they didn\u2019t have the sports-worship that the US has. The unis seem to do just fine without counting on their sports teams for money, and even in the application process, consideration is only given to your grades and scores. They don\u2019t care what sports you did, what clubs you were in, or what instrument you played. Basically I\u2019m saying that\u2019s the way it should be. You want to continue working hard at your sport? Great. But you\u2019re not getting funding for it, and if you don\u2019t have the marks, you\u2019re not getting in.",

The university had decided to expand the number of classrooms and remodel what was there to accommodate more people.\n\nThey had started tearing down some walls when a tornado took out the football stadium. With the insurance money they got from that, they then canceled renovations on the biology hall and diverted the funds from that to the stadium as well. It took them three years or so to start renovations on the biology department again.\n\nAnd for what?

I think instead, both academics and athletics should be considered because some people from my school had 35s on the ACT and were really good academically and put just as much work hard work into football and were pretty good but not the the best.
