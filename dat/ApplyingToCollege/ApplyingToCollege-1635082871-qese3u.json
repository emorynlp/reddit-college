  "title:": "weighted vs unweighted",
  "text": "Which one do schools care more about? My unweighted gpa is definitely a bit low (at least for this thread) but I would say my weighted gpa is pretty solid. I am in a program where I took all college classes for the last two years of high school so I got a significant boost. Would this help me a lot, like enough to get into my reaches? Or do colleges mainly care about weighted? \n\nFor reference: UW3.29 W4.06 and test optional\n\nSchools i'm applying for if it gives you guys any insight(everywhere EA if they offer it):\n*Tulane ED(big reach I know but dream school)\nUMD college park\n*UMiami\n*Ohio State\n*Syracuse\nPenn State\nPitt\nMiami in Ohio\nPace\nUMass Boston\n*Virginia Tech\nUVM\nBinghamton\n\n* next to my favorite I really hope I get a yes from",

      "text": "Colleges will recalculate your GPA. Also, colleges know that community college classes are typically easier than APs, despite being weighed the same. I think your starred schools might be hard to get into. UMass Boston, Miami in Ohio, UVM, and Pace you should definitely get into though. Did you take the SAT? A solid SAT could definitely boost your application, same with good extracurriculars.",

I wasn't aware community college classes were that much easier than APs I thought it would give me some type of edge lol. I did the early college health sciences program so it was a lot of biology and anatomy stuff which I thought was pretty difficult if it means anything. What do u think abt Virginia Tech? I thought with their acceptance rate I might be able to get myself in.",
