  "text": "Hello. I'm applying to college this year. In comman app one of the first essay topic is about identity interest or talent that is meaningful. I want to write about my being trans and intersex, however I'm not sure whether it will decrease my chances of getting into a uni. I don't want college ppl to think that i am manipulating them with me being trans. However i think that this expereince shows how strong and enthusiastic i am. I am just really scared that the admission will take it as manipulation and thar i am using it as a \"token\" to get to a collve without deserving. What do yall think?",

      "text": "(sorry for the incoming ramble. i feel very strongly about this because i, as a trans person, experienced something similar last year while applying to colleges.)\n\nit didn\u2019t decrease my chances. you can actually make it work in your favor\u2014i did. \n\ni chose my top school in part because of their progressive attitude and acceptance towards trans people, so in the \u201cwhy do you want to go here?\u201d essay i wrote about that. i mentioned that i wanted to be an environment where i can grow as a person, express myself, and focus on academics at the same time. i also said that i wanted to involve myself in advocacy within the college\u2019s community to help sustain and encourage diversity. i got in with a great scholarship, and now i\u2019m in a supportive community where everybody respects my identity without question.\n\nit\u2019s not manipulation at all, it\u2019s raw honesty. any school that doesn\u2019t accept you for who you are isn\u2019t worth your time. (make sure you look into how accepting each school is of trans people, by the way. it will save you a lot of grief. you\u2019ll want to be in a supportive environment.)\n\npersevering as a trans and intersex person DOES make you seem strong. life isn\u2019t always easy for people like us. schools know that. just the fact that you\u2019ve made it this far and aspire to chase a better future shows your passion and drive. best of luck, i hope everything goes well. :)",
