  "text": "I always hear that colleges will recalculate your reported GPA, but how exactly do they do that? Do they remove certain courses from calculations? Are your marks boosted based on the area you come from? \n\nIt\u2019s out of my control, but I\u2019m curious.",

      "text": "Hard to say because colleges do not (and will not) specifically release that info. Most likely they may exclude non-academic electives (PE, drama, choir, etc) or ignore +/- that some schools add to letter grades. But a more accurate way of characterizing the process would be that colleges look at your transcript rather than overall gpa, recalculated or not. They want to see specific grades in specific classes, not an overall number (that also varies widely by high school).",
