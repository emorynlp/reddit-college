I\u2019m 123 pages into reading the whole 204 pg. document and there are dozens of cases all with USC where payments were made to \u201cUSC Women\u2019s Athletic Board\u201d And \u201cUSC Men\u2019s Water Polo\u201d. Basically a woman in the athletic director\u2019s office (Donna Heinel) was selling admissions spots on teams in exchange for donations to their programs (and side bribes also). Those donations are (if I remember them all) are somewhere in the $50K+ range. Then the parent would pay another amount (like $200K) to Singers\u2019 \u201cFoundation\u201d that was then used to pay bribes directly to Heinel, the coaches, the testing centers and the test-taking ringer. \n\nI was also under the impression that the universities were victims also, but that\u2019s not totally the case with USC. Some of their athletic teams benefitted directly from selling those spots. The evidence is all over this document with dozens of clients as they were instructed to send checks payable to \u201cUSC xxx\u201d. I have not come across any of that with the other schools though.",
