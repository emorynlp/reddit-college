  "text": "Ok so this might be a little long so I will try to keep this short and simple. Basically, during the end of last year, there was a Science Olympiad interest meeting. Now it\u2019s the end of first semester, and no word has been said about it by the sponsor at all so I don\u2019t know what has happened. I also asked the sponsor a few months ago by email but all she said was that she was still thinking about it. There still has been no word said about it and I really want a SciOly at my school because I think it seems really fun and I think this would be something I would be genuinely enjoy and be good at. I\u2019ve never competed in one nor have I had experience in one so I have no idea what to do. Please give me some suggestions on what I should do and some advice would be great.",

      "text": "Scioly is a ton of fun!! My favorite EC throughout hs for sure. To get started, you\u2019ll want to find 10-15 kids with a diverse set of skills (good options are at least one med, bio (other than med), chem, and physics nerd and someone good at building things). You will also need a parent or teacher coach.\n\nThen, you just need to register with your local regional competition through Scilympiad. You can try to sign up for some invitationals (also through Scilympiad.)\n\nFor resources, get started with scioly.org, the SO inc website, and the scioly subreddit.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!",

It's a ton of hardworking but very rewarding.",
