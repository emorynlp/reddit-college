      "text": "It\u2019s now near impossible to switch into a major like CS at many UC\u2019s (especially Berkeley and SD) because they are sooooo over enrolled and many departments cannot handle more students than intended.\n\nEconomics and Math are popular courses, so it all depends on how you do in pre requisites. If a major is competitive (I assume Econ is) you NEED a very high GPA in pre reqs to be able to transfer because of the competition for very little seats available.\n\nIf you work hard though, it should be possible unless it\u2019s not like CS or ENG. Although Econ is not too far off in terms of its competitiveness. \n\nThe UC\u2019s are a public school, which are traditionally more strict in terms of major caps than are privates. So keep that in mind",

Like one other comment mentioned, a few majors are impacted & will require min GPA and/or min grades in a specific course, but it\u2019s relatively easy to switch to a non-impacted major. FYI, the min GPA & coursework requirements are there no matter what (even if you say you want Econ on your app, you won\u2019t technically be an Econ major until you\u2019ve met requirements to declare).",
