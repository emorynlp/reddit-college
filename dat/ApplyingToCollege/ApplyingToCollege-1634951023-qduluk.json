  "title:": "Do I Need to Submit Transcripts from Online Courses Already on my Official HS Transcript?",
  "text": "I've taken quite a few courses online through my state course provider (think FLVS), which my school accepts for credit, and also puts on my transcript. Do I still need to send transcripts directly from the state course provider to colleges, even though they are already indicated on my high school transcript?  \n\n\n I've also taken courses at my state flagship university, and some colleges explicitly state that they want college transcripts, even though these courses are also on my transcript; however, they don't specify if they want online coursework transcripts. Should I submit them just in case? I don't really want to call every admission office to clarify.",
