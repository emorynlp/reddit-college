  "text": "Hi! This may seem like a dumb question so I'm sorry if it's obvious but is there a greater benefit in going to a school that has a larger undergraduate percentage and overall puts more effort into them? For example, if one got into NYU and Columbia, while Columbia is obviously an Ivy, it has more graduate students than NYU with more undergrad. Is there an obvious benefit to going to a school that seems to care more for its undergrad? \n\n\\- Thanks!",

Your best bet would be to speak with the current students to see what resources are allocated for them and what issues they're facing.",

      "text": "Not really.  Regardless of the ratio of undergrads to graduate students, faculty at research universities get promoted (or not) based on research output.  Some schools try to incentivize undergraduate teaching by giving out awards for it, but, generally speaking, you're not making full professor based on how well you teach undergrads.",
