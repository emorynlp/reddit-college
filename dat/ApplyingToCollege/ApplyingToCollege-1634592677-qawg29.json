I spend 3-5 hours volunteering each week, 4 hours doing art council work for the Carnegie Museum, 1-2 hours doing club work at school, 15 hours working at my job, 2 hours doing work for my own arts organization I started, etc. So somewhere around 25 ish hours a week for me, but that\u2019s just because I can\u2019t stop doing things or I feel completely useless on account of my crazy pressurized upbringing.",
