  "text": "Hi there. My name is Josh, I'm from South Africa. I'm currently in the process of applying to Universities (both here in SA and in the US). Long story short, I won't be able to write SATs and I'm afraid it'll harm my application and chances of getting into the universities I want to get into. My family doesn't have a lot of money and so I'll pretty much be needing full financial aid/scholarship to be able to attend an American college. \n\nAt the moment, I think my application looks pretty decent. I have straight A's, around 100 hours of community service (The President's Award - Gold Level), have many years of provincial representation in sport, play 1st team (the equivalent of Varsity in the US) for all of my sports, have leadership roles, been involved in cultural activities and many different clubs at school, very good recommendation letters, etc. Basically most of the things that Google has told me that I must have except for SATs. Do you think I'd still have a decent chance at getting into schools that'll be able to meet my financial need? From my understanding, the only ones that'll be able to meet my needs are big Ivy League schools that are super hard to get into (like Harvard and Columbia, my two favourite Unis that I've been looking at btw). Any help would be hugely appreciated!\n\n\\-J",
