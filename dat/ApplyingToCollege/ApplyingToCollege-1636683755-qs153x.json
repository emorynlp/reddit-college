  "text": "At the start of this school year I decided to take AP Stats online as an extra class and now I'm regretting it (Sophomore year). I only took it because other kids at my highly competitive high school were taking AP classes online and labelled them as an easy GPA boost. However, it has caused me some anxiety especially since I really don't get enough detail and nuance from the online course and also while writing FRQs. Overall I'm just really unhappy with the class, but I do plan on taking it irl in the future.\n\nMy big question though is, is how greatly would a W/P effect my chances with colleges(T20s, Ivies, or high rated state school).",
