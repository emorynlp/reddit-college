  "text": "There is this girl who was my scioly partner. She didn't do shit for the event so the night before the event I tell her to reformat the cheat sheet so it is easier to read. She get all offended and gives me a lecture on \"oh this is the only thing you think girls are good for and not the real science.\" Then during the exam i see that she is getting all the questions wrong so I obviously change all her answers and do teh test myself. We end up placing 1st place (which she then flexes to all the teachers and on her college apps) and writes an essay explicity mentioning my name as a sexist (I have a very unique chineese name). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is applying for the same schools as I am for the same major. Will this hurt me? What can I do to fix this?",
