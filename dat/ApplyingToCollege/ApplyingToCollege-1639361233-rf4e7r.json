  "title:": "mistakenly put incorrect SSN on csu application",
  "text": "hi all, a few weeks ago I submitted my csu application but realized I mistyped my SSN. I had called all the schools I applied to & majority of the schools sent me a pdf on changing the correct number, while one school just told me to change it once I\u2019ve been accepted. side note, my family & I don\u2019t qualify for FASFA. additionally, I have already gotten into some schools, but still haven\u2019t yet changed the number yet. I personally don\u2019t feel safe due to privacy sending my correct SSN via mail (or fax) so I\u2019d rather wait for all the other schools to contact me when they need it. \n\nI need advice; should I call all the other schools, telling them I don\u2019t qualify for FASFA in the case there may be some sort discrepancy? & maybe something along the lines along not wanting to send it for security/privacy reasons? \n\nany help would be greatly appreciated! thanks in advance!!",
