  "text": "I feel sick with worry. I submitted my UC application last night, but just found an error. I enrolled in college classes in high school, but added an extra semester of a class that wasn't supposed to be there. I still took that course (exact same name), but it was instead just an Honors class through my school. Really confusing, right? Should I contact the all the schools to address the mistake? I'm frightened that my application will get rejected.",
