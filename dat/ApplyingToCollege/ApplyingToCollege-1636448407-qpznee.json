  "text": "My interviewer did a STEM degree and I'm applying to psych. Is it a net positive that I'm planning to study something different (so they can't probe me too far, since I, for one, have never had a single intellectual thought in my life) or is it negative- that we wouldn't be able to connect as well?\n\nHYPSM interview. I know this sounds like a rly unnecessary question to ask but interviews worry me HAHA",
