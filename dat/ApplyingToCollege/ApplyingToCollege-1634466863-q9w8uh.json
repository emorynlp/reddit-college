The more unique and out there the prompts are, the more they limit the possible responses and the more they limit your ability to communicate who you actually are.\n\nMost generic prompts are open to the same types of answers you\u2019d give to the uchicago ones and so much more - this openness in response makes you stand out more because you\u2019re more likely to be able to say something unique about yourself and the world than you can with the uchicago ones.\n\nI actually quite enjoyed coming up with responses for the UChicago ones even though I\u2019m not applying there - specifically the one relating to the material of celestial bodies and the old dividing by 0 ones. But as college application prompts, they\u2019re extremely flawed.",
