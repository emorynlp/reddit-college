  "text": "In my essay, I mention something I made that, when you google it, comes up and makes up most of the top results. It is difficult to explain the significance of what I made without them seeing it online, so I was planning on saying something like \"if you'd like, you could google \\_\\_\\_\", but I don't know if that would be considered rude. Thoughts?",
