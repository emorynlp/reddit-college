              "text": "You probably know already that being an intl needing full aid is the toughest spot to be in for US admissions. Best I can offer is cast a wide net of both LACs and universities as long as they meet 100% of demonstrated need for intls. Admissionsmom had a post some time back of folders of different college lists, one of which was a folder of colleges that had historically been generous with intl aid. If you haven\u2019t checked that out already, I\u2019d consider adding some of those colleges.",
