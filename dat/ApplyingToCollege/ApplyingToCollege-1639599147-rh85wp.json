  "title:": "Where to open decisions",
  "text": "I\u2019ve been contemplating on whether to open my UPenn decision tomorrow during basketball practice which goes from 3:30 to 5:30 (decision comes out at 4pm pacific), or if I should simply go home and then open it. If I were to do it mid practice or immediately post practice, I could do it with my friends and they are planning to film my reaction. Yet I don\u2019t want it to be disappointing for them if I made it seem like a big deal but didn\u2019t get in. They all want me to open it during practice, but I\u2019m so frustrated and don\u2019t know which to choose. Any opinions? Thanks a lot\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73",
