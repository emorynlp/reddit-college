      "text": "I\u2019m almost certain that with all schools, LORs will be required with your submission (whether that be EA, ED, or RD). According to UMD\u2019s website...\n\n>> UMD requires two letters of recommendation for a completed application: one from your school counselor and one from a teacher. If you have additional letters of recommendation you would like to submit, please feel free to do so.\n\n\nI would suggest emailing your teacher and counselor ASAP. If your school has a brag sheet, do that as well. Mine was required for my counselor recommendation, and to be fair, I think it helps. Good luck!",
