Do you think it is more cutthroat and toxic or collaborative?",

          "text": "1 - cornell is PRETTY rigorous i would say, as the average grade for intro science classes tend to be B/B- or somewhere in between. with that said, you can definitely do well if you use your resources and work hard, and as you get used to the challenging courseloads. clinical opportunities around campus are really hit or miss: there aren't too many volunteer/clinical job positions available in the local area (downside of going to a school in a rural region) so you have to be really proactive to snag them. otherwise you can do your clinical hours at home/other places during breaks. however, i'd say that the research opportunities are fantastic here (important if you want to go to top20/research medical schools) - you can do research in so, so many fields, from chemical engineering to public health to molecular nutrition, to name a few. \n\n2 - i can't say b/c im not applying until next year, but i've heard from others that med schools do take cornell's rigor into account when you apply. this is corroborated by the fact that cornell's average accepted applicant GPA is around 3.65, while the average accepted GPA nationally is around 3.7. on the flip side, b/c a lot of students at cornell represent some of the best students in the nation, the competitive nature of our student body also makes it difficult to stand out. so it's really what you decide is important for you. \n\n3 - i actually (for the MOST PART, there are annoying pre-meds here, don't get me wrong) found my pre-med experience significantly better b/c of the friends i met in some of the intro courses. my fellow pre-med friends have never hesitated to help me out, and i always do my best to pass resources or help my friends if they're having trouble with a concept or something, so the community i found was probably the best part of being a pre-med here.",

Am I mistaken? Why is it like that?",

          "text": "statistically, yes, cornell has a lower acceptance rate to college than other top universities. but that statistic doesn't predict whether YOU will get into medical school. your chances of going to medical school is partially under your control (your grades, MCAT, ECs, letter of recommendation, etc), which is not completely dictated by the institution you attend.\n\nkeep that in mind, because when you choose a college to go to, focus on not whether it has a \"good\" medical school acceptance rate, but whether you truly feel as if you'll be happy there. you're spending 4 years at a single place, so you want to make sure that school provides the kind of environment, resources, and community you want. first and foremost, the most important lesson i learned while going through almost 4 years of college with a rigorous courseload/schedule is that at the end of the day, what i choose to do with my life now and in the future doesn't matter unless i truly feel happy with it.",

ALSO cornell makes its OWN ICE CREAM LOL! it's not my absolute favorite but still pretty cool to be going to a school with its own ice cream brand :) \n\nin terms of undergrad experience, i think the \"rural\" local area of cornell makes it super unique - as a result, we really get a \"collegetown\" feel as students here b/c cornell makes up a large portion of the ithaca (the local town cornell is located in) community. \n\nalso we have classes that most other schools probably don't have - like a wines tasting class (you literally drink wine during the class lmao), ice cream making class, beers tasting class, ciders tasting class, scuba diving class, skiing class, etc., so i would say that cornell really can put itself in its own category sometimes!",
