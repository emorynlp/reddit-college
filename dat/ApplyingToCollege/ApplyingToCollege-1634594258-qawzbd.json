  "text": "Now, I'll just start and say I know I'm extremely lucky that my parents even care about my college applications. They make good money (enough to bar me from any kind of non-merit aid), and I go to a really good high school. \n\nHowever...they are so damn involved in this. Every single day since August, we have had around 2 hour  discussions (I don't even know how they have the time for this), and they are solely dedicated to different parts my application.\n\nI can handle going over the ECs and minor parts of the Common App with them, in fact I very much appreciate that. What I can't handle is going over my essays. Every day, my dad finds something wrong with these essays, and when he doesn't think I'm answering the question right, he flips out and gets extremely pissed. It's so bad to the point where I'm literally shaking in fear whenever I'm trying to write my next essay. Like, at this point I'm not trying get into college, I'm essentially just trying to please my dad. I think I would have so much less stress if I did them and revised on them on my own. (Btw, my mom also works on my application, but she's basically just my dad's minion.)\n\nI'm pretty sure most people's parents aren't this involved in their application, but am I wrong? Should I just be happy I'm getting any help from my parents at all? Idk man, but at least it's almost over...until regular decision :(",

Or can you say \u201c can I email you this to review while I work on other stuff - the you can give me comments tomorrow?\u201d. They probably *think* they are being helpful. \nOur school counselor hasn\u2019t done a lot really but one thing she has done is tell all the parents collectively to back off. It was useful\u2026",
