  "text": "i am seriously a detective. for the past 3 years, it\u2019s been on a Thursday in mid-december, so that would imply December 16th for this year. last year, every applicant got an email saying that their checklist was not available for viewing on the portal on December 11th, and then brown sent out an email revealing the decision date (December 17th for that year) the day after (on December 12th). This year, the portal closed on December 9th, which is earlier. So that means we should know soon when decisions are coming out? seems like they might be earlier this year because of portals closing earlier (9th vs 11th). idk. i\u2019m insane.",
