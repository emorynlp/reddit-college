  "text": "So I'm currently in AP CS and AP Calculus AB, and I'm kind of struggling in these classes due to bad teachers, and just the fact that they're both pretty hard classes. I have almost all A's on my transcript, but will 2 B's in these classes mess up my admissions chance, especially in top schools? The semester is almost over, and I don't have much time to get them to A+'s. What should I do??",

      "text": "I can't say for top schools, but since you are in AP CS, I assume you might consider CS as a major. I go to UIUC for CS which is relatively competitive, and in high school, I got a B in precalc, calc AB, calc BC and a couple other classes. I ended up taking calc BC twice to get an A in it the second time around. I'm not sure what your school's policy is for grade replacement, but you could look into that if needed. Unless you are really striving for a 4.0, I wouldn't sweat it too much. Good luck on your finals though!",
