  "text": "Kind of a stupid question Ik, but I was wondering if the word limit on supplemental essays which need to be uploaded, i.e. not typed into the boxes, has to be rigidly followed? Like for my Amherst supplemental which is of 300 words, I am stuck at 390. Do colleges check the word limit? I will most probably edit it to get it to the correct limit but I was wondering if it can be done.",
