      "text": "Just my personal opinion (as a parent), I would try to avoid it, not so much for being unacceptable, but there must be a better way to get your point across. I would work on the idea behind the sentence, as \"thought we were going to get screwed by our teacher\" is saying, to me, that you were making an unwarranted assumption about the teacher being a jerk. If you carefully consider what your idea or point is, you might come up with a better way to say whatever it is you are trying to say.  It may take some thought, so be patient with yourself.",

              "text": "I would reconsider. Not only is the language sort of lazy, it's less than clear. Perhaps if you are more precise, the sentence will write itself. Your follow on phrase makes it seem to me that a more fitting verb would be something along the lines of scolded or reprimanded, or perhaps punished, not screwed. Screwed may not fit your meaning.",
