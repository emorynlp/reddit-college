  "text": "Hi! I want to be an Astronomer (more specifically, a cosmologist) and while choosing majors in applications for some universities, there are options for Physics, Astrophysical Sciences, or Astronomy. Which one do I choose? I mean, I know I should major in physics and then go into graduate school to study astronomy, but what does an Astronomy major specifically mean? How is it different from Physics IF you want to be an Astronomer?",

      "text": "Astronomy studies celestial objects in the universe. Astrophysics is a branch of astronomy that is a little more theoretical and deals with the physical aspects of celestial objects (energy, formation, evolution, etc) It doesn\u2019t matter which one you choose. If a school offers an astronomy of astrophysics major, you can always do that and then minor in physics or biology or something similar. Hope this helps :)",
