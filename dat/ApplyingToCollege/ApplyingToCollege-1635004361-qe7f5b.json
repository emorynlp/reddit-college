  "text": "I know that you\u2019ve probably seen like a million of these posts, but please hear me out. Any help/opinion is appreciated.\n\nI read in this subreddit that if your high school is well-known, (mine is one of the three best high schools in Turkey that sends many students to T20s every year) and if other students from your high school with similar GPA got 1500+ scores, (which they did, and I have similar or higher GPA than them) SAT wouldn\u2019t make or break my application. Other than the SAT, in my opinion my application is quite strong; clear hook on politics, well-rounded, decent awards and ECs with many leadership roles but nothing super extraordinary, total of 7 AP and SAT Subjects with best/very close to best scores, and finally probably the best part of it, essays and recommendations. \n\nNow the only date that I can take the SAT, which I never studied for so far, is 4th of December. I can try and get the best score I can on that, or as an alternative, I can focus on my mid-year exams which will be sent to colleges via mid-year transcript and apply to more colleges (currently 17, might be 26). Considering all of these information, what should I do? Thank you so much in advance!",

      "text": "\"Should I take SAT?\" The answer is usually yes. Afterward, you can decide whether or not to submit the score. 7 weeks may be plenty enough time to prepare for the SAT. If you have not already done so, try a practice test, timed at home, to see where you're at right now.\n\nr/Sat",

      "text": "Which school? I'm guessing Robert? If that's the case, you should be able to ace the SAT. SAT Maths is a joke compared to our curriculum, and Writing is incredibly easy if you use Erica Meltzer's guide to SAT Grammar. The only problem is Reading but you're obviously from a school that teaches in English, so you could handle that as well.\n\nYour mid-year report is much less important than the SAT. And you can do both at the same time, SAT isn't like YKS you could get a great score with just a few weeks of study. \n\nRegister now. If you get a garbage score just don't report it.
