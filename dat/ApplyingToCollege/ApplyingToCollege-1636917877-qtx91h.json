Let me put it this way: \n\nPretty much every admissions site I\u2019ve seen says interviews are offered based on availability. Not receiving an interview would just mean there was no one available to interview you.\n\nThe only exception I\u2019ve seen is one where interviews are offered \u201cif additional information is needed\u201d. I suppose you could fall at either end of the spectrum for this one.",
