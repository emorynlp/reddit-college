Turnsout she was doing a tons of stuff off school. Internships at unicef, coding in 4 languages, developing an app, publishing an book , volunteering at organizations and other basic stuffs. Its weird how she managed to hide all of this and one day all of a sudden she post about getting into harvard. What a life man damnnn",

The ACT is standardized so you\u2019re actually being compared to the national standard as opposed to your school\u2019s, which causes a lot of problems of kids to think the tests are \u201cunfair\u201d or whatever when what it really is is a great indicator of how well you\u2019re going to be able to test in college, which helps schools make fair decisions. It also raises major red flags in my opinion if you have a 4.0 and can\u2019t crack a 30 act because the disparity should not be that strong, and the removal of the requirement allows some kids to hide behind a good gpa without being nearly as ready as colleges think they are.",

Indeed, we live in a developed country where most people do not consider these chances. But those people do not care about these because they already know and planned their own lives. Less privileged kids will take every chance of these but they are simply blocked. \nSo maybe she cold emailed but she was privileged enough to know that Unicef accepts high school interns.",
