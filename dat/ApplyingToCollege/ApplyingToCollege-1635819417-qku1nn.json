  "text": "I'm applying to transfer, and the common app looks a lot different than two years ago. Last time I applied, I only had one school added to the common app, and I requested all my recommenders to that school. Then I was able to select my recommenders on each program I added later. So each teacher only had to upload their letter one time to the common app.\n\n Is it still the same as two years ago, or is it set up now where I'll have to send emails to every recommender for each school (aka spam my professors with a dozen requests)?",
