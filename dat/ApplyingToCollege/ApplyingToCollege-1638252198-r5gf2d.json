  "text": "I don\u2019t care about prestige or whatever or bragging rights. I feel like any time I\u2019m online all I see is that I need to have a good name brand college to get anywhere in my industry, and that scares me. I feel like if I screw up now I screw up my entire future and I hate that so much.",

              "text": "So top tier consulting firms and Wall Street really care about college names or having family connections to a lot of rich people or demonstrated skills/solid work ethic + brains. And in any other business job it doesn\u2019t matter - graduation from an accredited state school will suffice. Even better if you have demonstrated skills in marketing or HR or accounting. Trust me, CSUDH or USU is fine",

It just means you might have to make the connections yourself rather than having it be handed to you.
