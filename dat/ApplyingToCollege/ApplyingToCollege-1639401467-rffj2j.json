  "text": "A bit of background, I'm really interested in pursuing biology in college, but I'm also really good at CS. So, I wanna go to a school that has a good computational biology program. CMU is one of the best in that field, BUT the thing is, I would have to apply to their school of computer science. With the 7% acceptance rate (even for ED) for SCS, I really don't think I'll get in. So should I instead pursue a biology major at Tufts and ED there? I still really want to do SOMETHING in comp bio, though, so do you think it's possible to do research in that field at Tufts? I've been reading the type of studies undergraduates there do and the majority of it seems to be wet lab stuff...\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to know what you guys think of this situation. I don't want to get this choice wrong because if I don't ED to Tufts, then yield protection will hit me hard lmao (I basically didn't attend any official info sessions, etc to show demonstrated interest bc the school is right in my backyard and I see the campus every day).",

      "text": "Although Tufts has yet to match CMU CS program, it is increasing in quality somewhat drastically. They recently (literally like 1-2 weeks ago) opened a massive new building dedicated to CS/Math departments. Look up Joyce Cummings Center. Additionally, the new T stop will be opening very soon. Tufts is probably a more well rounded school, and if you choose it it\u2019s not like you\u2019re choosing a school with a terrible CS program \u2014 it\u2019s relatively very good.",
