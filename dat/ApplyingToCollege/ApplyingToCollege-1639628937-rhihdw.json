  "title:": "Rejected by Harvard",
  "text": "I\u2019ve spent my whole life preparing to get into Harvard. My parents spent thousands trying to buy out the AO but even that didn\u2019t work. When I got the rejection letter I got so mad that I started storming around the house and breaking everything in my path. My girlfriend of 10 years started crying and begging for me to stop but I couldn\u2019t see anything beyond my wall of tears and pure hatred. I threw a vase that said \u201cGrandma\u201d for some reason at her feet and it completely shattered. My whole family as been trying to get me to calm down but i can\u2019t. It seems like my entire life melted before my eyes. Now where will I go?\n\nHow could they reject me? I literally took APUSH and got 1st place out of everyone who took the exam. I spent HOURS and HOURS on my common app essay honing it and making sure it was good grammar. \n\nDon\u2019t waste your time going to college guys it\u2019s useless. If I can\u2019t get in you guys obviously can\u2019t. Get real.",
