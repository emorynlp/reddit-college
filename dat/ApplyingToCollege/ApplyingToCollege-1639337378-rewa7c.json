  "text": "How much is it worth for the time spent in an EC? I've been doing FIRST robotics competitions since I was in third grade (I'm a junior) and while my teams haven't been slacking (I've been captain of the teams I've been on nearly every year I participated, and we always qualified for the state competition), I don't have any particularly notable accomplishments relating to it. Freshman year, I was captain when my team qualified for the Worlds level competition, but apart from that no significant accomplishment. Therefore, how valuable is participating actively in robotics for 10 years (at time of application) for a potential CS/Data Science major?",

      "text": "FIRST is a very good EC, and I think a lack of awards (although captaining a team to worlds is pretty impressive) will be made up for by how committed you are to it and the fact that you've taken an active leadership position. FIRST also makes for good essays; I'm writing my Duke community one on the FIRST community. You also mentioned that you're a junior right now. Have you looked into the dean's list? I was a finalist for FTC Dean's list last year, and I've gotten lots of emails from colleges as a result of that. It's a pretty neat individual award, and since you've been involved in FIRST for so long, I think you'll have a good shot at it\n\nEDIT: also lots of safeties and targets have specific scholarships for FIRST, and I think I remember Yale and MIT were listed on a list of colleges that support FIRST that I got when I won Dean's list finalist",
