  "text": "I am currently in high school and my gpa is currently around a 3.6 (assuming i end junior year at my current level) I was doing really strong the start of freshman year then started to falter once online classes took efffect and ended with a 3.44 then sophmore year I struggled on virual schedule and ended with a 3.24. I am now currently in my junior year and am averaging a 4.0 gpa for this year. How will college admissions view this dynamic in my grades through the years? will they think I slacked earlier or will they think its good I improved?",
