  "text": "I'm a full-stack web developer (MERN) and an international student applying for a CS major (+ financial aid) in t20s, and I've probably built over a thousand websites in the past four years. How do I mention that in my ECs? I can't write \"self-taught myself XYZ languages through Udemy\", now can I? Can I mention building full-stack and e-commerce websites for my peers as a Freelancing Job under the work category? Thanks in advance",
