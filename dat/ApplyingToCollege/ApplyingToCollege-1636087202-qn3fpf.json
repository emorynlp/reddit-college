  "title:": "Furious that my school messed up my transcript",
  "text": "For context, I've been to 3 high schools. Not for any disciplinary or expulsion reasons, but I moved and had some horrible life circumstances at the time. The last school I went to was a specialized highschool that combined curriculum with internships and honestly helped a lot. The issue I have, and have always had is their transcript. All it says is CR\\* for credit, with an added sheet of paper that claims CR\\* is equal to an 85%. What's more, it does not include all my classes or even give an overview of the topics covered that are accurate. One example would be that instead of saying what language class (Spanish) I took it just says TRANSFER LANGUAGE, with the CR\\* as a grade. Some classes aren't even included with what credit they were for.   \n\n\nAs you can imagine this has given me a hard time getting into schools, even more so because I want to apply internationally. I find the way they handled my transcript, arguably one of the most important pieces of paper for college, irresponsibly. I have asked the guidance councilor before to please give me a more legible version or to combine the grades I had at my previous school with the one i'm in now, and she (as most guidance councilors are) was extremely unhelpful. How can I prove my worth as a candidate like this? I'm considering going to the principal and asking her directly to please rectify my grades list and approve it. Right now I have an \"unofficial\" gpa from the school but that does me no good in the long run.",

They moved me around in classes a lot so I have a lot of bullshit on there that isn\u2019t reflective of my good work. I really want an overview of everything to paint the full picture that I\u2019m a capable student. Senior year classes are usually the most important.",
