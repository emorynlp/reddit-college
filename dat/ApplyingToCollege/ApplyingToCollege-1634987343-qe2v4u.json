      "text": "I think Lawrence is really good - it's on the ctcl.org list.  Not super selective, but offers a good education.\n\nAlmost every student there is getting some aid. They don't have the kind of endowment to be fully need blind, but they definitely accept some students with a lot of need, and come close to meeting the need of all their students.",
