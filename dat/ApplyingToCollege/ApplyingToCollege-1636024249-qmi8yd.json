      "text": "80% of BC students are Catholic and the school is run by  Jesuits.  That seems like a significant difference.  From the outside looking in, having not visited either school, BC seems like it has a more coherent identity.  And D1 sports.  Looking at images of the campuses (again, haven't visited), I'm not a fan of BU's.",

      "text": "Take yourself on a google map tour of the campuses. They are completely different. BU is large (16k undergrad) and urban, a mile long strip of Comm Ave. BC mid-size (10k undergrad), on the edge of urban, traditional campus w/ collegiate gothic architecture (Gasson being one of the most photographed examples in the US; see wiki history), Jesuit, lots of school spirit. Agree w/Jayph that the Catholic percent is very significant (tho might be closer to 2/3). Most students, when they explore these schools enough, find they have a definite preference for one or the other.",
