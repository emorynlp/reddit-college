At least not super meaningful ones. But I definitely agree with looking at old posts. Be aware pre 2020 posts should probably be ignored, at least in terms of what they say about Sixth and Seventh. \n\nI'm planning to put a pinned post on the UCSD subreddit once my midterms calm down a bit though so if there's anything in particular people are curious about let me know.",

      "text": "Current UCSD student here. \n\nFirst of all you can major in basically anything in any colleges. It\u2019s not like other schools where you can only major in certain subjects in certain colleges. So the majors each college offers shouldn\u2019t be your concern if it was. \n\nI highly recommend you rank the colleges based on their GE requirements because the extra classes you need to take can disrupt your 4-year plan and may add to your stress. So conventionally you should rank the colleges with the easiest GEs highest while those with more difficult GEs lowest. \n\nApart from GEs you may also consider the surrounding environment of each college. Some have shitty dorms/dining halls. Some may be very isolated from the others. \n\nDisclaimer: the ranking I\u2019m offering is entirely my personal opinion and preference if I were to rank mine again. Others may differ in their choices. \n\nPersonally, I would recommend ranking sixth as your first. Because 1. Their GEs are not hard compared to some other colleges. 2. It\u2019s the newest college built. So it has beautiful and modern dorms. 3. I would say they have the best dining halls on campus. I always love to go there to grab food. One downside is because it\u2019s pretty centrally located, it can get busy during school days. \n\nThen I\u2019d recommend seventh (btw even if it\u2019s 7th, the buildings aren\u2019t the newest. They just renamed an old area of the school). 1. Not difficult GEs. 2. All their \u201cdorms\u201d are apartment style. So you\u2019ll get more private space and a larger and neater space for you to live in. I\u2019m currently living on seventh and I\u2019m loving it so far! It\u2019s quite far from the \u201cmain\u201d campus but not entirely remote. It\u2019s a nice and quiet area. Pretty chill even during weekdays when school is in progress. \n\nTwo colleges I\u2019d recommend you to put them last on your list are ERC and Revelle. They have the arguably hardest/most time-consuming GEs. Between these two, put Revelle below ERC because ERC has better dorms and is located in a pretty chill area (right under seventh actually). Also, Revelle has harder GEs compared to ERC (even though both are pretty hard already). \n\nAgain. This is solely my personal opinion.",
