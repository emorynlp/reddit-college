  "title:": "Accept Offers/Pay Enrollment Deposit for Two Schools",
  "text": "Hey, am I allowed to accept an acceptance offer and pay the enrollment deposit to two schools? One school hasn't given me my financial aid and the other school has a deadline to accept the offer\u2013December 1. The school I am waiting on financial aid from won't tell me what I must pay for another week and I can't wait. I just want to make sure I won't be kicked out of the schools if I accept the offer to both. Obviously as soon as I receive my financial aid, I'm going to notify whichever school I won't be going to that I won't be attending. Thanks!",

      "text": "You need to call the December 1st school and ask for an extension on the deadline.  I\u2019d be surprised if you weren\u2019t accommodated.\n\nFor the future, it\u2019s always a good idea to ask for extensions and make contingency plans *before* the 11th hour.\n\nEdit: you may still be able to get ahold of them if you call now, depending on where they are.",

So I think it's too late to request for an extension, unfortunately. I've been emailing them for weeks but they are finally just now responding.",
