  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI studied my freshmen and sophomore year in a school which does not offer any AP courses. Then for my junior and senior year I moved to a school which provides AP courses. I didn't take any in my junior year as I joined the school in the middle of the session but I did take Pre-calc as honors. Now im a senior and I have 4 APs: Calc BC, Econ, Stats, and Lang & comp. I genuinely want to study something related to business or management. So, do you think only 4 APs is good enough to get into college? My grades of this year and last year are somewhere in between A- and A+. I feel like I won't get into any of the colleges I applied so far. My junior year schedule was: Sociology/anthropology, Health, Pre-calc, Business Math, computer graphics and animation, literature across cultures, and Intro to phy/chem. My schedule now is: the 4 Aps I mentioned above and Desktop Publishing, and photography. I feel like my schedule is weak and might be the reason I get rejected. Do you think this will get me into UW-Madison(Kelley School of Business) or Indiana U Bloomington? PS. I'm an international student and I study in American school in Italy.",

      "text": "Schools look and see where you went to school and what opportunities are available to you at each time. If you believe you took advantage of academic opportunities provided by your school, it is likely that the school you\u2019re going to apply to will believe the same or may even be more lenient towards your circumstance.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t read the final part. Being an international student trying to study in the US is hard to do. As long as your present yourself in a manner that will show you\u2019re capable of handling that school and handle it well, you should be fine.",

          "text": "also, I forgot to mention. I'm not Italian. I moved here from somewhere else. So, I was studying in 10th grade in my home country but for 11th and 12th I'm here in italy. I have written about this transition in my essay as well. So, I think this won't be a big of a problem. The main thing is that is my schedule strong enough that those colleges will take me?",

              "text": "You said \"into college\" not \"into a specific college\".  Though, even at the highly selective school you and your friends are applying to, 4 is still enough.  I say that because there are plenty of students who have no chance to take any AP courses whatsoever, and those students are not disqualified from admission.  Now, for you *specifically*, it's possible that four may not be \"enough\" to gain admission to that *specific* school.  But it's certainly enough to \"get into college\".",
