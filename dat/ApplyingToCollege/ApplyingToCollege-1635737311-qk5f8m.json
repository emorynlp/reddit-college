And with the recent Forbes list that prioritizes schools that accept more pell application, I guess more schools may be looking to accept more pell recipients. So, does being low income/pell recipient boost your application?",

      "text": "I wanted to hop in here and answer this since I was a low-income student at my Alma Mater and I am actually reading a book for my job, Paul Tough's 2019 book, \"The Years that matter Most: How College Makes or Breaks Us.\" I just finished reading the section about college admissions and thought I could provide some perspective in this discussion. \n\nTo make a long story short - \nAs much as colleges and universities publicly profess their love of uplifting low-income students, many of them, especially private schools, do not. If you're talking about Top 10 schools, the element of prestige they are trying to maintain typically doesn't include low-income students unless you have a unique background on top of dazzling grades, scores, etc. \n\nRealistically, many of these high ranked schools could admit an entire class of academically successful Pell Grant recipients and not worry about losing money due to their large endowments, but many of these schools actually enroll less low-income students, on average, than institutions of a similar size. \n\nThis is also true for students from certain racial and ethnic backgrounds, typically Black, Latinx, Indigenous, etc. Combine the two and many colleges aren't looking at these students unless they provide them more of an investment. \n\nNow, I'm not saying don't apply! Please still apply if that's where you see yourself, but being low-income isn't much of an advantage unless you also provide other reasons for why they should \"invest\" in you as a potential student/graduate/alumni. \n\nThere's a great \"This American Life\" podcast episode about college admissions in the \"test-optional age\" if you want to check it out! \n\nTL;DR: Most Top 10 schools don't have an incentive to enroll low-income or minority students unless they excelled in school, have great test scores, or a unique story. Being low-income doesn't fit their \"prestigious\" brand and actually makes it difficult for them to admit wealthier students who would traditionally uphold that status.",

So, if you live in a household where the total income is $42,000 a year or less, then it would be considered a low-income household.",
