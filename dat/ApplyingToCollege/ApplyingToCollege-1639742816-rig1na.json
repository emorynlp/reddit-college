  "text": "Hi, A2C!\n\nSo... Princeton deferred me. And the other REA applicant from my school. While I'm really happy I didn't get straight up rejected, I don't know what to do now.\n\nShould I send a LOCI? If yes, what to include in it if I don't have any relevant updates?\n\nAnd how often does Princeton defer its applicants? Do deferred kids usually get in or should I just give up?\n\nThanks a lot!",
