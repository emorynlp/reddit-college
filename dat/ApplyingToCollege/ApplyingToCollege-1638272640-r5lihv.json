  "title:": "Severely messed up marking the honors/AP/SL/HL section of the UC app",
  "text": "I submitted my UC app and for some reason never caught this error having read over it three separate times. I don't know how it got so messed up, but I have HL under NH (non honors) classes and NH for classes that are supposed to be honors. How would even approach fixing this? It's such a hilariously big mistake that it's hard to even explain, I'm not sure how it even happened since I clearly remembering clicking through very carefully. It's like the markers have been randomized and I don't know what to do.",
