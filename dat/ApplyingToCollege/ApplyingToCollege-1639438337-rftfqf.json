And I was told on here that unless you specifically want to move there for 4 years and switch your ID and everything over, Its just like an extended vacation... so you keep all your old insurance and address' and stuff. Just tell your insurance what is going on I guess and they should say who youre allowed see out there.\n\nIf you hear anything different pleaseeeee let me know!",
