      "text": "Pros - Quite inexpensive to attend compared to many other universities. Great merit scholarships. If you like football, mountains, and partying, then WVU has a good atmosphere for you. Very fun sports atmosphere. Politically moderate; not overpoweringly on one side of the political spectrum, which could be positive depending on what you prefer. You'll encounter all sorts of people at WVU. Beautiful mountains nearby; so many outdoorsy activities like hiking, mountain biking, etc.\n\nCons - The main campus is kinda ugly in my opinion. Woodburn Circle is very beautiful though.\n\nAlumni - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_West\\_Virginia\\_University\\_alumni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_West_Virginia_University_alumni) Joe Manchin is pretty well-known. He's a Senator.\n\nDorms - No clue.\n\n\\-----\n\nI'd ask all of your WVU related questions under this thread.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/qc0zfj/class\\_of\\_2026\\_qa\\_1020\\_what\\_do\\_you\\_want\\_to\\_know/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/qc0zfj/class_of_2026_qa_1020_what_do_you_want_to_know/)\n\nIt's a \"What do you want to know about WVU\" thread for prospective applicants. :)\n\n\\-----\n\nBest of luck. :)",
