  "title:": "Additional letter of recommendations",
  "text": "Most of the schools that I\u2019m applying to require 1 letter from teacher and 1 from school counselor. That being said though, I will still submit an additional teacher recommendation because I greatly think it adds another layer of information of me as an academically-focused person. The problem is that my school only hired a counselor recently (my school is not in the U.S) and he had only worked with me for 2 months. He already submitted his rec letter and I\u2019m afraid it might be lackluster. The superintendent of my school suggested that she could write another rec letter for me because she had seen my academic journey from the day I enrolled. \nShould I provide this extra material?\n\nThanks a lot!!!!",
