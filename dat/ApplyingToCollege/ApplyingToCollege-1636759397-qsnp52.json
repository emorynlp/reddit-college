A lot of people there saw him and asked him how college was going and where he was going. \n\nNo less than 4 people got confused and thought he was going to Penn State (keep in mind we live *in Pennsylvania*). \n\nOne of these four people was a prestige-whoring parent. She asked him where he went to college, he said UPenn, and she wrinkled her nose and replied \"*My* daughter's going to go to an Ivy League school, not state school.\"\n\nImagine her embarrassment when we told her and her daughter (standing behind) confirmed.\n\nMoral of the story:\n\n1. When you name a private school after the state it's in, confusion ensues.\n\n2. Don't be a prestige whore.",

People ought to have the right to do what they want free of judgment as long as they're not hurting anyone. That mom is generally known around here as the person who just brags endlessly at the expense of others.\n\n>No one, and I mean no one here mentions the Ivy League status.\n\nThis is unfortunately not the case around here (for the parents). Most of the kids are honestly more mature than their parents when it comes to this. They constantly compare their kids and their achievements, and even though this one mom is notorious for turning every conversation into a competition, they all do it.\n\n>Is your friend a freshman?\n\nLmfao no, he's a junior, and that's the funniest part. This mom didn't even know him, and she still asked him where he went to college. In other words, she was actively seeking someone to belittle or worship based on his answer to her question.",

Prestige allows you to have more opportunities for connections and internships. Plus, a prestigious school will have a higher concentration of motivated and intelligent people, which not only makes it more likely that you'll learn more effectively due to being surrounded with people of similar intelligence and drive, but also that the people in the networks you build will succeed and that you'll have more opportunities for successful startups with the people around you.",
