  "text": "I had sent a FutureMe letter to myself in October that was supposed to arrive yesterday. I don\u2019t remember what I wrote but I knew it was motivational. When it didn\u2019t come, I checked my FutureMe account to make sure there weren\u2019t any issues. It turns out I sent the letter to myself on December 12, *2022* instead of 2021 \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80. I can\u2019t change the date anymore. All y\u2019all, be careful with tears",
