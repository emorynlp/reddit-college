  "text": "When high school has a semester system. Some of courses are only one semester long. In the grade for the semester that I did not have that course, should I leave it blank or select \"no grade\"? What is the difference between them? My concern is that they might not know that course is only one semester long and think that I dropped it. \n\nAdditional info: the official high school transcript is organized by semesters instead of courses, so if a course is only one semester long, it's just not included in the semester that it was not taken.",
