  "title:": "I'M SO STRESSED OUT. My counselor sent quarter grades that were entirely optional and unnecessary.",
  "text": "I'm terribly worried now. I applied to an ED1 school that does not require first quarter senior grades (not even mentioned on their website), but my counselor sent them on an optional transcript a few days ago anyway. And my quarter grades included some C's. He said since quarter grades are not required for them they will not look at it at all, but the grades have been sent!! I'm assuming they'll definitely open it and think I'm slacking off my senior year. Will they really not look at them? Asking the school not to take the grades into consideration would sound suspicious, right?",
