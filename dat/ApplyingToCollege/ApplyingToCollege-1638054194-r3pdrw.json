      "text": "Possible? Yes. \n\nAdvisable? No.\n\nA rushed essay without any thought put in is very rarely good. Good essays do not take as much time to write as some people on this sub seem to think, but they do take thought and introspection, which is very difficult to effectively accomplish when you're stressed by a deadline two weeks away for probably 20+ essays (depending on what schools you're applying to).\n\nBut there are some people who do this successfully. I've told this story on this sub before, but I know a guy who was an extraordinary procrastinator\u2014so much so that he didn't even start RD supps until mid-December. He applied SCEA to Yale and decided to wait for his decision before starting RD supps. He got deferred, wrote supps for I believe 13 schools in ~2 weeks, and got into multiple T20s, in the end choosing Penn M&T.",
