  "text": "So I'm pretty confused on what schools I should apply to EA, right now I'm ignoring ED to figure out other stuff right now. My situation is that I haven't completed much all so far, I have yet to complete my common app essay and supplements. I requested transcripts for various schools that I might choose to EA to. Talked with my counselor, and she said the most important thing is to not rush it for EA. With that in mind, I'm thinking I will just apply to 1-3 safety(maybe target) schools, just for the purpose of getting a few colleges \"out of the way\" or less work for my RD process. My logic is that I hopefully will get into these safeties regardless if my commonapp essay is the best it can be or not, (I'm hoping my supplements for these colleges will be sufficient, as they are safeties) so I can make more informed decisions financially for RD, and probably apply to reach schools in RD so I can have more time to edit my common app essay (we can improve it after EA, right?) and supplements for the reach schools that I would not have had enough time to fulfill to the best extent if it were through EA. My concern is that I'm missing out on higher acceptance rates in EA? Is it okay if I just do my reaches in RD? I don't want to skimp a reach school app just to get rejected and not even deferred for me to get a second chance in RD (if I do get deferred from a reach in EA, can I improve supplements for that college for RD)? What types of schools do most kids apply for EA? Any tips or clarifications on the process would be appreciated.",
