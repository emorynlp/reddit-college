  "title:": "Is it reasonable for my technical college's website to be fairly broken as well as the support feeling pretty unprofessional overall?",
  "text": "I am going to be attending one of my state's main technical colleges for an associate's degree starting this spring and it seems like I am encountering minor problems every time I try to take care of business with them.\n\n\n* Overall, the school's website feels outdated and uncomfortable to navigate. The layout of the site feels inconsistent as I browse through it and it doesn't feel stable. Various major bugs exist in it that are seemingly being completely ignored. When I tried scheduling a tour via their website, it took me to a random website administrator page and gave me no notification that I had signed up for the tour. When I tried pressing the send button on the request info page, it repeatedly took me to a 404 page with once again no confirmation that the message had been sent. \n* The phone support is usually lacking, most of the people I'm talking to pause for a long time and act like they don't really know what I'm asking of them when I present a question. This leads to me usually just driving up to the campus and getting my problems sorted out.\n* Emails that I send them either get completely ignored or get a reply over a week later. This puzzles me considering that I send them straight to their respective department (advising, etc) where I have seen the full time office environment they run in. In my mind answering emails is one of the most basic components of the job. This makes it to where the only true way to communicate with advisors, financial aid, or other departments is to call them or go onsite. \n* The new student orientation page was written in basic HTML that I could've written myself.\n* When I got my email regarding how much financial aid I was going to be getting, the \"out of pocket\" section had an automatic error type thing which meant I couldn't see how much I had to pay out of pocket. This seems to be a common theme in a lot of emails I get where there is automated data included.\n\n\nAlthough these seem to be red flags, the reason that this intrigues me is because this is supposedly the best technical college in my state and once you get onsite, the environment feels nice and the support is thorough. I was wondering if most technical colleges tend to be like this and if it's something to be overly concerned about.",

      "text": "I wouldn't worry too much about these things as long as the college and the program are good in themselves... To compare, CMU has the best CS program in the US, but their own website wasn't the best to navigate until recently, and their application portal was one of the most buggy I have seen out there!",
