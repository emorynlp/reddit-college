  "text": "Right now I have above a 4.0 gpa. Some of the schools I\u2019m interested in don\u2019t require the act/sat. So my question is, if someone else submits an application that is the same as mine and they have my same gpa, but they submit a good act score, will they be chosen over me? I am already signed up to take the act but I don\u2019t do very good on tests like it.",
