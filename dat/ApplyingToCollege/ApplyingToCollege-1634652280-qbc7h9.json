These meals likely have one thing in common: in some way, they originate from factory farms.\u00a0\n\nThis flash seminar would address the issue of extensive factory farming in the U.S. and its effects on our health, our society, the animals, and the environment. Through an interdisciplinary approach we would discuss how mass-produced meat contributes to pollution and climate change, and how it directly relates to our culture\u2019s damaging relationship to food. The seminar would also equip students with the knowledge to find potential solutions that may eventually lead to substantial change\"\n\n^cool, but I don't GET anything new from this. I don't walk away with either a new perspective (eg: how fossil fuel companies gaslight us, or how meat companies push advertising to reframe our views toward food negatively could be one), or something new from the applicant, other than they know about food. \n\n\nI also have no idea why you'd want to bring in the theory of relativity into an essay about literature. I get what they're going for, but as a reader, I j roll my eyes haha",
