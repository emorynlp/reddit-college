As for the Common App, submit it whenever it\u2019s ready, but there is no advantage in getting it submitted Oct 26 vs Nov 1. That said, I\u2019d submit at least 12 hours before the deadline so that you don\u2019t have any last minute issues, crashes, payment errors, etc.",

The situation with UPenn is that  \n\n\nThe FA deadline is nov 2.   \nTo submit all the FA documents I need an application portal acces  \nTo get it I need to submit the common app  \nOnce I send the Application Portal, it apparently takes 2 days for them to give me the Application Portal Access",
