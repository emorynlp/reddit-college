  "title:": "your 101 on ocd, esp in terms of the college application process",
  "text": "ok so i\u2019ve seen a number of people on this sub mention that they have ocd, and i\u2019ve seen others who\u2019ve mentioned ocd-like symptoms w/o actually knowing that they may have ocd. i\u2019m making this post to give you a better idea of what ocd is, since i was diagnosed with severe ocd a few months ago (as a direct result of the college app process), and i think it may be helpful. i\u2019m also leaving out any of the usual \u201cthink happy thoughts\u201d and \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter where you go to college\u201d bs, since none of that did anything to ease my ocd.\n\n**obligatory disclaimer**: i\u2019m not a medical/ licensed professional, so don\u2019t take any of this as medical advice. it\u2019s more of a personal account of ocd/ its symptoms/ its effects/ etc from the perspective of a college applicant.\n\n**what is ocd?**\n\nocd (obsessive compulsive disorder) is a type of anxiety. it is NOT wanting things to be neat/ organised (although some people with ocd do have an obsession with tidiness). that\u2019s a huge misconception. ocd is where people have intrusive/unwanted thoughts that they can\u2019t get rid off, and in order to cope with those thoughts, they feel as if they have to do something to get rid of the thoughts.\n\n**how ocd shows up**\n\n*stage 1*\nmy ocd began with compulsive counting. i continuously counted everything i saw \u2014 and my brain identified \u201cbad\u201d numbers like 6/7/13. if i stopped at one of those numbers, i would feel as if something awful was going to happen, so i had to continue counting until i reached a good number.\n\n*stage 2*\nit then worsened into repetitive actions. i began needing to keep clicking light switches until they felt \u201cright\u201d (otherwise i would freak out that my house would burn down), i had to keep clicking the ceiling fan switch until it felt right (or it would feel like the fan would fall off the ceiling while i slept), etc. it reached a stage where it would take me around 40 minutes to go from the living room to my bed: a distance of around 4 metres.\n\n*stage 3*\nthis in turn worsened to literally any and all bad thoughts. i was no longer dependent on just hitting bad numbers \u2014 i would also have to compulsively redo something if i was thinking or breathing \u201cwrongly\u201d when i initially did it. didn\u2019t take a deep enough breath? redo it, person x may have a heart attack otherwise. mind feels off when you walk into a room? leave and re-enter, you may be having an aneurysm. even looking at a \u201cbad number\u201d (eg when i looked at a clock) made me look away and relook at it, and i had to keep redoing that until it felt right.\n\ni of course knew that it was completely irrational \u2014 but my head automatically went \u201cbut what if it\u2019s not?\u201d that alone was enough to make me continue, since experiencing ocd seemed better than any of those other awful things from happening. note: there aren\u2019t actual \u201cstages\u201d of ocd per se; i just divided the text to make it clearer.\n\n**other symptoms**\n\nmy ocd symptoms aren\u2019t the same as everyone else\u2019s. for some, it\u2019s tidying stuff up until it feels right. for others, it\u2019s doing things in triplets or quadruplets until it feels right. there are plenty more variations, but all of them revolve around doing something compulsively and obsessively in order to cope with/ neutralise intrusive thoughts\n\n**the cause**\n\nfor me, the cause was college apps. as an int\u2019l in a country that doesn\u2019t offer the course she\u2019s applying for, who is interested in a low-paying field, and with parents who only think the cost of a u.s. education is worth it if it\u2019s a \u201cprestigious\u201d uni \u2014 i put IMMENSE pressure on myself to get into a t10. \n\ni continuously drowned myself in ecs, ecs, and more ecs. i spent every waking moment as a junior freaking out about applications. my ECs were the weakest component of my profile, so i tried cramming 4 years worth of ecs into my junior year. it reached a stage that now, the activities section and add\u2019l info section both don\u2019t have enough space for me to list all my activities. yep, it was that extreme.\n\nand this worsened my ocd, because i kept feeling as if i wouldn\u2019t get into z uni or uni of x if i stopped counting at a bad number, or if i didn\u2019t flick a switch the right way, or if i wasn\u2019t breathing correctly when i did x. the college app process took me ages \u2014 for instance, it would take me around 8 attempts to log into the common app each time, because every time i saw the words \u201clog in,\u201d they would remind me of the word \u201cbenign,\u201d which my brain would link to a benign tumour -&gt; cancer. i had to turn the AC temp in my bedroom to 23 instead of 22, since i\u2019m in the class of 22, and it would feel as if i wasn\u2019t going to get into my dream college if i left it at 22.\n\n**therapy**\n\nas bitchy as it sounds, i\u2019m lucky that my dad has anxiety. i obviously wish he didn\u2019t since it\u2019s an awful disorder to live with, but the only silver lining of him having it was that it made it much easier for me to tell my parents about my ocd.\n\ni\u2019m an EXTREMELY private person. i bottle everything up and i never snap. so when i told my parents i may have ocd, they took it seriously and took me to a therapist. i hated her so much lmao, and i never went back again. she seemed really patronising, and i spent the entire session wanting to gtfo. but that\u2019s just me. for my dad, therapy helped him overcome his panic attacks and made his anxiety reduce hugely. for my cousin, therapy didn\u2019t help her much, but the breathing/relaxation techniques she learned helped her cope a lot.\n\nif you have ocd, tell someone. PLEASE. i promise you: i was absolutely terrified of telling my parents that i had ocd, since i felt embarrassed + like i was a failure. but telling literally anyone else was a HUGE weight off my shoulders and i felt like i could finally breathe.\n\n**overcoming ocd**\n\nif your ocd is caused by college apps, imo the only way to overcome it is by ensuring that you have nothing college-related to freak out about. i overcame my ocd three days ago; here\u2019s how i did it.\n\none of the biggest causes of my ocd was that i didn\u2019t want to stay in my home country for college; i wanted to study abroad. but i was freaking out that i wouldn\u2019t get in anywhere, and that even if i did, my family wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it. so i applied to a safety school in a country that i LOVED, which also had really low tuition fees, and boom: i got in. even if i don\u2019t get into any of my top choices, i am genuinely incredibly excited to attend my safety school since it\u2019s super highly ranked so my parents approve lol (it\u2019s a global t50 and a global t25 in the field i\u2019m keen on), and the country and fees are both amazing.\n\nafter getting in, all the remaining weight on my shoulders literally completely vanished. will i be gutted if i don\u2019t get into any of my reaches? absolutely \u2014 i ground so hard throughout hs and i\u2019ll be devastated that the work was for nothing, since the safety school only took my grades into consideration. (i obv did the activities bc i was passionate about them, but i def wouldn\u2019t have stretched myself so thin if i didn\u2019t have college apps to worry about.) BUT i honestly will not dwell on the rejections since i\u2019m genuinely excited about my safety school. \n\nafter getting in, i managed to finally get my brain to register the fact that all the awful thoughts and \u201cconditions\u201d i kept making up would literally have 0 impact on the world around me. everything was literally just in my head, and my thoughts wouldn\u2019t affect anything around me. all of this seems super obvious to anyone who doesn\u2019t have ocd, and the rational part of me certainly knew it from the start \u2014 but my head never previously allowed me to believe any of it.\n\n**conclusion**\n\nocd is a horrible disorder, and i wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone. if you think you may have it, PLEASE speak to someone. or at the very least, google up an ocd test to see if yours is a full disorder of just sporadic worries. to anyone freaking out about college apps: apply to a rolling decisions safety school that you can afford/ offers good aid. i promise, you will feel so, so, so much better knowing that you have a backup if all else fails.",

      "text": "This is just excellent...excellent writing, advice, and your journey is a model for many. The point at which we fall down the proverbial rabbit hole is also almost unnoticeable. One day we have annoying neurotic behaviors which affect only ourselves. The next we are driving everyone crazy or worrying friends/family...the dog always knows. Congratulations on all of the above and the best of luck to you.",
