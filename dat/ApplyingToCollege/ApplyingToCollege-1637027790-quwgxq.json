  "text": "I honestly don't know if this is something I genuinely want to do or if I'm just conditioned to want it. I'm not really interested in STEM or anything that's beneficial to me. I'm way more creatively geared, but I'm worried about getting a useless degree I'll spend my life paying off debt for. I've already applied to seven safeties (mostly undecided) and I have literally no idea what I would do there that would make me interested/be lucrative for me. I'm really lost and confused and need some guidance.",

      "text": "Creativity is somewhat broad.  Is there something you'd enjoy doing, that you could credibly get paid to do, and that doesn't require a college degree?  If so, then it's worth considering whether you need a 4Y degree.  If not, then you should strongly consider getting a degree.  I recommend not going into debt.\n\nImagine you're 22 and need to afford a place to sleep and food to eat.  What sort of job would you want to have, if you had your pick (realistically speaking)?  Gun to your head, you have to pick.\n\nNow, what degree (or degrees) unlock(s) that job?  Consider getting that one (or one of those).",

          "text": "For some reason this is a really hard question to answer without embarrassing myself. I really enjoy writing fiction and would be interested in film making (have no equipment or experience). More realistically, I imagine I would get into publishing. I should probably do more research in that field, but I think college education is definitely required. None of my interests are very marketable in today's job market or even worth going to college to pursue. I guess I should figure out something else, but I still don't really know.",

              "text": "Try answering some of these questions:\n\n1. When you were very young, what captured your attention for hours on end? A class? The zoo? Bugs? Writing? Drawing?\n\n2. What activites capture your focus now, so much so that you sometimes forget to check the clock or you end up late for your next thing?\n\nThose things that captivate you are a good guide for figuring out what you might want to study or work at long term.\n\nAlso, writing is a critically important part of filmmaking, so I think you could easily study both. Don't go to an expensive University to do it, though. A good writer can get a degree from anywhere and still land a good job.",

In general creative writing is something that you can benefit from a degree in, but it doesn\u2019t *require* it\u2014 even a lot of more advanced job listings related to writing clarify that applicants should have a degree *or* a couple years of experience. I think writing is one of the few jobs left where climbing the ladder with experience is realistically possible.",
