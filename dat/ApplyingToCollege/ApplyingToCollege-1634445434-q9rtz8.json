  "text": "For anyone that used ApplyTexas and has already submitted an application.....\n\nThe section for employment/internship activities had a blank that said: \"List your specific role/job title\". \n\nI just submitted an application to UT Dallas, and upon viewing my submitted application, I scrolled to the bottom where the \"Internships\" section was and noticed that it did not have my inputted info for \"list your specific role/job title\". All it had was employer, hrs/wk, start date, and end date.\n\nIs this happening to anyone else?",

      "text": "did you click save after entering the info? applytexas does not warn you if you click to the next page without saving, which means that you will have that info wiped until you go back and re-enter it. you also cannot save the page if you haven't entered all of the questions that are marked as required (i just entered a period for each box and hit save so i could come back and change the stuff and resave). definitely have a word or google doc with all your essays saved because unlike commonapp, applytexas does not autosave (it is manual).",
