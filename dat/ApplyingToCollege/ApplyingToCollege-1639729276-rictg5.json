      "text": "Yes but not in the way you might think.\n\nDeferred applicants have the opportunity to submit new information and a LOCI to the school. This is essentially a \"second chance\" for the applicant to catch the school's attention and win an acceptance.\n\nWith no additional updates or changes, your chances are likely similar to normal RD applicants, if not slightly lower",

But that\u2019s because RD includes a full array of applicants while the deferred group had a set of students removed by being accepted.\n\nFor a given student, the admission chances of ED deferred vs. RD should be identical. You are calculated agains the applicant pool based on your data. There is no bonus or penalty for having been deferred.",
