However, I am inclined to say he isn't lying because he actually is super smart and is like a super duper track star. He obviously can't go to all three, but he is choosing between those he has told me. \n\nAlso, I realize now I look like a jerk saying it because it looks like I am making his accomplishment look not so good. I could never get into any of these colleges, and when i saw this it reminded me of him.",
