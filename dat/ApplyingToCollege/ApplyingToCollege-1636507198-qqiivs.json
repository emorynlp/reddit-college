  "text": "I'm applying for Compsci and I already submitted my early action schools and sent my July ACT scores which was a 27, with a 31 in English and Reading, a 25 in Math, and a 19 in Science. \n\nI took the October 23rd test really hoping for an improvement but I got a 26 with a 26 in English, a 29 in Reading, a 23 in Math, and a 24 in Science.  This gives me a Superscore of 28. \n\nIs there any advice I could get? I'm really disappointed and idk what to do now.",
