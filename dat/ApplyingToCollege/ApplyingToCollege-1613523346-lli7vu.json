Usually within a minute or two, I can tell if you are in the top 10% of applicants. It does make my job more difficult because I have more applicants to sift through. But take heart, if you are qualified and show that you have a strong passion to attend my specific University, you will standout. Top tip: do your homework on my University, and cite specific academic programs and student organisations that you intend to pursue, and be genuine and passionate about what you can offer to our community.",

Their resume usually had several outstanding elements, accomplishments, and future interests. Nearly all applied because they believed they could be accepted and excel. RD pool applicants were often ambivalent about my particular university, didn't have a focus on what they intended to get out of a college, and have good but not impressive resumes. An Ivy school is an expensive place to 'find yourself'. My opinion is the Common Application is to blame for many people applying 'just because they can.' I much preferred when we used an exclusive application because it trimmed the applicant pool size. In both ED and RD pools, nearly all are above average students. But our acceptance rate is well below 10%, and the ED applicants were far more likely to fall in the range of being closely considered and accepted. Now, everyone is in the same pool, but it's still obvious who are the stand outs.",

It has changed the landscape for how students learn, what opportunities that can access, and the ability to pursue outside interests and accomplishments. These factors will have complex and unpredictable outcomes that amplify certain student's strengths but hinder others. For example, an introverted self-studier will probably show disproportionately more academic excellence last year than an extroverted group-learner when compared to past years. I already see much less applicants touting internships or projects that involve travel, outdoor settings, and group engagement, in favor of students showing impressive computer programming projects, internet ventures, and entrepreneurs with individual rather than group team models. Some of these are trends that were already present, but there will definitely be a re-balance towards students that have been able to excel under Covid, as compared to past 'normal' years.",
