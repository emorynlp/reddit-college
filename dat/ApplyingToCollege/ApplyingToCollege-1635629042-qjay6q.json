  "text": "I submitted Stanford REA and was told by my counselor to only submit my AP score with a 5. I have taken 5 AP tests and have gotten 4s on the rest. I did not submit those. Will this hurt my chances? I feel I have decent essays and ECs but I am not sure if I need to email them or what to do! Especially since I already submitted through common app.",
