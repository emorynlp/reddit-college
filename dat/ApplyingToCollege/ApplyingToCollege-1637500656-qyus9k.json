  "text": "I've always wanted to study in the US and kinda forgot that good tuition exists in Europe. I had a chat with my dad, and it's pretty clear he's not in favor of the States and prefers Europe. I asked him why, and he showed me that paid tuition was ABOLISHED in Germany.\n\nDoes the quality of tuition lessen because of that? How do jobs look at graduation from an equally good German university versus an American one?",

      "text": "Yes it is true. You don\u2019t need to pay for studying in Germany. The only expenses are the living. Further, you can work while studying 20 hrs/week or so. And Germany has much better PSW opportunities and the work life balance is better than US. You also get lots of holidays. Moreover you can visit other European nations if traveling is one of your hobbies. ( I believe you are talking about going to a university). Although, you might earn more in US than Germany. If money is not your thing; consider Germany. And it doesn\u2019t matter where you graduate from in Germany. Almost all public universities are more or less of the same quality. :)",

Since apparently, they're not producing an adequate number of kids, they want internationals to stay and have families of their own. So you can easily get a green card (or whatever equivalent) directly after graduation.",

Typically they don't have dorms.\n\nIt may depend on what field of work you are considering, but generally, US employers have little to no familiarity with German universities. If you are planning to return to the US after college graduation, consider instead finding a large merit scholarship at an lower ranked US school.\n\nEdit, I was assuming you were a US student. If you are an international student, consider whether employers *in the country where you plan to live after college graduation* are familiar with German universities.",
