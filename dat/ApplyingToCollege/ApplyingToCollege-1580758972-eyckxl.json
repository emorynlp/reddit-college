          "text": "My daughter got a letter from Harvard a couple weeks ago. She read it and then tossed it in the recycling bin. I asked what it said and she said, \"Basically congratulated me for being a minority with a high PSAT score and to think about them in the future if I decide I want a rejection letter.\" Noted, kiddo. \n\nIn all seriousness, the process has changed a lot since your parents were young. [A top ten school in 2006 had a 16% admissions rate. Today, that rate is just 6.4%, a decline of almost 60%.](https://www.businessstudent.com/topics/college-acceptance-rates-over-time/)\n \nI started college in 1985. I have a PhD from an \"elite\" school but I wouldn't have gotten into a top 20 undergrad or grad school today. The competition is just way more intense than it was when your parents were younger and I can't recall any promotional mail ever showing up at my house from colleges.",
