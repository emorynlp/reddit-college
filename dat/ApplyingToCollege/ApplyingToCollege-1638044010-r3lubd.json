  "title:": "Attending community college after high school while having been dual enrolled in high school",
  "text": "In the spring I'll be graduating with an Associates Degree in arts and science (no major, all the students in the dual enrollment program are getting a general degree), as well as getting my high school degree. \n\nI've been working on my applications to UC and CSU, and up until now I've been changing my mind about what I want to major in. I'm interested in 3 very different fields. I'm aware that you can change your major once you get accepted, but one of the majors I'm interested is engineering, highly impacted and highly competitive, so it would be hard to change to that major. However, I fear that applying to engineering in the first place would decrease my chances of getting into one of the 'better' colleges, which I might've been admitted to if I applied under a less competitive major (something under English or humanities), one that I might end up choosing in the long run- you know, all one big clusterfuck of a decision, and I need to submit my application in two days. \n\nI've been considering doing community college to figure out what I want to do, but I'm afraid it may look bad if I've already got an associate's degree and continue to still attend community college. I hear that transfer students who apply to schools that don't do tag, such as UCLA and Berkeley, still have to do electives and stuff outside of courses in order to maximize their chances of getting in (and have stuff to write on their applications) which honestly intimidates me. UC Davis offers a TAG program for every major except computer science, and I'm afraid I might decide to do that in the future instead.\n\nI'm still going to submit my applications to CSU and UC, just so I have options, but I have no idea what major to put. Should I maximize my chances of getting in by putting the less competitive major for the top schools? Should I put the competitive major for all schools? Honestly I'm just having a whole ass crisis. Any insight or advice?",

      "text": "If you want to get into UCLA and Berkeley, your best shot is to do the honors transfer program into the schools. I know UCLA has one- it\u2019s TAP I believe. I think Berkeley does too. It increases your odds significantly.\n\nEither way, don\u2019t even worry. CC is a great option. If you\u2019re smart and motivated, you\u2019ll leave CC with a ton of options. I went to CC for 4 years and I\u2019m at Cal Poly SLO now, and I\u2019m literally going to graduate with a 6 figure job. You don\u2019t need to take a straight shot to a uni to do well.",
