  "text": "I was looking through the US News ranking for intl finaid and I was surprised at how many LACs dominated the list. As an aid-seeking international, I'm definitely not complaining, but I wanted to know how smaller institutes ( Haverford, Skidmore, Washington and Lee, etc) can afford to give even more financial aid to international students than some of the giant research universities?",

      "text": "Keep in mind that \"giving\" financial aid simply means charging you less to attend.  They're not writing a check.\n\nIf their marginal cost of educating you is less than the net cost after financial aid, they're still better off.\n\nIt's also an inexpensive way of buying diversity, high test scores, etc., which can look good to future applicants.",

          "text": "True, but the ratio of students recieving aid to total admitted students is actually amazing for some of them. Look at Washington and lee which gives aid to 95% of intl students(around 70 out of 75) vs a larger University like Georgetown who gives aid to only around 30 out of 1000",

      "text": "Most of them have huge endowments for their size - the ones that offer big aid to international students often have at least $500 million, and a school like Grinnell has $2 billion to work with.\n\nMany of them also want a more diverse student body, including international perspectives, so they choose to spend their aid budget that way.  A big selective research university can attract plenty of full pay international students on their own -- LACs typically can't.",
