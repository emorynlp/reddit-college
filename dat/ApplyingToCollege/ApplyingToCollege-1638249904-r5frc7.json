  "text": "For 9th and 10th grade, my school has this option for students to take a regular history course or an AS (Advanced standing) version of the course. I realized my transcript missed one semester of my 9th grade and put the normal version of the class instead of the advanced one I actually took. I\u2019m pretty sure there is no GPA difference between the classes, so should I just list in additional comments my explanation? Will this be bad for UC admissions?",
