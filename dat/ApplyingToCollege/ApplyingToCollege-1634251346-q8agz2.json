If \"full price\" would be $25k (including room/board) then maybe I'd go up to $35k.\n\nGiven my household's income, this eliminates any private school and/or out-of-state public that doesn't have a large non-need-based scholarship.  The set of schools that \\*do\\* have such awards \\*and\\* that are more compelling than our state flagship is fairly small, and winning one of those awards is a long shot as they are highly competitive.\n\nSo, I foresee my kid's college list being: state flagship, one or two less selective schools where they would almost certainly get significant merit aid, and then a bunch of selective schools where we'd be hoping to win one of the big scholarships.
