  "text": "Last year my dad tried to k*ll my family. Like no joke. So no shit my grades dropped last year, my cumulative went from 3.8 to 3.3 and I failed one class. I wrote my essays about my dad and what happened to me last year, I have a 4.2 GPA right now as a senior, I have some fantastic and unique volunteer extracurriculars that I CONTINUED despite my situation last year (plus leadership in debate and two instruments for 10 years), and I feel like I\u2019d be decently competitive without my GPA issues. My essays were very well written and meticulous - so is there any chance for me? Applied to all UCs, a few Cal States, Syracuse, Oregon, Penn State, U of Zona, ASU and CU Boulder. Right now I\u2019m just reaching for Boulder or Oregon, but is there any chance for me at more competitive schools?",

Please make sure you get the mental help you need. It doesn't hurt to find out the mental health assistance programs at your future college, too. PTSD is real.",

I am incredibly sorry for what you have endured and I hope you are doing ok and getting the support you/family needs. You have applied to wonderful schools, I do think you could apply to others, just go for it!",

Mention this in your additional info section, and u might be able to turn this into an essay. Talk about anecdotes from that specific instance and how it affected ur grades, but how u viewed things in a different light and overcame ur difficulties",
