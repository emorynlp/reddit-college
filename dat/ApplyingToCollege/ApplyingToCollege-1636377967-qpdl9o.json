  "text": "HI! I'm currently a senior in HS, with great greats, relatively good ACT scores (32) and Sat (1490) and I'm applying to a lot of good state schools. However, I'm missing awards. My school doesn't give out good awards other than dean's list, and a gold scholar medal (average of 93/100+ in a year). I have both, but other than that I don't have any medals. I go to a boarding school, so I'm unfamiliar with regional medals.\n\nSkills I'm good at for a possible medal:\n\n  \n\\-Langs: Spanish (level 4), Native russian and serbian speaker from family, learning Korean, took latin for 2 years (taking national latin exam later)  \n\\- School subjects: Social Studies, maybe math(?)\n\n\\- Computer Science (trying to get USACO silver later this year in December), published small mobile app with 5k downloads (puzzle game)\n\n\\- Entrepreneurship, again the app, made a small dropshipping store with 20k revenue but little profit.\n\n\\- Sports: soccer and lacrosse, top player in a niche game called napoleon total war \n\nIf anyone knows about medals I can apply for for these skills, please lmk. If there are any exams/tests of other than NLE that I can take to get some sort of medal or award, lmk.",

Been trying for long time, but never really been successful.",

Been trying for long time, but never really been successful.\n\nBranding and finding a good product is actually key, I used Gabriel St. Germain's and Verums ecom course which I got for almost free from a reseller, super helpful. Also working with a friend is really motivational. It's super easy to get sales these days for Q4, so I'm doing like 1k rev a day, but It's hard to focus btwn college apps and my store.",
