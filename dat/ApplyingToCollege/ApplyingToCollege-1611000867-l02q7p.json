  "title:": "Please Don't Withdraw Your Apps Until You're SURE Of Where You're Going",
  "text": "It's that time of year again - several posts asking that admitted students withdraw from other schools early so that other students can take those slots.  There's a lot of things wrong with this and I want to clarify them so none of you make a serious mistake.\n\n**1.  Your applications and acceptances are yours.**  You paid the application fee, you did the work to warrant consideration, and you put the application together.  Don't feel bad for other people who might get waitlisted or rejected.  Keep your options open until you need to close them.\n\n**2.  You aren't actually helping anyone.**  You can only take one spot at one college.  Every top university will end up with full enrollment, like they do every single year.  This is four years of your life and six figures of someone's money on the line - you owe it to yourself to make this decision based on what is best for you, not some random other applicant. That is not your problem and there is literally nothing you can do to help that person. Thinking you can is like helping the poor by not buying a lottery ticket, thereby increasing their odds of winning. It's silly.\n\n**3.  Let colleges manage yield.**  Colleges admit people knowing full well that not all admitted students will enroll.  They have a timeline for issuing acceptances, assessing enrollment, and addressing yield and the waitlist.  They know way more about historical numbers and the current situation.  You do not owe anyone else your spot.\n\n**4.  Withdrawing early probably won't impact the waitlist timeline anyway.**  A lot of people say you should withdraw anyway so other students might find out their results sooner.  According to former admissions officer /u/FeatofClay:\n\n>I keep seeing this exhortation (that withdrawing helps waitlisted students get in earlier) on this community. I'm curious as to the source of this \"conventional wisdom,\" and a sense of how many schools where this holds true.\n\n>There were years in the past when we'd use the pattern of March deposits to try to predict May 1 deposits, and we might admit more people in March and April since we anticipated being down on May 1. However, we learned that the \"signals\" we got in March ended up being too unreliable to change our admit plans. We don't do that anymore. So whether you say \"no\" on March 20 or on May 1, that wouldn't change the timing of decisions for students who were still waiting.\n\nAnd even if it does move the timeline up, that's not your responsibility.\n\n**5.  Don't try to \"be nice\" by giving up your spot at a college because your situation could change.**  This is the biggest reason not to withdraw early.  Schools give different, often *wildly* different, financial aid packages (Seriously I've had students get $50K+ a year from Columbia and only $20K from WashU, as well as many other similar examples).  Even if you have your heart set on a school and you got in, it might prove too expensive to be a viable option.  Experience has shown that you will have an easier time negotiating for more financial aid if you have multiple offers.  You could also have a family medical emergency, loss of employment, or other calamity that affects your decision on where to go.  You could get [threatened with rescinded admission for getting 2 Bs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/80jkos/calling_out_columbia/).  You could decide you want to be closer/further from home.  You could decide to major in bioengineering instead of economics and therefore switch from UChicago to Georgia Tech.  There are hundreds of reasons why your plan could change, so don't close doors for yourself before you have to.  \n\n**6.  Read the details of the admissions agreement and follow them.**  Early action programs don't require you to withdraw other applications, so don't do it until you've made your decision.  Early Decision programs usually do require that you withdraw other applications, but only after you have received your financial aid package (and it is affordable).  Don't play games or try to find out where else you can get in just to inflate your ego.  Keep your end of the agreement you signed.  But also, don't withdraw your applications until you're SURE of where you're going.",

      "text": "This, definitely this. I'm going to put my story down here as an attempt at an explanation. I'm in the UK so some terms may be different to y'all, feel free to ask if there's anything you don't understand.\n\nThe way applying for university (college) works in the UK is that you have to do all of your applications through the University and College Admission System (everyone calls it UCAS though). Unlike in the US where (as far as I'm aware) you can apply to as many colleges as you like as long as you pay the fee, we can only apply for a maximum of five universities for a single fee of \u00a325 (about US$33) or \u00a320 (about US$27) if you're only applying to one uni. You also can't apply to both Oxford and Cambridge Unis (UK equivalent of Yale and Harvard) in the same year - you can only choose one of them.\n\nI applied to three different universities in January 2020 (the deadline for all UK applications). Three months later and I had an offer for University #1 but hadn't heard anything back from University #2 or University #3, even though I had an interview with University #2. I had spoken to my tutors about withdrawing my applications for #2 and #3, where they told me not to because \"they may come back to you with an offer at some point\". All of my university choices are in London (where I've lived all my life) but as my parents had kicked me out a year prior and I was sleeping on my boyfriend's couch, I needed to make accommodation choices pretty quickly if I didn't want to end up on the streets (especially not in the middle of a pandemic).\n\nI'm not sure how acceptance works in the US but here we can get three different decisions - rejected, conditional offer (which depends on you getting the grades required in your exams - we use our grades from our last years of education rather than a GPA) and unconditional offer, which basically means that you're in no matter what. I had a conditional offer from Uni #1 but nothing from the other two, so if I screwed my exam up I'd have no place at uni. I then decided against my college's advice to withdraw all of my applications but that offer, and solely focus on getting the grade I needed for that one uni. (In the UK, we go to school ages 5-16, college or sixth form 16-18 then university 18+ - the legal age throughout the whole of the UK is 18.)\n\nSummer came and I got the grade that I needed to get into university, and I'm now 19 living the best life I can (despite the pandemic) and doing a course that I absolutely love. If I had focused on preparing for interviews that would have never happened, I wouldn't have met the conditions of my offer. Though saying that, you need to seriously consider every option available to you before you withdraw any apps - my general rule is if you've had any sort of a reply from them (apart from any automated ones), don't withdraw. You don't want to be left high and dry only to find that you would have a place if you had waited a week more.\n\nI've just realised just how much I've written but I hope this helps you in some way, even if it isn't US-based. If it helps just one person then I'm happy that I haven't just written lots of crap. If you do have any questions though, please feel free to ask :)",

Like, really badly.\n\n>One person who would have gotten in withdrawing their application doesn\u2019t mean that another spot will open for someone else who isn\u2019t academically qualified.\n\nThe argument for declining admissions isn't about giving academically unqualified applicants a chance, its about giving equally or deservingly qualified people a chance. You and I both know that the college apps process is truly random, and a properly qualified applicant could definitely hurt from some guy not wanting to decline admission. ANYTHING can be a factor in an AO's decision when it comes to rejecting those students that are *kind of* there in terms of their resume but not quite. So lets not keep pushing this narrative of harmless stubbornness unless its backed by facts, k?",

                  "text": "If you just look at the number of accepted students at each school, it can vary greatly. For instance, Yale accepted 2229 students out of 35,306 for the class of 2022, but only 2178 out of 36,843 for the class of 2023 despite both being years in which Yale had sought to expand admissions. Then for the class of 2024, they accepted 2304 out of 35220. So yes, it generally is a range rather than a set number. As a result, the chances of somebody holding on to their acceptance in order to field the rest of their decisions actually having a direct impact on another applicant is minimal.\n\nI get the very cynical look at the application process, trust me, I do. But, I think sometimes that cynicism is exaggerated as in this instance, colleges aren\u2019t excessively obsessive over maintaining strict class sizes. \n\nAnd again, I think the general argument here is to hold off on withdrawing admissions BECAUSE the process can be so random. Taking into consideration financial aid, scholarships and opportunities, career decisions, etc., is important, especially if you don\u2019t know where you are going. \n\nHowever, I will agree that if you are absolutely certain which school you want to attend and you get in early, especially ED, then it\u2019s generally best if you do withdraw. Again, this is contingent upon you actually knowing where you want to go for certain and are in a position where you can maintain the status quo, which is often rare and difficult to have concretely.",

AOs themselves (at Q and A sessions, for multiple different schools) have said that one person withdrawing does not help others. If you want to keep believing this false narrative that the reason you got rejected was because person X didn\u2019t withdraw their application, you can keep doing that, but that will just be lying to yourself. What AOs have said when is generally, they accept a range of students, the number decided using historical yield data, and if one they would have accepted withdraws, it doesn\u2019t mean that one other different person will be accepted, because they accept a range and if you weren\u2019t going to be accepted before, it is extremely unlikely that a withdrawal would change that. \n\nWith that in mind, if you still refuse to acknowledge or believe that fact, there is nothing I can do to help you, and you can continue to blame everything on the person who didn\u2019t withdraw.\n\nI understand this process is difficult, and stressful, and can spark hatred and anger and someone who got into a school you wanted to go to, I really do. But things happen. And you need backups. That is why people have academic and financial likely schools. God forbid something happens, like a death of a loved one, or losing a job, or anything that could stop you from moving far away or affording college, you need those options, and withdrawing takes those away. It is very rare that you know 100% where you\u2019re going even after getting into your top school until after you commit.",

If that was the case, you wouldn't have applied. \n\n...was objectively disingenuous. And besides, some safeties are just less desirable than others in any situation imaginable. Telling seniors to retain their admissions with absolutely 0 exceptions or nuance is a bit questionable.",
