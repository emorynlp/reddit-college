  "text": "I am an international and I am doing early action to TCU (deadline is November 1) but I need to work on my CSS a little more. I was planning to do early since I had my common app and other documents finished, but I am not sure. The website does not say any deadline about CSS for the early action students. It only says that the deadline is February 1 for prospective international students. It is my first time doing an application so I am confused. Is it normal to send CSS after applying to a college or is it mandatory to submit CSS before the college application deadline?",
