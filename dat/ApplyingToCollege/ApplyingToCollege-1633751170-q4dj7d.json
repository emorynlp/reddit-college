  "text": "Title says it all. Currently in my junior year, and moved to a new school/state 2 months ago. Bc of this, i dont think ill have any exceptional extracurriculars. The ones i do have/planning to do are building a website, couple service clubs, prom committee, powerlifting, cs club. (Im trying to major in cs at a decent school like unc (in-state)). My grades are fine and i expect to get ~1450+ on the sat. Do i even have a chance cus of lacking ecs or what? Any advice/comments would be appreciated",

No university is going to reject you just because you moved high schools lol",
