It allows people to use a background as a crutch.\n\n3.Gender identity\nThis is a college application. My gender shouldn\u2019t play any role in my acceptance to a college. If your gender identity is that much if a part of you, talk about it in your perspectives essay.\n\nEspecially when these are the only prompts besides the common app available, it just screams the wrong message to me.",
