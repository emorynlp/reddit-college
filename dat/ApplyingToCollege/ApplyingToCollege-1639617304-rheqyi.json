  "text": "As everyone knows, ED and EA decisions are slowly rolling o Even though I'm a junior and not currently applying, many of my friends are seniors and are going through a lot of rejections. I just want to make my friends feel better and hopefully move on after a rejection. A2C, how should I respond if a friend does get rejected from a school, and what's the best thing to do to support them?\n\nThanks!",
