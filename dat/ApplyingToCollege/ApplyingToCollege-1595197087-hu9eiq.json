When you finish class you can do whatever and leave because you dont live there, instead of being isolated in your tiny dorm room you pay thousands for. You will probably have more freedom so it may not be a bad idea. \n\nStudent debt is no joke. I completed my first year of college, no debt and its looking that way for my second year. My friends are probably already in debt and there is gonna be a few who took out loans for everything single darn bill (Tuition, room and board, dining fees, those darn books) .So by the time I transfer to Uni I will have $0 debt while some maniac has 60K already.\n\nIn conclusion, seriously consider community college. Like imagine if you won a 2K scholarship that is one semester free. You can even work and pay that off. My near minimum wage job, a scholarship, and a few clep exams mean im not owing a NICKEL to ANYBODY this school year. Please get a job if you havent already because it really makes a difference",

I was JUST able to pay for my summer and fall classes at a COMMUNITY COLLEGE! May still need a little help from my parents since im 158 dollars short.\n\nSummer\n\n* Organic Chem lecture and lab ($800), lab equipment that came several weeks late ($200), books and molecular model kit ($100something)\n\nFall\n\n* Gen Bio 1 and Algebra based Physics ($1342.50), Dont know books cost yet but Physics we dont need one.\n* Clep exam for Calculus 1 and US History 1($85 per exam not including sitting fee or other materials I may purchase to study for, but for now Khan academy and Youtube is my best friend)\n\nOn top of this I will need to pay my car bills ($219/month)\n\nI was probably only able to afford this because I have been stuck at home since March with a virtual job. So I spent no money on gas, outside food, social life. Literally my bank account started swelling but I lost all that to school tuition and fees. So frustrating that could have went towards my nonexistent savings account. In fact, my parents had to take over the car bill for a while but im planning on jumping back on that again when fall semester starts so I can be less of a burden.  \n\nThis is my life, and I go to a community college, so you can imagine what its like for someone going to a state university or even a private or out of state school if they dont have much funding. I wish I can move out, but thats not happening for at least another year and I may have to take out loans or earn a good deal of scholarships for that, but thats why people like us gotta earn them good grades. its a grind :)",

              "text": "Oh mate just reading this gives me anxiety. Although I already graduated high school, I\u2019m not going to university straight away because of 2 years mandatory national service. (About to start in less than a month) Now you probably think I\u2019m not from the US, which is correct, but because I went to an international school with an American curriculum, the US would be the most logical stepping stone in my academic future. I really don\u2019t think I can support myself in the States while attending uni there. Not even sure if I can get a scholarship with my grades, which are pretty average, good at best. Honestly, I might not even put US universities as a choice after my 2 years of national service because of the price and other reasons. I\u2019m really gonna have to save up my allowance I get from national service or else I would also have a nonexistent savings account lol. (Might just lose it right now since I only got 70 bucks in it)\n\nIdk how it is in America but a car doesn\u2019t sound like a good idea. Gotta pay for it, taxes, petrol, maintenance, and parking (my family, well my mom and I, stay in a flat so if I were to get a car I would have to pay for parking which is not cheap). I\u2019d rather take the public transport.\n\nAlso, what is clep? Collegeboard emailed me asking if I wanna take it if I wasn\u2019t satisfied with my AP score, which I am (although I\u2019m more upset about the fee because we had to pay shipping fee, doubling the price of the exam and in the end we took it online at 4 in the morning). Doesn\u2019t seem to be worth my time and effort.\n\nEdit: also you can barely afford 2 seasons of school fees even with the support of a scholarship with like 5 to 6 month worth of pay? Either I\u2019m missing something or this has got to be the worst trade deal of all time",

And you can schedule it anytime me you so you arent ilimited to taking it this one time in the year in high school. Yeah college does seem like a bad trade deal but thats because im handling it on my own without my parents because I want to be responsible and not a burden. They have three other children to put through college. For the first two semesters they paid for it. Also we are middle class so we are too rich for financial aid, and too poor for college. We are pretty much on our own. My CC charge 160 dollars per credit plus fees. So 15 credits would be 2500 dollars. Thats why im working more at my job, taking exams for credit, and frantically applying for scholarships. Because at the end of the day, I want to go to Grad school for Pharmaceutical Sciences and I want to have as little debt as possible from undergrad because Im most likely gonna have to take loans then. Luckily I have a pharmacy technician certification so I can get paid more money. At least 5 to 6 dollars more (I make 8 an hour), then up to 20 dollars an hour if I work hospital instead of retail (Best case scenario but hard to get)",

This might come across as insensitive, and if it does I apologize and I don\u2019t mean any offense, but even if your parents got 3 more kids, you are also their child which they should be held responsible for helping you. Also, the 3 other children are your parent\u2019s choice and their responsibilities, not yours, so don\u2019t beat urself up if your parents cannot afford it. Of course I don\u2019t mean completely leave it up to them to pay for everything but I think it\u2019s okay to depend on them a little. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that u have the right to burden them a bit. Hope that de-stressed u a bit because u understandably sound real stressed about this. But like I said you trying to lessen the burden on your parents is admirable so props to u. In my family it\u2019s just my sister and I so I guess it\u2019s easier on them. They said at the very least they\u2019ll give me money for food which I\u2019m definitely grateful of.\n\nYea we r middle class too so I guess financial aid is out of the question, god dammit. Now I just have to hope my pretty average, good at best, grades can land me some scholarships. Gotta get my hands on whatever I can get lol.\n\nAlso, you make $8/hr and that\u2019s 5 to 6 dollars more. I\u2019m assuming that means that the usual is about $3/hr. How can it be so little? Mate being a cashier at my local McDonald\u2019s pays more. Hopefully u can get that sweet $20/hr to cover ur loans. I\u2019m just bewildered on the $3/hr.",

Im pretty sure 3 dollars an hour is illegal in every state unless Im a server who have tips, sorry if I wasnt clear.\n\nAlso the Clep exam is generally easier than the Ap exam. You should look more into it but thats okay if you dont want to. Exams are hard enough.\n\nThanks for the advice. Another reason why Im helping them is because my dad is currently a full time nursing student and my mom is the only one working. I understand its their choice and they should help me but I feel like this is better in the long run. Soon my dad will graduate and make more money. And hey, it may seem like im working a lot but they helped me so much to. \n\nLike I live in their house for free, my dad helped me write that scholarship essay. My mom helped quiz me for my pharmacy technician certification exam which will help me earn more money in the future. They paying my car payments for now, AWESOME.\n\nYes, I am stressed, but I am also determined and eager :)",

I\u2019m doing music so I developed a relationship with my now professor throughout highschool and that has helped me get scholarships, maybe you could pull something like that? That\u2019s about all I can offer as someone literally in your shoes, I turned down a larger better and more competitive school for a school in my state, but a good one and one where I\u2019ll probably get a better education tbh I just won\u2019t have a flashy name behind it",

              "text": "So I\u2019m guessing you know about bright futures but if not (or for those who don\u2019t) anyone with the SAT or ACT super score can be eligible if that\u2019s accompanied by a passing GPA (don\u2019t remember the specifics but I think you\u2019d have to be pretty low to not qualify) and have a certain amount of volunteer hours and you can get different levels of it. There\u2019s a couple different tiers with the top covering full tuition for instate schools and some but not all private schools in Florida, the requirements did change for 2021 so I can\u2019t give you specifics but td available on their website. I got some from local Italian American clubs/ polish American clubs and if you have any of these nationality type clubs in your town or any lodges they\u2019ll likely have scholarships even if you\u2019re not Italian or whichever it be. Check your local veterans clubs, most have scholarships. Your dentists may have some as well. Is there a major corporation or factory where you are? I got one from a company that many factors vehicles (can\u2019t say because it would low key expose my location but it\u2019s only for locals to the town). Sorry if these are a little vague but at my school our councilors collected and compiled local ones which if you ask your councilor I\u2019m sure they can help. Do you play music? Even if you\u2019re not a \u201cjazz\u201d player There are quite a few jazz foundations which award money (I didn\u2019t apply in time for these) but especially in south Florida there\u2019s like a Port Saint Lucie jazz found. I think and a treasure coast one and they\u2019re not hidden by any means at all. Also even if you don\u2019t go to school for music sometimes you can get music scholarships for playing in bands/ orchestras or even doing a music minor and auditioning. Check your parents work place as well, local scholarships aren\u2019t advertised as much and if you dig you\u2019ll find them and the applicant look is wayyy smaller because it\u2019s only people in your town. Also even if you\u2019re not religious: churches.\n\nEdit: sorry for the music ones even if you\u2019re like a classical Oboe player just practice some basic jazz charts and go suditij for jazz foundations because normally the applicant pool is so tiny you\u2019ll get it anyways source; my friend who got 2 jazz foundation scholarships and he pretty much only played classical saxophone \n\nAnd most smaller schools will offer you more more money than bigger ones, FSU and UF won\u2019t be dishing you out the big bucks because there\u2019s tons of kids, ucf is a little bit better about money. I\u2019m going to UNF so there\u2019s a little bit more aid to go around. What I did for schools is I just waited until the last minute to accept to see what basic offerings I\u2019m getting. I knew of 2 scholarships I was getting at UNF and I was debating on whether to go to UNT with the 1 scholarship I had from the school. So you will see what the money will sort of look like while you\u2019re deciding between schools, most of the big scholarships will be rewarded before decision day and the smaller/ foundations ones will come later. And I did apply to FIT just out of curiosity and they offered a lot of scholarships to make the private school costs basically the same as in state costs which is nice, and if you do go out of state you may get a out of state tuition waver! Where you only have to pay instate tuition, I got that for UNT but not for Univ. Milwaukee, so it depends. However a lot of my aid came from the fact that I\u2019m going instate and to a \u201csmaller\u201d school. Don\u2019t give up though!! There\u2019s hope! And loans can be repaid just be smart about them I\u2019m in the middle of figuring all of that out right now so I can\u2019t offer any loan advice lol.",

      "text": "When you're looking at school costs it's important to realize what those costs would actually mean. Care mostly about the immediate 5-10 years after you get out of school? Don't go somewhere expensive unless the better outcomes would cancel out your rough monthly payment increase from loans, calculable from an online student loan payment estimator. Care about retirement date/amount like the folks over at r/financialindependence ? Ensure that the increase in the total amount average graduates in your field get paid  times the amount of time you think you'll be working is greater than the total cost of the student loans once you think you'll be able to pay them off. These shouldn't be that hard to calculate and there are plenty of calculators online that can help you get rough numbers for an ideal student loan payment schedule -- there are actually a fair few fields (mostly stem or other immediately marketable degrees) where if you plan on being in the workforce for 10-20+ years (which you probably should be), it's still economical to go to the better school. For example, UCSD, well-known to be affordable in-state while having a good computer science program, sees software engineers with undergrad degrees make ~97,000 per year, while MIT counterparts earn about 110,000 per year. This 13,000 dollar gap, when multiplied by 20 years, the earliest date at which all but the most stringent cheapskates would even consider retiring at, comes to 260,000 dollars. Even if one payed 50k per year to MIT but only 10k at UCSD (which wouldn't even cover housing in San Diego lmao), that 180,000 dollar difference, even when interest is accounted for (which I won't do here because I'm currently on mobile), fizzles out around the 20-year mark with proper investing, and every year worked beyond that point tips the scales in MIT's favor. Maybe you're somehow into FIRE already and are aiming to invest far more aggressively than average, which would be better for UCSD because you could invest the money that didn't go to MIT loans earlier. Maybe you prioritize money more before you turn ~30 to live life or travel. There's also something to be said for the experience -- as a computer science guy (for the example), would you rather go to a school with essentially thousands of like-minded nerds, or a school known for its nigh-zero social life? Or maybe you'd prefer the relaxation that UCSD can offer over MIT stress? These are considerably harder to gauge before actually going, but if the numbers come out close enough, the actual college experience is worth a lot too. But doing the math is always a good thing to do, and running the numbers -- especially more accurately than I have here -- can help you get a way better picture when deciding. A good resource for this is [payscale.com](https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/bachelors/page/1), where you can search for schools and get rough numbers to run. Schools usually publish their outcomes in pamphlets or on their websites for more accurate pictures, too. In all likelihood, if you really like the schools, you should still probably apply to both the cheaper and more expensive ones, as they're probably better with outcomes than you think. It's also worth noting that with Corona, interest rates are going to be ludicrously low, so this might actually be a decent year to be graduating in terms of student loans, despite how it's bad in every other way.\n\nEdit: it's also obviously not as simple as just multiplying as salaries and often salary gaps ramp up as time goes on; I included that for the sake of example. I believe payscale.com's report has a 20-year estimate for better comparing, but I have no idea how it's calculated.",

              "text": "When pushing a resume through HR and arguably even during the interview process (if you pass a basic screening), the school and work experience are basically the only non-personality-or-communication things they see; going to a T20 is somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy, also making the manager/HR correlate you more with MIT, and because it might land more jobs directly out of school or internships during, makes your experience look better too. Both schools are considerably above the national average, so few produce candidates that are unemployable, which means passing the tech screening part of the interview shouldn't be a problem for the average kid from either. In abscense of anything else, the MIT degree probably won't just instantly land you a job, but it's clearly a boon assuming an identical person applies with or without it. Also, MIT has a far more closely knit alumni network that (though for all I know this is specific to comp sci) will just give you job or interview opportunities because they know you went to their school (also MIT has a bunch of entrepreneurs and so would have more relevant businesses that do this), which is something a lot of top schools do. I have no doubt that a decent chunk of that difference is totally because MIT has better students, but there are a lot of clear, direct ways that those higher salaries are produced. As long as these are supposed to be rough numbers I think that gap is still totally reasonable to use in those calculations. \n\nAlso, if you actually know the percent of that gap that better students account for, just multiply that by the gap and then run that and you'll just be more accurate. Frankly I have no idea how you would conduct a study like this (maybe track MIT admits that went to non-T20s? Seems like a small sample size), but if one has been done that'd be really cool.",

Also, Juniors TAKE THE PSAT AND TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. National Merit Scholarship packages (full rides at Alabama, Ole Miss, Idaho, tons of money at UT Dallas, Arizona State, and plenty of others) are great ways to load up on scholarships and distinguish yourself from other students when trying to do research or get involved in other activities within a huge school. You will not regret trying to get Finalist status even if it\u2019s just for the security of having a full ride or close to it at one of your safeties.",
