Best to find out now!\n\nFor those who are not yet aware, PSA, public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.\n\n(For those who are aware and like to downvote my frequent PSA, the OP situation is the reason why I do it. Obviously, plenty are not yet aware.)",
