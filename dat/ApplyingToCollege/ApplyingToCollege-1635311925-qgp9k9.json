  "text": "So right now, I'm a senior, going to graduate 2022 (obviously). I'm applying for the CSU system, and on the High School Coursework section of the application, am I supposed to include my senior year as well? Since I'm *currently* a senior, my final grade has not been determined yet so I can't really add it in can I?\n\nSecondary question:\n\nThey ask for the final grade of the class you took that year. Here on my transcript, it states 2 seperate grades, for each semester. Do I use the second semester grade or the first one? Or can I just use the best out of the two?",
