      "text": "Both are solid schools, but this is not how you should be thinking about ED here. ED should be for the school that you would go to over literally any school that you have a chance of getting into (e.g. don't hold out for Harvard with a 1400 + 3.0 but if you're in range, then that's probably a valid ED if it is actually your top school). So the real questions here are:\n\n1. Which school do you prefer to go to between Northeastern and RIT?\n2. Are there any financial factors to consider here? Do you need FA?\n3. Are you in range for both schools?\n\nTo answer the question you asked, I'd take Northeastern over RIT consistently (and actually did make this choice myself when choosing schools), but they aren't too far off. Both will do well and offer similar advantages with co-op.",

              "text": "Tbh there's no need to apply ED for RIT, and while you can try for Northeastern and test optional helps (don't submit your score), its def a reach. So IMO this is now a question of if you ED or not at all.\n\n>I am applying for FA, but costs is not the biggest reason\n\nLet's say you ED to Northeastern but get your max COA offered to you, and RIT is 30K a year cheaper. are you going to be kicking yourself that you're locked into ED?\n\nI would strongly caution at ED'ing to a school based on what school ranks or seems better for a subject by a slim margin. There are a lot more important factors in where you're going to spend your next 4-5 years.",
