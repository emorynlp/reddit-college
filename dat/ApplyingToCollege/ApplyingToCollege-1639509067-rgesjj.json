  "text": "I already have applied to all 6 of my colleges and have already heard back from 2. One of my biggest activities listed was my participation in FIRST robotics. Last year we weren\u2019t able to have it because of covid, and on my applications I indicated that I will be participating in it this year. However with the new variant it doesn\u2019t look like robotics will be held this year. Should I notify colleges or not since it\u2019s a minor detail on one of my ten activities? Would it matter at all?\n\nSorry if this is a dumb question I\u2019m going crazy waiting for decisions.",
