I'm not sure how much it actually helps but it's one of the reason, though not the only reason, my son is staying involved. He thinks the Eagle scout rank combined with leadership on his sports teams and clubs will help, especially as an URM. He says soon he'll be giving kids the same speech once he is an Eagle scout.

              "text": "That's generally a good rule of thumb. Unless you are doing something truly extraordinary, the exact extracurriculars aren't going to make or break you. Colleges like to admit students that will contribute positively to their school. 4.0 GPAs are a dime a dozen and they want to see who you are outside of that. Things like leadership and commitment can be shown in a variety of extracurriculars and colleges are well aware that students do some activities as \"resume boosters.\" There is no such thing as the perfect extracurricular and I tell both of my high schoolers to focus more on what they like than what they think colleges will like.\n\nI'm not sure how much being an Eagle scout helps in college admissions. My son is hoping the Eagle scout rank along with his leadership on his sports teams and in his school clubs will tie together nicely to paint a better picture of who he is. Plus, boy scouts have trouble reaching minorities. Only 4 percent of all boy scouts achieve the rank and only a small percentage of those kids are black, so he's hoping that helps him stand out from the other team captains and class vice presidents. I would still caution against it if he were only doing it for college though. He still likes it but as a very involved high schooler it has fallen down his list of priorities.",

I've been doing piano for a while, and violin for slightly less (not very good, mostly just for fun, but am in an outside-of-school orchestra), and doing music is also good for apps, so why not stick with it through senior year. I wouldn't necessarily avoid app boosters like the plague; if it's interesting and it might be good for the app, why not give it a shot? Different strokes though, and that's totally fine.  \n\nHave a great day!",
