  "text": "I\u2019m trying really hard to fill out my GT transfer application to the best of my ability. How will addressing these questions help my application? I\u2019m hoping your answers may help me! Thank you!\n\nIf you transferred from a different college to a large research college how did you address the following things on your application?:\n\n   \u2022 What is your major?\n\n   \u2022 What sort of thing did you write about for your application essay?\n\n   \u2022 Did you submit your SAT/ACT score(s)? \n\n   \u2022 What was your SAT/ACT score(s) (regardless if you submitted them on your transfer application)? \n\n   \u2022 Did you mention anything from high school on your application? If so, what did you mention?\n\n   \u2022 What grade did you transfer into (sophomore, junior, senior)? \n\n   \u2022 What did your college ECs look like at your previous institution?\n\n\nI have a lot of background from my high school I\u2019d like to mention on my application. I was also dual enrolled for two years as a high school student and I\u2019m not sure how much that\u2019s going to hurt or help me.
