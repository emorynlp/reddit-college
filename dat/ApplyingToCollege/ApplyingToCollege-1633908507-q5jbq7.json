  "text": "I did fafsa, took me a good 50 minutes with my parents\n\nNow, about CSS. It has THE WORST UI that I have EVER seen. For a \"non-profit\" company that makes tens of millions off students, the website is god awful.\n\nHere's my situation. Parents are married, but separated (dad works in Korea, we have a healthy family), this means that my dad doesn't have a W-2 form for taxes and stuff. Mom is a stay at home mom (so basically makes 0 a month). But WHY is it SOO difficult to turn in the damn forms??? like why??? Trying to figure out CSS took my family a good 3 hours. I recommend you all to start ASAP.",
