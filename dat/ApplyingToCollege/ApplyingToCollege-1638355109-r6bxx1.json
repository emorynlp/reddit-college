  "text": "I was told by my parents that all I needed was good grades and strong test scores to get into college. I wasn\u2019t allowed to do activities because they were always busy and extremely frugal. I got a job recently and I started doing piano lessons and speech but I know that\u2019s nothing compared to other kids. Should I just give up now and stop worrying about this? If not, what are some ways to earn merit aid. I have no leadership ecs, I have no long term commitment activities (started and paid for all my activities this year) and I need to rely on my own income.",

Be able to reflect on your life and have a general idea of where you want to go after university will set yourself up better than check-the-box activities. Do your research, though, and start looking at the specifics of what is required versus what is recommended for the schools you\u2019re interested in attending.",

If you're a national merit semifinalist (if you took the PSAT you'll find out your result this month), even better.\n\nSome schools that do this are ASU and UAlabama Birmingham. Look into more.",
