You can either leave the huge spaces (I\u2019m sure AOs see them all the time), or just get rid of the blank lines and just hit enter once between each paragraph, and that should show up more normally in the preview. \n\nP.S. this question gets asked multiple times every year around application deadlines (like most other questions I\u2019ve seen on the sub the past few days), so you can find the answers by searching on this sub",
