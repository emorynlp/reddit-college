  "text": "I am a solid 3.7 GPA student, I have taken 2 AP's, 9 dual enrollments, and around 13 honors classes. I am \"smart\" but nowhere near to Uchicago smart. However, I play \"a sport\" and their coach is seriously interested in me. Obviously I am considering visiting and debating on going, my question is: Is it even possible for me to survive there academically? The opportunity seems to good to pass up given my situation.",

Tho uchicago is rly rly good at finance(but we have no finance major we have a biz Econ major) but we aren\u2019t that good at marketing, if u r set on doing marketing don\u2019t come here. If u do choose to attend I suggest grinding out AP science tests and Ap foreign language cuz that will help u out a lot with ur class schedule.",
