  "title:": "I didn't include my non transferrable courses in my UC and Cal State applications and now I'm scared.",
  "text": "I applied to 4 Cal States and 4 UCs. I made the mistake of not including my non transferable courses (there's 8 of them- I went to a private college outside of CA for my first year of college) in my applications because I didn't think I needed to. I notified every school of this situation and I will take the steps needed to resolve this issue. I asked each school if this situation would negatively affect my chances of admission. Some said \"potentially no\" or \"probably no\". Others said no or \"likely no\". \n\nI don't want the schools to think I'm trying to hide anything cause I'm not. This was a genuine mistake. If I could make the changes to my applications right now, I'd do it. But I can't cause I already submitted my applications. I have to wait until January to enter my classes and grades for them in. \n\nI'm just scared that this situation could lead to me less likely to be admitted to the schools I am applying to or get my TAG application to UC Davis rescinded (I submitted a TAG application to UC Davis and got accepted). If the non transferable courses were to be factored into my GPA, my GPA would still be high enough to meet the TAG requirements.",
