  "title:": "Thoughts on marrying before college?",
  "text": "Here is the deal: all colleges I have looked at look for your dependency status for scholarship, and if you are married, the income of your parents is disregarded completely, which would be a huge win for me since my parents earn too much for me to qualify for financial aid. My question is: could me and my best fiend marry before going to college (no actual desire or feelings of love between us) and get scholarship money because we are both minimum wage students? Or would this hurt my admissions chances for universities? Follow-up: if we file for divorce after going to college would this be considered fraud or could we claim the feelings are no longer present?",

First, you would have to demonstrate that your marriage is legitimate.  You are FAR from the first student to identify this \"one weird trick financial aid officers hate!\"  Your fin aid application would undergo a TON of scrutiny.  If they discover any reasons for hesitancy, they have full authority to offer you no financial aid at all and to accuse you of fraud.  Aid awards are determined by the financial aid office - the FAFSA and CSS are just guidelines.  \n\n3.  You had sure better trust that friend.  Marriage is a complex legal arrangement and should never be entered into lightly.  Divorce is similarly often complicated.  If your relationship with your \"spouse\" deteriorates, as can happen in life, they could make this hard on you. \n\nI do not recommend this approach.",

Financial aid is both from the federal and state levels in the US, and any attempts to defraud the process falls to the IRS and Department of the Treasury for investigation (Treasury's investigative branch is the Secret Service), and they are *very* good at what they do.\n\nOverall, I see no way of doing this without committing a minimum of 4 felonies.",

      "text": "I'll admit I've had the same thought.  I can't imagine it would harm your admissions chances, so that's a non-issue.  However, if the FAFSA and/or CSS will ask questions about whether you expect to receive significant financial support from parents/relatives, and if you expect to receive financial support, you would want to answer that question truthfully and it might still tank the amount of financial aid you receive.\n\nAnother kink in this plan:  depending on the state, you usually can't marry without your parents' permission until you turn 18, which is typically going to be later than the time frame during which you'd prefer to apply to college.\n\nAnother possible one:  while marrying severs parental obligation for the FAFSA, I'm not sure whether the same is true for the CSS.  Maybe?  If not, then this scheme won't help you at CSS schools, and the schools that are most generous with financial aid are typically CSS schools.",

Usually there will be a chart on their website with the levels of stats and scholarship amounts. Example: [https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/](https://scholarships.ua.edu/freshman/out-of-state/); see also UAH, U Maine, U Kentucky, U Mississippi, U Arizona, Arizona State, Wyoming, UTD, etc. Then compare the scholarship amount to the out-of-state cost of attendance to see whether the scholarship would make the college affordable for your family.",

If your spouse defaults on obligations, the creditors can sue you to recover the money. They can also garnish your wages and take title to your property. There's also the possibility that marrying might put your ability to qualify for your parent's health insurance in jeopardy. Not to mention your spouse taking out credit in your name since you are, after all, married.\n\nTLDR this can go so very wrong in ways you can't even imagine. Please don't f\\*ck around, and you won't find out.\n\nEdited: Forgot to mention that if your \"wife\" gets pregnant by anyone during your marriage, you are the presumed father and will be on the hook for child support. Attorneys are expensive, and unwinding that mess can take a long time.",
