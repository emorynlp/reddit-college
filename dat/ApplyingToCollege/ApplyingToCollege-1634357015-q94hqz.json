  "text": "okay, so most of the college deadlines are in January, but many of the colleges im applying to have early action, priority deadlines, etc. but i am retaking the sat in november and although i want to meet these deadlines and have a chance at scholarships, i don\u2019t know if it would be more beneficial to wait because if im being honest, junior year in the middle of covid was really below my average for me, and im trying to deal with it now. it kind of messed up my gpa, but i have a solid college essay that kind of explains what was happening around that time, and have had many teacher say it\u2019s spectacular and good to go, a lot of volunteering + activities, plus a pretty good freshman and sophomore year. and i want to retake the sat because again it was a really bad time for me and i know i could do so much better. im not a student with like a 1.7 gpa or anything like that but i do think there\u2019s room for improvement so I don\u2019t know if i should wait and take the time to improve or just do it now and submit it later when the scores come out mid November. what would be better?",
