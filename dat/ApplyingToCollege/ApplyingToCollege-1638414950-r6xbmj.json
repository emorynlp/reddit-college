  "text": "Obviously a throwaway \n\n(this is not a shitpost)\n\nA couple years ago (i think it was eight grade or ninth grade - we go to a school thats 8-12) I used to say slurs a lot. I didn't understand the severity of it coming from a neighborhood that was very white and I've apologized since and became a better person. \n\nI thought it was over when I apologized sincerely for it when I was in the 10th grade. Now, kids at my school know that I'm applying at top schools and are threatening to send the screenshots and videos to the admissions officers there. \n\nI really don't know what to do. I'm so scared. Any advice would be helpful.",
