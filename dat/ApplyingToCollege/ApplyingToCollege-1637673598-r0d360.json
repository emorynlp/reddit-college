      "text": "It\u2019s really strong academically and our neuroscience/biology departments are really well funded. Hardly a traditional college experience and I\u2019d say many of the students are socially awkward (not necessarily a bad thing just there\u2019s a lot of us here). Cons: I do feel socially isolated and there\u2019s a bit of a \u201cwhere fun goes to die\u201d culture, and I wish the school were bigger which just comes down to my personal preferences. However there are some amazing professors here (both like, as people and as professionals. I love one of my bio profs and I went into the class skeptical) and if grad school is on your radar the size comes as a benefit that you can build close relationships with them. To be completely honest I only chose this school because of its location though, which is pretty great. I\u2019ve always wanted to live near Boston \nSource: am a freshman at Brandeis\nEdit: I forgot to mention I also chose it because of money. Scholarships/fin aid were great and even beat my state school, I know Brandeis is really generous with that",
