As we see how millennials experiencing high debts for pursuing higher education may impact future generations. If we follow the trends of millennials, we're going to be experiencing the decline of youth population as a lot of millennials and gen z probably will have no kids or less than 3. Its now being normalized to not have children or having less than what boomers had(4 - +8). Not to mention the great resignation happening rn, so work conditions will change. So, anything can happen. As the boomers and gen x fade out and millennials and gen z start take over. Anything can happen tbh, we won't know what it will look like until 10-20 years later.",
