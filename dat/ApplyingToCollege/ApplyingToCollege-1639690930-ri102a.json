  "title:": "How do I tell colleges I made 5 figures",
  "text": "I made between $50k-$100k this year from social media. I'm trying to major in computer science or double major in com sci/business depending on the college. I don't really know how to use this in my essays to give me the best chance to distinguish myself from others, especially when applying to Ivies. Do I just leave it as an activity in my EC list? Would admissions dislike people pursuing social media?\n\nI'm applying RD to Stanford, Carnegie, USC, UMich, Duke, and UPenn. Most of these are reaches, but I've already gotten into my safeties. Some stats if it helps: SAT: 1570, GPA: 3.98/4.5",
