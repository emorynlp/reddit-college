  "text": "I'm not really sure what schools I would enjoy being at especially for my safeties/matches so as a result I don't really have any safeties/matches.  I live in michigan, I have a 1520 sat (740 english/780 math) and a 3.95 gpa (4.0 since sophomore year).  My first choice is Umich but beyond that I'm not really sure where I want to go.  I want to go into applied math. I am curious what options there are for me that aren't necessarily in the mid west.  Does anyone have any suggestions?",

      "text": "If we want to talk about this from an economical point of view, I would argue there\u2019s almost no option better than Umich with that in-state tuition. Depending on your income, top-tier privates are the next thing you should consider. \n\nRice in Houston has an excellent math department and great funding for financial aid, unless your family makes a lot of money you will receive pretty good aid there. \n\nObviously Much of the T20 falls in that same category, even if they\u2019re all quite selective. \n\nIf I was in your position I wouldn\u2019t consider any state schools other than Umich. To me it wouldn\u2019t be worth it. I would be pretty confident in your acceptance there, definitely have a backup school, but you\u2019re not gonna beat Umich with just about anything.",

Furthermore, there are much more things to consider other than application stats/general location/concentration, such as school size, in-state vs out-state, financial aid, future career, and more\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would suggest exploring colleges using some college search like majorclarity or something, creating a substantial list then narrowing it down from there",
