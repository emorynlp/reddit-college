  "text": "I spent my WHOLE summer (and when I say whole, I mean WHOLE) studying for my SAT retake \ud83e\udd22 and my hard work finally came to an end on Aug 28. I was satisfied with my score but by the time I wanted to start college essays, school was right around the corner (Sept 2). \n\nNow I am stressed out because I am being bombarded with school work on top of my senior project AND I don\u2019t have any personal essay ideas. I was thinking of applying EA but I might do RD just so my essays don\u2019t seem rushed or messy. \n\nPpl who have everything under control, I WANT TO BE YOU :)\n\nBut at least I have filled out Common App (except for the essays obvi) and I have requested my letters of recommendation \ud83d\ude42",
