  "title:": "Sending Official SAT scores after submitting the Common App",
  "text": "Beyond self-reporting my SAT scores on Common-App, 2 of my colleges want me to send official score reports, and this has come up as incomplete on my application status tracker portal.\n\nIf I send my official SAT test scores 2 weeks after the submission of my application, will it be evaluated as a part of my application, or excluded? Do any of you know what the deadline is for submitting missing materials on first-year international undergrad apps(post notifications of missing materials)?\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "It depends on what schools you applied to. The majority of schools have an early action deadline of Nov 1st, and want at least 1 score in by that date. If you took an October or November test- depending on the school- they may accept those scores and superscore them all together. If your file is incomplete by the early action deadline, they might put you into the regular decision pool. Just send your scores as soon as possible.",
