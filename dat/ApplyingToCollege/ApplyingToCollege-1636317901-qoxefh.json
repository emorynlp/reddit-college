  "text": "I don't know where to say this but I wanted to pursue an International Relations/Law degree. I love engaging in political and philosophical discourse, but I don't think I'm good enough. I love going to national debate tournaments or Model United Nations, but I always end up badly and only became the best delegate once. I can't even write/my writing skills are bad, I believe. Even the sophomores and juniors do better than me in the field I want to pursue, while I just suck at doing anything related to it.  \n\n\nMy other option is to take Engineering (because I think that's only where I excel). I'm a senior and I'm still not sure about all these because of self-doubt. Perhaps, I can just take Mathematics since that's my other favorite and I'm one of the top performers in Math in our school.\n\nIt's so frustrating to think that my classmates excel or master at least one thing while I am being a jack of all trades but a master of none.\n\nI'm just so sad thinking about this right now...",

My major is psychology and I have not taken 1 psych class. I\u2019m going to uni to learn about psychology. Getting better at what your passion is, is the entire reason uni exists (that and money of course)",

      "text": "WOW. similarly, I also want to pursue the exact same degree. This anxiety of being substandard is something I completely understand, but try your best not to compare yourself to your peers, especially the younger ones. (I swear, I do this all the time too) \n\nIf IR is something you're passionate about, then pursue that degree! Even though many wont recommend it, if you don't like IR in college/uni, you can always switch your major to engineering, since that's the other thing you enjoy and excel at. \n\nIts a tough journey, but I believe you'll get through it. We can do this! Best regards.",

I completely get what your feeling and it\u2019s definitely hard especially when I feel like everyone is so much better at articulating themselves. But just remember, that is the point of pursuing a degree in the field. You want to get better at it. You want to learn about something your passionate about. Do not compare yourself to others!!! (Easier said than done). I definitely need to take this advice myself but I hope this helped. Just know that if you end up pursuing something new, do it for yourself not because you think others are better than you at it.",
