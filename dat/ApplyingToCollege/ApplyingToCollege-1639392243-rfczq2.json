[22k intls applied to NYU last year](https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2021/january/NYU2021Applications.html#:~:text=Early%20Decision%20Applications%3A%20NYU%20received,greater%20than%20for%20fall%202020.) out of 100k so 22%. [24%](https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/nyu-at-a-glance.html) of NYU is international. It is possible that yield rate among intls is significantly higher, but point is it's pretty similar.",
