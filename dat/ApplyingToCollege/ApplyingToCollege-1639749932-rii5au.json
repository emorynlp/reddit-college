  "text": "Hey yall! I got into my dream school but its about 7.5k more expensive per year than my local private college. The difference is about 39k per year vs 46k per year. Is going an extra 30k in debt worth it in YOUR opinion?\n\n(39k is affordable, 46k is on the brink of unaffordable, but not something I would go bankrupt over.)\n\nFirst college 15-20% acceptance rate and is my dream school, second is 60% acceptance rate but a great college",

Also, if you had \u201cleftover\u201d college savings, would you be able to access it for a down payment on a house, travel, etc.?  Things to think about.",
