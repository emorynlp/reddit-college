      "text": "Getting deferred is not the end of the world. Life will still work out, you'll still get to do everything you dream of if you work on it, a university acceptance won't change that, or define you in any way.\n\nYou are a complex individual who has more depth and layers than what a few essays can show. Right now you have endless possibilities before you, and the university you end up choosing will define many things in the next few years. Don't encase yourself in only one possibility, don't close yourself to new opportunities. You never know what might surprise you along the way. In my personal experience, some of the best things that have happened to me happened because something interrupted my intended path and I had to work around it.\n\nYou are more than what a person in 8 minutes of their life can see. Maybe your AO had a bad day, maybe his dog had just died and he just wasn't in the mood to read applications... Something as random as university admissions doesn't say anything about you and about what you can accomplish in life, that can only be determined by you, your work, your effort.\n\nFor the moment you are only deferred, there's still a long way to go. But even if you end up being rejected at the end, know that it doesn't matter and it just wasn't meant to be. There will be more opportunities, universities, and experiences. Lift up your chin and know that the best is yet to come, what would life be without a little drama eitherways?",
