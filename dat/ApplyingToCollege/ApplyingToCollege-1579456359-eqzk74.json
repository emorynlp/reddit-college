  "text": "like come on. I walk into Starbucks 5 mins before my interview and there\u2019s already a kid sitting with my interviewer. The interviewer told him to get up and wait because he \u201ccame too early\u201d. Seriously, show up at the right time don\u2019t try and take my time spot that\u2019s just so rude and inconsiderate, not to mention you look like a total try hard, who shows up 30 mins early for an interview, the fuck? Then my interview got cut short because the kid came so early and was waiting so long that the interviewer felt bad and ended my interview after 20 mins because \u201che had someone waiting for so long.\u201d Smh.",

I showed up and took a seat and after the pleasantries he realized I was there early. I turned to see the guy whose interview was before mine standing right behind me. I took a walk and got some tea and came back when the interviewer emailed me that he was ready.\n\nI was also wearing a suit and a tie while the interviewer and the guy in the time slot before me were wearing very casual clothing, which really elevated my 'tryhard' look.\n\nEdit: I wanted to clarify that I wasn't trying to take anyone's spot. I just didn't know there were other people being interviewed. When I walked in, he motioned me over and I sat down, not realizing what was going on.",
