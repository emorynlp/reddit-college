  "text": "Last year, I couldn\u2019t imagine myself anywhere but northwestern. I was absolutely crushed when I was deferred then rejected, but now I am so grateful. I am a freshman at notre dame and I love it so so so much. I cant even imagine myself at northwestern anymore. Just want you all to read this to let you know it\u2019s not the end of the world if you don\u2019t get into your \u201cdream school\u201d \ud83e\udd0d",

I just accepted a high-paying internship and will be graduating with a six-figure job.\n\nNo regrets. Life works out when you learn to love what you have and move forward. Try your best to reach your dreams, but don't be upset if it doesn't work out.",

It\u2019s also funny to rustle some UC jimmies when they find out SLO has a lower acceptance rate than all but the top 3 UCs and has better salary outcomes than basically all of them overall.",
