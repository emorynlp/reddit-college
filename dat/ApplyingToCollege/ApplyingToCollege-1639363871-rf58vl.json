  "text": "Set a goal to do something you DON\u2019T want to do if you get in. Not some self improvement thing you want to do but don\u2019t have the motivation; something you would not do normally and would not want to do normally.\n\nI was just chatting with my friend and said if I got into my top school I\u2019d rewatch a show I hated\u2026 and now I\u2019m feeling less nervous about the decision coming out because if I get rejected I won\u2019t have to watch it.\n\nObviously not for everyone, and don\u2019t do anything too drastic, but it could be a fun way to take the stress off as decisions come out.",
