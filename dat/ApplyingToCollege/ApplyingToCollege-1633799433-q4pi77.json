  "text": "Hi! I was trying to find any information on a good weighted gpa by I haven\u2019t found any, I have a 4.38 weighted and a 3.72 unweighted, which one looks better to submit? Also I am applying to some pretty selective colleges, my extracurriculars are good however I got a only a 1470 on my SAT, would it benefit me to go test optional with my current gpa? Thank you!",
