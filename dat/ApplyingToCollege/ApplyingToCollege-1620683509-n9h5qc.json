Basically the only stuff you need is the most recent tax returns (don\u2019t worry if you personally don\u2019t have to file taxes, they take that into account). It\u2019s not an application where you have to write essays or anything though. I think that for the free cc, it doesn\u2019t matter how high or low your family income is, it just gives two free years to any California resident who is going immediately into community college.",
