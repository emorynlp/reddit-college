  "text": "Hello everyone. I am an international student applying soon. I have an issue with names. I apologise for the length and complication of this. I will be separating first and last names with commas.\n\nI understand there is another subreddit for international students, but this has more people and so I might hear from more people with different experiences. I apologise if I broke any rules.\n\nMy passport has 1 \"name\" field, no first or last names. I will be using made up names throughout this. Thus, the passport name would be Liam Noah Oliver Elijah William James. We have a patronymic tradition.\n\nThe SAT asks for a first and last name, so I used Liam, Noah. This is also the name the school used on the Common Application school report.\n\nThe TOEFL had an option to use 1 name field, like my passport, so I typed Liam Noah Oliver Elijah, only to have the score report come out as Liam Noah, Oliver Elijah.\n\nNow, when applying, I was advised to use Liam, James with the other names as a middle name. I would do this for my Common Application and CSS Profile. I am worried that if I use Liam Noah, the I-20 would come out wrong and I would not be able to get a visa or travel to the university.\n\nHOWEVER, I am now worried they might be unable to match the school report of Liam Noah with the application of Liam James. Any advice? What name do I go with?\n\nThank you for your advice.",
