  "text": "In August, I took the SAT and scored a 1360. I retook it on October 13 and I expect a much better score, but it won't be available until November 3. I applied for my top 8 schools (including U of M Ross and UF) EA last night as well. Is it worth it to send a new score (if better) late? And if I do, should I call/email each school? Thank you!",
