  "text": "Hey, A2C!\n\nTwo days ago, I submittef my RD application to Duke. However, I totally forgot I had checked the box to be considered to Duke Kunshan, too, so I didn't write the Duke Kunshan specific \"optional\" supplement (which is a 200-word Why School essay).\n\nShould I write it and submit it through the portal to demonstrate interest, even though it was optional? No college essays are truly optional, so there's that. Should I just wait for rejection?\n\nThanks in advance!",
