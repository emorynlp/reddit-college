  "text": "I wrote my personal essay on why ivy league admissions officers are the most gullible people on Earth for letting the majority of their students being conceited and arrogant rich kids. Obviously, some of them aren't but the truth is that there is so many of them it can't be a \"coincidence\". What is the chance that other students applying ed did the same thing as me? I was hoping my uniqueness would convince them to let me in. I kinda went in thinking I might as well get rejected being honest if im gonna get rejected anyways. Hey, at least my essay will stand out right since its not some generic extedned metaphor about my passions right?",
