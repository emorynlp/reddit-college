  "title:": "Does valedictorian matter in a small class?",
  "text": "I went to a private school with a small class of about 25 students. Covid caused many students to leave throughout 10th and 11th Grade, and my class was cut down to only 5. I have a GPA of 95 and was in the lead even before my class shrunk down. If I become valedictorian, will it matter as much as with a larger class?",
