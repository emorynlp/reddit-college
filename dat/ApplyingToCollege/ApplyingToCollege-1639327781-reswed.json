      "text": "You could have wrote about this on personal statement. Mental health is quite a unique topic.\n\nAccording to most colleges additional info is an area to provide more info about your extra curricular/ school background(if international)/ awards/ or something unique that would not fit some where else due to word limit.\n\nBut this is not a place to write another essay. Most of the colleges may find this rude. \n\nBut there is a loop hole. What you can do is just state some important points about your mental health and sadness. But if you write like a whole 600 word essay, I don\u2019t know what will happen.",
