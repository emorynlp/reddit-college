      "text": "Take my opinion with a grain of salt since I'm also just a senior applying, but I don't think you need to change the approach you have. The reason why people say to \"tell not show,\" as opposed to \"show not tell\" on the PIQs is the word count. As long as you don't go overboard with fluff, the story is WORTH the words it takes up, and the essay as a whole is representative of what you want to convey to readers, a story approach is fine. Think about how you want readers to think of you after they finish reading; if that's best done through a story, do it!",
