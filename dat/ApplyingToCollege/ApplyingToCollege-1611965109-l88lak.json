  "text": "My friend got into her dream school, a T10, during the early round and she has such a lovely personality lol. Sometimes I forget how much kinder a person she is than me, but then she has to go and remind me\ud83d\ude02\n\nThis one kid we know at school has always been very rude and snippy about college apps, constantly putting down other people\u2019s schools as not being prestigious enough. He was really sad a few days ago in class, so my friend asked him what was wrong, and he said he was deferred from one of his top choices. \n\nMe internally waiting for my friend to respond: *YESSS\ud83d\ude08 Unleash your dark sideeee\ud83e\udd2c Cut him down with all your fury and dance on his self-esteem\ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udffe Flex on him so hard\ud83d\udc41\ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc41*\n\nMy pure friend: \u201cI\u2019m sure it hurts now, but everything will be okay. You\u2019re really smart and talented. Even if this college isn\u2019t the one, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get into a wonderful school\ud83d\ude0a\u201d\n\nMe: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\ude27\ud83d\ude27 *Alright, I\u2019ll just escort myself to hell then...*",
