  "text": "For context: I\u2019m an international student, and the college I\u2019m applying to requires transcripts to be send to their office. My transcripts should be arriving by tomorrow to the school, but I haven\u2019t submitted my application yet. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any problem but just checking. Thanks!",
