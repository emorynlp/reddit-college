  "text": "Hi! This may be an odd question to ask but as I am an international student, I know very little about the concept of college mascots. Are they only for the sports team? Actually, I was searching for topics for my supplemental essays for one of the colleges I\u2019m applying to. Their mascot is really inspiring but I have no interest in sports or anything as such. Should I write about the mascot?",

      "text": "Not necessarily. Like you call all students at Purdue Boilermakers and all students at UIUC Ilini. But it depends on the school like you call a student at Yale a Yalian but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s their mascot. In general it is not just for sports, at least because the school want to get everyone into the school pride.",
