  "text": "So I applied ED and yesterday realized that I had forgotten to submit one of the financial aid forms into idoc. I submitted it late but also the school hadn\u2019t sent me an email notifying me about the missing form, idk why. I\u2019ve been seeing posts that say if a school asks you to add missing financial aid it\u2019s a good sign and so would the opposite work in my case? Is this confirmation I\u2019m getting rejected/deferred?",
