  "title:": "Will poor grades from my previous CC screw me?",
  "text": "To keep things brief, a while ago I took CC courses and got really poor grades for 3 semesters (shame on me, I know). Since then, I've moved to a new state and restarted my CC career in a comp sci program with hopes to get into a good school and I'm doing great. \n\nHowever, I'm worried those old grades will haunt me the rest of my life, and universities won't want me because of these bad grades I got in a program that has no relation to comp sci!\n\nShould I be worried? Or will my more recent good grades overshadow the old terrible ones? How much of an impact will those have on my future education prospects? It would suck for my poor performance in an unrelated program effect my future.\n\nThanks!\n\n(And IK I shouldnt have gotten those bad grades but what's happened happened, so please save your scolding lol)",
