  "text": "Im applying through the National College Match for Questbridge. But I think my computer might\u2019ve glitched out since its horrible quality and for BU despite clicking no, sent a yes for submitting test scores. For my SAT i got a 1170 (which i know isnt that good) but if my school report says that a 1085 is the average SAT for my school, would that be seen as above average for my school, or that I just hurt my chances greatly?",

      "text": "I would contact BU to confirm and see if they can disregard your SAT score. Your school's average test score is irrelevant, your score is still \\~ 250 points below BU's 25th percentile (based on [https://www.bu.edu/admissions/why-bu/academic-profile/](https://www.bu.edu/admissions/why-bu/academic-profile/)), and not something you will want them considering",
