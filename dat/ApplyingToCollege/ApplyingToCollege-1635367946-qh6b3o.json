  "text": "To put in context, I\u2019m an international student in highschool applying for college. I have about a 3.7 unweighted gpa (I\u2019m not sure since I take IB so the conversion is muddy) and some decent extracurriculars I think (school president, co-founding a youth organization, starter on JV women\u2019s basketball team, MUN, etc). \nI want to study something related to economics or urban studies, but preferably architecture related things as a minor. \n\nAll in all, I keep circling back to NYU or BU as my top choices for university, and with the early application deadline approaching in November 1st (which I\u2019m determined to apply in as it would increase my chances of getting in) I\u2019m at a loss for which one I want to apply to, since I can only apply to one. These schools are the only schools I feel like fit my personality and isn\u2019t too easy or too challenging of a place in terms of my gpa. I would also be in a thriving city with young people in it for either, which I would love, being an extroverted person growing up in a city. However manhattan would feel isolating and overwhelming I think, but Boston on the other hand would feel super cold and dull and grey which would be a culture shock since I\u2019m from a tropical country. I\u2019ve never seen snow. The alleged grade deflation terrifies me at BU, but NYU\u2019s lack of community at a city which isn\u2019t a university town is also daunting. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love both institutions and what they have to offer, but minuscule things like this keep having me jump between one or the other. I just need someone else\u2019s opinion on what they would pick, if they were in my shoes...",

      "text": "Being an NYU Alum, my views are obviously biased, but I would pick NYU again in a heartbeat... Boston is a nice \"town\" but New York is a \"city\" - and that pretty much sums up the whole difference between these two places... BU has around the same campus (or lack thereof) as NYU does, but given the right people, you'll find so much to do in New York - they're not exaggerating when they say that the whole city is your campus... In the end, see which school fits your personality and your needs, and give it a shot!",
