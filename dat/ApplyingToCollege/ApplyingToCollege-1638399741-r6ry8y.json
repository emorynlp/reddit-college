If the info you want to change can't be changed by you, then you can email ucinfo@applyucsupport.net \n\nThey can change little mistakes and you'll see the change on the UC application site. The colleges you applied to will see the new changes too, UNLESS they've already downloaded your app. If so, email each of them individually.",
