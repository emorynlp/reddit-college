I want to do business, so Wharton\u2019s business focus is ideal, but I appreciate how brown has the open curriculum and it would be nice not to worry about GPA, Columbia\u2019s Core isn\u2019t horrible plus it\u2019s located in NYC so that\u2019s a W, I honestly really like Princeton bc I prefer the suburbs to the city at least from a comfort standpoint, Yale is just cool and really pretty, Harvard is name brand, Cornell is literally between so many beautiful parks, and Dartmouth just seems really close knit and fun.",
