  "text": "Is it bad that all I do is work on college applications? \n\nMy friend got mad at me for just talking about my applications and how far along I am, and how I\u2019m stressed about the early deadline approaching, and she kinda indirectly asked me to shut up. \n\nShe asked me about my day after that but I didn\u2019t know what answer I should\u2019ve said because ALL I did was work on my essays. \n\nShe told me I\u2019ve become boring and all I do or talk about is college\u2026 I kinda felt bad but idk maybe what she\u2019s saying is true? I just feel like this is time to grind out with applications\u2026 \n\nDoes anyone else feel like this or is it just me?",
