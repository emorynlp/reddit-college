  "title:": "Ivy obsession will destroy you. I know someone facing his FIFTH gap year trying to get into HYPSM.",
  "text": "Y\u2019all I\u2019m not joking. This person in question is my mom\u2019s friend\u2019s son from China. He\u2019s now on his FIFTH GAP YEAR after getting rejected from all Ivies again. He\u2019s freaking 22 years old now or something.\n\nHis family is STILL obsessed with him going to HYPSM because he was top of his class in high school. He has had no job, no schooling, no anything since then except obsessing over applying to colleges every year. Only Ivies and a handful of T10s. Every. Year.\n\nI thought I\u2019ve been obsessed, but it\u2019s nothing compared to this. Really woke me up to the toxicity of Ivy obsession. He\u2019s literally put his life on hold and reliving every admissions cycle like it\u2019s Groundhog Day. And he\u2019s planning on doing it again!!",

I took a gap year this past year due to the pandemic, but I would never do one just to get into a school (since it's a crapshoot and keeps getting crappier as the years go on). Maybe he should be advised that, if there is no change to his application since it appears he isn't really using his gap year, he is no different to the AOs as being just another tryhard Asian student, but significantly older than the rest which only makes him even LESS appealing to AOs. Colleges do care about what you do with your time in the years you don't go to school, so he'd be an automatic reject next year if nothing changes, just so he knows.\n\nSomeone I knew from HS got rejected from all the Ivy's on Ivy Day. It was absolutely devastating and she had no other options since her safeties rejected her too (except her safety was literally JHU/ U Chicago so it was inevitable). Instead of being an absolute potato, she ramped up her resume, interned for the Democrats during the 2016 election cycle, and got into another T10.\n\nAnother person I know took a 4 year gap after his undergrad to work and get on-the-job experience in his field (Music) before applying to grad school, and ended up getting into the best grad school for that instrument in the entire country. \n\nNot sure from what I read, but is he also international? If so, that's just a triple-whammy of unfortunate circumstances in applying to US colleges. That question on most applications that ask you what you've been doing during your gap year is highly relevant and colleges take your answer seriously; I hope he makes a change this year and admissions go better next year for him. I wish him well in whatever he ends up doing, but this has to be exhausting by now.",

I heard of something called the lumiere research program that helps high school students or gap year students complete research.\n3. Get very high scores on the SAT and on his English language tests.\n4. Take courses on edX or Coursera in a field he wants to major in & pay for certificates. Write articles on his interests and publish them anywhere, even a blog.\n5. Apply Early Decision to a college that accepts many ED applicants, maybe Brown or Columbia. Gush about how much you love them. Let his recommenders write that he walked on air. Attend every virtual visit, every admissions counselor session, and make them remember your name.\n6.
