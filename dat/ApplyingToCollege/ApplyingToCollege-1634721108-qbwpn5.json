  "text": "looked on the page for the yale fee waiver and i was wondering if anyone has experienced this? \n\nit says that\n\n\u201cIf your family income and size fall within the criteria above, follow these steps to apply with a fee waiver:\n\nIf applying with the Common Application select \u201cYou can provide a supporting statement from a school official, college access counselor, financial aid officer, or community leader.\u201d You will not need to submit any supporting documentation.\u201d\n\nhas anyone who has applied to yale have an AO/someone from yale reach out? not trying to con the system or anything as family falls below the income level listed, but i was wondering if they check since it says no additional documentation is needed.\n\nthanks!",
