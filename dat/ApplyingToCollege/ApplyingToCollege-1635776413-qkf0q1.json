  "text": "I was talking to a friend today whose applying REA to Yale and asked about his ECs. besides the usual sports, his leadership positions, etc. he straight up admitted that he ran out of ECs toward the end and put that he WROTE A BOOK, but hasn\u2019t gotten it published. Like, he said he\u2019s been writing this entire novel throughout high school and just hasn\u2019t shared it with anyone. Surely colleges won\u2019t give this any weight bc it isn\u2019t verifiable? Or will they ask to see his book? he\u2019s aplying for a humanities major so i feel like this is a significant unfair advantage",

If he gets in, it would be because of other reasons and if he's denied, it probably be because of other reasons again (plausible deniability so there's no way to verify his statements).",

      "text": "For the most part none of your EC's are verifiable. If you claim you won certain awards which most likely the winners are published somewhere digitally then the admissions officers can check, but they probably won't waste their time. Remember they are really just looking at your application for a few minutes. Now lying on this section is not uncommon, but his lie seems somewhat absurd and this will probably flag some kind of concern with the officers. Despite what we like to believe that people that go to ivies have done incredible things it's usually not the case. No doubt they are good students, multifaceted, and have a cool story, but most haven't done something insane such as writing a whole novel to get it. This is coming from someone who's friends with people who got it in to Ivies and attend them. Now I know this seems very unfair and it is. You just need to be warned that once you get into college the unfair advantage thing is way more common than you realize especially at a prestigious university. My roommates parents wrote her essay and they are college professors. I know people that lied about their race/ethnicity. So many students go to feeder schools and have access to fancy college counselors. So just know that the application process is never really fair and that so many have an unfair advantage.",
