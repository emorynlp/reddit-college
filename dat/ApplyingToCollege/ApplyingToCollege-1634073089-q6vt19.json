  "text": "Hi there! I am about to be 24 and I have finally chosen to go back into school! I never got to go to college after graduating HS. Although, I did do running start (a program where you take college courses as a Junior and Senior in HS). I would like any piece of advice on how to get started back up into this. I am truly excited and would love to learn once again! Thank you so much \ud83e\udd72. \nI also live in WA if that makes it any easier to help pinpoint any advice.",

      "text": "Do you know what kind of engineering you want to do yet?  Use that and check for ABET accreditation to find out what options you have (there's a good program search on [https://www.abet.org](https://www.abet.org) to look for specific majors or to see what each school offers).\n\nDepending on the school and program you want, you may be better off doing CC first and transferring to the four year school.  If that's what makes sense for you, look at the degree map for the major that interests you and make sure that the CC classes you choose fill those requirements -- the public options in Washington will probably have articulation agreements that spell out exactly which classes match up.",
