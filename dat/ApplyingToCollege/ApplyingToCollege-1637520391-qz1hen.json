  "title:": "Why bash on UCs?",
  "text": "Whenever I see posts about what colleges someone is applying to, someone always comments about the financial aid aspect of the UC system and how they do not provide any aid to OOS. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but when you actually attend a UC school as an OOS, there are more options for financial aid than the initial perception you receive and that initial cost seen is cheaper than attending a private school anyways. The Ivy leagues are not \u201cfree money\u201d and give scholarships/ aid to whoever no matter your background. I\u2019m assuming most of the people in the subreddit are middle class to upper middle class- you will be most likely paying full tuition (75k+) to attend these types of universities whereas a UC would be (60k). This is still expensive, but at least it\u2019s 15,000 dollars cheaper initially. Here\u2019s a comment from Quora that inspired me to think about this: \n\n\u201cHere is the tricky-carnival barker \"free money pitch\" I'm getting tired of hearing from expensive school representatives:\n\"My private university is actually more affordable than the state school because of financial aid\"\nUnless you are dirt poor and have no guardians like the woman in the movie \"Homeless to Harvard\" and you are\nan absolute genius or won a big award like #1 in an international science fair project, you get loans. A loan is something you pay back. Private schools might give you a discount but that's like picking a Ferrari for $200,000 because the dealer said\nyou will get a discount of 10 percent.\nFinancial aid could mean a loan, a grant that doesn't have to be paid back, a discount or scholarship. They usually won't give you an aid package proposal until after you get in.\nAnd even if you take the aid (usually a loan that needs payback) you almost always have to pay something to\nthe school, eg $500 per month plus housing, food, transportation and books. If your family is in New York and you go to Stanford you have to pay for getting back\nand forth. If you drive for safety you should stay in hotels. Driving is not cheap.\u201d \n\nMy point is why warn people specifically about the UC system about their financial aid when a person will struggle even more financially at an Ivy League/ private school if coming from a middle class situation?",

          "text": "To put some numbers on this I used Harvard's NPC to calculate what my income would need to be (with family size = 4, kids in college = 1, state of residence = Texas) in order for the total cost of tuition at Harvard to equal the total cost of Berkeley (out-of-state).  I checked with assets = $0, $100k, $200k, $300k.\n\nI assume a total cost of $75,891 for Harvard and $72,128 for Berkeley.  Those numbers are from the \"Tuition and Fees\" tab at each school's page in the latest US News rankings.  So, Harvard would need to give ~$3800 in financial aid.  Cutoffs:\n\nAssets $0: Income $270k\n\nAssets $100k: Income $265k\n\nAssets $200k: Income $255k\n\nAssets $300k: Income $245k\n\nIn other words, with $100k in assets, Harvard is less expensive than Berkeley (out-of-state) if a family like the one I described earns less than $265k/year.  If that family earns more than $265k then Harvard is (marginally) more expensive.",

The UCs will not likely give aid to OOS or international students so it\u2019s good to help people who aren\u2019t familiar with the info. \n\nNon-resident cost of attendance is likely around $67k/year and that doesn\u2019t count the cost of travel to and from home during move in, move out, and winter break. So likely close to $70k. \n\nIf someone can afford that sticker price then it doesn\u2019t matter but if a family does qualify for aid, they are better off applying to private school and if it\u2019s an Ivy and they get in, they have a better chance of getting aid and even get the cost down lower than a UC non-resident price tag. \n\nIf a student has a solid state university that has decent job placement, it is not worth it to go to a UC unless it\u2019s for CS/STEM degree at Cal or UCLA if you want to go on name recognition. If it\u2019s a stretch, it\u2019s not worth it.\n\nAnd no one is bashing the UCs. That\u2019s crazy because most of the UCs are great schools. They\u2019re just stating the facts to help students who may not be aware.",

Yes, if your family is paying full price UCs may be cheaper, but for the 75K family, the cost of a private school will often be cheaper. And some financial aid packages for the more generous schools have no loans. But admittedly, most schools include loans as part of the package.\n\nApplicants should do due diligence and run the Net Price Calculator to at least get a ballpark figure. Many families are surprised to find they will qualify for aid.\n\nI do think that when someone brings up the lack of FA at UCs, they aren't bashing it. Rather the OP may simply be unaware that they will get zero aid from the UCs. There is no point in applying for a college you cannot afford.",

      "text": "Pretty much what the other posters said.\n\nEVERY. SINGLE. YEAR. there are posts in March from students who were overjoyed to be accepted to a UC and then ask us where they can find their financial aid package - it's sad to tell them that no, they're not going. So yeah, I post a lot of PSAs on this. It's not bashing, it's financial reality.\n\nIn fact, I was just thinking this morning that with the UC deadline approaching, it's time to post another PSA thread on the topic.\n\nUCs are a poor value out of state, with a few possible exceptions for particular programs.  Those \"donut hole\" families who are full pay even at privates, but struggle to afford full price, will get a better value from their own state university or colleges that offer substantial merit money. Those families who are not full pay at privates will typically get a much better deal from a top privates, which tend to be generous with need-based aid.\n\nAnd then there's this: [https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-11-08/editorial-uc-is-at-the-tipping-point-with-overcrowding](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-11-08/editorial-uc-is-at-the-tipping-point-with-overcrowding)\n\n>Unless you are dirt poor and have no guardians like the woman in the movie \"Homeless to Harvard\" and you are an absolute genius or won a big award like #1 in an international science fair project, you get loans.\n\nNot sure you understand financial aid. If you are *only* getting offered loans, then either (1) your calculated need is low/ability to pay high, or (2) the school does not meet full need.\n\n**PSA for those who may need financial aid:** public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more.\n\nRun the ***Net Price Calculator*** on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. (Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.)\n\nFederal student loan limits of 5500 for freshman year, totaling 27k over four years, are often reasonable amounts to borrow. Larger loans require a parent signature and are usually not reasonable amounts to borrow.\n\nIf the need-based estimate does not make the college affordable for your family, then look for merit scholarships. Often, the best merit scholarships are offered by the colleges themselves. Look for colleges that offer competitive merit scholarships according to their websites, where your scores and grades are over the 75th percentile for that college. Also look for colleges that offer big automatic merit scholarships to out-of-state students for your level of stats.",
