  "text": "Rejected from Stanford REA; I could\u2019ve wrote better. I needed this rejection to open my eyes to the fact that I\u2019m not of that intellectual caliber to go to a T20, let alone Stanford. Doing these college apps made me realize that I haven\u2019t done enough with my life. Knowing this, Im gonna drop every school except My state school and build up from there hopefully. I knew I was going get rejected and it still stung. \n\nGl to all on your apps. May you get into your schools.",

If you have your heart set on one, maybe grad school.  I'm in the medical field and I do not know what college my coworkers went to unless I went to school with them.\n\nPlease don't let this determine your self worth.",

But don\u2019t let the Stanford rejection be what discourages you if you still want to apply to those other T20s. If you would still gladly attend some of those colleges if accepted, shoot your shot. Who is Stanford, or any college, to determine your choices, future, intellect, self-worth, or anything about you? They aren\u2019t the measuring stick for any of those parts of yourself unless you let them be. It\u2019s hard right now when the rejection is fresh, and believing in your full potential is hard even when you haven\u2019t just been rejected. But give it a few days and think about it. If you want to shoot your shot at other top colleges, that\u2019s something you should choose for yourself, not something you let Stanford\u2019s admissions team determine for you.",
