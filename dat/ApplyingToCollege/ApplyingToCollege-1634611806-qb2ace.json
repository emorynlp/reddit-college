  "text": "Hey guys, sorry for these dumb questions and possible formatting issues (on mobile) but I was wondering if you have to report all the APs you took on your common app. I asked someone else and they said to omit the ones and twos but I thought you had to have them all listed even if they don't count as college credit. Also for the past scores you wish to report, can you just report your highest or do you have to report all of the tests you have taken since you would have to send in an official school report later?",

There is no requirement to report all APs.\n\n(If you were asking about SAT/ACT, there is only room for your highest scores.)",
