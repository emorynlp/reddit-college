  "text": "# I studied so fucking hard for the unit 3 test. I skipped apush, skipped school, neglected all my other ap classes to study. I took it, and I know i failed. I was out sick so I had to do it when the class was extremely noisy. Furthermore, she put me in a room where i could hear everyone without knowing the time. I was unsure about 1/4 of the MCQs, and skipped at least 1 and guessed on 2.\n\nNow I will get lower than average, do test corrections to get at max an 80% and land up with a 88% in the class with few ways to get an A because I need to get >98% on the final to clutch up in the end. You know what is worse? AP Bio is related to my major. I cant do this any more I hate it so much.\n\nDo you guys think ap bio or ap chem is harder?",

      "text": "I mean, 88 on an ap class isn't all that bad, the weighted GPA will certainly be better than this. As everyone in this subreddit said, having a B isn't going to ruin anything. Just try your best to bring up your GPA but there's no need to be so freaked out.\n\n Having taken AP Chem during normal year and AP Bio in covid year, Idk if I can came up with a fair comparison, but I did much less work in AP Bio than AP Chem and got about the same scores (both GPA and AP scores are similar). That difference may, or may not, be due to Covid.",
