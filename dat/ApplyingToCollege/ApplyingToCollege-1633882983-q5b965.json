Times when you felt your belief was being challenged. Like...you felt your identity was being split apart.\n\n2. A thing or moment you love\n\n3. Very memorable events that happened to you (prefably small events, something that may happen in your daily life)",

      "text": "Now would be a great time to stop thinking of yourself as an uninteresting person with nothing good going on! I think that describes 99% of most of us until normal stressors. Sometimes, reading other \"successful\" essays or helpful hints from admissions sources sparks a very small idea. Read some thoughtful ones...take a few short notes...then, take a walk, sleep on it, distance yourself from your personal pressure, then, write something/anything to get a paper full of words strung together. Then, you can shift everything around, upside down and sideways, eliminate, add and muscle it into something you are proud of. Even if this is for ED/EA 'ya got the time or perhaps Regular Decision is easier for you. Good Luck! You will be just fine.",

Three pieces of advice that are intentionally vague so take it as you will.\n\n1) Simplify the process, no need to complicate things (get something\u2014anything\u2014writtten down.\n\n1) Don't be afraid to stray away from the traditional (A0's read through thousands of applications, you need to make them slow down to get noticed. The only way to do so is writing about something unique\u2014something they haven't seen before).\n\n3) Have your parents, best friend, teacher look over your ideas, can they immediately tell that it's u/elonera 's work! Write ideas that are truly and authentically *you.*\n\nHopefully, this sparked some ideas! Good luck!",
