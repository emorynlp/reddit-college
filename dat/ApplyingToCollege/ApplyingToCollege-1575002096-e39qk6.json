It also meant I wasn't even considered for honors or scholarship money. So I consider it a rejection because it completely eliminated UF as an option. They didn't see me as a qualified student, which is in some ways like being rejected, it just wasn't a true rejection.\n\nI'm going to a different school now (UCF) that offered me admissions/scholarship/honors so I'm happy. Sorry that my original comment was misleading.",

Imagine being dense enough to believe a black person couldnt possibly get into a top tier college and are only there because they are black. Collegevine isnt college admissions officers, they are using falsehoods then if they believe you have a higher chance of getting into MIT if you are black when just in the 2016-17 year, 6% of the student body at MIT  were black. You are more likely to get in if you are a rich white/asian if anything.",

People here will give u graphs links and so much info. You\u2019re a junior so I don\u2019t blame you, but being black is being a URM which means higher chances of getting in. This does not mean that there aren\u2019t smart black people, this means that being smart as a black person gives u better chances of getting in. \u201c6% of the student body was black\u201d is an irrelevant statement. A better is to see the acceptance rate percent of black people who applied. Yes there are like 4x more Asians in the college, but also 20x Asians applied. So being black helps. Being ignorant to that is just dumb.",
