  "text": "I\u2019m not an URM (I\u2019m classified as white) but my ethnic background encompasses two groups that are historically associated with conflict, which has had a huge impact on my self-identity. I focus on that in many of my supplementals and pretty much everyone (teachers, guidance counselor, friends) says it\u2019s a great essay that is really unique.\n\nCan a diverse and unique ethnic background (not URM) help my chances?",
