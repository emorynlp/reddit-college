  "text": "hi everyone. i hope you\u2019re well and getting through this insane period of time in our lives. remember that none of us are alone \ud83d\udc9d\n\nanyway, i\u2019m doing early action for 2 of my schools and i feel like i always have a million things to do. i have two different kinds of portfolios, a bunch of essay questions, endless rec letter bullshit, activities resume, research on acceptance rates, fighting with the counseling dept. at my highschool to give me my transcripts, tops scholarship stuff, fafsa paperwork, agonizing over money and scholarships\u2026.\n\nit\u2019s just a lot to handle. and then i get into this shitty mindset thinking about what the whole point of all of this is- that i\u2019m applying to be a fucking TECHNICAL THEATER student, because i\u2019m too fundamentally stupid to be good at any other redeemable skill, and that the rest of my life is just going to be an endless search for gigs and paying off hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans forever. i\u2019m so aggravated that this time in my life, my senior year after basically not being an active member in society for 2 years, is nothing but endless anxiety and rumination about the future. \n\nsorry for rambling, i\u2019m just really frustrated and in a tough spot. any guidance is greatly appreciated <3",
