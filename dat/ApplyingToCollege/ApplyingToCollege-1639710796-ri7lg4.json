  "title:": "Reverse Chance for ED2",
  "text": "Got deferred from my ED1 school which kind of sucks but hoping ED2 works out more favorably. \n\nSo a little bit about me first:\n\nMajor: Econ\n\nGPA: 4W (strong upward trend) (no rank)\n\nCoursework: 8 AP\u2019s, 13 Honors, 1 CP\n\nSAT: 1530\n\nRecs: Obviously haven\u2019t read them but if I had to guess: 9/10 from APUSH, 7.5-8/10 from AP Econ, 6/10 from Counselor, 7/10 from internship coordinator\n\nEC\u2019s: \n1. Internship at AG\u2019s Office\n2. Team leader for a Bike MS charity \n3. Helped with a volunteering service in India \n4. Volunteered at a local food pantry during the summer \n5. Head of the build team for my robotics league \n6. Helped tutor kids at my school\u2019s chess league\n7. Member of my school\u2019s entrepreneurship club \n8. Extracurricular music lessons (7 years) \n\nAwards (probably my killer):\n1. Some local school honors\n2. A local university\u2019s honors\n3. AP Scholar with Honors\n\nCommon App: How I worked through a challenging piano piece and my motivations behind it. (8/10 imo)\n\nAs for the college itself:\n\nLocation: In the city would be nice although I\u2019m basically open to anything at this point.\n\nDiversity: Doesn\u2019t need to be extremely diverse but not too homogenous either. \n\nCost: Money isn\u2019t an issue.\n\nHelp would be appreciated",
