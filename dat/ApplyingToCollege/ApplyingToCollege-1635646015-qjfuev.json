  "title:": "Common App Application question",
  "text": " I recently just submitted my common app application for 4 colleges but later found out that there was a whole section dedicated to testing. I clicked on the question that asked me if I wished to self-report my scores because I was going test-optional and assumed that section was only asking about the SAT. I have only taken 2 IB SL exams, Psychology and Math AI which I received a 6 and a 5 on. However, I also have 3 Hl exams, 1 SL, and 2 Ap exams to take in May which I also could not *report*. I hope to pursue a degree in business. Please respond quickly. The deadline is in 2 days!!",
