  "title:": "A rant - realizing that I fucked up in HS: average kids with average stats rise up",
  "text": "I\u2019m breaking down atm and just coming to terms with the fact that since I\u2019m an average student with average stats, I\u2019m barely gonna get scholarships and merit aid at schools I apply to which means we have to pay a lot. I\u2019m also low income so that doesn\u2019t help. Why couldn\u2019t I have just thought about the future in freshman year, taken more AP classes, realized how much weight my grades really have, and constantly grinded to get a better SAT and GPA to get into schools I want with little debt? I just feel like I\u2019m making even more of a burden for my parents financially because I\u2019m a shitty student even if I tried my best. Can\u2019t turn back the clock now. Fuck my life lol\n\nedit: okay wow this unexpectedly blew up, I can\u2019t really reply to everyone but thank you guys for the support and advice.",

Not bad but not a brag and what I\u2019d consider below average. You can get into most schools as an average student with average scores. Just write a good essay. \n\nAnd like others said, 100% apply to community colleges for your first two years. In Michigan we have Oakland University (and Oakland Community College) OU is really cheap and still holds a meaningful degree.

              "text": "hey! before i start, i hope your freshman year has been fun and enjoyable.\n\ni recommend being active in school, like joining clubs (especially community service ones) and sports. it's an easy way to make friends, and bond with other students in different schools. try everything out, and see which one really speaks to you. it's okay if you don't like it, but don't feel pressured to stay in just because it looks good to colleges. also, try to get a leadership role in one of those clubs or become captain/ leader in one of those sports to show your dedication.\n\ntake ap classes and keep your grades high! not only does it boosts up your gpa, you also learn so much about the subject. for example, taking ap biology made me realize that i wanted to pursue toxicology and biochemistry in college. take ones that interests you because you'll gain more out of it, but make sure to not overload yourself. \n\nbe proactive in the summer! enjoy your summer, but don't forget to finish any summer work. also, take college classes if your school allows it or find internships related to your passion(s.) you should try to find a part-time around 11th to 12th grade if your parents allow it. gotta pay off those fees somehow lol. summer of 11th grade, you should also look at what colleges you want to go to and the application requirements. get an idea of what you want to major in too.\n\nparticipate more in class! im extremely introverted so i didnt, but it's something i really wish i did. class goes by quicker when you're actively paying attention, and you also learn more by participating. they'll also remember your contributions to the class, so it'll be easier to ask them for letters of recommendations in the future. if youre struggling in class, dont be afraid to ask for tutoring or extra help\n\nstart prepping the act/ sat next! take a practice test to find your weaknesses, then target them using practice books and guides. if youre thinking of taking the sat, i recommend [1600.io](https://1600.io) and College Panda books. i have some resources for the sat, so hmu in the future when you need them\n\ntake care of yourself! high school is extremely stressful, and sometimes mental health gets neglected. if youre feeling stressed and overwhelmed, take a break. go for a walk, chat with friends, ride your bike, etc. put yourself first. also, make friends with people who will support you and wont bring you down. you deserve the best. also, dont forget to communicate with your parents. they'll always support you. (there are some exceptions) \n\nbest of luck to you in the future!",

Ik the admissions process is messed up but you\u2019ll hopefully get into the school you\u2019re ready to be at. Maybe challenge yourself there and then try to transfer to another \u201cbetter\u201d school later.

It helps being really good at standardized tests, but the associates helped me get into 4-year university where I graduated with a 3.8 gpa.

      "text": "I know the feeling. I was homeschooled from Kindergarten to 12 grade. I got a crappy SAT score (1060) and since I knew I was going to community college, I didn't care to take it again to get a better score. I also never took any AP classes because I already had trouble dealing with the previous normal workload and it really wasn't important for graduation. What I didn't realize is that taking AP classes could've saved time in knocking out some of the classes I had to take in my major during community college. I graduated \"highschool\" with a GPA of 3.5.\n\nDid it really affect me during community college? No, not at all. I was able to breeze through my college classes and graduate two years after I started. I graduated community college with a GPA of 3.9, made Dean's List in all four of my semesters, got into PTK, and am now working on applying to three different colleges and a transfer scholarship.\n\nMy point is, while if may be daunting and my situation is very unusual and probably not a good example, it can be done. You can have a second chance.\n\nHope this helps :)",

      "text": "Work in admissions at 4-year uni. Here's all the pro tips:\n\n1. if you can't get into your college of choice, go to a community college in the fall and transfer in during the spring. Enrollment will be down and there are spots reserved for transfers to meet metrics. You'll still have to meet entrance requirements, but you won't have half the competition. You'll also save a shitload of money and can cram a bunch of prerequisite courses. You must get a 4.0 here to make your life easier.\n2. there are an absolute fuckload of small scholarships you can get. I got $100/semester for four years for being 6'3\" and another one-time $250 for being left-handed.  Your department will also undoubtedly have scholarships you can apply for. Rich old donor folk are dying to give you money, you just have to go look for it and not be above writing a \"beggar's proposal\" essay.\n3. low income definitely helps you as far as financial aid is concerned. Tons of shit exists for this specific reason, from tuition reductions to scholarships and full on waivers. Put on some nice clothes and a smile and go finesse the old women working at the financial aid office to get yourself some good info on how to proceed.\n4. two words: payment plans. Most universities have them and can break your leftover costs out over the semester. It's a hell of a lot easier to pay $500 three times over 16 weeks than it is to jump off $1500 all at once. I think we charge a $10 service fee to do such.\n5. if for some reason you don't meet entrance requirements, it is possible to apply for \"provisional enrollment\" which basically just means somebody watches your grades and if you dip below an agreed amount you get booted. Stupid, since any normal student gets the same treatment, but it can get you in if you're in a pinch. Usually this requires writing a lengthy appeal essay to a committee that then meets and discusses your situation, maybe even bringin you for an interview.",

And being slightly below where you could\u2019ve been doesn\u2019t count you out from every school\u2014a little luck and a good essay goes a long way. \n\nLooking back, I kinda wish I could\u2019ve been more average bc it would be less stressful all that time and less stressful now, where I feel like I HAVE to go to a top school to make those sacrifices worth it. It\u2019s hard for me to really look at lower ranked colleges cuz I think of how I\u2019d be letting 12 years of top tier work \u201cgo to waste\u201d, and I know that complaining sounds super privileged (it kinda is) but just remember the grass is always greener on the other side. People who worked harder to be more than average could probably go to the same schools that average kids go to and have an amazing time there, but instead they feel trapped into taking a harder challenge just for the chance of benefits in the future. \n\ntl;dr: your bed is made now and you benefitted from going through school with more ease and less stress, at least now you have freedom to go to an elite school or just a local one and still feel great about the decision.

If you ignore the stigma behind it you'll realize its probably better to wait two years to go to a school you would really like (and receive the same exact diploma that everyone who went for four years will be attending, future employers/grad schools won't know you went to community college) and it's better than going to a school you don't want to go to.",
