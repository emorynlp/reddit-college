Some colleges like Santa Clara University said that is required otherwise they won\u2019t even look at your application unless you qualify for a waiver (which means your first language is English or if you have attended a high school where english is the language of instruction). \n\nOther colleges are more flexible and have this policy of conditional admission and can give you an acceptance but you need to enroll first to English as a second language.",
