  "text": "I auditioned for and was accepted into a selective extracurricular music group last year. However, because of the pandemic, it was canceled, and we never actually got to sing or perform together\u2014in other words, I never actually participated in the group even though I qualified. So I have 2 questions:\n\nCan I still list this as an award and state the circumstances in additional info, or should I leave the group out altogether?\n\nI got the chance to audition for this group through my school choir. Should I mention in the EC description for choir that I qualified for this group, or should I limit that to stuff I actually did?",

          "text": ">1. (postponed)\n2. (declined)\n3. or (forthcoming)...include the parentheses\n\nNone of these are true for my situation. It wasn't postponed because the audition process occurs again each year, so I'm not guaranteed acceptance again this year. I didn't decline acceptance; the group itself was canceled for the year, so no one got the chance to accept or decline. And it's not forthcoming, since I won't know the results of my audition this year in time for applications so I don't know if I'll have done it by the time I go to college.",

I'd frame it as an \"award\" in the sense you passed a selective audition process for the assemble. But how do you describe the other choir stuff? You can PM too if you don't want to publicly share.",
