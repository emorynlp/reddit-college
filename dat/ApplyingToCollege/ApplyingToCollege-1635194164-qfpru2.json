  "text": "Hello,\n\nI have a high GPA, great rigor, but not so great SAT scores.  I'd like to try for some test optional schools out of state, I live in Florida, but obviously being OOS one of my biggest issues would be financial aid.  \n\nDo you know of any test optional schools that have decent merit scholarships that don't require scores for the aid?  I've applied and gotten accepted to University of Alabama, we are awaiting the aid package.",
