  "text": "I talked about my relationship with perfectionism\u2014 more specifically my struggles. I attempted to try and become this \u201cperfect\u201d person to not be like my father. He abused me, and my mother, took me to his drug deal, etc\u2026(I gave kind of a vivid insight into all of this), and because of all this, I did everything I could to make sure I would never be like him. I started having problems with my weight, and became bulimic, because I thought to be perfect, I had to look perfect: my dad also said I was fat all the time. But anyway, this was a big part of my childhood, and when he left in 4th grade, I was left with all this damage. \n\nAs time progressed, and I grew up, I realized I didn\u2019t have to be perfect; it\u2019s unattainable. I started to only reinforce positive self affirmations, and prevent negative thinking. But the main thing I said was that I turned perfectionism into passion. I embraced a passion in politics and international relations, and it erased perfectionism. Basically that\u2019s the run down. I took a negative, and I made it into a positive journey. But I touched on a lot of things you apparently shouldn\u2019t put in a college essay. what do you guys think? I would really appreciate your advice!",

      "text": "I could be reading too much into your post, but what concerns me isn't your essay topic, but that you mentioned that you intentionally wrote it to turn a negative into a positive. You have a compelling and difficult story - it sounds like you've faced real struggles - but that story won't mean anything if it isn't authentic. If you are telling the story to lead to a place that isn't really where you are at, that will be obvious to someone reading it.",
