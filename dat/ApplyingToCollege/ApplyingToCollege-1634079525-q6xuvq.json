      "text": "First check each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll *\u2013 self-reporting is faster*. \n\nOther colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission. Official reports from College Board can take anywhere from a few days to two weeks. Not sure about ACT.",
