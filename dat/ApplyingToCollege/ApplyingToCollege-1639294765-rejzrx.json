  "title:": "How important are first semester senior year grades?",
  "text": "I am a senior in a competitive highschool in New York and I was wondering if a dip in 1st semester senior year grades will lower my chances of getting into T20\u2019s and Ivy League colleges. From Grades 9 - 11, I got 1 B, however, due to taking more challenging classes (taking 7 AP\u2019s) than I could handle, I will be getting 2 B\u2019s in my senior year. I calculated that my unweighted GPA will be around a 3.93. I plan on studying mechanical engineering as my major. I have taken all the relevant science classes: AP Chem, AP Physics 1, AP Physics C, AP CS A, AP Bio, however I will be receiving a B in AP Physics C. For RD schools, will a drop in grades hurt my chances, especially in AP Physics C Mechanics? Will they see the rigor in my courses?",

      "text": "it won\u2019t hurt at all. most colleges are quite familiar with senioritis etc. \n\nAnd given the rigor you\u2019ve taken (7 APS) it\u2019s not uncommon for a slight dip, a few B\u2019s, to occur. \n\nWith that in mind, you must realize a 3.93 GPA is super competitive & your classes, for the most part, exemplify your spike in mechanical engineering.\n\nI\u2019d say you\u2019re fine.",
