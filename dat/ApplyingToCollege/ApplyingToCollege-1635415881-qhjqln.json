  "text": "Hey! Would everyone please help me out.\n\nUPenn says their deadline for fin aid application is Nov1. The steps are: submit css and then after the submission of the CommonApp application, submit docs to PFAS through the applicant portal.\n\nDoes it mean that Nov 1 is the deadline only to the CSS profile, if they say that an applicant can access PFAS only after the commonapp submission? \n\nHope you got me. Thank you in advance\n\nPS i am an international applicant",
