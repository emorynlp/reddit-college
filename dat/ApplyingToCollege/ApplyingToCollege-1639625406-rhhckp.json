  "text": "My kid is interested in pure mathematics undergraduate program. He has good grades so far. Bit worried about opportunities in getting internship and jobs with just Mathematics. Any comments on this? appreciate on recommendations to other major/minor that my kid can take in addition to Math major?",

      "text": "It's not wise to think of college mainly in terms of job placement. That said, pure mathematics has some of the highest job placement rates and mid-career earnings. Rather than internships, math students should find research opportunities that will prepare them for academic or professional training at the graduate level. If a student does want to pursue industry/employment immediately after undergrad, there are many opportunities for math students in government and with tech firms.\n\nCommon minors for math are physics and computer science. A math major is difficult enough by itself, so I wouldn't assume that any student should get a minor/minors.",

If you think directly in the box it will cause difficulties as the first thing you think of physicist or mathematician is a long haul trig with a PhD resulting in 10+ years of college education. But if you think sideways a bit there are plenty of options available to you. As far as money is concerned it does skew [elite](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/search/?cip4=2701&cip4_degree=c&cip4_degree=a&cip4_degree=b&fos_salary=70000..150000&page=0&sort=completion_rate:desc&toggle=fos)(listed by graduation rate).

Secondary teaching,  academia, actuarial stuff, data science, or just plain software.  If the latter, would want to supplement with some CS courses.  Could also go on to law or medical school.  Or finance.  Or possibly a graduate econ program if he also studied some econ as an undergrad.",

      "text": "A common path for a lot of math majors at my college: major in math and plan on going to grad school, but also double major in CS in case that plan changes, since the abstract problem solving taught in math makes learning CS relatively easy by comparison, and there\u2019s often substantial overlap between the major requirements, so the double major isn\u2019t that intense. Then getting some sort of programming/software engineering job is usually feasible, since math majors usually learn how to think better than the average CS major. \n\nThere are a number of threads over on r/math asking about career paths for math majors outside of academia\u2014maybe searching through those could also be helpful.",
