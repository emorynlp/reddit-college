  "text": "200 characters max. I\u2019m having trouble figuring out how I should answer this short take. This is the first year that Yale is using the prompt so I can\u2019t find any examples online. How broad, narrow, serious, quirky, conflicting, complimentary should my answer be? I know it can be any of these and they want variety, but I still don\u2019t know where to start.\n\nFull prompt: \u201cYale students embrace the concept of \u2018and\u2019 rather than \u2018or\u2019, pursuing arts and sciences, tradition and innovation, defined goals and surprising detours. What is an example of an \u201cand\u201d that you embrace?\u201d",

Who knew Yale would be following in our school's footsteps. :P\n\nIn all seriousness, they're limiting it to 200 characters?  That doesn't give you much room to play with.  You really may have to go with something along the lines of what /jayphoward suggested.",
