  "text": "Hi, so to give you a little context I am an international student from Egypt and I want to get a scholarship so I was hoping that you could guide me to applying to college, or maybe if there is a wiki that I can read that will help me maybe.\n\nPS: I want to know how to do a correct college search I think that is the most important along with the other things that I am supposed to know if you may please.\n\nI would really appreciate the help, thanks in advance.",
