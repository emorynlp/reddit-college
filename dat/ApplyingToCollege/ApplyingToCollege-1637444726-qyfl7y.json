  "text": "I applied very early to Pitt but forgot to check off my interest in the GAP for the School of Medicine. However, I contacted admissions before the deadline, and they said that since I got in for pre-med, I would be considered for the GAP. \n\nThat was at the beginning of this month. I'm very worried I'm not being considered because I've already gotten a scholarship notification, but no notification for the GAP. \n\nOn some threads, I've seen people who have applied at the same time or after me who have already gotten in. I'm so scared. I'm so scared that I've worked so hard to not even be considered.",

They said those who move on will get notified by dec 15 on their website. I\u2019m not too worried bc pitt is a safety and I should be getting in but you shouldn\u2019t as well",
