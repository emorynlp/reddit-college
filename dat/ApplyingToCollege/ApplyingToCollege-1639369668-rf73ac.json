  "title:": "You're allowed to have a mundane essay topic!",
  "text": "I see sooo many jokes and references on this sub about difficult life experiences making for \\~good essay topics.\\~ I know often these are just memes, but I can't believe the smart ppl on here haven't gotten the message yet that **u do not need to have endured personal hardship** to have a strong essay! \n\nIn fact, as an admissions counselor, I often find that these topics are not useful for me trying to get to know **you**. Your grandma died? She sounds like a wonderful lady but I can't admit her to my college. Your parents are going through a messy divorce? I don't want to read your diary! Lol I know this sounds harsh but do you feel me? Personal tragedy \u2014\u00a0especially when it's mostly related to **other** people in your life \u2014\u00a0can distract from the purpose of the essay, which should be abt communicating who **you are** and what you'll bring to a college campus. \n\nI remember as a high schooler myself thinking that my essay was going to be a weak point in my application because I'd lived a boring, relatively privileged life. I totally get why you think that. But I promise you: colleges just want smart/curious/insert-school-culture-specific-adjective-here students. We do not need you to prove that you've endured something difficult. You're 18 years old! It's fine if your life hasn't gotten hard yet! :)",

          "text": "I'm a sucker for essays that emphasize curiosity \u2014\u00a0like just talking about your interest in some topic & why you're into it! Or if you haven't zeroed in on a particular passion yet (totally fine!), I love a good essay about just being the best version of yourself / what's special about your personality / how you'll contribute to a college community. I know it's kind of meta to bring up college itself in your college essay, but honestly I think it's great \u2014\u00a0the people who work in admissions are weirdly obsessed with college, so we love to get excited with you about it lol",

I would like to know your take on my personal statement (Common App \"main\" essay), I believe it is tangentially related to the \"curiosity\" response you gave another commenter. Would it be okay if I PM you? I'm not planning to share the essay itself, ask you to chance me, or otherwise take a lot of time.\n\nAlso, I like your username :D",
