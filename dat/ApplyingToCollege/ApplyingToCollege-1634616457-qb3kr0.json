The easiest way to know is to call the admissions office and make sure. \n\nAlso realize the FAFSA is necessary to get federal student loans, no matter your family\u2019s income. That may be another reason to submit it. \n\nMy feeling is that you\u2019ll be fine not submitting it, but double check to make sure.",
