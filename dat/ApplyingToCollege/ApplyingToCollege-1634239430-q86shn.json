  "text": "Throughout my life I\u2019ve been told that I\u2019m a failure, and now it seems that they are right. College admission was the last grasp for me to prove them wrong and I fucked that up- it\u2019s all just gonna be downhill from now on. It\u2019s even worse that I am at a college in a consortium with all other neighbouring colleges WAY better than mine. Sure, I try to transfer away, but my bipolar brain just wouldn\u2019t work and struggling to get all As, which is not even a guarantee admission cuz they are \u201cholistic\u201d\u2026. how the fuck do I even make time for that?\n\nTwo years of suffering is just too much.",

If you know you want a specific job, you could try to get internships or just hands on experience in the field and that would be much more valuable than you transferring to a \u201cbetter\u201d college",

          "text": "it kinda does define you.\n\nFor any remotely famous company, your alma mater is the first filter of your resume. You aren\u2019t even given a chance to demonstrate your ability. And, this is even becoming more ubiquitous in tech industries, which are supposed to be the ones that don\u2019t care about this, let alone others. More so when you are an international student trying to immigrate: \u201cwhy the fuck should I hire a foreigner if you aren\u2019t top of the tops?\u201d (This goes the same for internships)\n\nAdditionally, the connections you make at prestigious university are irreplaceable.\n\nIt\u2019s just desperation and hopelessness for my future all around.",

              "text": "It is true that going to a prestigious college is advantageous, for connections. But you can get connections other ways as well; cold emails, previous internship boss, etc. If they filter resumes, then make your resume into what they want to see, you don\u2019t need to include that you\u2019re a foreigner on your resume unless they specifically say so, which they pretty much never do. The only thing that can give it away is maybe your name, but that\u2019s also normal because the US has people of different races and naming culture is different. \n\nThe reason why I say an internship could be more valuable than spending years trying to get to a prestigious college is that if you have an internship, it shows that you can get work done. Just because you took classes doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you can do it on the job. Employers want a guarantee you can do the job so they hire you. They\u2019re not gonna spend time interviewing every applicant cause that\u2019s not possible, so another way you can show them is your previous experience. Prestigious college kids also have this, passion projects, extracurriculars relating to the job, so it\u2019s not just their prestige that gets them the job. All of prestigious college students have a decked out resume just from the amount of extracurriculars they had to do in high school or college to get into the school in the first place and this also transfers to the job hunt. Don\u2019t think that prestigious college is the only route and put all your eggs into one basket. You can improve your professional profile in other ways.",
