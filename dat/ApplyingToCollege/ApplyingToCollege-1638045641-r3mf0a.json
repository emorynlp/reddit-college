      "text": "From your other post, it looks like you are out of state and need financial aid. PSA, public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more.\n\nCal States do not offer need-based aid to out of state students; CSU cost of attendance varies, mid 30s to upper 40s, depending on which CSU. (UCs do not offer need-based aid to out of state students either, cost 65-70k.)\n\nRun the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.",
