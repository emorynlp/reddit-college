  "text": "Dear Admissions Office of MIT,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for the opportunity to consider my application for admission with the first year class entering in Fall 2022. I have carefully reviewed your rejection and supporting scholarship, and despite your schools fine record and accomplishments, I am unable to commit to the University of Masstech.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease do not consider this to be a reflection of your college's academic ability but rather an indication of th overwhelmingly large pool of schools and my inability to confirm offer to every qualified college. I am disappointed I could not accept more of the outstanding universities which offer me a rejection this year. I hope you understand the difficulty in selecting such a university from the many qualified colleges in this years' offer pool.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI appreciate your interest to me and the time and effort involved in considering my application. If I can be of any further assistance, please feel free to write or call. I will be happy to help you with any further plans. I wish you every success in your future educational endeavors. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccordingly, I extend my sincere regrets to reject your rejection for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSincerely,\n\nMost painful seniors.",
