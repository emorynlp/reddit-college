  "text": "I\u2019ve been surrounded by pretentious people all my life. And when I came back from virtual school I met one of my friends. Let\u2019s call him Bob. Bob has multiple awards, probably #1 in the nation for some math competitions and basically unanimous valedictorian. I was talking to him and was like what would you do if your Val. He was like \u201cI\u2019m gonna play Brawlstars\u201d and I was like \u201creeally ??? nothing special?\u201d and he was like\n\n \u201cNah. It\u2019s literally just a title. What 3 mins after we all graduate and go home in our seperate cars, it won\u2019t mean a thing. I just work hard enjoy life and the memories that come with it. I have a beautiful girlfriend, I got good friends and I\u2019m happy, and that\u2019s all I care about right now\u201d. I was literally in awe like it\u2019s a change of perspective when you hear people brag about everything or being compared to other people who basically just ignite these rivalries. \n\nMan some people are just so fucking humble it\u2019s amazing",

      "text": "This person may indeed be humble, however his words to you were somewhat dubious in reality; since it is a big deal and many people will probably care later in life that he was the top student at your school and there is -0- chance that he did not work to be just what he became -- which necessarily means it meant a lot to him.   Your buddy is also smart.  I always hypothesized that the super successful and accomplished are often the most righteous.  It is cynical, yes, but it is usually the person that falls a bit short or accomplished a lot but others don't know it that tend to be more pompous about their laurels. If you have a great deal, it costs you nothing to be generous or humble or modest.  I look at the athletes after their wins who say, \"I thank my teammates and my mom and dad and my coach and my savior\" etc... but they don't thank them when they lose, necessarily.  Its very hard to be a great and accomplished student without entering into competitions and taking courses and managing your schedule so that you can be number 1.  What I am saying is that it takes planning to be number 1 at anything, it does not spontaneously happen, you need to want it.  For example, in my childrens' HS, for you to be at the very top of the class, you have to take enhancements outside of the public school system (summers or online programs), so you can be eligible for honors and AP classes earlier in your HS career.  If you don't do that, you have -0- chance of being the top student and even if you get all As and A+ 's it will be difficult for you to reach top 10% in your class.  OK, back to you friend, it was nice what he said to you.  My guess is that he knows it was hard to do what he did and he set out to do it and my guess is that he is pretty psyched that he actually did it and knows it is a big deal..",
