  "text": "I started an EC towards the beginning of 8th grade, did it through 8th grade and the summer and kept doing it until halfway through ninth grade. Obviously the ninth grade portion is fine to put on my app, but is it ok to also include the 8th grade and summer aspects/accomplishments of the EC? Just mentioning the ninth grade stuff would be like cutting it in half and I think it\u2019d make it seem incomplete. If I include the entire time frame of this EC should I note in the additional info section about how some of it was done in 8th/the summer too?",

      "text": "confused as to why this is a special case. you did an activity during 8th and part of 9th grade and then stopped? I was under the impression colleges want to see activities that you've continued with through your senior year, so unless this is really some crazy impressive EC I don't understand why you would want to include it.",
