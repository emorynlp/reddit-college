  "text": "My school doesn't do GPA, and the requirements to get into Kelley are given in terms of only GPA and SAT score. My SAT score exceeds the requirements by a big margin but i can't tell if I passed the GPA requirements since I don't have a GPA. So would I need to petition to get direct admission?",

My daughter applied test optional, so we knew she needed to appeal.  \n\n\u201cIf you submitted all of your application materials by November 1 and meet the admissions criteria, you\u2019ll hear from us four to six weeks after you are admitted to IU. Students will not be notified if they have not been offered direct admission.\u201d",
