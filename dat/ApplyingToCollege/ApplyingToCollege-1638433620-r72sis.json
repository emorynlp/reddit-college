  "text": "Super freaking sad right now, I know I shouldn't have waited till the last twenty minutes to turn it in but I thought that would be enough time and I had to finish an essay. My wifis really slow and decided to crash right then, and then the site wouldn't load and process it. I pressed the button literally on the minute but it didn't go through. Is there any possibility that they'll accept it? I sent an email and I'm calling tomorrow but I just don't know what else to do.",
