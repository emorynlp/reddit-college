  "text": "I just submitted by UNC chapel hill EA application. Not 10 minutes later I get a notification that apparently my teacher gave me a 0 on a 100 point project we had been doing. I emailed her and I'm pretty sure it will get worked out but my application is gone. I currently have a 50 in the class and with fall break i doubt that will be changed till late next week. Will UNC see that grade?",
