  "text": "is there really a benefit to doing REA at stanford? should i just go for it and hope for the best? i'm really anxious about which school to choose, i'm not personally the most amazing student that has a lot of national recognition etc but i've done pretty well and earned straight As, UW 3.98, took a rigorous courseload of APs, done ECs related to my passions, etc. it's just that this stanford has always been my dream school and i really just see myself going here. \n\nI am an Asian female, so i'm not sure if that will put me at a disadvantage since there's probably a lot of other asian ppl like me applying..\n\nif any of y'all are applying REA to stanford, lmk so i don't feel alone in doing this lmaooo",

      "text": "i already applied rea to stanford but from what i\u2019ve heard they don\u2019t give preference to early applicants as a majority of the class is accepted during reg decision. i applied because it\u2019s my dream school also and i wanted to up my chances as much as i could, but the decision is ultimately up to u and j be sure to recognize that a large amount of ppl accepted rea are already legacies or recruited athletes so that increase the acceptance rate also. best of luck to u whatever u decide to do!",
