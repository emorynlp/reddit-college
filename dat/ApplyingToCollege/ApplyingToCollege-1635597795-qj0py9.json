  "text": "is 2 symposiums, 2 research projects related to desired major, 1 research internship with a vvv renowned research fellowship but not related to desired major a research spike? ofc i have other ecs but does this create a spike? idk (also by rd i will have a research olympiad, hopefully a finalist)",

              "text": "Point being: it's highly subjective and there is no right answer.  It's not like if you do an 8.6 it's \"not a spike\" and is meaningless w.r.t. admissions but if you do 9.0 it \"qualifies\" as a spike and all of a sudden it's super-meaningful.\n\nThe more you achieve the more meaningful it is.  Yes, the graph of achievement-to-admissions-benefit probably isn't linear, but nobody knows exactly where it starts to turn exponential.",

Colleges want to see the supporting coursework for that spike ( if you are writing a paper on quantum physics, they expect you have done AP Physics C with A grade). If you can get paper published in reputed journal with peer review, that is even great. Just one outstanding or well read work is enough for a spike.",
