Everyone\u2019s personal experience is different, but the common thread is that it has limited students in ways that make the other essays MORE important - not the essay about \u201chow the pandemic has effected you\u201d or whatever. That\u2019s where you explain the shift in responsibilities or whatever struggles you have faced. That is just an antidote to be considered, but of course it\u2019s not getting you into your college of choice.",
