  "text": "Hi! These are some of the schools I'm interested in, but I want to know more about them. I want to go into either biotechnology or biochemistry. What are the campuses like? Are people there friendly to foreigners? Good teachers? How hard is it to get into these schools? Anything really. All I really know is about their admissions requirements and which programs they have.",

Despite a higher acceptance rate in paper, they receive much fewer applicants than many schools in the states. \n\nMost of the courses are taught in German or French as well, so that is a consideration to be had.",
