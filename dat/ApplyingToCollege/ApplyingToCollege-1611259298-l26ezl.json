  "title:": "Delaying National Decision Day",
  "text": "As it stands, National Decision Day will be on May 1st this year, just like it\u2019s been every other year. But this year isn\u2019t just like every other year. \n\nMany of us seniors on A2C will be waiting until the first or even second week of April to have our admissions decisions finalized. This means that we\u2019ll have almost two fewer weeks to decide where we\u2019ll be attending. Plenty of us will only learn about our financial aid in late April, if not May. Adding to that, COVID restrictions will have been in place for over a year by then, limiting our opportunities to visit and envision ourselves at any of the colleges we\u2019re considering. Why is it that we\u2019re expected to make our decisions quicker than ever in a time when we need the most support?\n\nI believe National Decision Day should be delayed to mid-May. I understand that colleges need a relatively early deadline to deal with waitlists and enrollment, but giving us just three weeks to make the biggest decision of our lives thus far adds unnecessary pressure to seniors who have borne the brunt of the pandemic throughout college app season. \n\nProfessionals, applicants, college students, high schoolers, what do you all think of this?\n\nedit: I see some schools are delaying the commitment deadline to May 3rd. That\u2019s just 2 days. Point still stands.",

Personally tho, idk anyone who goes to any of the schools I\u2019m applying to except for one. Yelp can barely decide if I\u2019ll like a restaurant, since half of the reviews are usually very good reviews and half are very bad. Also, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019d trust the opinion of a bunch of people I don\u2019t know when I could just go see for myself. For example, I thought UIUC (my state school) was just smack dab in the middle of a million cornfields, and it is, but after going there I also saw the small but rather cool urban area adjacent to it. So I might go there, idk. I\u2019m not saying visiting is a necessity, but I think because it\u2019s not a decision to take lightly, there\u2019s something to be said for becoming as knowledgeable as possible about the different potential options.",

Before deciding what schools my daughter would apply to, we watched a lot of videos on each one attended virtual info sessions and all the school marketing stuff sounds the same. Every school fosters innovation blah blah. We tried to break away from official school stuff and find students own dorm tours or day in the life videos. If i had to watch another vapid girl put on her makeup and walk around campus with the camera pointed at herself so you couldn't even see the school I was going to scream. Thankfully my daughter wanted to stay local and I grew up and went to college here and have some firsthand knowledge of the different schools to help her differentiate.",
