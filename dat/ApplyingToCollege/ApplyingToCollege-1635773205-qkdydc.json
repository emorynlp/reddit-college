  "text": "For my UChicago creative essay, I wrote a letter to my house, personifying it, and saying goodbye before I leave for college. \n\nI want to use a proper letter formatting to be cute but I\u2019m not sure if I should include my home address at the top of the letter.\n\nIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m concerned about safety or anything, I just know they might see it as inappropriate. But it\u2019s already listed elsewhere on the app so idk if that matters.\nIf not I might just replace the address with (your address) or something cute because it\u2019s to a house.",
