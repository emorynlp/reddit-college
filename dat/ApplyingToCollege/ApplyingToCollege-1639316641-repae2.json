  "text": "Basically title. I have all of my essays pretty much finished, so I should be fine with that, but honestly I don't know if I want to submit this early. Do these interviews give you a significant advantage? And do I even need to send in the Rice writing supplemental to receive an invitation to their portal? Help please lol (international student seeking aid btw)",
