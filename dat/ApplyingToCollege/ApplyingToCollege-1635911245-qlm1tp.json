  "title:": "Has anyone actually had Penn State reply to their emails?",
  "text": "I've sent Penn State 3 emails in the past month because of \n\n1. SRAR issues (I was asking if I can create an account before I submit application) \n\n2. Whether if my commonapp is linked to the account I created \n\n3. Why they sent me another email saying they didn't get my early action application 10 minutes after midnight when I submitted it at 7pm the day before.\n\nWell, I've got a new problem. MyPennState says that my TOEFL score is imcomplete and my SAT score report is missing. However, I have it on record that my SATs were sent on 10/19, and TOEFL was sent on the 20th (with other schools confirming they recieved it).\n\nAt this point I dont even know if its worth it to write another email, it seems like the email they give us is just for SENDING us things, instead COMMUNICATION.",
