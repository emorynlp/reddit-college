  "text": "Dear Andrew, \n\nI\u2019m so sorry to hear that you got rejected from one of your dream schools. You literally watched YouTube videos everyday about that school and researched so much. You even told mom, dad, and brother about what clubs you would join or how you would spend your days if you got into that school.\n\nSpend time to be disappointed Andrew. However, sooner or later, you have to get back up. Life moves on. You still have 6 more colleges to apply to and you should work on them. Tonight\u2019s rejection doesn\u2019t define you. \n\nTrust me, Andrew. Everything will work out in the future and when you look back on it, you\u2019ll wonder why you worried in the first place. So, get off your phone at 1AM and sleep. You\u2019ve literally got an AP Cal final tomorrow. \n\nYou got it andrew. I\u2019ll see you in May when you get all your results!",

      "text": "Hi Andrew,to be honest, college application process is inherently a bit of a crapshoot. Since it's a crapshoot, a single miss doesn't mean much. Many schools receive an insane amount of apps for a comparatively tiny amount of seats, so many great candidates fall through the cracks. Don't take it personally and move forward. Shoot widely in RD and you will get into schools you deserve to get into. If you have a full-pay hook and you got a flat out rejection, take this as a warning sign that you should re-evaluate your personal statement and your school list.",

It\u2019s okay to cry, it\u2019s okay to be upset, it\u2019s okay to be mad, and it\u2019s okay to be confused.  My rejection was hard, but I eventually got through it.  I had a terrible year, and I was honestly convinced that Vanderbilt was the place for me to go.  I even sent in an appeal because I thought it was a mistake.  Well, after getting yield protected from my second choice and denied from my third choice, I was given an acceptance at UC Berkeley.  I never thought I would ever come close or good enough for Cal, and I am so glad I applied.  You will find where you are meant to be, just trust me.  I\u2019ll admit, I was never too thrilled about my choices, but now I honestly can\u2019t imagine myself anywhere other than Cal.  Besides, you can always try to transfer in later too!
