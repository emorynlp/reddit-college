  "text": "So I've been struggling with my 'why college?' and 'why major?' essays and I always hear people saying to 'do more research on the school', but my question is how ????\n\nLike what are the steps to be taken to learn more about the school and the major?  The websites feel kinda disorganised and confusing...\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that I'm undecided major..\n\n&#x200B;",

From there, looking for information from students about their experience in those majors is great as well.
