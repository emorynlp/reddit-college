      "text": "Basics for making a list:\n\n* Safeties include auto-admits (schools that automatically accept any student that meets the requirements, community colleges, and state schools with high acceptance rates. \n* Targets can be state schools and other schools with mid-range acceptance rates. You theoretically could get in, but might get rejected because they picked an applicant similar to you. Otherwise, your stats are on par to be able to get in. \n* Reaches are schools where you are typically below the averages for that school. OR schools like Ivies, where even if you met the standards, you might get rejected cause the acceptance rate is too low. \n\nKnowing that, make a list of things that are important to you: \n\n* Your intended major (obviously) \n* Big school, small school, don\u2019t care?\n* Research/ internship opportunities?\n* Well known/prestige?\n* Offers tons of study abroads?\n* Location? \n* Dorms? \n* Good food?\n\nAnd then check the colleges in your state/ country. Do they offer your major? Do you like the campus? What are the average stats of the accepted students? Could you get in? Where does it fall on the Safety, Target, Reach list for you? \n\nIf you like it and it meets your standards for an ideal college, go for it and add it. \n\nI believe on this subreddit, you should be able to make a reverse chance me (check the rules). You basically add your stats, intended major, and state, and people will help you make a list of colleges",
