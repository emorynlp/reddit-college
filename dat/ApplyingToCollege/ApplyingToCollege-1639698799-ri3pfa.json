They pretty much always take our Val though, idk why.\n\nI was accepted but can\u2019t afford to attend so I won\u2019t  be going, I wish I could give you my spot! I would suggest looking into Holy Cross and transferring, ND gives huge priority to Saint Mary\u2019s and Holy Cross transfer applicants!",
