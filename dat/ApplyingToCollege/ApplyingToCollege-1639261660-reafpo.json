  "text": "Ok so I just got hit by a horrible doubt. I\u2019m from Italy and my school\u2019s on a semester schedule, so my mid-year final grades are released on February 1st. So far, I applied REA to a college and RD to a couple of others by Dec 1st to meet a couple of deadlines.\n\nSince I saw on the websites and on the applicant portals later than the mid-year report is required \u201cas soon as it is available/released\u201d, my counselor and I figured we\u2019d just send it in February when it comes out\u2014even to my REA school. Maybe even a few days later since we need to translate it and let the school stamp it for it to become official. Please please please tell me we did the right thing. I do not need to send, like, screenshots of the grades I\u2019ve gotten so far, right? Since it\u2019s not a report issued by the school? Or should I email all the schools I\u2019ve applied to/will apply to to let them know that my report is not going to be there before February?",

The only question would be if the REA school wanted Q1 grades or a progress report.\n\n>Or should I email all the schools I\u2019ve applied to/\n\nNo. They know they don't come out until February",
