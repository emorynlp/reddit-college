  "text": "Hi, I was wondering if a comp sci bachelors degree carries weight?\n\nWhat you learn in the program is really valuable, but there many self taught people out there so does the degree carry much value?\n\nThere is the Phd and research/teaching route for which I think a good comp sci will be really beneficial in terms of teaching you the things and getting into masters and graduate programs. But if you are not going that route is a camp sci bachelors degree worth it, also especially if you are looking at data science which uses comp sci mostly as a tool and some theoretical concepts for ml and you are going for a general \u201ca analyst\u201d route where I can later get a higher masters degree to work with data in any field if I am not an actual data scientist as my role.",

      "text": "From having quite a few friends who have gotten Comp Sci degrees;\n\nYes, it is absolutely worth it. \n\nWhile self learning is an okay way to learn, it only teaches you how to write code for the most part. The big stuff in a degree is learning theory and issues of coding as well as optimization. Another huge thing in academic programs is learning different programs and their interactions with different computer architectures (basically learning how software, firmware, and hardware work together). While the former is more common in self-learning, the latter is rarely present.\n\nThough it should be said that Comp Sci works pretty much mostly with pure coding and Data Science on analysis, both lack foundational knowledge to be anywhere near able to analyze \"data in any field\". Pretty much everything you would learn in a Data Science program can be learned in other academic programs with more formal focuses (ie, don't go into Data Science if what you want to do is making models of pathogenesis, go into a microbiology program).\n\nPut a better way, Data Science will teach you how to get results, but not how to interpret them other than on a statistical level. You will know something is happening, but not what.",
