  "text": "Last summer I was awarded a full tuition scholarship to a summer program, and I was wondering if that is considered an award I can put in the honors section?\n\nSimilarly, I was chosen to complete a large project for my city last year in a competition and I got paid for it. Is that an award?\n\nAlso, Scholastic award keys (not medals) are regional not national right?",

For the second one, it could definitely be an award if you want. However, if you put a large amount of time in it I feel like putting it as an extracurricular where you have more space to explain it/show the time commitment might be better. For the last one, my art teacher told me to put it as regional so that\u2019s what I would say to put.",

I received some local news coverage for it and a monetary stipend, so maybe I\u2019ll just put that part as the award and leave the project itself in the activities section.",
