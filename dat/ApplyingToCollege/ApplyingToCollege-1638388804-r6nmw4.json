  "text": "Hey, so I had a question that couldn't be answered clearly by people who I asked and I hoped you guys could help.\n\nI am in 12th grade and applying to college for 2022, but I plan on requesting a one year deferral of my admission to take a gap year. I am not a US citizen, so I can't fill the FAFSA, but I plan on filling the CSS profile.\n\nBut the CSS profile only lets me apply for 2022, so should I fill it now or wait until next fall?",
