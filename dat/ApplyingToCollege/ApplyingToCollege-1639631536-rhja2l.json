      "text": "Unweighted GPA is out of 4.0 (except for some schools where an A+ counts as a 4.33). In a weighted GPA system, you get a bonus added for honors and AP classes - at my high school, an honors class got +0.5, and an AP class got +1.0. In other words, an A in a regular class is 4.0, an A in an honors class is 4.5, and an A in an AP class is 5.0. In an unweighted GPA, all three would each be 4.0. I\u2019m not aware of any GPA systems that go up to 7.0 - if that exists, it\u2019s extremely uncommon.",

      "text": "There is no standard method of assigning grades in U.S. high schools.  Some give 0-100 grades, some give A/B/C, some give A+/A/A-/B+/B/B-, etc.\n\nHistorically, an A was worth 4 points, B was worth 3, etc.  Most places use that system, though they may give out numerical grades and then map them onto A/B/C.\n\nWeights are given out for \"advanced\" classes.  Some schools give an extra 0.5 points for an \"honors\" course, and an extra 1.0 for AP, IB, etc.  Other places give +1.0 for both.  So an \"A\" in a weighted class would be worth 5 grade points instead of 4.",
