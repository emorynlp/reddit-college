  "text": "Hi! I\u2019ve been trying for weeks to figure out what to write about for my common app essays. I\u2019ve had so many game-changing experiences which I\u2019ve definitely learned from, but a lot of them have to do with my own mental health or were mistakes I\u2019ve made in the past. I deal with ADHD, anxiety and depression, but I\u2019m apparently not supposed to write about any of those considering colleges see it as a red flag. \nI\u2019ve been to treatment before due to sexual trauma, and that was definitely life changing, and I wouldn\u2019t write about it as a \u201cvictim\u201d per say, but still I\u2019ve been told not to mention that. I also got lost in the mountains skiing back country (the guide said he knew where he was going, but didn\u2019t), and considering it wasn\u2019t necessary my fault for getting us both lost, I was told not to write about that either because it could be considered a dumb decision. Any ideas? I\u2019ve never done an exchange program or had any recent accomplishments that I feel like I could strongly write about. Any and all advice would be appreciated:)",
