  "text": "Hello,\n\nSo long story short I went to a 4 year university back in 2018 for a month before leaving to pursue a business I had going. At the start of school, myself a long with a group of guys cracked a joke about a girl that was deemed inappropriate. I was never in-trouble or had disciplinary action towards me per say but I was talked to and told it was not acceptable which I agree, it was not. I've since grown up and I'm now 22.\n\nPlease note I left for other reasons, not because of that. I was never disciplined but I was talked to many times.\n\nEven though I have open enrollment at that school still, I'm going to a partner community college in Los Angeles in hopes to transfer to either USC, UC Berkeley or NYU.\n\nI'm not familiar with the transfer process - Will for instance NYU or any other school contact my old University and ask for a record or something of the sorts? I don't want this to be held against me..\n\nCan I email the school and get my file? Would it say everything?",
