  "text": "\ud83d\ude2dHELP!!\nOkay so\u2026 I asked my art teacher to submit his rec letter for me by nov 1st bc I knew one specific school wanted all of their stuff by that deadline. He was a little too confident in the grace period and decided to submit them today lol. (Nov 3rd)\n\nThe thing is, before the deadline had passed, he had an option to submit my recommendation. After it, he just wasn\u2019t able to. [here\u2019s what happened](https://imgur.com/a/MshBBJI)\n\nSuper, SUPER odd. I asked my counselor today and she couldn\u2019t figure out why either. The thing is, I had that same art teacher assigned for other schools like RISD for RD, so it should have at least let him submit a rec for those schools. No matter how many times I tried it in front of him, it wouldn\u2019t work. \n\nSo I tried adding him as a NORMAL teacher instead of \u201cother recommender\u201d (which is supposed to be for art teachers\u2026 idk why it\u2019s not working) and it worked, so he submitted his rec there. So now my page looks like [THIS](https://imgur.com/a/xvSad8Y)\n\n\nI should contact the two schools that were affected by this, right? Is this okay to do? I\u2019m just a little worried that everything\u2019s going in an odd direction \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29",
