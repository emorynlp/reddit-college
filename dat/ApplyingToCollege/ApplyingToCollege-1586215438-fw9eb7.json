  "title:": "Just got into a huge argument with my parents over not wanting to go to MIT",
  "text": "I just filled out the USC Housing application and got to the page to submit the $55 application fee... apparently talking to my parents about deciding between multiple schools didn't make it clear enough to them that I wasn't going to automatically commit to MIT. I was bombarded with 30 minutes of yelling, accusing me of \"being a pussy,\" \"being retarded,\" and \"having serious mental health issues\" in Chinese (Damn, what a failure I must be for that).\n\nObviously I was insanely happy when I got into MIT. I was over the moon for about an entire month. But after that initial euphoria went away, I began to really process what going to a school like that would mean. I've worked insanely hard for my grades in high school, and I was never the type that would be able to not study for tests in order to excel. I always felt stressed out by everything, and the \"college resume building\" aspect of my life took over my entire mindset. Although I've never had the guts to go to a therapist or seek professional medical attention, I'm sure I've experienced depression and anxiety far too many times during my four years in high school.\n\nThrough more research online and talking to current/former students, I've come to realize that MIT truly might destroy me. I'm already extremely fragile mentally, and the advice I've heard over and over again is to not go to school if you fall apart under stress. Sure, the graduation rate is extremely high and I'll probably be able to make it through, but at what cost to my mental health? High school has already broken me many times -- how is MIT not going to be even worse? The only thing I realized I truly like about MIT is the prestige associated with its name... and that's precisely why I don't want to go there right now.\n\nWhen I tried to tell my parents my thinking, they refused to even contemplate the reasons as to why I'm having doubts in terms of attending this \\*magical school\\*. They told me every college would be hard, and while that's certainly true, is it possible to deny the fact that MIT will almost certainly be more intense and riskier for my health than other, \"worse\" schools? The campus made me feel miserable when I visited, the horror stories I've heard have scared the shit out of me, and I honestly can't see myself enjoying my time at MIT. But my parents said that \"MIT is too prestigious for you not to go,\" that \"there is a reason why their yield rate is so high,\" that they \"couldn't stand to talk to me again if I chose to go such a bad school like USC.\"\n\nMaybe I did this to myself. My entire life, I've been a sheep to my parents. I listened to them when they insisted I needed straight A's since the beginning of middle school. I listened to them when they told me I couldn't hang out with my friends during the school year because a \"good, smart Chinese boy had better things to do with his time.\" I listened to them when they told me that a \"perfect ACT/SAT score will set you up for your entire life.\" I even almost listened to them when they told me to quit playing a sport, literally the one thing that has kept me sane throughout the past 6 years of my life. Now, they expect me to blindly listen to them again. But this time, I can't.\n\nI don't know what to do. I know that I will probably regret passing up the insane academic opportunities at MIT if I don't go. I know that I might never be able to heal my relationship with my parents if I don't go. I know that, if MIT doesn't destroy me, it is probably the best choice for me to go to college. But how do I know that it won't destroy me? I can do more research, but how can I know for sure that I will be fine if I go there? How do I make the right decision? I can't even discern my own thinking from that of my parents. I don't even know how to end this rant. I'm just a giant freaking mess. I feel stuck.",

You OP are very intelligent for realizing that there is more to college than just the adcedemic reputation of a school. At the end of the day, I urge you to consider which college will make you the most happy. You don\u2019t want to be a slave to a top university where you aren\u2019t having any fun. If going to MIT makes you happy, go there. But if USC is where you want to go even if your parents are pushing back, go there",

              "text": "This isn't to encourage you towards inaction. My father refused to help pay for me to go to college unless it was where he wanted and for the degree he wanted me to get. I decided not to go to college at 18. Instead I self taught and made the right friends who had the ability to train me in IT. I tried to go to college on my own dollar but my dad made too much and my mother refused to help. I instead doubled down and focused on my career. I ended up at IBM, I remember my orientation. I was in a group with a lot of fresh 20 somethings graduates who were stunned I got a job like I did with no degree. \n\nI realize that my choices definitely slowed down my adult life progression. But at 33 I've got a car that is nearly paid off, I just closed on a house, and I have a stable job. I'm making a very comfortable salary which is probably the upper limit without a degree. So now would be the time for me to finally go get my degree and I can bankroll myself, go on my terms and for what I want, and not have to rely on anyone. \n\nI encourage you to evaluate your decision beyond the mental fatigue to include the timing and the appropriateness of taking on debt for your education. It may be worth while to wait and then go after you've recovered mentally and matured your decision making / confidence in your own agency.",

                      "text": "I landed a job in their multi vendor support center. I was a \"Software Engineer\" for Microsoft products. The team I was on provided premier MS support for IBM customers. I regularly engaged in project planning, implementation, and short answer how-to for break fix for my customers. Internal to IBM I was a Technical Solutions Manager. So I also lead collaboration between business units and served as an SME for MS software solutions. \n\nI boot strapped my entire professional career. Each job I took I didn't have the entire ability to perform all that was required of me. I didn't admit that to anyone. I read as much as I could, built my own home lab and watched a zillion videos on each topic I needed to learn. As a result I've always been able to deliver on all of my job role requirements. I've even authored a few unique solutions for issues I've encountered. I still watch and read everything I can. I've gotten to the point where I have forgotten more than I know right now. But I remember enough to being myself up to speed on subject matter that I do not encounter on a daily basis. Of course over time I've developed a innate minimum amount of knowledge. So I do not have to re-learn absolutely everything.\n\nI got the job at IBM through a recruiter for a staffing company who posted the job ad on Craigslist. I thought it was a joke but applied anyway. I was immediately called back as I had a strong resume. I had a phone interview and the hardest material knowledge test I'd ever had to take. IBM changed my life, they required MS certifications in order to keep my job and they reimbursed me upon successful completion of each cert. The management also cared and helped develop my confidence and my technical ability. I poured everything I had into the job, I got converted from contractor to full blue IBMer in a year. I also was able to receive a solid yearly review after my first year as an IBMer.",

We grew up in a different time where the best people weren't necessary the ones with formal educations, but engineering is growing more complicated and the forefront of computing especially is highly dependent on theoretical understanding that college provide. Stochastic procceses/upper level statistics, linear algebra, vector calculus, are pretty much a must these days. Not to say you couldn't learn this all on your own (Khan Academy really is fantastic), but if OP got into MIT, it is clear that they are academically and socially mature enough to go to college. I also would wager that they will do well at USC, and confidence will come naturally. Just my thought as another person who has worked in industry. \n\nOn a side note, my dad sounds like yours. Even after getting into Caltech, my college options were: Iowa State for electrical engineering and that's it. I wanted to do aerospace engineering but my dad thought that was pretty stupid, because \"every house has electricity, how many people have an airplane?\". Hahaha.",

There's no way of telling how you'll do at either school, so you'll just have to make a decision and stick with it. \n\nBased on your comment that the one thing you like about MIT is the prestige, it sounds like USC is a better fit for you. It's nothing to scoff at (I've met other Chinese parents like yours who think it's a crummy school; not sure why...), and while it might lack some things that MIT has, it'll likely have other things that MIT lacks. If you commit completely to USC and really take advantage of campus opportunities when you matriculate--no second thoughts, no \"If only I went to MIT\"--you'll very likely find your place on campus and have no regrets. Find some clubs and activities you'd be excited to get involved in if you went to USC; that generally helps with feeling at peace with a school. \n\nOne thing that helped me a lot when I was considering college was personal development. I was picking between MIT and Caltech, which are quite similar, and ultimately, I chose MIT because it was far from home (I'm from SoCal), bigger, and its students seemed more generally well-rounded in their interests. I was (still am) kind of awkward and didn't really know how to talk to people who weren't my personality \"type\", so I thought MIT would expose me to a greater diversity of people and force me to be more social. \n\nParent-wise, since I lived so close to Caltech that my parents could drive over anything they'd like (and they totally would), I thought staying in SoCal would slow down my becoming independent, and I wanted some more space. I'm not sure what your plans are for your relationship with your parents, or where you're from, but this is something to consider as well. \n\nThat said, there were a few things I wanted to say--\n\n\\-Since your mental health is really fragile, USC could also be very dangerous. It doesn't have the same reputation for academic rigor as MIT, but it could certainly present other stresses that could negatively impact you. Research mental health facilities at both places, and make sure you seek mental health ASAP. \n\n\\-I didn't like MIT very much when I visited during CPW (and my 2 visits before that weren't great either), but I enjoyed my four years there. Is there anything at all about MIT that you like about it besides the prestige? I find that a lot of the worst horror stories about MIT are either fringe cases or from the way past. There's a lot of smart kids that make you feel bad, and people do botch their mental health (but this happens at every campus), but it's a very \"move at your own pace\" type of school unless you're in an engineering major that has specific requirements each semester. \n\n\\-I'd recommend against going to MIT if you're likely to transfer out. The first semester is on PNR, but people have definitely transferred out in the past. If you commit to USC now, you'll have some time to negotiate with your parents and figure out finances in the event that they do decide to withdraw support; if you go to MIT and transfer somewhere, that'll be more jarring for them and leave you stranded on shorter notice.\n\n\\-What do you like about USC? Do you really like the school and think you'd fit well, or is it just your only other option? \n\nGood luck. This is certainly rough, and lemme know if you need an ear.",

If I go to MIT, I'm definitely not going to approach with the mindset that I'll definitely be transferring out -- I'll definitely be embracing the school and doing the best I can to find happiness there. \n\nAbout USC: I really love California which is why Stanford was my dream school before my rejection (oof). I'm a huge sports guy so, although it probably shouldn't be, being able to watch their teams is a big part of why I love the school. The Trojan family is exceptionally strong in the LA area, and I would love to live there after college. I also received the presidential scholarship, which means I would be paying 29k less per year to attend USC and I'd be able to live in the McCarthy Honors Residential College, which is really, really nice",

If not and it is still your ultimate goal, why not trying a strategy like deferring USC by a year, attend MIT 1 year, then try to transfer to Stanford ? One thing you might also consider, that I didn't see you talking about yet, is what you want to do after graduating. The main advantage of MIT is that it gives you easy access to a lot of options after graduation (top companies, top network of alumni to work with, possibility to get in top grad schools like at Stanford). You can still try to achieve the same from USC of course, it is just harder. If you don't care much about these opportunities, then indeed MIT might not really seem useful.",

      "text": "Unpopular opinion: it sounds like you have imposter syndrome. What I've learned since coming to my T5 (one that's known for being pretty difficult, i.e. not Harvard or Yale) is that *everyone* struggles. Everyone has to study to excel on tests, and everyone worked hard for their grades in high school. But not everyone shows it. Don't think that you're lesser than everyone else who got in, or that MIT will be *especially* challenging for you, just because you had to study in high school. You've faced stress and anxiety at times, but so has everyone else. You overcame those things enough to achieve what you did, so you should have confidence going forward!\n\nOf course, I don't know your full mental health history, and I can't tell you what you can or can't handle. If you visited MIT and didn't like the campus or didn't like the curriculum, then by all means choose USC where you'll be happier. But don't turn down the opportunity solely because you're intimidated. When I first came to my university, I had these kinds of thoughts too. I thought I only got in because I wrote good essays and not because I had achieved what the other kids had. But once I got here, I fit in just fine.\n\nEdit: I don't like to post my school / year for privacy reasons cuz sometimes I mention pretty specific things about myself, but if you want to know the school / hear more about this just shoot me a PM\n\nEdit 2: Based on the people who've PM'd me, I'd like to clarify something else: grades really aren't that important for your future. I have a 3.85 right now, which makes me a candidate for Phi Beta Kappa, but that doesn't necessarily mean I have job offers falling into my lap. As always, to get good internships / research, you have to put in the effort. That effort goes a lot farther towards post-grad outcomes than your GPA does.\n\nFor me, a lot of the reason high school was so anxious and stressful was that at most high schools you need an almost perfect GPA for schools like MIT. Get two B's and it's basically over. But that's not the case in college. Of course, students put pressure on themselves to compete for higher GPAs, but grades don't have as big a bearing on post-graduation outcomes as, say, high school GPA does for undergrad admissions.\n\nAt my school, it's pretty easy to get above a 3.5 if you put in good amount of effort. In STEM classes, the class average is going to a B / B+, and the top 15% will get an A. So if you're a completely average student, you'll probably end up with a 3.3. If you want a 3.9, which means consistently getting an A / being the top 15-30% in almost all of your classes, then those are the kids who are buckling down and heading straight home from the library each day. But you learn pretty quickly that *it doesn't matter what your GPA is*, except for a select few fields like if you want to go to an Ivy-level academic grad school / law school / med school, or MBB consulting. But for most jobs, GPA doesn't really matter as long as it's above 3.0. I know kids with 3.3s going to Goldman Sachs. I know students with 3.2s going to Facebook. If you don't want school to take over your life, it won't.",

However, I hesitate to agree with the other comment saying you should choose MIT. USC is by no means a bad school, and fit is incredibly important IMO. It's one thing if you're worried about not being successful at MIT, and another if you truly believe that you will be miserable there. You said that you did not enjoy the campus visit and you can't see yourself enjoying your time there. That makes me wary of telling you to go.\n\nI'm so sorry that your parents are not supportive of your struggles or your doubt when it comes to MIT. I can't tell you what the right decision is here; there's a lot to consider, between the benefits of MIT and your relationship with your parents. At the same time, at the end of the day it is your life, and you know yourself better than anyone else. If you think USC is the better option, I would do your best to pursue that.",

I\u2019m also going to college this year, and I want to go University of Toronto just because of its prestige and I feel like I deserve it or something, but I know the competitive environment is gonna ruin me. So, I keep telling myself that it\u2019s ok to choose an easier school, and that\u2019s probably what I\u2019m gonna do. I hope I don\u2019t sound offensive, but this seems like your parents problem.

The top engineering programs are all extemelry difficult and require tremendous mental resolve, but MIT, CMU, GT, and Berkeley in particular have a serious stress culture in engineering and due to the enviornment are particularly brutal. While other engineering programs like Stanford, Michigan, UIUC (etc.) are equally difficult academically, they don't have the same stress culture because stress is mitigated by other enviornmental factors like more diversity in student majors, more relaxed students, and school spirit. To any student who doesn't eat/sleep/breathe engineering, I would caution you to select a top engineering school where there is an escape should you become overwhelmed.\n\nEdit: Btw, those of us in industry who are alums of these places are actively trying to change this culture at our alma mater, but it's largely driven by the student body and very hard to change. As much as I love GT, given the choice for my own child between GT/Michigan or GT/UCLA, I would want them to choose a better enviornment for their own mental health",

      "text": "Hi OP, ive told my story a couple times on A2C but I'll tell it here again, because maybe it will help you.\n\nAbout 40 years ago I applied to two universities for a BS in EE. Iowa State, a school 20 minutes from my parents' house, and Caltech. I actually got accepted into Caltech, and then had to turn it down because there was no chance in hell my parents could afford for me to go there. At the time, I was... upset... To say the least. \n\nIn hindsight, this might've been the single best thing to happen to me in my life. As you might expect, I was pretty much the top student at IA State Engineering (and I had a full ride). When I graduated at the age of 21 I received offers from Stanford and GT, and since GT was fully funded, that's where I went. So by the age of 23 I had an MS in EE from Georgia Tech (which is a top 10 electrical engineering school) and I had paid exactly 0 dollars in tutition fees over the course of my undergrad and grad education. \n\nThese days I've got my dream job, dream house, a beautiful wife I love very much and two beautiful kids (who aren't really kids anymore, but they will always be kids to me). Imo, life is a lot bigger and longer than 4 years of undergrad education, and more importantly, the people who have what it takes to succeed do so independently of the school they attend. So turning down MIT? Not really a big deal in the long run. The amount of self-awareness and maturity you have to know that's the right descion for you speaks volumes about your character. Certainly more than I had at your age when put in a similar situation. I'll also point out that USC (unlike IA State) is one of the nation's top colleges and is no means a school one settles for. I think you'll be just fine.",

At the end of the day, this should be **your** decision because this is **your** life. Your parents' points are valid and worth considering, but so are yours.\n\nMental health is incredibly important to quality of life, and really, what's the point of being 'successful' if you're not happy? USC is an amazing school, so it's not even like you're setting yourself up for failure by going there. USC is widely recognized as an excellent school, so you will have amazing opportunities with an education from USC. \n\nAnother thing to consider -- are you going to grad school? If you think that you would do better at USC, then that might be the better choice.\n\nI think you should take a few days to step back from the situation. Then reevaluate how you, and only you, are feeling.",

I went to McGill ('Harvard' of Canada) after high school and it was hard and depressing and I dropped out. I went to rehab for depression. Maybe, if I went somewhere else I would've had a healthier experience. I don't know if I regret choosing McGill, but I am now at community college at 25 years old trying to transfer to a good UC. I chose prestige over happiness (I really liked UCSB), and it turned out to be a huge mistake. Think hard about if you can endure 4 years at MIT and if that would be worth the opportunities a degree from MIT can open up for you. If you got in, you got in for a reason and are smart enough to be there. But sometimes, there's more important things than rank and competition. I hope you make the right choice, whatever that might be.",

      "text": "At the end of the day, choose wherever you think is best for you. I will say, though, that, with some physical health issues that sporadically affect my mental ability, I was worried about MIT as well. However, the more research I did, the more I fell in love with the school and realized that the popular acronym IHTFP really showed the collaborative spirit there. From what I can gather, at MIT, it\u2019s hard so the students are forced into collaboration to \u201cbeat\u201d the school. I also found watching KJ Hardrict aka MITechGuy\u2019s videos helpful as they have me a sense of the camaraderie of the student body. I recently talked to the founder of a mid sized tech company about getting an internship, and the conversation moved toward college. He said they (and other companies) pay MIT grads at least 10% more right out of the gate, because he says they have a whole different mindset that is invaluable to the company. Then again, that mindset doesn\u2019t just magically appear, it\u2019s brought out by the extremely demanding nature of the education. I know MIT is the right choice for me, but obviously everyone\u2019s different, and it\u2019s up to you. One other thing is that people spend a lot of time on their extracurriculars in addition to classes, so, by taking a standard 4 classes per semester but cutting down on extracurricular commitments, you could find it quite a bit more manageable. Then again, extracurriculars are important too. However, I don\u2019t think you should sell USC short. It\u2019s an incredible school with a ton of opportunities and, judging by what you say about your work ethic, I think you could really shine there as an excellent student! Let me know what you end up choosing!",

You said that you\u2018re \u201cfragile,\u201d but I think you might be underestimating yourself. Plus, MIT\u2019s experience makes people tough and strong such that whatever you do afterwords seems a lot easier. As long as you\u2019re not premed or prelaw, aiming for a perfect GPA is not a priority and it\u2019s okay to have setbacks - that\u2019s normal. Also consider that the people from MIT you talked to, if they\u2019re on Reddit, tend to be more dissatisfied with their college experience than the average student. Reddit is a place for venting after all.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you that a campus visit is not an accurate snapshot of student life; a lot of colleges try to make it all sound rosy, but I remember my mit tour guide candidly telling me that it\u2019s difficult there. Yet the students seem to brag about how badly they did - they\u2019re not ashamed to fail or stumble because everything\u2019s a learning experience.\n\nThat said, you know yourself the best and prestige does not overcome mental health. USC is still a good school and you\u2019ll be successful at either university.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already paid your deposit, perhaps talk to some others from MIT who might give you a more balanced perspective.\n\nGood luck and congratulations!",

It was very difficult to convince them and they put me through a lot of mental stress during the commitment period and after. But as time goes on, that feeling fades and fades, and my parents have accepted that I go here. From time to time they'll still shit on my school, especially since my brother goes to Yale but like... I'm across the country from them so it doesn't really matter. I can honestly say that the people here won't be as studious as people who go to MIT, which is sort of a given. But they're still very intelligent and very hard working and there's a surprising amount of them who turned down ivies themselves to go here. MIT does party pretty hard, from what I see and hear, but so do we. But we have three things better than any other school in the nation:\n\n1. Women\n2. Weed\n3. Weather\n\nThere are some things you should understand.\n\n1. We've had a lot of student deaths last semester, which have been covered up. I think something like 9 students died, one who lived in my dorm during week 0. Pretty scary stuff, and it's been understated. I'm surprised nobody in the comments has mentioned it. You might do better here mentally just because the weather's pretty nice (and the weather does have an effect on your mental health, for me at least) compare to MIT, but it's not as if we have the best mental health support in the world\n2. You might not have all the resources you would have if you attended MIT. Don't get me wrong, USC is an amazing school, but will you get the recruiters, the professors, the programs, the clubs at MIT? Probably not, especially the recruiters. Let me put it this way, students at MIT will probably have no trouble going to the Citadel, DE Shaw, or some other hedge fund and making tons of money their first year. USC, it's not so often. We do send lots of people to FAANG and Big 4 though\n3. There is still stress if you go here. I just took a linear algebra midterm today, and thank God corona got us all home. If I took the test in person, I probably would've failed it. Ironically, I've been studying using MIT OCW with Gilbert Strang. You will face difficult classes and nasty professors. If you're in CS, 104 is notorious for being time consuming, and our CS classes are in C++, which has a lot of idiosyncrasies that more modern programming languages don't have. It's not as if everything is easy here compared to MIT.\n\nIt's a difficult position to be in, and I relate to how your parents have been treating you. Reading this, you probably think that USC is terrible, but USC has been amazing. You get a more rounded college lifestyle and the people here are very collaborative (even the pre-med kids). Living in LA is so much more interesting than Boston. The professors are very approachable and easy to connect with. Also, for the housing app, if you made honors college (which you probably did if you got into MIT), choose McCarthy. There is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't. \n\nIf I had the choice all over again, between Rutgers, GT, USC, Cornell, and Cooper Union, I absolutely would pick USC or Rutgers (for the cost). Cornell honestly isn't even much of a consideration for me. If I had the choice between USC or MIT, it's a tough call, even without your parents weighing in. But if there's one thing I can guarantee you, it's that you really can't go wrong either way, and if you can manage your time well and seek out help when you need it, you will undoubtedly succeed. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions",

      "text": "(college admissions counselor here). Probably an unpopular opinion, but I would go to MIT, see how it is, and transfer out if you don't like it. You could even defer your USC admission if possible and have that as a back-up plan. I went to Cornell for undergrad and Harvard for grad school, and although people here may tell you education is similar across decent schools, a) I don't believe that. I sat in on my twin sister's classes at UMich and USC (her undergrad and grad schools) many times and there was no comparison in level, b) the amount of doors that the college name opens for you is unfathomable. As my dad says, you get access to \"a club\" for life, and it makes anything work-related (negotiating, starting your own business, etc.) easier because people see you as more competent and credible with that degree.\n\nIf you major in something that you actually like, the classes should be enjoyable even if you have to work hard. Don't you enjoy time spent learning things that fascinate you?  If you went to a competitive high school, no matter how hard you worked, college might surprise you in how \"easy\" it is, depending on your major choice and work ethic. In college I would do most of my work on the weekends so that during the week I could focus on going to class, working out, hobbies, etc. And in grad school, I taught 20 hours/week to cover living expenses and was fine. You really don't know how challenging MIT will be and you are being intimidated by its reputation. Tbh, Harvard was way easier than Cornell (Cornell had no problem failing me in Calculus lol); at Harvard (and maybe MIT too, many top schools) there's grade inflation and professors generally don't give less than B-.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you go to MIT, you may be surprised. When I visited Cornell, I hated it. I found the campus too big, the people too preppy, and day I went was rainy. I wanted something smaller like Colgate. However, I wanted to study nutrition and Cornell had a better program so I went there. I feel like it was a 4-year vacation. Even if MIT is academically too much for you, you always have the option to transfer. Also, there are tons of mental health resources on campus included with your student health insurance, so even if you need weekly therapy or whatever as a crutch while adapting, you will have that option. I agree with your parents and think that you really don't know best at this point. Oftentimes, what we imagine or fear is the complete opposite of reality. I think you're overplaying MIT. Also, at Cornell and Harvard I helped tons of students and friends with their essays and tutored romance languages; I was also very social and active on campus. Point is, I met a lot of people and saw the quality of their work and their intelligence and was really only impressed with a handful of people. Not saying that I was \"better\" than them in some way, but that I had imagined this snooty Ivory Tower of little geniuses, which was the furthest thing from reality.\n\nAnyway, this is long. I just think you should have faith in yourself and give MIT a chance (Cambridge is so quaint, and Boston is fun) and if you really want to be in California, you can go there for Spring Breaks, summer internships, transfer if you hate MIT, or live there later in life. Most people in this thread have no idea what they're talking about because they're seeing things from a parochial view. We have one life that we know of. Get the best education you can, if it's too intense for you (which I doubt), transfer. Just try your hardest while being happy.  I think you're demonizing MIT--focusing on how you hated your visit, the horror stories you've heard, and how you think your mental health won't make it--because you don't think you will make it there and hence it's easier to reject it, than to try it and admit potential \"failure\" down the line. I do think if you go there, you will enjoy the lifestyle, your friends, your courses, and Boston/Cambridge. California will always be there; MIT won't. I just don't see why you wouldn't even give it a real shot when you can always transfer if it's too much. That seems like selling yourself short.",

          "text": "To address your point about schools being similar/not, I would say this largely depends on the major. I have sat in on quite a few upper div/grad engineering lectures at Stanford, Berkeley, and Michigan, and having graduated from GT, I will tell you all 4 of those schools offered classes of similar quality. While Ivy League schools may offer a dramatically better liberal arts education then their state school competitors, the same relationship between top privates and top publics is absolutely NOT true for some technical fields like engineering and CS. While schools like Stanford, MIT, CMU are top privates in engineering, their public rivals like Berkeley, Michigan, GT, UIUC are extremely comparable in terms of educational quality. This could in part be due to the fact that engineering is acreddited by ABET which forces standardization, but also because engineering in it's nature has well defined content. While I have never been to USC or MIT and sat in there, there are many equally successful USC and MIT grads at the company where I work. If I had to guess, USC engineering classes are roughly comparable to MIT.",

      "text": "hey op! Currently doing my Masters at USC and also went there for undergrad and have chinese parents and went to a pretty competitive high school/put pressure on myself to succeed and dealt with mental health issues throughout college lol. You're smart enough to think about more just college reputation. College is sooo much more than that. \n\nI'm not sure what your intentional major is, but I can speak about USC. What I love about USC is how they encourage students to take classes outside your department/cross major if possible. A major I always found interesting was CS/BA (Computer science/Business admin). Another major that is popular is IRGB (International relations/global business). There will be courses that will challenge you for sure from hearing my friends talk/my experience, but that's college. If you got elective spaces, highly suggest taking a film class as that's what USC is known for after all. I would also consider departmental resources. I was in Annenberg and Marshall, departments that are well-funded and well-connected lol. That has given them the room to host amazing networking events or guest speakers. \n\nMy peers at USC were extremely driven and that Trojan network has been real. I know I want to stay in LA because of my interests so I'm really taking advantage of that to grow my network. Some of my internships that I got was thru the Trojan network. USC is definitely a highly spirited school, probs the most spirited school I visited when I was doing my college tours back in high school. That was definitely a draw for me. I feel proud wearing my USC gear on campus/going around town in LA. It has been conversation starters with random strangers before haha. The weather is great too. But LA in general, is an amazing culture hub, especially if you're into entertainment, media, and tech (a growing area within LA/Silicon Beach). Feel free to PM if you got more questions! Congrats on both acceptances!",

      "text": "First of all, I'm sorry to hear about your parents, OP. Although they're entitled to have their opinions, you deserve to be supported no matter what choice you make. \n\nPersonally, I'm the happiest I've ever been at MIT and being in such a collaborative and high-energy environment has done wonders for my mental health--which I really struggled with in high school. The pressure of getting into college as well as other personal issues really excerbated my anxiety and depression. However, at MIT, I've found it really wonderful and liberating to be around people who are all really passionate about what they do and appreciate the cool things that other people do without feeling the need to compare. Sounds nerdy but I really enjoy my current research project (UROP) and I can geek out about it to someone I'm making small talk with without them judging, and then listen to whatever cool project they're working on! I'm really sad that this year's adMITs won't be able to experience our Campus Preview Weekend (CPW), which is usually an awesome chaotic jumble of fun events hosted by students/student groups/living groups across campus. I think I had similar struggles understanding if I truly wanted to go to MIT or if it was just for the prestige, and it was during CPW that me, and most students I know, really got to understand the MIT experience and appreciate the unique atmosphere on campus through conversations with both adMITs and students. If you're still uncertain about your decision, I encourage you to attend some of the informal virtual sessions that we'll be hosting (or reach out to me directly)! \n\nUltimately, if you got into MIT, it means that we know you'll be able to handle whatever academic challenges come your way. In terms of stress in the first year, MIT has mandatory PNR during the first semester, which gives all first years the opportunity to take a step back from the intense mindset towards grades they might have held during high school to explore  and find communities/groups/activities that they love. MIT also offers really accessible mental health counseling, which many students take advantage of (yay, no stigmas). We also have an awesome office called S\\^3 (Student Support Services) which you can talk to at any time if you're stressed or struggling with something and they can speak to your professors on your behalf. \n\nMIT doesn't accept the smartest individuals, they accept people who they see being happy and fitting into the on-campus community. For example, you mentioned you're an athelte. Athletics is a huge part of MIT student life, but not in the traditional sense. MIT does a lot to support its students athletes in pursuing their sport and all the athletes I know love being a part of their teams--it's just not a campus-wide spectacle sort of thing as it is at many state schools. In fact, because our dorms each have their own unique communities and culture (which is awesome), one of the dorms is sort of known as the place where a lot of athletes live and, as you can imagine, it's great being able to be around other athletes and live with your teammates if you are one. \n\nOverall, I just want you to know that you shouldn't doubt yourself because you have the capability to thrive at MIT. Take some time to engage with other adMITs and \"CPW\" events hosted by current students if you want to better understand the campus culture to see if you would enjoy it. However, you might ulimately find it not to be the place where you thrive the most--and that's okay!",

Please read MIT's statement of student support: [https://firstyear.mit.edu/tutoring-support/academic-support](https://firstyear.mit.edu/tutoring-support/academic-support) and review MIT's student resources: [https://resources.mit.edu/](https://resources.mit.edu/)\n\nIf MIT accepted you, they are confident that you will do well and are a good fit for their academic and social community.  I believe you will be amazing no matter where you go.  Do not let self-doubt, fear and tension with parents determine your future.  But just remember, no matter where you go you will face challenges (and celebrate successes!).  You will need to know how to ask for help and support from peers, faculty and administration.  My personal feeling is that MIT may provide better support and resources for you as an individual and student given the relative smallness of its undergraduate population.\n\n\\*Plus - Cambridge/Boston is awesome!!!\\*  (Source: husband went to MIT and I'm from Boston)\n\nGood luck in your decision making!

      "text": "Go to MIT. Take a gap year to de-stress. Take a light course load. Bet on yourself being able to handle the material, and bet on yourself finding better, more efficient, and even more relaxing ways to study. Here are 3 points that should highlight why you **will be told you're making the right choice** by Reddit, but you might not be:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) **If it's breaking you** in the first year, you can transfer to USC. I hate to be the \"MIT is more prestigious\" category, but this will open so many doors for you you can not even fathom; to base your decision here based on **an emotion** (the anticipation of stress) rather than **logic** (what steps can I take here to prevent it, what are the people that are at MIT and **not** stressed doing right) is nefarious to yourself, and self-destructive!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) In addition, make the following distinction: **Your GPA in high school determined your future. Therefore, you felt stress over your GPA.**\n\n**Your GPA in College does not determine your future. Employers are looking at it less than** ***ever*** ***before***\\*\\*. It is arguably okay to graduate with a 3.0 - imagined a chill, hardworking, but not-so-intense academic life wherein you get great grades, but don't stress and strain to the point of depression for them!\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3) The actual in-course material at MIT vs USC are not going to be dramatically different.** Harvard students say this all the time. There is this cloud of illusion \"from the outside\" that makes it seem like one is dramatically harder, superior, and more difficult than the other; as if it's a higher tier of education. In truth, classes might be a bit more challenging, but we truly, genuinely live in a world where **GPA is just not that important anymore,** ***great*** **academics in college are just not that important anymore, curriculums are relatively the same in \"raw difficulty\", and college name & prestige carry** ***far more weight than ever before.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsider that colleges don't scale with population size. The level of distinction between you and the rest of your cohort/age group in your major (as a percentage) is going to be so dramatically higher from MIT that it's mind-boggling now!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Don't make this life-changing decision based on negative emotions (fear, anxiety, depression, the fear of anxiety, the fear of depression). Genuinely bet on yourself doing well, and living in an adapted world.** Also, consider that the type of people you meet will also dramatically change your experience... you might meet people at MIT in your classes who help you reason in new ways that make course material super fucking easy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Go to MIT. 100% take a gap year. And keep USC as a back-pocket option. Take it utterly easy on yourself for your first year GPA-wise - GPA is not that important anymore, but college name is more important than ever (from an employer's perspective).**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGo get em :)",

I got accepted into a top 10 music school with arguably the best wind ensemble in the country and was ecstatic when I was accepted and it had everything I had thought I'd wanted, big school, big name, big programs, good reputation and I was able to be on campus and liked it. but then I got accepted into a state school, much much smaller, no big name, no low acceptance and for me I ended choosing the smaller school, there were a couple reasons but one I think you'd resonate with is competition. I was told literally by the professor of \"big school\" that it would be naive to say that all interactions and competition there would be healthy, and I know at small school 100% there would never be anything or anyone to be toxic or the like, and I know I can succeed better if I go into a smaller and more friendly environment. Also seeing that you VISITED campus and didn't see yourself there is HUGE. DO NOT GO if you got negative energy from the campus! You can be successful coming out of any school especially undergrad, honestly I've only ever talked to musicians about where they studied and no other professional, and honestly you'll probably get the same level of education from either school. Don't let your parents pressure you into these decisions, I don't know your financials but Ill guess it'll be you to take on debt (if even you have any) and in a couple of months you won't be living with them and Im going to assume you won't ever permanently live with them again.

              "text": "Imo, considering price is short-sighted when you're talking about a school like MIT. Look up articles with schools that have high Return on Investments. MIT is always up there (for example: [https://thebestschools.org/rankings/private-colleges-best-roi/](https://thebestschools.org/rankings/private-colleges-best-roi/)). I had \\~125k in loans after my schools but paid them all down in 1.5 years of a full-time job and a LOT of hustle. I was also an expat so had lower taxes, but still. If you graduate from MIT you will most likely have a high starting salary and pay down your loans within a few years. And the ROI will be much more than at 99% of schools, probably including USC though don't quote me on that. I see your parents' point -- they are trying to guide you toward what they believe will give you the best opportunities in life. Unless they only care about bragging rights to their friends, which I doubt, your parents likely want the best for you. Based on their experiences, they believe MIT is the best and I think you should see that with a more open mind. They want your well-being overall, and if MIT starts to degrade your mental health, I doubt they would complain if you wanted to transfer. Anyway, it wouldn't matter at that point. I used to be like you but the older I get, the more I prefer to not make my own mistakes (I've made enough for a lifetime during college) and to listen to the advice of my parents. I don't always agree with them, as you clearly don't, but you should believe they have good intentions and have thought this through also.",

I\u2019ve been researching this about Stanford because I feel very similarly to you about the pressure and stress and one thing I really like about Stanford is that you have people who have put together their schedule in ways where they\u2019re doing 3 hours of homework everyday and there are others who have schedules with 45 minutes of homework (bare minimum and possibly only Freshman year). Again, I think you\u2019re very smart for prioritizing your well-being and happiness this early in life, but it would also be a missed opportunity to get an MIT degree if there is some way you could both attend the school and feel good about yourself. I would also wager that many of those \u201cnightmare cases\u201d are probably the students who are really pushing themselves\u2014you don\u2019t have to do that.

You're not stupid and once you're in that environment and then you see a different school. It's gonna be difficult. I'm just saying that Boston isn't a bad place. If you're thinking of partying, then Boston is okayish, but most places close by 10. But if you want to study, and you have a goal to maybe Change something in the world and what not, you can do anywhere, BUT the teachers matter. You can get great faculty advice in MIT. I've lived in boston and it seems like a pretty dead city to me, and I've seen mit campus (it's no great). Kid I'm in final year college. I got a sat 1330(not great ik but without studying) but let an opportunity slip, and then am here in another country in a stupid Engineering program. This brings you forward for 15 years if you take it(just an extra push). You may be able to do the same stuff in other colleges but you also may not. Mit according to me has another advantage. Harvard closeby. One of my friends at harvard dragged me with him to mit and he spammed every single professor out there to work under them and he went to their office because it was close by. You get an added advantage there.\nAnd you just gotta put on a happy face and go to school. You never knew what strikes next. Maybe USC isn't a fairy tale too. You'd have to make contacts at both places. USC would have great people too but here  added advantages. + If your parents can afford it, then go for it kid.",

All my life my parents and family and friends were always like \u201cyou\u2019re gonna go to MIT\u201d and for the longest time I really did believe that MIT was my dream school. I mean like how could it not be? I loved STEM and like MIT is the place for STEM. Ergo, it\u2019s my dream school. And these feelings were still with me even when I got my decision letter. I was so nervous and scared and when I found out I got in I was unbelievably happy I broke down crying. I had gotten into my dream school. I applied to other schools and would wait for them to come out but I knew I wanted to go to MIT. But then as the year progressed and I really researched MIT and then looked at other colleges I had gotten into I realized that MIT really never was my dream school. It was my parents dream school. The more and more I thought about it the more I realized I won\u2019t be happy there and that\u2019s the most important thing in college. I\u2019ll admit I was scared to tell my parents that I no longer wanted to go to MIT but I just knew I couldn\u2019t let myself spend four years at a place that won\u2019t truly make me happy. I\u2019m truly sorry that your parents have put up such strong opposition to your decision. But I believe that college is a time for you to not only get a great education but to explore new things and to find yourself. College is supposed to help you grow and be a better person and if a certain place will only tear you down and break you down than that\u2019s not the place for you. The education doesn\u2019t matter unless you\u2019re in a healthy state to be receiving that education. I know it\u2019s tough to like think about going to another school when it\u2019s MIT and like IT\u2019S MIT and it\u2019s absolutely incredible especially when you\u2019re meeting resistance from your parents or peers. But in the end, go wherever you feel most comfortable where you can feel happy because that\u2019s where you\u2019ll be able to thrive and really get the most out of your college experience. I hope this helps sorry it was a bit long.",

Kendall Square (where MIT is) is my favorite area in the city. Kendall Sq. is awesome, there is so much to do there. Will you be able to enjoy the area if you're unhappy? - No.\n\nMIT is a fantastic school,  no doubt but you need to decide for yourself whether or you'll be happy there. 10 years out of school no one cares where you went, they care about is how you're able to apply the skills that you've learned. It's not like USC has a super high acceptance rate, it's still very competitive. USC's acceptance rate is only \\~3% lower than Cornell's.",

Both USC and MIT are great school and I\u2019m sure that whichever school you choose to go to, you will definitely make it into your career of choice, whatever that may be. I wouldn\u2019t even take into account where your parents want you to go because it is most likely driven by their desire for a good image within their social bubble, which is disgusting. I have asian friends and it disgusting how much their parents care about their image and how they force their kids to do things for THEIR OWN IMAGE. Your life belongs to you.

As much as our parents want the best for us, at the end of the day we're the ones that are going to be putting in the time and work to make that happen. USC has made a very good name for itself in many careers and it is a fine choice for any. At the end of the day, sure some doors will open up to you if you go to MIT that otherwise wouldn't, but USC will open up several doors for you as well. I think that prestige is a minute factor in choosing a college. MIT and USC carry you to a certain point, what'll carry you past that point is what I call the you component (your values, ethics, creativity, etc.). The reason why MIT has such a high employability rate is because the students that go there end up developing their you components well, and this is because they fit with the school's vibe. If you think that USC will give you a better you component and better promote your growth then that's the school for you. If your parents don't understand your choice now, prove them wrong in the future. Trust me, if you go to MIT and you end up doing poorly because you don't fit with the program, they'll probably find a way to pin that on you anyways (I speak from personal experience). People will always find a way to blame whoever they want to blame.",

Last year he got accepted to MIT and Caltech, and probably some other really good schools too, and he turned them all down for USC. Since I'd always wanted to go to MIT, I asked him why he chose USC, and he said that their really intense academics were only a small part of the reason. I don't remember any of his other reasons cause this was like last year but USC was a better school for him than MIT.\n\nIt made me question whether or not I actually wanted to go to MIT, and though I ended up deciding that I did, I realized I would be just as happy at my other top choices. Ultimately my decision wasn't about rankings, but about how much I vibed with the culture at each school. I hope your parents realize how good of a school USC is, and more importantly, how much better of a school it is for you.\n\nEdit: if it helps, I am also a good bit terrified of the academic rigor.

However, they also know that there\u2019s more to life than just good grades, and support me in what ever college I choose as long as I am happy. In the end, I chose USC over NYU stern even though I know Stern is more prestigious and academically rigorous, because I know I will be miserable at Stern.

Your parents may have some harsh words for you, but it\u2019s you who has to live with your decision for the next four years. Do not choose something you feel pressured into choosing, ESPECIALLY MIT.

MIT, more so than other prestigious schools thrive on the reputation of being exceptionally tough. Since it's an institute and not a comprehensive college, it is less diverse. At least three of friends were miserable there and they all say they would've enjoyed another school more. MIT is really only right for some people. It takes a specific type to go to MIT, get through it and enjoy it. Also, weather plays a pretty big role, sunny SoCal is probably a lot better for the mindset than harsh New England. \n\nA lot of Asian parents don't believe in mental health challenges, they think it's an indication of weakness; they even scoff at people talking about suicide. Tell them you want to enjoy college and that you are an adult and need to take responsibility for your own life and stop listening to them. It's super hard, but it's literally YOUR life at stake.",

You seem like you\u2019ve already considered these things and after that it\u2019s just about overall happiness for the most part. If the stress you feel about grades and school is anything like mine, I would seriously suggest picking the school that seems easier. I know that when I get too stressed about school, I shut everything else in my life down. I don\u2019t hang out with my family because I\u2019m doing schoolwork. I don\u2019t hang out with friends because I\u2019m tired from doing schoolwork. I don\u2019t clean my room or do anything productive except schoolwork and I check my grades several times a day and it\u2019s really unhealthy and stressful. After a while I either break down entirely or manage to convince myself to slow down because I start realizing what I\u2019m doing to myself. Personally, I couldn\u2019t go to a school knowing that it\u2019s going to be four years of that kind of living. Plus, some advice about your parents, I know you\u2019re real worried about them cutting ties with you, but if they\u2019re willing to do that over this, then they\u2019ll be willing to do that later on when you decide that maybe you want a career they don\u2019t want for you, or you want to marry someone they don\u2019t approve of, or some other big change in your life. Some kind of falling out is inevitable with people who have to have it their way or the highway, especially with huge life decisions like this. I\u2019m not saying your relationship with them isn\u2019t worth preserving, but it is very possible that they\u2019ll find something else to be upset with you over if not this, so you might as well do what will make you be happier and healthier.",

I would agree that they might not have been the most productive or sensitive, and might have made you feel insecure. But once you answer this question, I think you should be at more peace. Is your fear of failing keeping you from doing what you really want? In my experience fear is almost never worth your desires or aspirations. You don't ever want to look back on life and think \"I could have done it...just maybe\". Always give yourself that chance if that's truly what you want. You will surprise yourself. Yes it will probably be hard, yes you will doubt yourself. That is normal and all part of the process. But imagine. When you finally make it through, trying your absolute hardest (which doesn't have to be all As btw). But going after something that you really believe you would enjoy and benefit from and attempting to make it work is the BEST feeling. You Are smart, you ARE capable, you ARE strong. Don't underestimate yourself. :)\n\nAlso, your parents probably feel harsh because they love you, and they probably see so much potential in you. That's all. Parents are usually scared their kids will make the same mistakes as them or not be able to take advantage of the opportunities they wish they'd have. A lot of the times their fear manifest as anger; but trust, it comes from a good place. With that said, it must feel restricting to be fitting their mold instead of them allowing you to express yourself and try different things.\n\nIn the end bud, your mind is a powerful thing. Just take to to evaluate. And remember, trust in yourself all the way. Reach your highest brilliance.",

I committed to MIT a half hour ago, but I made sure that it was truly what I wanted, and not what my parents have \u201cbrainwashed\u201d (not really, but you get the idea) me into believing I would be happy there. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you still read these, but something that I brought up around my parents was how it really depends on the person. Someone who goes to MIT but never focuses on their grades or opportunities or something could easily do worse in life than someone who stands out in a state school. Guilt trip them. If they love you and trust you, then they should believe you would do well no matter what university you go to.",

      "text": "Congrats on your acceptances OP! I had to make a similar decision for my Master's degree so I can relate to how incredibly stressful this can be. Sorry to hear of your parents' reactions. My parents were likewise adamant that I pick the more prestigious college - the prestige difference of the schools was greater than between USC and MIT, and they were mind-blown that I was hesitating. I ultimately chose the less prestigious school to avoid loan debt well into the 6 figures and since the program was more well-rounded.\n\nI do have regrets, partly cuz I found the campus culture and location uninspiring and limiting, whereas the other school was in a vibrant city with seemingly countless opportunities. That said I ended up where I hoped to for my first job after graduation and with manageable debt, so perhaps I made the right choice. However, in my field the college name isn't so important as long as one has solid training and experience, which my school provided. Depending on your career interests, MIT would likely offer more support than USC. Prestige plays a big role in some fields (e.g., business, law).\n\nIt sounds like you're underselling yourself - you seem very capable and bright and have obviously worked super hard. Don't doubt your ability to succeed. You might have confirmation bias regarding MIT. Yeah it's known to be tough but I wouldn't be too fearful of the rigour compared to USC. I've attended several universities in diff countries of varying reputations/perceived toughness (global rankings of \\~30-400, just googled this); they were all hard lol. \n\nAssuming money isn't a major issue, I agree with the posts here suggesting to try out MIT for a year and if it's not for you, consider transferring to USC. USC is no slouch of a school though and I think you can't really go wrong either way. :)",

No one else. \n\nUSC is a fantastic school with a lot of good programs, and if you really see yourself there and think you\u2019ll fit in and have a good time, then that\u2019s the place to go. But if you\u2019re in love with the MIT academics, how can you help your mental health? I know a lot of colleges offer access to professionals that you can talk to, and I know that there are other kids there struggling, and getting a strong group of friends that you can trust and talk to will be super beneficial. \n\nRegardless of what you do, I know all of us on this subreddit are super proud of you, and you\u2019ll do amazing wherever you go!!",
