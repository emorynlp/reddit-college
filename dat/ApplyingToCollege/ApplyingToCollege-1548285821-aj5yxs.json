You should know some things since not everything is exactly like it was in the Monsters University documentary starring Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan. Greek life is still a HUGE thing here. Oozma Kappa has a way better reputation than it did back then. They\u2019re not super scary but the people there are chill so it\u2019s great for non scarers. Roar Omega Roar is slowly dying down. Everyone saw the truth about it in the documentary so not many people have wanted to join since then. Other than that, everything\u2019s still pretty much the same. The Scare Games are almost identical every year, but I can\u2019t share what the other events have been! Come join our school!
