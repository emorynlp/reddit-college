If you need financial aid, this will vary between these schools. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based estimate before you apply. NYU's NPC has a reputation for being less accurate. If I had to guess affordability between these options: Tufts/CMU>Northeastern/BU>NYU.\n\nI don't think Tufts has an undergrad business program, but look through their options for minors, certificates, etc.",

      "text": "If you're most interested in comp sci, CMU is the clear winner. If you're most interested in business, NYU is the clear answer.\n\nI can't comment too much about CS since Idk about the reputations of schools like Tufts or BU in CS. For business though it goes:\n\nTier 1: NYU\n\nTier 2: CMU, maybe Tufts\n\nTier 3: BU, NEU*\n\nNEU is the least prestigious of the list and has the weakest alumni networks but it also has its co-op programs which really helps it place kids into positions that they otherwise wouldn't be able to recruit for. CMU has improved its business program recently and it's a decent semi-target, but they're not really close at all to NYU in terms of finance recruiting. \n\nI'll be real with you. I'm a comp sci and business major and I'll say that the overlap is a lot more theoretically good than it is good in practice. The prestige careers of business (finance, consulting) won't really care that much about your CS major other than finding it interesting and the impact it can have on your GPA will likely overweigh the benefits of being novel. (Note: you also don't need a business degree for them.) Meanwhile, the CS jobs won't really care about your business degree. If you look at quant jobs for example, they make it clear that a foundation in finance is unnecessary since they're confident they can teach it to you. There are some careers where both are applicable, but I've found in my experience that the majority of people who are doing both end up in careers where one would've been perfectly fine (I'm a good example of this; I work in analytics and my business degree was wholly useless in securing my job lol. Everyone else on my team has a STEM degree, the only other person with a business degree did the same thing as me lol.) \n\nSo basically, I'd advise you to figure out what careers you want to pursue and from there choose which schools/field to prioritise. If I were you, I'd personally go the CS route in which case CMU is unmatched but that's really a preference basis. I realised I liked CS only after I'd already finished freshman yr which was unfortunate.",
