Like if I lived in NC I probably would not leave. \n\nMy dream school is Washington and Lee in Lexington, VA. They\u2019re pretty small, have highest CPA exam pass rate in the country (so they have my major which is accounting), and then have some cool things like Mock Con and Spring Term! I\u2019m hoping I can be one of the recipients of a full ride scholarship they give 10% of their class, but we\u2019ll see. Otherwise there\u2019s no way I can afford it :/\n\nI also applied to Richmond, their campus is super pretty! I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to afford it though if I am accepted.",
