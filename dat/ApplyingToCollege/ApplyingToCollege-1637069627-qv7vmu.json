  "text": "Being brutally honest, it was one of worst Internships ever. My task was to code the website, with major functionalities like Auth, routers etc. For the first few weeks, everything goes well... then, the nightmare starts.  \n\n\nThe \"CEO\" started giving me work I never signed up for. Updating some random form data????? updating link tree links???? Jesus Christ I don't even want to think about that anymore. I kid you not, the \"CEO\" guaranteed wasn't doing ANY WORK AT ALL.  \n\n\nShit pissed me off so much. I'm glad I got out of there. Uhh, yeah, that was a rant. I'm done :DD",

I'm only human, I may have forgotten about how many things you are already working on.  \n\nMeaningful HS Internships are uncommon as hell, and you just walked away from one.  \n\nLots of HS Internships working with technology actual involve putting paper in the copy machine, and listening to others talk about a project on a conference call.  \n\nYou were writing code, **real code**, and interacting directly with a CEO or VIP at the organization, as a HS Intern, and you walked away because you didn't think it was fair that you thought you might be doing more work than you thought was fair or something.  \n\nYou could have built people-relationships & connections that may have been really helpful come graduation time when you need a job...  \n\nI hope it was worth it.",
