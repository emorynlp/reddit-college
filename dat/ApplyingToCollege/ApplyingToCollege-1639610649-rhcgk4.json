  "text": ">The Admissions Committee has completed a careful evaluation of your application for admission to Lehigh. I regret to inform you that, although the Committee was impressed with your academic credentials, we are unable to offer you admission. The demand for international financial assistance exceeds the amount available to award and so financial aid needs become an important factor when considering international applicants. Had more funding been available, we would have been able to extend an offer of admission to you.\n\nwhat does this even f\\* mean?? my application went through till Fin Aid??",

          "text": "Because of the ways college is paid in the United States.\n\nThanks to heavy subsidies, a U.S. citizen or resident can access a large amount of money via student loans. These loans, in turn, need to be paid back, and they are one of the hardest types of loans to get written off in the event of bankruptcy.\n\nThat\u2019s right, if you go broke and need to get your credit card debts, underwater mortgage, and repossessed car loan wiped out, but you went to a private college and got a degree which cost $80,000 and a job which pays less than $30,000 per year, you will still owe that $80 grand plus accrued interest.\n\nSo, this debt basically follows you anywhere in the U.S. Couldn\u2019t you just avoid it by leaving the country? Why yes, yes you could, and degrees from American colleges are well respected in many other countries. But if you ever wanted to return to the U.S. after trying to skip out on your debts, you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised to find that interest continued to accrue, your creditors probably have a judgement against you and liens on any property you might possess, your FICO is shot, etc.\n\nSo, just stay away from the good ol\u2019 U.S.A. and you\u2019ll be fine, right? Well, about that: It is actually pretty difficult to establish oneself in another country with minimal cash, no ability to work, and little form of support from an extended familial and social network.\n\nBy now you should be seeing where this is going: foreign nationals coming to the U.S. have much less to tie them here where we can force them to make payments on student loans, and much greater support back home where they might be able to use that degree to obtain a relatively high wage where costs of living are low compared to the United States.\n\nAs a result, foreign nationals do not qualify for the type of federal student loans a citizen can typically obtain via FAFSA. Schools offering scholarships have budgets set by their boards, and those budgets have fixed limits on the amount of aid available to international students. Those dollars are extremely competitive, since the limited supply coupled with the high demand of people like OP means that the price, in this case being the qualifications of the recipient, is astronomically high.",

      "text": "\"is Lehigh need blind?\"\n\"For the vast majority of applicants we do not consider whether they are applying for financial aid or how much FA they might need to attend Lehigh. For a very small portion those financial considerations may become one factor among many in an admission decision. In all cases our review will remain holistic and in no cases will the ability or inability to pay become the only or primary factor.\"\nLike the comments suggest, it seems that being an international student is a big factor.
