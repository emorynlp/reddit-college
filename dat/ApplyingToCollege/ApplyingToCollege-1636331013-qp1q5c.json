  "text": "I am a transfer applicant who has graduated hs and cc already and I\u2019m in a gap year after I got my associates. I was on the common app and it gave me the option of requesting a fee waiver for being a pell grant recipient but then said a counselor would have to approve. I don\u2019t have a counselor? Who exactly are they sending this request to? Are they sending a request to my hs because I graduated in 2015 :\u2019) idk pls help",
