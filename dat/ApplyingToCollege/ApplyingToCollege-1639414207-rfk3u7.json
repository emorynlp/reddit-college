Just know that for most classes, you will have less priority than HMC students.\n\nYou should see the [special majors guidelines](http://catalog.pitzer.edu/content.php?catoid=17&navoid=1365#Guidelines_for_Special_Majors) that Pitzer puts out.",

If you really want to study CS, you should apply to HMC/CMC/Pomona.",
