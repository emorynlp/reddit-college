Just know that for most classes, you will have less priority than HMC students.\n\nYou should see the [special majors guidelines](http://catalog.pitzer.edu/content.php?catoid=17&navoid=1365#Guidelines_for_Special_Majors) that Pitzer puts out.",

If you really want to study CS, you should apply to HMC/CMC/Pomona.",

      "text": "Hello, CMC junior here. Absolutely DO NOT rely on cross-campus enrollment for CS at Mudd. Mudd realized a little while back that people were exploiting other 5Cs\u2019 lower acceptance rates to essentially \u201cattend\u201d Mudd by fully taking their CS program instead of majoring at their own school. The demand around the 5Cs for Mudd CS has gotten so crazy that Mudd has been starting to close its availability for CS classes to other 5C students. It\u2019s been incredibly difficult to get into their intro CS course, CS5, and I recently failed to get into their 2nd-level course, CS60, this most recent registration cycle. Do yeah, try to avoid doing this if possible. It\u2019ll bite you in the ass. Let me know if you have any other questions; I\u2019m happy to help.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit: CMC has CS courses as well, and they are not bad\u2014it\u2019s just that the quality is eclipsed by Mudd\u2019s classes. If you\u2019re interested in applying to the 5Cs and are dead set on CS, aim for Mudd, but realize that CMC and Pomona are also options.",
