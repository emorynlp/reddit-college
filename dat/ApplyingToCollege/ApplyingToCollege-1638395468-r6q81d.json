  "text": "I applied early action to Northeastern, University of Miami and Villanova. \n\nI sent in my CSS before the November 15th deadlines and uploaded my documents. It told me sent and received and I only recently found out you can check financial aid status on your application portal.\n\nIt\u2019s not received for any schools but Villanova. I called UMiami and they told me it\u2019s because my forms aren\u2019t signed, I don\u2019t have a non custodial parent waiver, and something about a mismatch information between W-2s and tax form. \n\nSo I\u2019m trying to figure that situation out but does anyone know if passing my docs late effect my financial Aid at all? \n\nEveryone is trying to calm me down and say deadlines don\u2019t actually matter but if not why do early action and regular decision applicants have different financial aid deadlines? Aka early action has early deadline. \n\nWhy did Villanova accept it? \n\nAlso when I resubmit my docs do I do it through IDOC or the actual application portal?",

      "text": "Breathe. It\u2019ll be ok. They are still playing with financial aid in April because people they offer it to don\u2019t accept. Just get those documents in. Usually financial aid is handled separately from admissions. If you applied on time you\u2019ll still be considered the same way. Just fix it promptly.",
