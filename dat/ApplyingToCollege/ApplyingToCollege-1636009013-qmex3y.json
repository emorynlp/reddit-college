  "text": "Hi, does anyone have information on this program because I had a lot of questions about? (Acceptance rate/transfer opportunities/difficulty of courses/degree)\n\nMy gpa is a 3.75 and my sat is 1450 with a 39/45 IB predicted score and good ecs (2 internships, 2 research papers, 1 publication, varsity athletics and decent guitar player)\n\nIt\u2019ll also be helpful to know how easy/difficuly it is to transfer to the dual program once admitted in a standard engineering program",

      "text": "From what I read, Emory has no \u201cstandard engineering program\u201d. You enroll and earn a different degree in a different Major, then spend another 1-2 years earning another BS at GT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>This partnership between Emory and Georgia Institute of Technology allows you to earn a BA or BS in any of Emory\u2019s majors and then transfer to Georgia Tech to deepen your focus on engineering. Upon completion, you\u2019ll have two bachelors degrees, one from Emory and one from Georgia Tech.    \nThe program usually takes five to six years to complete.  \n\nIf you want a GT engineering degree, enrolling there seems a lot easier, in four years.",
