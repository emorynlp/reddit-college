  "text": "My first app is due October 15 (this Friday) and 2 of my 4 teachers still need to submit recommendations. \n\nI let them know about needing these several weeks ago and sent them a follow up email over the past weekend. One teacher said he\u2019ll work on them during the weekend and the other didn\u2019t respond. \n\nDo I assume they have things under control or should I send them a follow up email?",
