  "text": "i didn\u2019t really think this one through before i registered, but i realized recently that it can take up to 3 weeks for scores to get sent and processed after i find out my score (december 13). i\u2019m not sure how likely it taking 3 weeks is, but it\u2019s stressing me out cause i\u2019ve studied hard for this test lol",
