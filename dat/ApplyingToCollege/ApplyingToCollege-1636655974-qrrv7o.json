  "text": "I submitted my app on nov 1st, for one of my main ECs which is volunteering I wrote about my own projects, however I participated in a lot of other projects too. because of the word limit I just wrote smth like \"attended various volunt projects\". Can i email admission to tell them about other projects where I participated? Is it too late? And how should I email them? Help me pls!!! (p.s. I forgot about additional information section) considering that I can definitely add a lot more info",

The additional info section isn't really used to write about activities, anyways, it's more for extenuating circumstances. So personally I wouldn't email the AOs, not major enough of a change for them to care.",
