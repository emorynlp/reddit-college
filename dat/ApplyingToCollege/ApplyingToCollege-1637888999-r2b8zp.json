  "title:": "[Freshman] Courses and GPA question",
  "text": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI am a male Freshman. I had a few questions about GPA and courses so i have came here in hope to get them answered.\n\nSo my first question: Will colleges see that i have that i have taken harder courses and give me little extra credit for that? I am asking this because my GPA is not the best but i am taking harder courses so does that counterweight the low GPA?\n\nExample:\n\nMy current courses and grades as freshman:\n\nHonors Algebra 2: B\n\nHonors Biology: A\n\nAP Computer Science A: A\n\nEnglish 9: A\n\nWorld History / Civics: A\n\nSpanish 2: A\n\nFitness: A\n\nOverall GPA is 3.8 Unweighted\n\nNow heres a example schedule of someone else:\n\nAlgebra 1: A\n\nBiology: A\n\nEnglish 9: A\n\nWorld History / Civics: 9: A\n\nSpanish 1: A\n\nArt: A\n\nFitness: A\n\nOverall GPA is 4.0 Unweighted\n\nSo the first transcript (my transcript) has a 3.8 GPA but i am taking Honors and AP's. The example students transcript has a clean 4.0 GPA but isnt taking any Honors or AP's. Which student would a selective college most likely take?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance",
