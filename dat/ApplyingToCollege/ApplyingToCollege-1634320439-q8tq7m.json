  "text": "So I got a 30 on the ACT, (31 Math, 29 Science, 29 English, 32 Reading) and a 1400 super score on the SAT (720 Math, 680 English/Reading) should I submit both scores for EA? Or just the SAT since its slightly proportionally higher? I do plan on taking the ACT again which I could easily super score to a 31 if any of my sections go up.",
