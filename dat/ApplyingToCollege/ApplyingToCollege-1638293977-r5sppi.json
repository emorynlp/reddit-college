  "title:": "Question on UNC-CH tuition",
  "text": "[https://cashier.unc.edu/tuition-fees/](https://cashier.unc.edu/tuition-fees/)  \nSo I was looking on the UNC website, and it mentioned how the tuition system changed to a \"per-credit-hour\" basis. Would someone be willing to explain how exactly it works? I also used the tuition estimator, and the tuition costs felt incredibly low, especially since I am OOS. I was wondering if that tuition calculator takes into account income for example or if I am missing something because it felt kinda off to me. Thanks in advance!",
