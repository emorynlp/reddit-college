You got this.\n\nSince UC PIQ does not have to be an essay format (even bullet points are told to be fine), you don't have to be pressured to make them in a beautiful sentence.\n\nMove on to write the draft asap since we forget.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading and leave any comment or feedback! :)",
