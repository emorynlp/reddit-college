  "text": "Hello everyone! So recently, I started an account for applying to Biola. However, I have changed my mind and wish to delete my account as well as the application I started (I did not submit it). I can\u2019t find anywhere that will allow me to delete it, so would just leaving the application to sit there until the deadline just automatically nullify my account and/or application?",
