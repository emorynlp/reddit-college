We know this is disappointing news.\n\nAdmission to Wellesley will be especially competitive this year, given the large and very talented applicant pool. Since many applicants present strong records of achievement, admission to Wellesley is highly selective, and it will not be possible for us to offer admission to all students who could be successful here.\n\nYou will receive your admission decision through your Applicant Portal in late March. We appreciate all the work you have done throughout high school, as well as the time and care you have taken to present us with your credentials. I hope this early information will be helpful in your college planning. \n\nThe Board of Admission is grateful for your interest in Wellesley and wishes you the best as you pursue your education.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJoy St. John  \nDean of Admission and Financial Aid",
