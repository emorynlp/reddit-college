  "text": "Hi,\n\nI took the ACT more than once and I\u2019m taking the SAT soon. I have the option of sending ACT scores to universities for free on the website. Does this free offer only last until the test scores come back to me or can I wait some time to compare my ACT to my SAT (and decide whether to submit ACT) and then still submit my ACT to four universities for free?\n\nThanks.",

      "text": "I\u2019m pretty sure ACT is like SAT - you select free sends before the scores are received. There\u2019s a cost afterwards.\n\nUnless you\u2019re confident that your score will meet the minimum you want to send to a school, it\u2019s usually a good idea to wait.",
