  "text": "In short:\nI'll be honest here. I am from India, want to become\u00a0a video editor and basically get PR and settle in Canada. Please suggest some good uni/colleges in Vancouver.\n\nIn Detail:\nI love video editing and I want to continue this as my career.\nBut the problem is that there are not any good colleges/uni here in New Delhi and even if I take online course the pay here is very low.\nI'll be graduating high school in 2022 and (most probably) will come Canada for higher studies (coz my cousin lives there).\u00a0\nI know a lot of people will say that I should take some online course and it will be worth way more than any university, But the thing is I want to settle in Canada coz of lot of reasons\u00a0\n(Like income equality, affordability,etc.) . So I might as well attend a college/uni related to career I want to pursue.\nBut all the colleges that I am searching for either turn out\u00a0to be\u00a0a\u00a0scam - like or are not worth the student loan debt.\u00a0\nSo, it would be really helpful if you can suggest me few colleges/uni which are worth money and maybe give work permit.\nThank you in advance!!",

      "text": "UBC Film School or Simon Fraser's Film in the Contemporary School of Arts are good bets. Emily Carr has a Film + Media arts program that might be good too, although I don't know much about it - they're more famous for visual arts (my sister went there for art).\n\nOther private schools like the Vancouver Film School are not worth it as they let anyone in and are absurdly expensive.",
