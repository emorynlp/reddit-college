  "text": "I can\u2019t tell you how little I give a shit now. I am perfectly fine going to my safety and I actually would love it there. I\u2019m so much happier, so much more balanced. I actually want to do my hobbies again. Prestige, I say this so much, DOES NOT matter in STEM and that\u2019s what 90% of you are. I literally promise you this. STEM is far far far more meritocratic than other industries and being a 3.7 at a state school in eng is better than 3.2 at Brown.",
