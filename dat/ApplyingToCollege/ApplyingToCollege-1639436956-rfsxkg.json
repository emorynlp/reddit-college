  "text": "I feel like my essays are very unique and creative in terms of content and personality, but I feel like the writing style is slightly bland (it's somewhat flowery, but when you read it you can kind of tell a high schooler wrote it unlike a college student). Do AO's look out for this or just the essay content?",

Your supps can be written well, but if the don\u2019t say anything worthwhile, then what\u2019s the point? I\u2019d rather see an average written essay with an amazing story",

      "text": "Content over form every time, but also bear in mind that a bit of form goes a long way. Simple things like using a hook or having a couple of rhetorical questions to engage the reader keep people's interest and help them get to the end of all that good content you have. \n\nI like to think of it as a car. The mechanical bits are what really matters, but if the paint job was all scuffed and it had dents everywhere, you probably wouldn't buy it, even if it ran on nothing but hopes and dreams.\n\nBut you don't have to sound like the next Hemingway, and if you do and your content doesn't hold up, it won't matter. Just like a Ferrari without an engine isn't likely to get many buyers.",
