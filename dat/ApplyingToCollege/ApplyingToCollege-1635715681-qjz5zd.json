  "title:": "I'm an alumni interviewer. This is what will happen during your alumni interview",
  "text": "Hi guys, I've noticed that interviews have started to roll in for students who have applied Early Decision to their chosen schools. As an alumni volunteer, I interview ten students every year for my school, and I think the policies we follow are about what you should expect from any school. So I'm going to explain to you our side of things so that you have a better idea of what you're walking into.\n\nAs always, the reason I'm writing this is to help prevent you from freaking out. College applications was a very stressful time for me, and only much later did I find out that most of the things that caused me stress were based on misconceptions about the application process. What can I say? The internet was young then!\n\nOne of the things that caused me a huge amount of unnecessary stress was the belief that alumni interviews are an important part of the application process. They're not. Admissions officers are professionals; they're not going to outsource their decisions to untrained alumni. After all, those alumni might not (for instance) understand the application process themselves or might not understand how the university has changed since they were students. And they certainly won't be able to see the bigger picture of the whole class the admissions office is trying to build.\n\nWhy do alumni interviews exist? I believe they are there to help get you excited about the university and to make alums feel more connected to the university. Alums donate money; making them feel connected to the school is a big deal.\n\nYou will probably get an email from the alum's personal email to set up an appointment. We get a list of emails belonging to students that corresponds with the number of students we volunteered to interview. Usually, all of the students we interview are from the same region. We have a web form that we keep updated on our side that lets the school know whether we have reached out to students and whether they have gotten in touch after we reached out. I don't believe it makes any difference to your admission if you don't reply to our email. You should probably reply anyway, so you don't leave a poor alumni volunteer hanging.\n\nThere is a list of things we aren't allowed to do, and we complete a training seminar every year so that we remember the list of things we aren't allowed to do. Those things include bad-talking other schools, asking you challenge questions like we're helming a job interview for Google, and challenging you to a board game. If your interviewer does this, they probably weren't supposed to. We're also not allowed to give some students more time than others, so if you read anyone writing that their alumni interview lasted all afternoon because they really hit it off with their interviewer... that probably didn't happen.\n\nYou can send a note to the admissions office if the interviewer does something really egregious. But even if you have an interview that you wish had gone better, the alum's comments on the interview are not, in my opinion, likely to affect your application. I think admissions officers even say openly that the alumni interview has the least weight of any factor.\n\nAgain, my goal here is to keep you from freaking out. Have fun during the interview, use it as an opportunity to learn more about the school, and use it as an opportunity to practice being interviewed. Alums love talking about their college days, so if you ask them about their college experience, they'll remember you as a really interesting conversationalist. (People remember conversations where they talk about themselves as interesting conversations.)\n\nIf you follow that up with, \"And based on your own experience, how do you see someone like me fitting into the student life at Unseen University?\", you put them in a position where they have to make the case, when they answer, for your admission. This is a technique that salespeople use to get clients to sell themselves the product.\n\nThat's it. That's all I've learned about talking with other people in all of my decades on Earth. Good luck out there, and please take care of yourself during application season. This, too, will pass.",

But here they are!\n\nI start with \"Tell me about yourself.\" Then I ask them what interests them about the school, although that would already be clear from their telling me about themselves.\n\nAfter that, it varies from interview to interview. I'll probably ask them what they're looking for in a college education, then tell them some things they might not already know about why my school is a great choice based on what they're looking for. I might ask them about their future career. I definitely ask them whether they have specific questions for me about the school. (We have one very distinctive aspect to the campus social culture that they usually ask about.)\n\nWe spend most of the interview on stuff that's specific to that applicant; talking about her passion for sculpture or biomechatronics or whatever.\n\nSpeaking only for myself, I want them to be comfortable and have a good experience. I usually take a moment to say what I always say here, which is that they are going to have a great educational experience wherever they go; higher education in the United States is very good, and the kids who come to these interviews will make a great path for themselves anywhere.",

I tend to ask general things about ECs, favorite classes, interesting experiences, etc.  I also ask about what you would consider an accomplishment, and I tend to ask if you see any negatives to your chosen passion/profession/whatever you want to accomplish.\n\nI don't have any specific answers I'm expecting.  Mostly want to see that people are thinking about different aspects of whatever it is they want to pursue.\n\nE.g.: \"I want to build a great new company going cool tech stuff.\"\n\nMe: \"that's great, and obviously seems like a great thing to do.  Do you see any potential downsides to building a new company doing cool tech stuff?\"\n\nIt's fine with me if they mention something (e.g. \"tech companies use limited natural resources\" or \"it encourages consumerism\" or anything else, really), and then tell me why they still think it's worthwhile to do what they want to do, or how _their_ company wouldn't have these downsides.  That's fine. It's not a test.  I just want to know how that person thinks.",

In order:\n\nInterviewers don't choose the student they are going to interview; they just get a list that consists, for each student, of the name, email address, and school they attend. They are not allowed to friend the students on social media.\n\nSome extra information about choice: interviewers often choose to interview for their own region, but they can volunteer to interview for a region that doesn't have a lot of alumni interviewers. This is what I do. I then get assigned a region, and so far it's always been a single city, although the city has been different every year. I've never interviewed students who go to the same school, although I don't know whether that's by design.\n\nBecause I volunteer to interview for other regions, I've only ever done alumni interviews online. Even though everyone is online because of COVID, interviews are still grouped by region; this is because *other* alumni volunteer to manage the whole process, and those alumni are interview chairs for their regions. So it's an organizational thing. It provides centralized nodes for managing what would otherwise be a very confusing process.",
