  "text": "If you could go to any giant public school with around a 50% acceptance rate, purely for culture, which would you choose and why?\n\nDon't think about the things that really matter like cost, distance from home, major, etc. I want to know which one you think you personally would enjoy your time at the most.\n\nHere are the ones I can think of off the top of my head, if I missed any let me know:\n\nBig 10: Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, THE Ohio State, Maryland, Penn State, Purdue\n\nEvery Other Conference: Washington, Pittsburgh, NC State, Clemson, Georgia, Texas A&M, UConn, UCSC, Virginia Tech",
