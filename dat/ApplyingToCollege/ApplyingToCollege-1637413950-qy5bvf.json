  "text": "Hey A2C! I'm just wondering if applying as an environmental studies/sustainability/agriculture major will increase my chances of acceptance. And the thing is I actually have a lot of unique ECs relating to these majors so I wouldn't be making stuff up. It would be easy to write essays about them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing is I want to switch to business/econ if I get accepted. So for Ivy Leagues, specifically Dartmouth and Brown, will applying as an environmental studies/sustainability/agriculture major increase my chances and will I be able to switch easily?",
