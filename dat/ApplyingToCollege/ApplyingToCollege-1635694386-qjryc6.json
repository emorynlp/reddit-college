  "text": "So, I \"made\" an art club, or I basically was the one to first email the advisor to start it, I found every person/recruited the people to join, I went back and forth to the advisor in order to make the club, would this mean I founded it?\n\nIt's a very chill club and it's not like I had to petition to the principal or do anything major to start it, so I feel like I'm exaggerating my importance by putting founder. However, I was the one who reached out/the only one that talks to the advisor, so I feel like I'm not just a participant. Thank you!",
