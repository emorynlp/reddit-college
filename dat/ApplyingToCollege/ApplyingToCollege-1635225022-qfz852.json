  "text": "\nWassup guys, I have a questions about college. I\u2019m currently a junior but my GPA for 9-11 right now is a 3.2 unweighted and 3.4 weighted. My Gpa would\u2019ve been a high 3.0 but Covid messed me up and I ended up getting a 2.6 gpa for 10th grade. I\u2019m taking pretty average classes, not to smart but not to dumb, and I\u2019ll bring my gpa up to 3.5 by the end of my junior year. What colleges could I go to if I wanna pursue nursing.",

              "text": "Same here:) bay area and applying as nursing. Anyways, cali nursing programs are the hardest to get into. The best two options i have for you is 1) go to a CC, complete prerequisites, get as high of a GPA as possible and apply to as many nursing schools as possible after completing the TEAS exam and the prereqs, or 2) apply to a cal state pre-nursing program, which then you will have to apply AGAIN after completing your prereqs and TEAS exam. If you are okay with CCs that\u2019s prob a better option, because CSU nursing acceptance rates are CRAZY. For example, Sac state last year, the nursing admits had an AVERAGE gpa of 4.0 on all college prereqs, crazy. ALSO, for many cal states, you won\u2019t even qualify to apply. I know for example Sonoma State\u2019s pre-nursing program requires a 3.7 GPA, not sure if weighted or unweighted but that already disqualifies you. You also need a B in every science and math class (including AP), to qualify to apply for pre-nursing in most cal states.",
