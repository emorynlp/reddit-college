      "text": "If you're interested in doing IB then NYU is the obvious answer. \n\nIf you want to be a Quant, CMU would be better, but you would also not be majoring in finance (or you'd double major and pick up a quant major like CS/Math/physics). \n\nIf you want to do consulting, then both schools do fairly well for consulting. Neither school is known for having a strength in consulting though (CMU tends to lean tech and NYU tends to lean finance). \n\nIf you're looking for other finance careers, both would be good. \n\nThey're also very different schools so consider what environment you want to be in.",
