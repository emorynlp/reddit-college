  "text": "I am a rising sophomore in a private high school in a big city. I\u2019m really invested into the humanities and want to be a lawyer. Really don\u2019t like stem so I like to stay away from that in regards to my ECs. However, I\u2019m struggling to find good extracurriculars to fit my profile. Can someone with similar interests PM me with any possible advice?",

      "text": "Other than mock trial, it's hard to get real law experience as a high schooler. Focus on your actual major. If you like politics, next year is midterm election season. Figure out who's running in your district/near you, and start cranking out those emails asking to intern for their campaigns. If you get lucky there might be an internship section on their campaign website, otherwise emailing is the way to go. You can also look for grassroots organizations supporting causes that you care about and reach out to them. Non-profits are always looking for more people. I want to be a lawyer too, and my politics experience was useful because I realized I don't like real-life politics as much as I thought I did. On the English side, you can submit your writing to literary magazines online and try to get published. PM with any questions!",
