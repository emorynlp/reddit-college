  "title:": "Do you really want to get into an Ivy League?",
  "text": "So I'm worrying about getting into college everyday and clearly there's no sense in it. But I also reflect on the people that I've met and where they got in. Some very smart, very hard working, kind souls that got rejected everywhere (but not really just the most selective places). Anyways. \n\nThis one guy I met sophomore year. He visited in our synagogue on a \"service\" trip to my city. But as it turns out this dude had already gotten into an Ivy League at the time. Jokingly, I asked him what the secret was, expecting him to say something silly. But with dead seriousness he said it was just doing things that would look good to Yale. Leading \"service trips\" and superficial non profits in his city. Clearly, he went to an all white high school as the things he said about poc were too problematic to repeat. He knew nothing about my city, only saw it as another step on his exploitive ass path. The fact that he traveled across the country when there are so many people in need in NY also pisses me off, creating CO2 too. I think this story just goes to show that admissions is BS. You can try to prepare and do the most prestigious things but at the end of the day, what's more important to you, to be an asshole, rich kid, with no moral compass, or be a decent human, with direction, intuition and something to be proud of within your self? If I had to do the things he's done to get into these schools, I don't think I could live with myself. Maybe this kid will never wake up to his and that's ok. It's up to the rest of to make the world a better place. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nno lie i saw him on tinder when i visited schools this fall and he had a disgusting thing about women in his bio LOL",

      "text": "This isn't a problem just for Ivy league. There are dipsticks everywhere, so it's helpful to browse the subs, visit the schools, follow the instas and TikToks, to see which types of assh*les you're willing to live with. \n\nMy kid took Cal State Long Beach off his list because some surfer dude couldn't tell him where coffee was. The guy was nice, but no coffee access and a beach drawl is not really my kid's vibe. That's fine, it's just a personality clash.\n\nIf you bumped into this guy on the Yale campus, would you care, or would you be embarrassed that you go to the same school? If you're embarrassed, then Yale is probably not for you and that's okay. Maybe Princeton has jerks you can live with.",
