I\u2019m scheduled to take calculus next semester but I know it\u2019ll hurt my gpa because I suck at math but I also want to have the best chances of getting in. Thanks in advance! :)",

      "text": "so I\u2019d gauge this question based on your major - for engineering they wanna see calc cause it\u2019s integral (lmao) to engineering but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s required. I wouldn\u2019t read too much into past admits, classes aren\u2019t a big deciding factor in the grand scheme of ecs gpa tests essays etc. Calc is a little tricky at first but if you work hard and put in the effort you\u2019ll get good at it since it\u2019s all based off very objective logic and calculation",
