  "title:": "Columbia or Stanford more prestigious?",
  "text": "Which is more prestigious? I know Stanford is the best tech school after MIT, but I am talking about the universities as a whole. Columbia is consistently ranked higher and is in the top tier of the Ivy League and has great social sciences and humanities combined with decent STEM (without too much focus on one area, unlike Stanford), so IMO Columbia. What do you think is the relative employer perception and lay prestige of these two schools?\n\nAnd which one do you think is more likely to overtake Princeton and Yale to become Harvard's rival in the future?",

Google CEO went to IIT, Stanford, and Wharton. Amazon CEO went to Harvard. Facebook CEO went to Harvard. The previous Microsoft CEO went to Harvard. (Granted, I don't think the almae matres of CEOs have much to do with current recruiting efforts, so I have no clue why you brought that up in the first place).\n2. Big tech isn't recruiting Harvard/Princeton/Columbia/etc. any less than Berkeley. Berkeley is a huge fucking school and has way more people interested in big tech, so their absolute numbers are higher. If you are going to Harvard, Google will take your call, don't worry. Very very few people are going to Berkeley/CMU over Harvard just because the former two are more known for CS.\n3. Very few people are going to Wharton/Columbia over Harvard/Stanford for business school, even if they are focused on management.\n\nI really feel like this sub goes overboard on the whole \"choose a university for its major\" sort of thing. The name on the diploma + overall fit is way more important than major-specific rankings...",
