Nonresident, US students from TX would pay the same rate as students from CT.\n\nSome public universities have an additional fee for internationals that puts the cost slightly higher than the cost for out-of-state students, but that is typically not much compared to the overall out of state cost.\n\nPSA, public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. OOS students pay 65-70k per year to attend UCs, no need-based aid. Exceptions, public universities that may offer some need-based aid to low-income out-of-state students (but not internationals) include U Mich, UNC, UVA; same advice applies, run the NPC to see an estimate.\n\nDomestic (US citizens and permanent residents) applicants should run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.",

Who said that his fees willl be way cheaper than mine even if he applies to another state(not his home state) and I thought all students except for instate pay the same amount. Ucla was a hypothetical example. And when you say small margin bw out of state and International what do the numbers sound like ? 5-10k difference?",
