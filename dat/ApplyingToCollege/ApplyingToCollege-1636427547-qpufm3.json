      "text": "Yeah interviewers are very unregulated it seems. For context, I interviewed last year; My stanford one was 20 mins and I ended up getting in so this probably won't affect anything. (I did see my admissions file and my interviewer wrote only 3 sentences and gave me mostly mediocre scores lol so that is smth to consider). Other interviews were a lot longer tho, 1 hr was standard but some did go longer (princeton specifically iirc). Not that it really matters, cuz I didn't get into ivies (Just applied to HYP). So yeah, basically? interview means very little in 97% of circumstances, so dw about it",
