      "text": "Do you want to go into Econ?\n\nUCLA doesn\u2019t have an undergrad business major. They offer an Econ major or a Business Economics major, which is a business-focused economics major.\n\nUSC has 5 Business Administration degrees (you major in Business Admin, and can select to not have a concentration or to choose one of their 4 concentrations: Intl Relations, Cinematic Arts, World, or Real Estate.) They also offer like 15 minors at Marshall, a wide variety.\n\nUSC is more well-known for Business & Marshall has awesome programs, academics, internships, and career opportunities.",
