  "text": "I submitted my ED application last Saturday on the 30th and I'm still stressed. I was hoping I could just put it out of my mind until like at least December, but I keep checking my portal for like no reason. I'm worried I'm only gonna get more attached to my ED school, and then more disappointed when I most likely don't get in. Does anyone that's been through this process have tips? Will this fade in like a week, or is it just stress until the decisions come out?",

Take a walk, long walk, meet friends for dinner, keep busy with fun stuff or chores...good chance to get caught up with cleaning/reorganizing your space. Do not let your obtrusive thoughts just sit there and grow like Hulk...move every single time to distract yourself. You cannot predict the outcome of ED apps or RD, for that matter. It is no longer under your control.",
