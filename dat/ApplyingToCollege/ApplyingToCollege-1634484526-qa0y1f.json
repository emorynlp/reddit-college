  "text": "I'm an international applicant with an SAT score of 1410 (EBRW 650 Math 760). I'm planning to apply to Fordham University this ED for their CS program. Should I submit my SAT, or go optional? \n\nMy academics are mediocre, with 83% marks in the Year final and a GPA of 5.00/ 5.00(unweighted). I'm the President of my High School English Club, and volunteer at two community organizations. Scholarships are my main priority.\n\nI'm feeling lost. Your suggestions will be highly valued. Thank you!",
