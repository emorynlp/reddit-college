Is there anyone else who\u2019s considering going into performing arts and if so where are you applying?",

      "text": "I'm mom to an MT student. \n\nAre you a senior? It's a little late to apply to BFA Theatre degrees, as you need to submit portfolio (audition) work. You can do this through acceptd.com for most programs, but it's cutting it close now. \n\nBA theatre programs might still be in play as many don't require auditions. Marquette is one that has a BA program that is fairly easy to get into.\n\nSome good schools (they do require extensive audition work tho) are NYU, USC, CMU, Texas State, SMU, Webster, Evansville, BoCo, Emerson, Pace. Some good but easier-to-get-into schools might be Marquette, Rockford, UWyoming.",

I think it's virtual again next year but I'm not sure. It's a great opportunity to practice auditioning for real schools, and almost every student comes out with one or two callbacks (or even acceptances) from there.",
