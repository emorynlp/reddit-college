          "text": "What do you mean by \"not allowed to do this\"? I agree it sucks but I'm not sure what you mean as if there's a law that requires them to do it. \n\nEscalating it risks your counsellor having a more negative view of you, especially if they haven't submitted the recommendation either. Check and see when your ED schools needs all documents by and if possible talk to the counselor in person.",
