      "text": "15 is a LOT because they will all have opinions and there will be opposing ones.  My kid  (who dislikes writing) had 2 parents, a college counselor, a college grad sibling, and a current college student read the main essay and 6 supplements, and it was just conflicting opinions on almost every essay.  I finally said to my kid \"YOU have to decide which edits to keep and which to ignore, because this is not essays-by-committee...\".\n\nIn the end, the problem is that your own voice starts to get lost, unless you're very sure of your work (and if you were, you probably wouldn't have 15 people read it).  I would suggest at least re-reading all of them in one sitting, to make sure that it all still sounds like YOU, and not the flowy-creative writer in one essay but the dry-scientific paper writer in another essay.  Good luck!",
