Students who start regional or national organizations that receive news coverage often have the high-profile status desired by colleges. These kinds of volunteer efforts can range from collecting non-perishable foods for a community following a natural disaster to turning a love of soccer into an effort to build fields in underserved communities. That said, just participating in a standard volunteer opportunity with no leadership role or major impact will likely be classified as a tier four activity.",
