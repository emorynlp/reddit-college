  "text": "The midterms are coming up and I'm scared. Yes, I am happy about getting this school year done. I'm doing well with every class except Pre-Calculus. I'm just not a fan of how my pre-cal teacher teaches the subject. She is the only teacher who teaches Pre-Cal. By time it's time to do exams. She only reviews one to three questions and gives out a study guide within a few days before the exam. \n\nFor me, I need at least two weeks to study for math exams. Not having those resources available until a few days before the exam, is not giving me enough time to study everything.  Last year I had an amazing math teacher who created vids to go over each standard step by step and gave out resources at least 2 to 3 weeks before the exam. He also went over every standard for review.  I'm hardly hanging on with a B in Pre Cal. If I fail this test, my grade will go to C in Pre Cal. I'm trying so hard to avoid another C on my high school transcript. Anyone else having these problems for any classes in your senior year midterms?",

      "text": "Here\u2019s what I know. You can do hard things. It doesn\u2019t mean you can ace this class but you can forth the amount of effort you feel comfortable with and end with a grade you feel comfortable with \u2014 even if you\u2019re not thrilled with it. \n\nSome suggestions:\n\nGo talk to your teacher. Explain your situation \n\nGo to office hours and study sessions \n\nAsk the smartest kid in the class to help you out and tutor you. Maybe you can return the favor by helping them with something or by baking them cookies or buying them a coffee. \n\nGet a tutor if you can afford it \n\nUse Khan academy and other online resources \n\nBe proactive and get ahead of this. It\u2019s really awesome that you\u2019ve recognized the problem so now next steps are to try different ways to work through it.  And I know you\u2019re up for the challenge.",

I'm not able to contact other students since I'm in an online school. One of their policies, students are not allowed to give out their personal information including phone numbers, and social media users. I'll go with asking the teacher.",
