  "text": "Basically I\u2019m miserable at my current college. My parents pushed me into a local university around the time COVID was starting and I\u2019ve been miserable ever since. The classes suck, the professors suck, and the campus sucks. I\u2019m aching to transfer out but I know that in doing so I will basically alienate myself from the rest of my family. It sucks because I worked really hard in high school to be in the top of my class, earn Varsity letters, and participate in a multitude of extracurriculars all for none of that to matter. With my parents making north of 90k they refused to pay more than $5k essentially damning me to the one local university I\u2019m attending lest I go tens of thousands of dollars in debt. I just don\u2019t know what to do or how to handle this. Every waking moment I\u2019m miserable and frustrated and I feel trapped.",
