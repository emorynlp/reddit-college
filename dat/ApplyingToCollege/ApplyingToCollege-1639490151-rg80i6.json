  "text": "So I am really interested in studying finance at Wharton, however I know that my grades are not at the \"Wharton Level\". I am taking the IB program and have managed to get a 41 predicted, but the catch is that I have gotten a C in my second semester of IB Math in 11th grade (getting used to online learning was difficult) and I think that grade alone will get me rejected from Wharton. So my point is, should I write the essays and apply even though there is a 99% chance I will be rejected? Or even any ivy?\n\nP.S. I didn't apply ED because I wanted to make sure that I can recover from that grade, which I did, and got a B+ in Math during my first quarter of 12th grade (which I'm happy about). Plus, I am a very indecisive person lol.",
