  "text": "So I was president of this club at our school but I just got into a fight with the advisor and basically quit. On my common app I listed myself as president for this year tho, and submitted it to a school already- do I have to email them with the change? Also, if I was the president of this club for the first quarter of my senior school year can I keep that position in common app? Or does it have to be all year for me to list it? If it matters I did a LOT for this club over the summer and I don\u2019t want to downplay my involvement in how it\u2019s being run this year by making it seem like I quit junior year or anything. Thx",
