  "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI was wondering if I should change my CommonApp essay, considering how sensitive colleges are to the ideas of negative essays and mental health (even though I never mentioned it was mental health, but I'm worried that it might bleed through in the wording).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* It is about self-confidence issues regarding my height, and in a nutshell, it's about how an anecdote of my dad crying convinced me to introspect and embrace who I am. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* DM me if you want to read the essay.",
