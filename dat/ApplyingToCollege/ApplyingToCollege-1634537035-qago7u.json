  "text": "Hey all!!\nI applied to UNC-CH (EA) last week using the Coalition App and just realized that I never removed the school from my CommonApp (I switched application systems halfway through). \n\nDo you think that I\u2019d be penalized for allowing the deadline to pass on CommonApp without submitting even though I submitted on time via Coalition??\n\nThanks in advance and sorry if this is confusing",
