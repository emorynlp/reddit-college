  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI just got an unconditional offer from a university, and I am not quite sure what should I be doing next. \n\nI am the first one of my family to study abroad, and this would be the first time for me to travel alone, so I am quite clueless and in dire need for guidance. \n\nI have not accepted the offer yet, as I am not sure if I should be preparing something before I go ahead and accept it.\n\nAny help is really appreciated, and please treat me like a fool and go with as much details as you can give. I really need all the help and guidance you can give. \n\nThank you all in advance.",
