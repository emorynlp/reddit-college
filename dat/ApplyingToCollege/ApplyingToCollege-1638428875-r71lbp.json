And because I applied on 10/15 for early decision (deadline 11/1) I am worried that it might go wrong since it's been more than a month. If I applied a few days ago, I would ask for a change but it's been more than a month... Unless it might affect my admission, I think I should just leave it as it is... Do you think it can affect my admission chance?",
