  "title:": "Can I apply ED without parent permission?",
  "text": "Basically what the title says. My mom doesn\u2019t want me to apply early decision to UChicago (my dream school) because it\u2019ll be around 40k a year with financial aid. Although we can afford this, she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it without looking at other options first. My stats are decent but my ECs are mediocre and realistically there isn\u2019t a chance in hell i\u2019m getting in RD (I think there\u2019s a fairly small chance of getting in even with the ED boost). I\u2019ve already told her that I am willing to take out a loan if she not help me pay for it, but she\u2019s still refusing to support my decision and says she won\u2019t sign the ED form. This is just a really shitty situation to be in. Even if University of Oklahoma gives me a full ride, I\u2019d still prefer going to UChicago; the starting salary for econ majors is respectively 55k and 86k. I think my dad is okay with me applying ED, so does anyone know if both parents have to sign the ED form/ give permission? And any advice to help convince my mom to let me apply ED?",
