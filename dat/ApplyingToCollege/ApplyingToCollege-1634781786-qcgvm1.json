Lee Teng-hui PhD '68, Tsai Ing-wen LLM '80, .... A tea shop could probably survive just on Taiwanese tourists alone);\n* Hamilton has FoJo Beans (on campus);\n* Hobart and william Smith used to have the Bubble Tea Cafe, but the pandemic killed that so it seems like campus dining or Main Moon may have stepped in;\n* St Lawrence has Spartacus on-campus (and possibly other places off-campus);\n* Skidmore has Bamboo Cookhouse\n* Union has Pho Queen, Storied further away, and maybe others\n\nThat doesn't even get into schools in Buffalo, Rochester, the Hudson River Valley (not Upstate), and so on. Honestly, boba is the easiest thing to find; \u597d\u666e\u6d31\u8336 when winter comes? That's harder.\n\nThe pandemic hit a lot of businesses hard, so I suspect you are seeing the effects of that. Yes, LACs skew a bit whiter; but pointing out the local boba places is old hat on campus tours. So all of these schools are likely to have tea shops opening now or by next year in addition to what is there now.",
