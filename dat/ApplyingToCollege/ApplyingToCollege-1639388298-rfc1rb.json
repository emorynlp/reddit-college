  "text": "I'm applying to Columbia and it has an option for a Combined plan\\[[https://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/apply/combinedplan](https://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/apply/combinedplan)\\] which would get me a Bachelors in Liberal arts and BS in engineering which is what I want.\n\nI am currently a community college student getting his Associates in General Studies/Transfer Degree, in Oregon.\n\nWhere my confusion hits is the part where it says \" The Columbia Combined Plan program is usually completed as a 3-2 sequence: three years in a liberal arts curriculum and two years in Columbia Engineering (with students applying in the **junior year**). \" Does having my associates put me in my junior year? Or should I just apply to the Liberal arts\n\nMostly likely going to major in Technical Communications and Cybersecurity",
