  "text": "Running out of time to ask for LOR and it\u2019s mostly because I just have no idea who to choose.\n\nAbout every single year of high school, I\u2019ve had different teachers, so I don\u2019t really have any consistent teachers I have had for multiple years, nor was I part of many athletics so I don\u2019t have any coaches to rely on.\n\nI have a list I have drawn out, and if anyone here has experience with writing or requesting LOR, or actually knows what colleges look for, it would be greatly appreciated if you pick the candidates that best fit those roles. Thank you in advance.\n\n- A Spanish teacher I had through 9-11th grade, head of a club I was in, but now lives across the country \n\n- Math teacher I have had for 11th & 12th grade who I don\u2019t talk with much, but have good relations with nonetheless\n\n- Math teacher who was the head of a club I joined 10th grade, but only stayed in for that year, and is now my AP stats teacher for 12th grade\n\n- My manager at my work that I have had a job at for 3 years, but I only work during the summer and during breaks\n\n- a science teacher I had in 10th grade that I formed a good bond with\n\nWhich 2 of these sound the most appealing? Possibly a 3rd one just in case a college requests that. Thanks so much",

              "text": "So my suggestion is based on the criteria I've heard pretty consistently since last year: 11th/12th teachers at your current school that you have a strong relationship with. Now I don't doubt that your former Spanish teacher or manager would write good letters, but if you're doing the Common App I'd invite them as other recommenders and use those two math teachers for the teacher section",
