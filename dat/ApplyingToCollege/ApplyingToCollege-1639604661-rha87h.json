  "title:": "Wrote one sentence for the NYU essay, still waitlisted?",
  "text": "Hi guys, I procrastinated hard (and I mean hard) for my NYU ED application and only finished my personal statement like 10 minutes from the deadline. I had zero time to write my Why NYU essay so I just wrote a single sentence that wasn't even complete. I just wanted to submit the application so my parents would be happy and be done with it. I absolutely do not deserve a place at NYU, my extracurriculars are mid (no leadership roles, switched schools so no long term commitment to clubs), recommendations are from teachers that I barely spoke to and grades started sliding towards the end of junior year. \n\nKnew I would get a rejection letter the moment I hit submit, then today I found out I was waitlisted? Genuinely asking, was this a mistake? I know waitlist isn't too big a deal but do admissions officers excuse a missing essay that easily? I also applied to the Liberal Studies Core program which is probably the least selective, does that factor into it? Or is the waitlist just a soft rejection in this case?\n\nNow I also feel like shit cuz maybe I could've gotten into NYU if I tried on my essay lol. \n\nAlright a sorta off topic question but does anyone know how to find the admissions statistics for NYU? I remember there was an official pdf or something where they reported all the precise amount of applicants they rejected, accepted, etc. \n\nTLDR: wrote one sentence for my Why NYU essay, still got waitlisted and not rejected or deferred, is the waitlist BS?? Do I actually still have a chance of getting in?",
