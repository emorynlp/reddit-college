  "text": "Hi all, I applied for Stanford REA and was deferred, so now I need to apply to other colleges. My outside recommender's letter was addressed to Stanford, and apparently the letters can't be revised. Should I send it to other colleges despite this? What's more important, the content of the letter (which should be very good) or the mistaken address?",

If you want to \\*assure\\* yourself that it's OK to have your teacher send the schools individual letters... you can email the schools and say:   \n\n\nDear X School,   \n\n\nHi, my name is XYZ and I'm applying to your school RD. There is a technical issue on the Common App and my teacher cannot upload her LOR. Is it OK if she emails it to you?   \n\n\nThanks in advance,   \nXYZ   \n\n\nPS: Before sending such an email, you might want to check to see if any of the schools have regional counselors. It would be better to ask your regional counselor than just the general \"admissions\" email.",
