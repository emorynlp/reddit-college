  "text": "Y\u2019all this urgent, I\u2019m applying to umass Boston and I got a 1310 on the last sat I took which was over a year ago (test center cancellations) , but I\u2019m still waiting for a score from one I took recently. I\u2019ve been scoring in the 1400-1550 range on practice tests so I\u2019m feeling good about it. Should I submit the 1310 bc it\u2019s the one I have or is it possible to apply test optional and submit later? \n\nSorry for horrendous grammar I\u2019m in procrastination panic",
