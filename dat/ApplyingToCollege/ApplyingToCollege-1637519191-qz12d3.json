  "title:": "Should I tank my courses for junior year and senior year?",
  "text": "So recently I was talking to my counselor about my gpa and how it would play out at the end of high school (I'm currently a junior). As of right now the AP's I'm taking include AP Lang, Calc AB, Macroeconomics, and Government. So far I have an A in all of them EXCEPT AP Macro because I'm taking it online and I've had fatigue about it. She told me if I got all A's, i would have a 4.4 by the end of this semester, and if I take AP Micro next semester I would have a 4.5. \n\nMy school doesn't offer many AP's and I've taken all of them so far except one(AP world) . In order to graduate with a 4.4 + GPA,  I would have to take 4 AP classes next year as well, but I don't want to take on that stress especially because Iits senior year and Im focusing on EC's more. What should I do? Should I take 4 AP's next year? I want to graduate top of class but I also know I need sleep. Any advice would help:) thanks",

      "text": "Depends on where you want to go after high school.\nTop schools really like to see you taking the hardest classes available all 4 years. My advice for you is that if you struggle with the hardest classes in high school, you might not want to go to a top college since they\u2019re often very difficult",
