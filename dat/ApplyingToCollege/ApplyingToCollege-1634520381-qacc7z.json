  "text": "I graduated in 2021 and have done nothing since I forgot to apply last year and haven\u2019t got to it this year, I have no idea how to even apply or what should be in a college essay. At my highschool no one, not one person talked about college or applications ever and I feel like in the only one who didn\u2019t go. I don\u2019t know how to find my gpa but I have a slightly above average Sat score so I\u2019m kinda confident I can get into a school. Every time I look at schools I just get confused, I want to go into engineering but I hear people say \u201cit\u2019s easy to get into the school but impossible to get into the engineering program\u201d, I don\u2019t understand what that means, I\u2019ve heard people also talk about entrance exams but I don\u2019t understand what that is or what would even be on the exams, or how would you even take the exams, what happens if you don\u2019t pass the entrance exams? Every time I look into college I just freak out and run in the other direction. I really want to go to college but I just don\u2019t know how to, I guess I just need help understanding everything there is.",
