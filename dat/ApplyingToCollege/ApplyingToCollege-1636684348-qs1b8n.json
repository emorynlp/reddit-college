      "text": "Heeello! First, breathe and sit down. You need a bit of steadiness. The CSS profile is a financial aid form that you need to fill out for some colleges. It highlights your financial situation, taxes and else. I don\u2019t particularly know its difference from the FAFSA as I\u2019m an international, but you can find the info online. There is a website (it\u2019s a domain from college board) that has tons of videos on how to fill it out. It takes a bit, but could be faster if you have the documents and information at hand. Google this! Don\u2019t mean to be rude but it literally has the answer to all of your questions.",

              "text": "Google says:\u201dThe College Board recommends turning in your CSS Profile at least two weeks prior to your earliest college application deadline. Ultimately, you'll need to check with each school you're applying to. As with any important document, the earlier you get this profile done, the better\u201d. \nSooooo I think check it, but it should be done at the same time of your apps",
