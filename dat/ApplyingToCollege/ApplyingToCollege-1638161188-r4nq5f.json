  "title:": "Putting Same Activity Twice on CommonApp?",
  "text": "So by far my largest activity is Mock Trial.\n\nI am President and Founder of my school team, but I also am on board of another mock trial organization outside school.\n\nI've done a lot of things on both organizations, and I absolutely don't think the small word limit can convey everything I've done. Therefore, I was wondering whether I should write Mock Trial on my activities section twice, once as President of School Team and the second time as Board of X Org.\n\nI could include some extra information in my additional info. section, but then it seems kind of disjoint and I'm not sure if AOs will read that far down for clarification. However, if I include the same activity twice, then it might be repetetive.\n\nNot sure which option is best. Any help would be appreciated.",

      "text": "Depends how different the description for each activity is (or if the time commitment to each is substantial enough to differentiate). I put my high school debate/speech team and independent debate as separate ECs when applying. But if it feels repetitive because what you have to say about each overlaps, then it might be better to combine them.",

              "text": "The AOs will read the additional info section, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend using too much of it on elaborating on the activities, since it\u2019s mostly meant for info that can\u2019t be expressed anywhere else on the app. If they\u2019re different enough, show it through their individual descriptions. If not and you combine them, you could include a short elaboration in the additional info, but I would try to keep it under the length of one EC description.",
