It might count as community service. Masters degree is bad, since colleges will assume you\u2019ve already been somewhere else. You should have saved your university virginity. Transportation is a weak extracurricular, unless it was teleportation. We need specifics. Tutoring the professors is obviously for clout, doesn\u2019t seem like you are really passionate. The business just shows how spoiled you are. Taken together, these extracurriculars don\u2019t match. They show no passion and are mediocre at best. You can try applying to your local community college. As long as they have at least a 80% acceptance rate you\u2019ll have a chance. Don\u2019t even bother with Ivys. Or you can take a gap year and get some actual extracurriculars under your belt (solving climate change, creating immortality, inventing time travel, becoming the world dictator). Good luck!",
