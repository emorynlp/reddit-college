  "text": "I just saw my Fordham decision and the aid letter. Unfortunately, the amount they expect me to pay is much higher that what I expected. I decided to go through the whole application process and check exactly what I wrote since I rushed it. \n\nTurns out, I just put a random value in predicted parental contribution and told myself I will later come back to change it after I confirm. But Fordham and Case Western deadlines were close so I went through the rest of the profile and submitted it to them. \n\nThe issue- I totally forgot to come back to it due to the deadline. And that is what I sent to Fordham who worked with that value. There is no way my parents can afford what they are asking over four years. Is there any way for me to change it ( I can't correct my CSS profile after submission)",
