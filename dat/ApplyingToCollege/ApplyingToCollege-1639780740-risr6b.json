      "text": "Yes. Typically colleges have an appeal process on the financial aid website. Look around there to see what you can find.\n\nBefore filing an appeal, see if you can figure out the reason for the difference between Chicago's Net Price Calculator and the actual package. The mistake could be in the forms or in what you entered into the NPC. Look in your financial aid forms for extra zeroes, missing decimals, etc. Have a parent help you with all of this.\n\nThen call the financial aid office, along with a parent, to speak with a financial aid officer. If there's a mistake somewhere, perhaps they can correct it without you having to go through the appeal process.\n\n(Sometimes NPCs are inaccurate for complicated family finances such as divorce or owning a business/rental property/farm if the NPC fails to ask. Students with more complex situations should consider calling the financial aid office with questions.)",
