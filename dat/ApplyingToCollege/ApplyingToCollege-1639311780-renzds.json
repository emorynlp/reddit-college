  "text": "As Uzbekistan is located in Asia, it can be concluded that I am Asian. But Wikipedia is saying the race \"Asian\" does not derive from location. Korea, China, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam....(East Asian Countries) are usually referred as Asian. Uzbekistan is in Central Asia and I think I am white. If I conclude it from Wikipedia, I am white. But still confused.",

So middle eastern people are not classified as Asian on the common app even if they are from the continent of Asia.\n\nCountries like Georgia in the caucuses are definitely white. It\u2019s technically neither Europe nor Middle East so white/other would work. On the other hand putting European white isn\u2019t too far off either as they\u2019re a former Soviet republic. \n\nAs for central asians and Turkic groups you can choose what you want to put\u2014white/other, white plus Asian, or Asian. Considering the anti Asian bias in admissions, I\u2019d probably just put white/other.",

I will click Asian. \n\nAsian \u2013 A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.\n\nWhite \u2013 A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.\n\nUsually, forms though may give more detailed options, eg South Asia including the Indian Subcontinent, so I then click on that.
