  "text": "Was admitted yesterday, and I noticed this. \n\nThere's a list of tasks to complete if you decide to enroll at SCU, this is item 2: \n\n>\"Submit official ACT/SAT test scores to Office of Undergraduate Admission--including\u00a0applicants\u00a0who chose not to submit in the application process.\u00a0The scores will be used for assessment of the\u00a0test optional program\"\n\nSeems like a good idea to me. They can compare test scores to college GPA for all their students and see if they should continue with test-optional. Why aren't other schools doing this?",
