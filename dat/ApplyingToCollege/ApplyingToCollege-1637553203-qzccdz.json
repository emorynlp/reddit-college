  "title:": "How should I write this essay?",
  "text": "I am applying for a full-tuition scholarship and need to write an essay. My dad keeps telling me that the judges won't care about it if it is not personal. However, the prompt says to use evidence from an article. How should I write this essay? More personal? Or more like an AP essay?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrompt: \n\n* Consider the following questions: What are the benefits and/or drawbacks of using podcasts in addition to or in place of textbooks? What are the benefits and/or drawbacks of assigning podcasts instead of a more traditional written assignment, such as a research paper?\n* Compose a brief essay *(750 words maximum, single-spaced, 12 pt font)* that thoughtfully examines the issue above and uses evidence from the article to discuss the complexity of introducing podcasts into the college classroom.",

      "text": "This prompt suggests they want something more like an AP essay. How is the scholarship described? What type of student is it designed to reward? If it is for creative problem-solving or insightful thinking/writing? Something like that? If so, they may want an essay that demonstrates how your mind works rather than tells them more about you (different than a typical college application essay, for example).",

The rest of the application is more personal \u2014 about your leadership experience, etc. \u2014 but above this prompt, it specifically says: \u201cEssay - The essay portion of the Trustee application will allow us to assess your ability to interact with a topic thoughtfully, think critically and write clearly for a public audience.\u201d\n\nThey want to see how you think and write on a topic and that topic is not you.",
