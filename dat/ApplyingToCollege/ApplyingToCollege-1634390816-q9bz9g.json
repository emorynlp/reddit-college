      "text": "Their CS outcomes aren't great - average starting salary in the low $50k range.  Somewhat surprising to me, as they are solid in a lot of engineering fields.  For comparison - Alabama is around $65k and Texas Tech is over $70k.\n\n3.5 GPA and a 1450 SAT would get you close to a full tuition scholarship (they have multiple separate scholarships that can stack). You would still have room and board to pay, but they are pretty good with merit aid.",
