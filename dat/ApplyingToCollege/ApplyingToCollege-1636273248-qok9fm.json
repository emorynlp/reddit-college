Just have it in your mind that just like a lot of the things you do (probably) ur going to end up doing it last minute, it\u2019s probably going to be low quality because of it, and ur going to feel bad afterwards. The only way to do it is to get ur shit  together and sit down and write it, do what u will with that info and good luck",
