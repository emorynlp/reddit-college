  "text": "I am literally exhausted. \n\nNow don't get me wrong, I've always been a pretty studious student. I've somehow kept up with my grades, extracurriculars, and friends. But for some reason though, this semester so far has been the worst for me so far. I always do all of my assignments extremely last-minute, only show up to my extracurriculars when I actually have to, and have been ignoring my physical and mental health. And now lo and behold, it's time to apply to college. Am I confident about my essays? No. Do I feel like I stand a chance against some of the other insanely talented students who are applying to my dream schools? No. Do I think of dropping out every chance I get? Yes. \n\nThe truth is, I am burnt out. I'm tired of submitting assignments just for a good grade and not learning anything. I'm tired of studying for a test for days and still not doing how I thought I would. I'm tired of feeling like I don't deserve to go to college because I didn't work hard enough as others did. But most importantly, I'm tired of not feeling like myself anymore. \n\nEveryone is telling me to just power through it, but I honestly don't think I have that much willpower left. But if I do decide to go a little easier on myself and be more lenient, will colleges think that I just gave up on myself? If I sign up for an easier course load, will all of my work that I've done go down the drain?\n\nBut on the inside, I don't want it to go downhill. I think that school has always gotten in the way of my mental and physical health, and I've definitely used academic validation to prove my worth to others and myself. I spent so much time focusing on getting the perfect grades and being the perfect student, that I've neglected my own mental and physical needs. So at the end of the day, was it worth it? When I finally get that acceptance to my \"dream\" college, will all of my problems go away? \n\nI'm worried that when I get rejected from the colleges I want to go to, I'll end up feeling like all of the work I'd done was for no reason. I know that my grades and what college I get into don't define me as a person, but it definitely feels like that right now..\n\nI'm just exhausted man.",

      "text": "College freshman here. I was in the same situation as you last year. \n\nFirstly, let me say, looking back on things and seeing how things turned out, which colleges you get into doesn't matter as much as I'm sure it feels like it matters right now. I know me telling you that isn't going to change how you feel, which is fine, but I can at least give you an example (myself). \n\nI was a good student in high school. Straight As, pretty good sat, etc. Senioritis sucked, but I managed to get through it maintaining my gpa (I'll get back to that later). Even so, I procrastinated on my essays and basically everything else, meaning my apps to a lot of schools were not as good as they could have been. Long story short, I got waitlisted and eventually rejected from where I thought I really wanted to go. But now where I ended up, I'm so glad I didn't get in lol. Here, because it's a state school, it's 3x cheaper, better weather, not a big city, which I hate, I could go on but basically even though this school isn't as prestigious, it's *such* a better fit for me. \n\nMoving on, I can give an example of the consequences of senioritis. My friend was basically planning on going to a certain school. It was a state school, his brother went there, and a bunch of our friends were probably going there. Throughout high school he got good enough grades to be pretty sure he'd get in. However, senioritis (and COVID online classes) hit him hard. He sucked at focusing for online classes and doing hw, and his grades went from As and Bs to Cs and Ds. But it's fine, colleges didn't really look at  senior year because you had already applied at that point, right? Well, he ended up getting waitlisted instead of accepted, and all of a sudden, his grades *did* matter. You can piece the rest of the story together, lol. \n\nFinally, on to the tips that I used to help me actually do my work:\n\n1. Find something you actually enjoy doing. Yeah I know, everyone says this, \"oh just find a hobby\" well it's true. I joined my schools ultimate frisbee team like 3 quarters of the way through the year, and even though it was only once a week, it helped a ton with my overall energy and mental state. Golf was another thing I did, just like the driving range and stuff, which also was nice. Just think about what it is you usually do all day right now and ask yourself do you really enjoy doing it. \n\n2. Limits. The number one things that distracted me from doing any work was YouTube and Reddit. So, I went into my phone's focus mode (don't know what it would be called on other phones, but almost all phones have it) and set limits for the amounts of time certain apps could be used per day. It was easy to override, sure, but just those reminders can kick your brain into thinking \"wow, I'm really spending too much time on my phone\". \n\n3. Rewards. Remember you don't have to get it all done at once, you can and should take breaks. It you feel like you got a lot done, reward yourself! Maybe some snacks, maybe extra Reddit scrolling, maybe a YouTube video or two before jumping back into the work. I find doing work while I'm actually still at school is a lot easier than doing it at home, too. \n\n4. Perspective. Remember to not be too hard on yourself. It will be difficult, and you probably won't get back to your full speed for the rest of the year, but that's fine and honestly normal. Don't think your motivation is gone forever, because I can tell you, it's not (I just spent my whole Saturday doing homework I don't even need to do, lol). \n\nThat's basically it, sorry for rambling. Just wanted to get this out there, and your post gave me the perfect excuse because of how relatable it is to me, and I'm sure to many others as well. Feel free to ask any questions!",
