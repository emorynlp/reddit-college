  "text": "Please tell me it is entirely ok to not EA/ED/REA. I am done with my app (almost) but for the essay, I guess, I need some time. I don't want to rush and apply. Also, I want to calm myself down for this upcoming month (as my 12th final exams are coming). I don't want to stress myself up more. So, it is ok to apply RD for all the colleges, right? \n\nSay, I have a good profile, then not applying early is ok, right? I would still get into at least one college in RD (again, considering I have a good profile)? \n\n(International)",
