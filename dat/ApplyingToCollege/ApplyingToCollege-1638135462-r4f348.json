  "text": "So, basically I was done with my documents by November 2nd, which is the deadline, and then I could not submit them through the portal. They just wouldn\u2019t get through. Then, I emailed all the documents on time to the corresponding email address just to prove they were done on time. In 2 days (Nov 4) I received an email from a counselor who said to try and submit them again. I did, so they were submitted on Nov 4-ish which is obviously way past the deadline. Now, on my portal I see that those documents are \u201csubmitted, pending processing\u201d and it\u2019s literally been a month. I am freaking out now, what do I do with this? Does this mean I messed it all up and they never received them?",
