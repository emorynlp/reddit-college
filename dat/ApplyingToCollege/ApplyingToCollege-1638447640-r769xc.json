  "text": "Hey guys\n\nSo I changed my admission plan at UPenn from RD to ED. The thing is I completed everything I could. However, my teacher STILL didn't submit the recommendation letter (he keeps saying \"ok\" whenever I ask him to) and my school counselor still didn't even start on the school report.\n\nAnother thing is that regarding financial aid, I had an issue and emailed Student Financial Support. They told me to email the admission office. I did, and the admission office told me to email Student Financial Support (what?). And I'm still waiting to solve this problem.\n\nWill this affect me negatively? I can't get it off my mind.",

Consider this your first college course, as learning to navigate this system is necessary to succeed in college. You will face the same nonsense again, whether it be with scholarships, dorms, course selections, major declarations, or simply graduating.",
