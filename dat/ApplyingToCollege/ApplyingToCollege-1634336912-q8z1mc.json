  "text": "I have a 92 GPA. It definitely isn\u2019t bad but compared to the kids in my high school, it isn\u2019t good. And those are the kids I\u2019m going to mainly be compared to. \n\nI\u2019m hoping colleges will see the \u201cgrowth\u201d because I got an 85 average freshmen year, and raised my GPA from there.\n\nI want to try for Stanford and USC because my superscore is 1540, but that GPA man ;-;.\n\nI did have extenuating circumstances (alcoholic father passing away) but I feel like these schools would just see my GPA once and throw my application in the trash folder. \n\nAny thoughts?",
