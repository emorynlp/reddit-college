  "text": "Hi, \nI\u2019ve started to get acceptance letters back, but I ended up with a D in Government this semester. I have 90\u2019s and above in all my other classes, I read somewhere online that because I have a D, college will not count the credit and I\u2019ll have to take the class again. I\u2019m asking here because I have found conflicting info.\n\nIs there any truth to this? Will I have to retake it?",

      "text": "What do you mean \u201ccount the credit\u201d? If you pass the course in high school, you have met any requirement for taking x u it\u2019s in high school.\n\nColleges rarely, if ever, give college credit for a high school course grade For one semester.\n\nThe bigger concern should be a college rescinding an admission decision. One condition of most acceptances is keeping grades at the same level upon which the admission was based. A D or F can put that in jeopardy.\n\nYou should contact the schools, using the mid-year report with your mid-year grads, and ask about potential impacts. It\u2019s better to get out in front of it than wait.",
