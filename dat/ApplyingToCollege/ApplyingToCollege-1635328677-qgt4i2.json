  "text": "So I submitted letters of recommendation for one college in the common app. I hear people say that the recommenders don't need to submit their letters of recommendation again, but that I do need to assign them to the colleges I want to apply to. I see no where to assign them T\\_T I am so confused\n\nI'd appreciate anyone who could help me :)",

          "text": "Yes I know what page you're talking about, but there is no option to \"assign\" recommenders, only to \"invite\" or \"manage\". The manage button offers only deleting recommenders, and if you invite a recommender who has already submitted a recommendation for another college an error occurs saying you've already invited that recommender. I just don't know if that means that the recommendation from one college is sent to all colleges on the common app.",
