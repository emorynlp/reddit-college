  "title:": "Enrollment deposit due in January for rolling admission?",
  "text": "Heya! I was recently accepted into a school through rolling admission, it's one of my top safeties too!\n\nThe thing is, it requires me to make an enrollment deposit by January 10th, and didn't have anything about this on their website. I still have to wait for other decisions from after that date. There are some \"fine print\" things that would allow me to refund the deposit/withdraw maybe, but do you guys know what would happen in this situation?\n\nMy current plan is to wait until I get my acceptance packet, look over it, see what it says, and later call them to ask if that can be extended.\n\ntldr - top safety sent me admission but I have to deposit before other decisions come out, what should I do?",
