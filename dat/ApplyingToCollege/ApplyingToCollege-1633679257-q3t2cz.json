I'm not the best writer but I love these 150-word small pieces especially when they have a wide range of topics.\n\n(Maybe it's pretty common for schools to have shorter essays but for the schools I'm applying to this is not)\n\nThey're easy to read and keep u going!\n\nJust wanna share this feeling/motivation lol HAVE A NICE DAY EVERYONE!",
