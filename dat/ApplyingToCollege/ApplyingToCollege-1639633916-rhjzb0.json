      "text": "I\u2019m an alum and looking back now - Rose-Hulman was truly the best decision I could have made for undergrad. Met the best people that, for the first time, I could truly connect with - people who were a little nerdy, liked math and science, and had interesting hobbies and talents. The curriculum was tough but the professors were incredibly helpful and were available to you no matter what. The campus is beautiful and the staff are unparalleled in terms of making the student experience top notch. From a career standpoint, Rose has opened so many doors for me as well. There\u2019s really very little downside (maybe location, but Terre Haute honestly has some charm and you have so much fun on campus that the need for the college town vibe is lessened, IMO).",
