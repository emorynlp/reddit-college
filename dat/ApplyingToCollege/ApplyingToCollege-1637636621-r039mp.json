  "text": "Y'know those essays where you're like \"damn, this is fun to read!\" and it's just so good and full of life and just feels so good and interesting? How do I write like that? I'm an avid fan of hating on English class. It makes me wanna fall asleep. But, I like reading books. I know, it's super ironic. It makes me laugh too sometimes. It's a hobby I've picked up over the summer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo despite me treating English class like the plague, how do I get better at writing? How to I write those \"interesting\" and \"lively\" essays? Asking for a friend here.   \n\n\nExample of an essay I find interesting? Something(s) I found super fun to read?   \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8a1fkl/fuck\\_my\\_1600\\_or\\_why\\_i\\_wish\\_my\\_parents\\_had\\_made/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8a1fkl/fuck_my_1600_or_why_i_wish_my_parents_had_made/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/b9f4di/the\\_essay\\_and\\_stats\\_that\\_got\\_me\\_into\\_mit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/b9f4di/the_essay_and_stats_that_got_me_into_mit/)",

      "text": "Write! And read! I am also an incredibly avid fan of those kinds of essays, ones that seem to pack a lot of meaning into a paragraph that reads casually. I think the best way to get better at that style is to read it (you can find it in personal essays, memoirs, or any other kind of creative nonfiction), as well as study it. It's incredibly helpful and even a bit fun to break apart an essay you enjoyed reading from a writer's perspective. I'd also really recommend Roxane Gay's skillshare class! It's only an hour and about half of it will be relevant to you. \n\nAlso, practice! Diary entries or journal entries are a great way to reflect on yourself and who you are. Ever read an article and get so angry you want to rant about it to someone? Write it down instead, maybe with an audience in mind. It'll help you better articulate your thoughts and emotions but to someone else. The anger will give you enough to write about but the struggle is writing it in a way that appeals to others. How can I make someone understand my perspective without stifling them with emotion? Writing like that (as in that style) is like having conversation. As a reader you feel like your part of it and as a writer thats your goal. It's hard to explain lol. Roxane does it better.",

              "text": "In regards to non-fiction: Some of my favorites are: Hunger by Roxane Gay (TW though), Pulphead: Essays by John Jeremiah Sullivan, Know My Name by Chanel Miller (TW) and How To Murder Your Life (TW). But, a lot of these are really dark as they are memoirs. \n\nI think most of this kind of writing will be best reflected in essays published in magazines or journals. Like, I Was Caroline Calloway (By Natalie Beach and published in The Cut) is one I enjoyed. As another commenter pointed out, places like the Cut, the Atlantic, The New York Times (etc) are the best place to find essays written in this manner. \n\nHowever, I will note a lot of coming-of-age novels and books tend to take this tone as well. I'd try reading some of those for something more fun and light.",

      "text": "I wouldn\u2019t take that essay as a gold standard; the writing seems good, but the metaphors feel forced asf and the only reason it worked was because of his unique situation\u2014 and talent\u2014 in math. Here\u2019s what I think will help you: read more books; try moving into real literature\u2026 the stuff that makes you FEEL something when you read it. Figure out what makes the writing compelling, and try writing a short story like that. Rinse. Repeat. Express your ideas in an articulate manner. But don\u2019t try TOO hard. Readers don\u2019t like the feeling of being manipulated to think a certain way\u2014 that\u2019s why I think he\u2019s that guy\u2019s essay wasn\u2019t actually that good.\n\nJust anticipating here\u2014 I wanna make it clear that I\u2019m not advocating for removing depth from your essays. But some of those metaphors just weren\u2019t it. Maybe he got in DESPITE his essays\u2014 I mean\u2014 it\u2019s hard not to cheer for someone with his profile/achievements. Don\u2019t overload it.\n\nJust my thoughts.",

So despite me treating English class like the plague, how do I get better at writing? \n\nYou want to learn to write, but don't want to put forth effort in the class that should teach you exactly how to do this?\n\n1. Your attitude towards English class is immature and disrespectful. There are English teachers who aren't good, and perhaps yours isn't, but you want to learn to do something and you probably spend 4 hours a week with someone paid to teach you to do just that -- so maybe become a good student?\n2. Read non-fiction. Good literary fiction is amazing, and it's the best writing around -- but there is a very big difference between literature (fiction / poetry) and essays. Good literature has to include ambiguous elements so that readers can interpret it differently; good essays are crystal clear, leaving no room for the reader to misinterpret  the author's points. One of the biggest problems students have is that they write essays and think that being vague, complicated, and ambiguous is a sign of their intelligence -- it's not. So, read literature, but also read about literature (and everything else). Read The Economist, The Atlantic, Harpers, Lit Hub, etc.",
