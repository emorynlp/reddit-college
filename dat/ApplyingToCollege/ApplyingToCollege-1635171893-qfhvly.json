  "text": "Okay I am not bragging or ranting here. But I spent a lot my time on ecs. Now after filling the number of hours per week and number of week, they seem really unreal even though I minimized few of my hours tremendously.\n\nSo can anyone look at it and tell me if it's only me or my time spent on activities really is unreal (hence a red flag).
