There are only a few colleges need blind for international students and are really competitive. The other ones will probably reject you solely because of your money. \n\nHowever, I will encourage you to apply as many colleges as you can. Probably you will be able to get into some college with your respective financial aid. If for some reason you are not able to get in remember that you have always the option to study undergrad in your home country and then grad school here.",
