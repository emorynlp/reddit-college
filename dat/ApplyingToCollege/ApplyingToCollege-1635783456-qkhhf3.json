      "text": "You email them now and let them know that there was a mistake on your application.  You certainly want to notify them because first off, mistakes happen.  Everyone gets that.  Secondly though, if they realize it's a national award and you checked it off as international, it's not going to look good for you.  It's in your best interest to just email them now. \n\nEither way though, don't sweat it!  Mistakes happen, just shoot them an email",

Secondly, they could interpret it as you trying to lie about the level of importance the award is.  Don't take those chances.  At the very least, even if it's submitted already, you reread it and saw your mistake",
