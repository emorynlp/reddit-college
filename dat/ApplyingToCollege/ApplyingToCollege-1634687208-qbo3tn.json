  "title:": "Question for the people that have received a PVSA award/President\u2019s Volunteer Service Award",
  "text": "How did you apply after you got enough hours? Does your organization do everything after you tell them you\u2019re eligible/want to apply? I contacted the people in charge of volunteering at the place I volunteer at, and (after some time) they basically told me that they worked on it and that I should be receiving something soon. All I did was tell them how many hours and the time frame; was there anything else I needed to do? They said something about them writing a letter too, so I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s more to it? Thanks!",
