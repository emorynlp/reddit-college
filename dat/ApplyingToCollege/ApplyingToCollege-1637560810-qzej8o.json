  "text": "a few months ago i made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/pdlvtb/dont_forget_to_celebrate_your_little_bits_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) post about celebrating every little bit of progress you make in the application process. i feel like i've been kinda slacking in this department with two deadlines fast approaching, but i had a bit of a breakthrough tonight and i'm proud of myself so i wanted to encourage everyone to be proud of themselves too. \n\nso a2cer's, what's your recent win? it can be as small as a single sentence or as big as an acceptance! whatever it is i want to hear it. \n\ni'll start: i finished a supplemental essay due on dec 1st tonight! it's 250 words and i already had a paragraph done, but it's the most i can remember writing in one sitting in a LONG time and i'm proud of myself for pushing through it.",
