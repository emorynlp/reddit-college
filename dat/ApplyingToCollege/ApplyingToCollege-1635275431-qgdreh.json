      "text": "Feeder schools generally have money. That allows them to do things like:\n\n-Hire good counselors that have connections to colleges\n\n-Set students up for success by providing lots of great resources, and over time develop a reputation among colleges for pumping out high-quality students\n\n-Attract wealthy families who want their kids to use the school\u2019s resources (then maintain their wealth/resources through the support of those families)\n\nA lot of feeder schools are also fairly old, which gave them a head start in forming relationships with colleges.",
