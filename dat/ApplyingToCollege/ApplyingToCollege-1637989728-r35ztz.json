  "title:": "Inputting \"G\" Courses for UC Application",
  "text": "For my A-G requirements, I fulfilled the \"G\" req by exceeding the requirements in A-F. I have like 7 years of math and twice as many physical science years as required, but the only actual \"G\" course that shows up in my application when I input it is 0.5 years or 1 semester of econ (for some reason my school has it set so that AP Gov is being counted as an \"A\" requirement). Will I be fine because I exceeced the requirements in other areas or do I have to take one of my \"extra\" math or science courses and manually input it so that it counts as a G course? I'm asking because in the CSU application I had to manually change AP Gov to a G course in order to fulfill the requirement so I'm concerned the UC has a similar system and I met get auto rejected because I don't fulfill the G requirements on paper.",
