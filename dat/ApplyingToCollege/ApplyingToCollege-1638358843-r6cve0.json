  "text": "You ever put your heart and soul in to creating the perfect application for your dream school that you've dreamed for the last 4 years only to be rejected without even getting an interview? It's been a week but it's all I think of. I have no soul left in me to get on with applications for other colleges. I know it's not the end do the world but idk how to get out of this feeling and pull myself together.  If you've gone through this too and know what I am talking about, pls let me know what you did to get better.",

      "text": "Take some time off apps(2 days or smth) and during this time, don't think about college or anything like that, focus on something you love. Then after that rest period, think about any other school that you would be happy to go to. Watch videos of current students and get to love a new school, then start applying again, since it's already December. You can do this. It's sad that you didn't get into that particular school, but everything happens for a reason. You are going to do much better at a different college. I'm rooting for you.\ud83d\ude0a",

Then, relook at your school list with fresh eyes, heart and open mind. You were blinded before by that other school but now, the perfect place is right there waiting for you..........you got this, good luck",
