  "text": "I got a 3.3 freshman year so even if I get straight 4.0s from now on my gpa will only be 3.7. So I literally screwed myself now, I\u2019m immediately out of the ivies and t50s unless I literally get a miracle EC within the next 2 years which is not likely either. I\u2019m screwed no matter what I do now because of my freshman year this is so depressing I feel like there\u2019s no point going forward anymore. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the competition but I\u2019m so insecure that my gpa is not good enough for t20 and that despite being a sophomore my high school career is over and I no longer have a shot at any dream school",
