      "text": "Hi!! Firstly, just for safety/confidentiality purposes, I would recommend not writing your name on such posts as you never know of anything that can happen online. Secondly, I would say at least do 4-5 more of online courses related to comp sci. Thirdly, I've seen everywhere that Harvard and the high-caliber univ usually have this metric of judging applicants where they ask themselves \"Where do we see this individual in 10 years?\" If they feel as if youre gonna be the next Mark Zuckerberg or getting any top positions in the future, your chances are pretty high. So keep that in mind as you are navigating through your application (obv show dont tell, like dont say I'll be the COO of 'company' name. Show them through your ECs and essays). And yes, you can. on the harvard portal, it allows you to upload Standardized testings after you submit your application (I believe you can also add your certificates in the Miscellaneous section of your portal). Best of luck!!",

                      "text": "Even if you can afford the tuition, you have a low chance because you want to major in computer science. That\u2019s the hottest major these days which so many students want. \n\nWell, if you have your favour, then extremely low chances wherever you apply to. You\u2019re an international student who wanna study CS. look at the reality\u2014 there are not many schools that support financially even though you have no stats\u2026 I\u2019m also a science student but apply to LACs only bc of financial aids. No university is safety for no score international students who require financial aids, unfortunately\u2026 I hope you take the Duolingo tests at least.\n\nAnd ECs what you have done, GPA, SATs etc lots of information matters especially for US admission. You didn\u2019t let us know any of them. Those certificates are not important tho\u2026 Like which science fair did you attend? Any paper you published? What kinda CS project have you made?\n\n(And you might have a wrong idea there are plenty of many schools where they have such strong and good science programs like Pomona and Harvey Mudd etc etc. there are even lots of students who choose those schools over Harvard, Yale, etc)",

It even gives lots of chances to get grad schools and their low faculty ratio makes them focus on each student mentally, academically.",
