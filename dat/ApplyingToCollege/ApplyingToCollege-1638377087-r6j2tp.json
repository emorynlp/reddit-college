  "text": "I\u2019ve always been a go getter. I always knew I had the entrepreneurial spirit lying within me, ever since I was a child. When I was a freshmen, I started my first business dealing drugs. I started off small, and now I\u2019ve grown it into an entire empire. The issue is though, is that it seems like everyone wants me to go with them. FBI, CIA, IRS, local and state police, even the feds, they all want me. During interviews, I didn\u2019t even have to schedule an interview, they all came right to me at home. Some of them even took me to a room specifically for interviews, although it was a little odd it was at the police stations. But overall, the interviews went great, they asked about my business, and they seemed very surprised at what I was able to accomplish at my age. They told me that they have never seen someone so young make such an impact in the underground world. \n\nI\u2019m feeling really confident about being accepted, despite the lack of dorm space in some of these places. But it\u2019s gotten to a point that I don\u2019t know where to go. They\u2019re all so prestigious, practically everyone knows about them. I just have this feeling though, that if I don\u2019t figure out where I\u2019m going to go, the institutions are just going to drag me to their campus. It\u2019s hard being a prodigy.",
