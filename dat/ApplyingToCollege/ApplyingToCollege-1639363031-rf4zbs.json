  "text": "As the title says, I was researching Cornell for the why Cornell essay and I started to realize I probably wouldn't be happy there\ud83d\ude2dit seems like a really competitive environment and the social scene seems heavily Greek life oriented. Even the clubs and activities seem really competitive to get into. All of this is not what I'm looking for in a college but I've already spent hours writing that damn 650 word supplement so I feel like if I don't apply it'll have been a waste of time. Ik I probably won't get in anyway, I wanted to apply to a decent amount of reaches just to play my cards and see if I could get into one, but I keep going back and forth on whether or not I should actually apply. Also I know I should have researched Cornell earlier but I decided to apply not too long ago because I was told it was really good for the academic niche I was interested in, so I haven't had a lot of time to research.",

That\u2019s tremendously valuable.  Colleges are not interchangeable.  Duke is a completely different critter from Brown which offers an experience quite different from U Chicago.  You want to find yourself excited to be a part of the college you select, not struggling to make it work.",
