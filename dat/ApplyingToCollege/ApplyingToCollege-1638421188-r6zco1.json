  "text": "I applied ED to Upenn where the first choice program is binding under the ED agreement and you can choose to put the second choice program as ED binding or RD non-binding. I submitted with the second choice program under the ED contract, but I now want to move it to RD. Is this a possible thing to do? Would it look bad on you and ruin ur chances for both the first and second choice program?",
