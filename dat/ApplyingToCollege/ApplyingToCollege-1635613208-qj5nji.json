  "text": "Hi!  Quick question about the common app.  For awards given by a specific activity, should they go in the honors section or the activities description section, or both?  For example, if someone got like MVP for a sport listed in their activities, where would that award go?  \n\nJust confused since the activity instructions says \"Please describe this activity, including what you accomplished and any recognition you received, etc.\", and I'm not sure if recognition means awards!  Thanks in advance!",

      "text": "Yea don't put them in both. \n\nIf it's non-academic I wouldn't put it under honors, since its traditionally for academic awards. I have lots of non-academic awards and just put them in my activity descriptions. \n\nIf you don't have enough space and really want to include it under the honors section, then maaaaaybe. I wouldn't recommend it though. \n\nRecognition definitely means awards, it could also mean certificates, publications etc.",
