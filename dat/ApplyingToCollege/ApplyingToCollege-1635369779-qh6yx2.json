  "title:": "Seeking Advice for MIT Maker Portfolio",
  "text": "I'm planning to submit a maker portfolio to MIT, and I have one fairly substantial project (a little free library that I built and designed) that I'll definitely list on there. However, I also have multiple smaller projects that I've done within relatively short time-frames, including a motorized zoetrope that I made from an Arduino starter kit, a video game I made for a week-long game jam, and some Blender animations I made for my robotics team last year. By submitting these, I'm hoping to show how I use personal projects as a way to explore and learn about a wide variety of topics that I initially knew nothing about, from woodworking to electronics.\n\nMy main concern about listing these smaller projects on top of the library is that I don't want to seem like I'm just throwing projects at the admissions officers to see what sticks, as MIT says that they prefer \"quality over quantity.\"\n\nSo, do y'all think it wouldn't hurt to submit these smaller projects, or would it be safer to only mention the little free library?",

[https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/ask-me-anything-about-portfolios/](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/ask-me-anything-about-portfolios/)\n\nFor what it's worth, we do tend to believe in quality over quantity. You can also mention these other projects in the additional information box in the application.",
