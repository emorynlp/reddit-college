  "text": "What is the difference between the political science and public policy majors? Both are offered at several schools, so it's not a matter of a naming scheme by institutions. Additionally, which would be better for somebody who wants to be a politician/lawmaker?",

      "text": "May be slightly different at each college, but public policy usually has a greater focus on creating and applying policy whereas political science focuses more on political theory and the study of politics. Public policy at my college requires a basic stats class and an econ for public policy class, so there\u2019s more quantitative skills involved than the political science major, although it\u2019s still not much. \n\nFor being a lawmaker, probably public policy. Or going to law school. For being a politician, there\u2019s a big difference between becoming senator vs local politician, and it can depend on the state/city you\u2019re running in. A lot of local politicians don\u2019t have a degree related to politics at all. Some haven\u2019t gone to a four year college at all. And running in Nebraska vs New York will be different. But honestly if you want to pursue politics at a high level you very well may have to go to grad school, and your grad school degree will matter much more than your undergrad.",

      "text": "just look up the differences in course requirements for both programs, that will give you a much better idea of how they differ at specific schools\n\nAnd the difference will not matter for law school or getting into politics",
