      "text": "Does your school have one of those schedules with four full credits one semester, and four full credits the next semester instead of eight different classes at once? Because that would explain why you only have that many classes. Additionally, like others said, make sure you\u2019re taking the most rigorous course load, but it\u2019s okay if you need to take a step back for a semester if you need it. Mental health should definitely be a priority. Microsoft classes suck sometimes, but at least you\u2019ll get so much faster at assignments because you don\u2019t have to worry about learning the subject and how to use those programs. (Additionally, at some community colleges, if you get certified, you can exchange them for dual enrollment credit)",
