  "text": "I am the eldest daughter in my family and both of my parents are immigrants. Being in the chance me sub and seeing what people have done during their high school careers makes me feel so shitty. Not because I can\u2019t do things like that, but because I know I can but I just was robbed of the opportunity to do so. Like I couldn\u2019t intern at fucking NASA or something because someone needed to watch my brother. I couldn\u2019t pay for a tutor to raise my SAT score because I already spent my last paycheck on gas and dinner for my family. I am just so, so envious. And hearing some people make bitter remarks about how being first-gen is an advantage, it really isn\u2019t. We have no family or resources here. I just am praying for the best this application season.",

It can be hard to stomach their clueless whining and condescension, and I'm sorry you've had to put up with it to access the information here.\n\nTo put your mind at ease a bit, colleges do make an effort to correct for these kinds of disadvantages. Adcoms may not know your parents' income when they're reviewing your app, but they will know your high school, address, and activities (including family responsibilities), so they'll have a good idea of where you fall economically, and what opportunities were actually available to you. They try to put achievement into context so that kids with fewer resources and more responsibilities aren't penalized.\n\nIt's not a perfect system, but just know that you aren't competing directly with those privileged overachievers; AOs understand that those kids are playing a very specific game that many can't afford. Instead, you'll be compared to students with a similar economic profile. I know that doesn't undo how shitty it feels to miss out on opportunities to prove yourself, and being surrounded by rich kids once you actually get to college isn't a cakewalk, either. But hopefully it makes the admissions process itself a smidge less scary.",

      "text": "It makes a lot of sense to dedicate your entire life towards developing a college resume before you attend college. But after you graduate, and realize that your college experience could have largely been replicated at any number of schools in the US, or that you missed out on a full spectrum of human experience by narrowing on one goal you decided on as a child, or that the job you ended with isn't as glamorous as it was rumored to be, or the pressure is too much; all of the time and energy you spent meeting arbitrary marks of prestige seems less and less relevant.\n\nThe bond you've formed with your family, on the other hand, is real and immutable. The appreciation for the struggle you've developed is real. You have worked for everything you have - and that is something no one can ever take away from you. \n\nIts never too late to become an  academic overachiever. Yes having the head start is useful, but while the name of a big college on your resume is flashy, it doesn't compare at all to the wisdom, sense of self and community that having fought through a struggle like your experience has been. Honestly, by just surviving and applying to college makes you an overachiever (its not easy, and very few people actually do). \n\nSorry for the rant, haha, but SAT tutors and research ops are pointless as hell if your goal is to chase prestige and not actually cultivate a fulfilling your life. I know, or know of too many people who went to tops schools and flamed out because of that. Take pride in what you've accomplished!",

My parents don't even know what the SAT is and for my whole life, I fended for myself. \n\nI know our experiences aren't extremely similar but please just trust in the process and ask for help.
