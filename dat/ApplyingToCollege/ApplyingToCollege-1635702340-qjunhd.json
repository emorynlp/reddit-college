  "text": "So, I\u2019m applying ED to CMU, and the October 13th SAT scores come out on November 4th as reported by collegeboard.\n\nCMU\u2019s website says they require supporting documents to be submitted by November 1st, they also say that they prefer all testing is completed by November 1st. When they say testing is completed, does that mean like I\u2019ve taken the test by November 1st or the score is already out by November 1st. CMU also only takes official score reports.\n\nBasically, if I\u2019m applying ED, will my oct 13 be able to be submitted to CMU \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

You're good.\n\nNot sure if they'll see the testing section, but it's possible to put that you expect a future score from Oct 2021.\n\nEdit, the actual language:\n\n>If you'd like us to consider test scores, it's strongly preferred that Early Decision 1 applicants complete all standardized testing by November 1. If there are circumstances that have led you to take a test after November 1 but still in the month of November, make sure you've indicated the future test you're taking on the Common Application. \n\nYou are good for having completed testing by Nov 1. I would still indicate your \"future\" test date of Oct 2021.",
