  "text": "I'm in my senior year and I'm taking 3 AP. We have a trimester system and in 3rd tri I'll take the AP seminars. It counts out of 4.0 instead of 5.0 (which will lower my gpa) so I'm thinking of dropping it and doing independent study for the exam. Do colleges care if I drop the seminars for an off roll (no class)?",
