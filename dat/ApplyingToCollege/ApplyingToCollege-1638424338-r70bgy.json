  "text": "Hey all!\n\nI'm interested in pursuing MBBS degrees (essentially medical qualifications) or engineering in China. Academics wise, I have a fair chance at Fudan and Tsinghua (looking at Peking too). Language isn't a big issue for me, since I'm Chinese-American. \n\nI've heard pretty bad things about career prospects though - studying at a top university in China won't translate over to American jobs, and even degrees from top American colleges are worth more in China. I want to live abroad for an extended time, but I'm not sure about whether these schools are a right fit for my future.",

      "text": "You know, you could also look at Singapore (esp. Nanyang) or Taiwan (NTU). Tsinghua and UST (and HKUST) are great, but... well, you should talk to someone who has spent time in the US/Canada and in China *recently*. Things have changed and some people seem to feel less welcome. Also, China has greatly reduced the number of foreigners coming in and living in the country. Not sure if that will revert at some point, but the omicron COVID variant doesn't make that look likely. That would greatly affect any internship and post-graduation plans.\n\nAnother option to consider (in Asia): KAIST. It's Korea, but most courses are taught in English and KAIST is damn good. While you might not get to use your Chinese (apart from reading the rare hanja which pop up or noting some similar words), Korea is a great place to be and super welcoming. Also: I've taught KAIST students and they were super sharp but also fun.",

      "text": "If you really, REALLY, want to go to university in China, and you love those schools, it's worth a shot, but keep in mind a few things: \n\n1) Career prospects are not great imo. Chinese degrees even from top schools are not likely to be familiar to North American employers at the best of times, and business relations and perceptions of China have deteriorated substantially as the country becomes increasingly 1984-esque, so you might not come across too well even to an open minded and tolerant employer. On top of that, experience and credentials might not necessarily transfer if you move back to America. \n\n2) China has changed, *dramatically,* in the past several years, and is no longer the China everyone was hyping about in the 2000's or 2010's. As a STEM student with a Chinese background chances are nothing TOO bad would happen, but let's just say things are very unpredictable right now and you run the small but present risk of things going very sour, very quickly. Make sure you've never *ever* done anything that might be considered politically charged. And you mentioned you wanted to live abroad for an extended period of time; if I were you I would absolutely NOT do that in China in this day and age. Just studying though, might be a more nuanced matter if you really want to go, which brings me to # 3\n\n3) I doubt you'll even be able to get in the country any time soon with China's extremely heavy handed COVID-zero strategy. \n\nI don't intend to fearmonger you away from this path if you have your heart set on it (I've entertained the idea of doing a study-abroad in China myself), but there are important considerations to keep in mind, some from studying abroad in general, and some specific to China.",

              "text": "Tldr as far as politics is concerned, China is basically a high-tech, more globalist version of North Korea \n\nIf you've been very public about your political activism, I would 100% think twice. Even if *you* don't think anything you've said is critical of the Chinese regime, totalitarian governments tend to get offended by the pettiest of things and you could still get in deep trouble. China is a 1984-esque high tech totalitarian state, so they WILL find out. And frankly China isn't a great place for anyone with an activist mind. \n\nIn my parents' days (I'm Chinese Canadian btw) it was relatively okay as long as you respected certain unwritten boundaries and there was a healthy albeit censored intellectual scene, but now the whole atmosphere has Great Purge vibes, except the indoctrination is so thorough you'll have a hard time finding any average citizen actually living in fear; most people feel perfectly fine. That's why Chinese citizens are still allowed to freely travel abroad. I have a cousin born in the 90's and had a relatively \"normal\" childhood, but he says gen z Chinese kids are so thoroughly brainwashed it's terrifying. This has all progressed at a terrifying breakneck speed, just 5 or 6 years ago the situation was *extremely* different and you'd probably have been fine as just a student. \n\nBasically, what I'm saying is if you're a passionate activist, China is definitely NOT a great place for you. You'd have to muzzle yourself completely for the entire duration you plan to stay there. And as a passionate progressive, well, you likely care deeply about government transparency, and human rights, two things that are not allowed to exist in mainland China in 2021. China is a progressive's nightmare. And don't think because you're on the left that China would be nicer to you. All lot of Western progressives like to sympathize with China in contrast to the US's moral failings, but the truth is unless you are fully devoted to \"Xi Jinping Thought\" as they call it now, any political idea is potentially dangerous (yes, even if you're an actual socialist). Btw, get in trouble even once and you're fubar'd , because China doesn't practice due process or rule of law. At all. \n\n\nPS: college students tend to be the most closely monitored demographic in authoritarian regimes, as you probably already know, so yeah, although it might not be quite as bad if you're in STEM",

      "text": "Hi there! I was born in china, but migrated to Singapore bc of my dad, I visit every once a year before covid hit. I would like to voice my opinions.\n1. I\u2019m not sure about career prospects in America, but these universities you\u2019re aiming for are highly prestigious in china, and their graduates are highly sought after by many major companies in china. They might send you an offer even before you graduate + these universities have career fairs when you graduate, so unless you\u2019ve been sucking REAL BAD AT SCH, you would 98% land a good job and a good salary in CHINA. I don\u2019t speak for other countries \n2. China is an amazing country. Contrary to seemingly popular belief under this reddit post, it\u2019s not a more globalised North Korea. As a tourist/ formal resident, it has developed and become no different to other countries. You won\u2019t get jailed for voicing your opinions, and you won\u2019t get thrown into concentration camps because there are none to begin with. If you voice reasonable political opinions nicely, loads of people will be happy to discuss it with you. You can believe me if you want. To be honest anyone who actually visited china would realise a lot of things they thought of it or had stereotypes about are false. ( for example concentration camps ) Please don\u2019t fight with me about this, if you\u2019re basing your sources on fake news. We can agree to disagree\n3. China is a really scenic country and there\u2019s lots of places to have fun! It\u2019s actually pretty safe too. I like the vibes alot and the people there are super warm and friendly. You can watch some YouTube videos of china vlogs and they can give you insight. I believe there\u2019s an European/ American girl? That studied in china and married a man there and she\u2019s having fun. You can check her vlogs out\n3. I agree that the china borders are real tight rn, and I don\u2019t have much knowledge abt that so many you can search it up/ do some research\n\nIt never hurts to try and apply! Even if you change your mind later on, at least you gave it a shot:). No words can express how much I love china, and you might say my viewpoints are biased but I get really pissed off when china is reviewed with injustice lol. You can ask other Americans who studied in china for their experience! ( ask a few, so you get the gist of it)",
