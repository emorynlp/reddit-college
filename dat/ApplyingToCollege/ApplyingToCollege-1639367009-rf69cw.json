  "text": "Been knocking out/revising a supp a day but now all I have left are the hardest ones, why us and why your major (mostly why us seems challenging). I got just under 3 weeks left for this for RD, is this enough time to come in clutch with brutal daily research? (I got like 5 of these sons a bitched to write)",

      "text": "\"brutal daily research\" seems a bit much I don't think these essays are as insane as people make them out to be. You shouldn't be coming up with 10 professors, 15 classes, and 30 clubs that you like from each school. I think my gtech why major essay is a good example. I wrote about create-x for entrepreneurship, CEISMC for public service, and their threads curriculum for CS. nothing crazy, and easy to find+choose because it related directly to my interests/passions. These should come naturally; what someone else said about ECs shaping vision is a great start, good luck!!",
