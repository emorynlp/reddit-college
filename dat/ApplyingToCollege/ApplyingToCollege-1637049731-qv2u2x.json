  "text": "I applied to Purdue, gatech and udub. Do all these unis share results in Jan mid or later typically? I was hoping i could cut down on further applications if I heard positive news from any of them before rd deadline of 1st jan of most unis. Now am wondering if ea was of no use in my case.",

Georgia Tech is late January OOS (25th last year), and mid-December in-state (7th last year).\n\nEA was required for merit awards and Honors college, and nearly required for high demand majors, at Purdue, at a minumum. Plus, you got them done and out of the way early. So hardly of no use.",
