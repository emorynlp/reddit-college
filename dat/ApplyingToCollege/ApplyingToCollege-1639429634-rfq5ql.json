  "text": " I haven\u2019t actually applied to a college (besides the community college I am at, so it doesn\u2019t really count) before so I\u2019m not sure how a lot of this works. Im applying to an out of state college from a community college and wanted to find out how many of my credits will transfer. How do you find out? Should I just wait and  If I get accepted will they tell me which credits transfer and which ones wont? Or should I contact admissions and ask them if they can determine which of my classes transfer and which don\u2019t?",

Sometimes there will be a link to a credit equivalency tool.\n\nPSA, public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. Run the Net Price Calculator on the financial aid website of each college you are interested in, with the help of a parent, to see a need-based financial aid estimate before you apply.",
