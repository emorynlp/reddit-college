  "title:": "Check your colleges' admission websites to see what score reporting methods they accept",
  "text": "Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll.\n\nHOWEVER, other colleges still require an official score report sent directly from the testing agency to consider scores for admission. (Official reports were the default requirement for many years.)  For these colleges, order an official score report ASAP for Nov 1 deadlines.",
