  "text": "Any help would be appreciated!. \n\nDue to some personal and financial reasons I must defer my admission into YORK university to a later term. I am currently enrolled into the JAN winter 2022 term. I, now am presented with two choices to either apply for deferment in the MAY summer 2022 session or the SEPT fall 2022 session. Most of my friends have told me its not worth it as most faculty will be on summer vacations hence;  I'm going to find it difficult to settle down till the fall session starts.  Which term is better for an international student who has not physically joined the institution yet? \n\nI have already deferred once from SEPT 2021 to JAN winter 2022 and was offered unconditional admission the first time.  I am taking this time to apply to other universities for the fall session as a backup option to York. Does the term I select to be deferred affect the chances of the my acceptance in york? \n\nThank you for taking the time to read through my long post, english is not my first language so I hope my errors are forgiven.",
