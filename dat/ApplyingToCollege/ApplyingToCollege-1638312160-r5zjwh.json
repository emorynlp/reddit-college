  "text": "I need some advice super quick. I\u2019m an 18 y/o senior in high school. I was recently accepted into an accelerated program and was recruited for rugby to my dream school. My mom has never been hot on me doing there and dug up some dirt on the school. She found that the program I applied to is on academic probation due to Covid and hasn\u2019t been able to have their in person review yet. The college is known for the program I was accepted to and their admissions director told me the school worked out the problems and are in no risk of losing the program. My mom on the other hand is insisting I apply to other schools by other I mean the one my sister went to and has a high seat in the college of business. Is it worth it to apply to other schools or is this just my mom being a b*tch?",

      "text": "Apply to other schools as backups, including the school your mother is insisting you go to. If you get in, great. If you don't, that's fine too. Applying to as many colleges as possible can make your choice selection the most diverse and will act as insurance in case things do actually fall through with your dream school (hopefully they won't!). Your mom is right to have suspicions, but you are also right in wanting to choose your dream school. Spend some more time researching & asking questions into this school to be absolutely sure things won't fall through.",
