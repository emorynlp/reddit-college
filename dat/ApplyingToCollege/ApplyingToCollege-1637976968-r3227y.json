  "text": "i wrote about how i\u2019ve lived in a rural town all my life and love technology and comp sci but there weren\u2019t rlly any opportunities out here to significantly study it until i became an upperclassman and was able to enroll in a programming/game development certificate program at my local CC and took the opportunity. do you think this would fit under PIQ 6 (think abt a subject that inspires you and how you pursued it in or out of the classroom) or PIQ 4 (describe how you\u2019ve taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier) ??",
