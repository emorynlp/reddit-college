  "text": "A lot of young people are being misled by digital influencers and consulting companies. Such influencers say that if you participate in extracurriculars like volunteering and scioly, you'll have a big chance of getting into an American university with a scholarship. \n\nToday, I see hundreds of students who are losing sleep nights and creating huge expectations of getting into an Ivy League. It is common to see young people creating \"Instagram NGOs\" and participating in 2/3 NGOs created by other juniors/seniors to fill the Activity List.\n\nTo make matters worse, several NGOs founded by seniors encourage this \"illusion\" even more. Several of these NGOs say that the main advantage of being a volunteer is the possibility of increasing the chance to be accepted into a foreign university.\n\nAs we know, out of 100 international students, only 2 or 3 students will be accepted into a college with a full-ride scholarship. In the end, most of these young people will lose their time and be frustrated.",

      "text": "Yes...it is a delicate balance between realism and not taking away hope. I tend to fall on the side of realistic information/likely admit. Too much energy, money, and time are expended with a very small chance at a return for that investment. In most cases, all of that would be better spent in home country/close countries for undergrad and perhaps US for graduate studies.",
