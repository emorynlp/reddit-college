  "title:": "I visited 100+ top colleges, 360\u00b0 campus tour videos of each are on Youtube",
  "text": "Three years ago I began visiting colleges with a 360 camera so my students could see the campus without having to fly there. Now these videos (updated with 2021 ranking and stats) are on Youtube, 100% free, so you can visit them without leaving home!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYt channel: The Art of College: [https://www.youtube.com/c/theartofcollege](https://www.youtube.com/c/theartofcollege)\n\nAlphabetical list of schools: [artofcollege.org](https://artofcollege.org)\n\n(Share this free resource with more by retweeting and share on your social media!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In each video, there are some stats by \"looking down\":**\n\n\\- USNews undergrad rank from 2011 - 2016 - 2021 so you can get an idea of rank trend, rather than point in time rank (+/-4 is statistical noise)\n\n\\- Full undergrad cost of attendance. I couldn't find this info aggregated anywhere so I went to every school's website and added tuition+room+board+fees+insurance, basically everything you need to budget for 1 school year.\n\n\\- Average undergrad starting salary from Payscale.com\n\n\\- SAT ranges (new 1600 SAT)\n\n\\- Undergrad early and regular deadlines\n\n\\- Nearest major city and relevant stats\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**When walking/driving outside of buildings:**\n\n\\- Each video also has at least 10 fun facts that I felt really define that school. I hand picked these after reading from Fiske's Guide, Princeton Review guide, reviews from students at [unigo.com](https://unigo.com/), and online about the colleges. After reading hundreds of comments about each college, you end up with a \"feel\" for what's unique and what's the same everywhere.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**For better playback quality:**\n\n1. Youtube defaults to 720p \u2013 1080p playback, which is too low for 360\u00b0 video. Click the settings icon and change to 4k for MUCH better quality.\n2. If the video is choppy, try another browser (Firefox seems to work best)\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**These 2 college application advice videos should also be helpful:**\n\n\\- [Some thoughts and insights after visiting 100+ top colleges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3da_vxtEvo)\n\n\\- [Very specific advice for applications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFWAuIF-YBg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The full list:**\n\n1.

      "text": "Hooty Hoo! KSU!\n\nWelcome to Owl Nation!\n\nI think our campus is very nice. Not the biggest but lots of pretty trees and plants and the furthest class building is a 15 to 20 minute walk from the dorms depending on how fast you walk and the lemgth of your legs. Walking through the UV and the UVS dorms feel so friggin cute, with the blue sky and the nice bricks. Kinda like NY but more picturesque.\n\nOur park (aka The Green) is where most activities and tabling events happen. We also have a Hammock Club because the school allows us to set up hammocks on the trees. \n\nI have been to the Marietta campus once. I loved it so much that I decided to officially switch my major to a stem major (was on the fence and scared of traveling by bus). The bus even took me back to the dorms even though school was closed by 5pm because of pandemic. It was 7 by the time I got back. \n\nWe also have the BOB buses that run through campus that take you between the Kennesaw campus and the Marietta campus, and to and from off campus housing locations such as uPointe. The busses are free for KSU students. \n\nWe have lots of intramural teams and club sports that are run by students. We have several intramural softball teams for example. Our gym offers cooking classes and licensed nutritionists to make proper nutritional plans for you as well (all covered by tuition including gym access). For an extra fee, you can have a personal trainer.  We also have a rental in the gym to rent bikes, canoes, etc. We also have a rock climbing wall in the gym.\n\nI kinda of miss KSU. I didn't have friends but it definitely felt like a second home.",

          "text": "I would say UC Santa Cruz was the most memorable. It probably has the most unique campus and campus experience being in the forest. Very Heart of Darkness-y, a good place to be introspective.\n\nSimon Fraser University in BC Canada was also a favorite, even tho the main parts of campus were under construction. It's on a literal mountain top. Beautiful beautiful views.\n\nFinally my favorite to live and study at would be my alma mater Georgia Tech. It's the perfect physical size, not too crowded with lots of greenspace, but not too big that it's hard to walk from one end to the other. It's downtown but in an enclosed campus. The weather is great year round, it's the cheapest school for its rank, and a diploma from GT is worth its weight many times over in gold. I did hate it while I was there tho, classes were VERY hard.",
