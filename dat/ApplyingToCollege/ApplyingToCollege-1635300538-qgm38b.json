  "title:": "Any \"Underdog Schools\" for Aspiring Tech Startup Founder?",
  "text": "Top schools like MIT, Stanford, and Harvard are excellent for their entrepreneurial culture and insane amount of opportunities & resources.\n\nHowever, it may be challenging to get admission and it may also be very competitive inside the school.\n\nAny suggestion for \"underdog schools/colleges\" suitable for aspiring tech startup founders? Perhaps a smaller sch with tight knitted entrepreneurial community and sufficient resources for all the budding entrepreneurs?\n\nThanks in advance!",
