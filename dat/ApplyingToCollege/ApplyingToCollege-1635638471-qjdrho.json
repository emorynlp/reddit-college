  "title:": "Self Report vs Sending Scores",
  "text": "Hi all,\n\nIm kind of confused on when we are actually supposed to send our scores from collegeboard. I am applying to a lot of schools, but the ones I am sending my scores to tell me that I can self report them. Does that mean I just dont have to send them in from collegeboard? Is there a certain way I can tell when they want me to send scores, because I dont think I am properly understanding what they require\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks",

Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report *only after you are accepted and have decided to enroll.* Other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission.",
