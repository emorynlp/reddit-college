  "title:": "How hard is it to get into BS/MD programs compared to other top universities like JHU?",
  "text": "So basically, I am applying to a ton of unis but I have to choose one for early decision, and I am really not sure where to apply. For the longest time, my plan was to apply to JHU for ED, but I've recently discovered that Brown has an amazing BS/MD program, and to be honest, I like it more than JHU and am seriously considering doing ED there. I am also doing regular applications to other BS/MD programs at unis such as Rochester and case western, but I have not found a lot of information online about their admissions other than the standard statistics. If there is someone who has got into one of these programs I would be very grateful if you could share your experience :D \n\nPS. Just for reference, I recently got my predicted score as I am studying in an IB school, which is 41/45 with 7 in both biology and chemistry HL. I also think I have pretty good ECs, but nothing very unique.",

      "text": "Just FYI\n\n>An early decision applicant who indicates a desire to be considered for entry into the PLME may be admitted in December to both the College and the PLME. However, some students may be selected for admission to the College but not the PLME. The Office of College Admission realizes that these students may not wish to be admitted to the College under a binding early decision program if they are not also admitted to the PLME. Hence, the office asks these PLME applicants to apply regular decision. Those who apply and are admitted to Brown but not to PLME will be considered for the PLME program during the regular decision program. The outcomes would be either admission to the PLME program or admission to Brown (the College).",
