  "text": "Hi, I hope this is the right place to ask this kind of question and would appreciate any advice on this. So I'm currently a senior, trying to decide on my major for college. Throughout high school, I've always been better at humanities based subjects like history and English, but I have a passion for aerospace and aviation. I'm thinking of majoring in something along those lines. Math and physics classes are more interesting to me, but I'm also not great at them. Now that I am looking into college, it feels like I'm choosing between a major I'm more likely to succeed at vs. a major I'm more passionate in, if that makes sense?  Anyone else feel the same or have any advice on what should I do?",

The thought process is that if I choose a major in which I\u2019m more likely to succeed in, then I\u2019ll be more likely to have a prosperous life after, and after that, I can pursue what I\u2019m truly passionate about without any worries.",

Or do you want to manage an airline?\n\nI ask because I always wanted to be a pilot (military, specifically). I was told I needed to all kinds of math and physics. However, my senior year of high school I was getting a D in Alg 2 so I dropped it at the semester. Never took a single math or hard science in college and majored in business. Now - pilot. \n\nMy brother in law went to college and majored in Professional Aviation. No math. \n\nNow, Aerospace engineer = math. And also more math.",

I was thinking of going to Embry-Riddle (idk if you are familiar with the school) and majoring in Aeronautical Science, which seems to combine flight training with learning the knowledge. I do ok academically, I have a weighted GPA of 4.5 and have gotten mostly straight A's etc. But I don't know if I have the skills for this specific major. Especially since, my skills mostly lie in reading and writing, not STEM subjects or anything hands on. May I ask what was your pathway to becoming a pilot? And if you think studying for it in college would help in any way?",

Like I said, I wasn\u2019t a big math/physics guy, but did have to learn aerodynamics in flight school. Having that subject put in that context really helped and I did well (I can fully explain how a plane flies and why you need coordinated rudder during an aileron roll\u2026but sill can\u2019t explain how a ship floats).\nAs for my path:\n- University of Colorado\n- Int\u2019l business and Psychology\n- Joined ROTC (on accident, class sounded cool, signed up\u2026it was ROTC)\n- Couldn\u2019t do math or physics so never got a scholarship. \n- Selected for aviation out of NROTC (first three choices were 1. Aviator, 2. Naval Flight Officer, 3. SEAL)\n- Then normal Naval Aviator flight school.\n-",

Funny how you accidentally joined ROTC, looks like the military route went pretty well for you though!
