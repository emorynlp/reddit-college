This should only be a last resort, when there\u2019s nothing else valuable to do. Someone that is working on a small business, building an app, or doing independent projects will outshine someone who worked at a fast food restaurant.",

It depends on your background. If you are socio-economically privileged, and you\u2019re working at a fast food restaurant, the admission officer is going to think, \u201cThis kid really didn\u2019t make good use of his resources.\u201d If you\u2019re low income and doing the same thing, then it could be a different story, and could be excellent fodder for an essay. \n\nI get where you\u2019re coming from, because I know that admission officers are also wary of students who have extracurriculars that clearly come from their parent\u2019s influence and privilege. This definitely doesn\u2019t come across well, and in my experience, admission officers can see through it easily. However, compare two applicants: One did research building a solar-powered car in collaboration with research scientists at a university, and the other worked at a fast food restaurant. Which one is going to outshine the other? \n\nAlso, just a side note, but this is a business that we do on top of our normal jobs.

Most importantly , it\u2019s what you DO in the job : working your way up, thinking of a new product , or becoming a top salesperson or producer. A great college counselor once said : \u201cIt\u2019s not just getting a job at the yogurt shop, it\u2019s thinking of the newest flavors to present to the customers or becoming the lead manager of the yogurt shop\u201d that will look the best.

Yes, absolutely if you suddenly find a passion for MUN, robotics, or speech/debate, go for it - you have all of junior and half of senior year to make a difference.  But, since you've been doing cc for 3 years, that shows longevity, and it'd be a more cohesive story if you delved deeper into that.  What about researching different shoe materials, looking at the physics of different spike patterns on grass vs dirt vs gravel, or whatever you're running on?  Start a website for ranking high school cc runners (or if there isn't one, world professional runners) and \\*the important part\\* update weekly?  Or a blog which highlights different runners, or the different shoe materials that you just researched?  Get a job selling running shoes - we live in a city big enough to have its own store just for runners, so hopefully you do as well.  If not, there's plenty of sporting goods stores around.\n\nGood luck!",
