  "title:": "Med student applying for second degree in Engineering",
  "text": "Hello, \n\nI will graduate soon with a medical degree next year and I would like to apply for engineering in the USA/Uk. \n\nI took sat once in HS (2017) and got 1370 back then. I know it\u2019s not great but I prepared for about 23-26 hours on a whole for the test. \n\nI remember being waitlisted in Purdue back then and accepted into some universities in the UK. \n\nI know I can do much better if I can focus rn. \n\nI am willing to take SAT, SAT subject tests again to get into any reputed college for Engineering (CSE or ECE)  for a second degree. \n\nI\u2019ve been fascinated with Engineering for a long time now. \nPlease do not  give me suggestions about how there is an opportunity cost at stake because I truly want an engineering degree. \n\nI\u2019m 21 years old now. \n\nPlease help me understand my options and how I should proceed. \n\nThank you.",
