  "title:": "Do UC's/CSU's care if you have courses from a bunch of different community colleges? (Transfer student)",
  "text": "I'm a California resident hoping to transfer next year and just wanted to know if the number of community colleges you have listed will affect how likely you are to get accepted. I'm in the process of picking classes for this semester, and all the classes for one particular classes have *awful* reviews, at least for the sections that are open. So far I've already attended two community colleges (one for high school dual enrollment and one for after I graduated), and enrolling in a course at a school separate from those two would add a third school to the mix.\n\nI got a pretty bad enrollment date and just don't want my transfer GPA to plummet from one bad instructor, especially when it's for a foundation course. I'd imagine they can't hold having a ton of schools on record against me if I finish all the transfer req's, but I'm not 100% sure. For context I'm planning on going into engineering and will be applying to UCI, UCLA, and CSULB. Thanks!",

          "text": "I've used Assist before, mainly just concerned if this is something universities would hold against anyone in the application. E.g. if it's not explicitly stated on the website they'd prefer you (or require you) to take courses from the same college, would doing it be something that would \"lose you points\" when applying, so to speak?",
