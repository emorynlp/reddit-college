Tom Wolfe was known for his eccentrism: he turned down a Princeton acceptance to go to Washington & Lee.  For unknown reasons, Wolfe despised Duke.  After his daughter decided to go, he spent 11 years - you read that right, from 1993 to 2004 - writing a book about how bad Duke is.\n\nHis novel, *I Am Charlotte Simmons*, written over the course of a decade, 800 pages long, takes place at a fictional university named \u201cDupont,\u201d known for its academic excellence and national champion basketball team.  The protagonist, Charlotte, widely considered to be based on Wolfe\u2019s daughter, is a prodigy whose academic potential is destroyed by the hedonism and social fraudulence of Dupont.",

You don\u2019t have to find reasons to hate a school when you know all things considered Dook is a great institution academically and socially. I actually had a friends transfer from Carolina to Dook \ud83e\udd22 and visited him and thought the students and the campus was really nice. The proximity to the surrounding schools makes living in the Durham, Chapel Hill, RTP area full of amazing synergy. Some professors teach at the both campuses. When there\u2019s a speaker, or concert its usually free you can check it out. Basically if you get denied you don\u2019t need to hate the place for no reason, if it\u2019s where you want to be just transfer, go to grad school or professional school there, get a job to work there after you graduate. If you really want to be part of a university community there are several options.",

Most students there are ultracompetitive and pre-professional, so it can be difficult to truly find your people. also the community in Durham is not super fond of the university lol. I\u2019m sure if you go there things will work out for you but it\u2019s definitely not a haven of any sort!!",
