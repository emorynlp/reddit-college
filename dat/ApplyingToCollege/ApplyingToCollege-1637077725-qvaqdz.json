  "text": "I'm an international student who applied to a some schools in the early round. So, according to my counselor he mistakenly live only submitted the Lor without filling the additional info and declined ratings based on me. Both of us are clueless at this point on how to go back. There was something significant to say in the additional info which he didn't and now there's no way to our knowledge on changing this. Is there anything one of us can do? I feel like I'm really screwed now.",
