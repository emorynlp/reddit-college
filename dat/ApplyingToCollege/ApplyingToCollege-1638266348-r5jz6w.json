  "text": "Was I not supposed to reply to them after they've answered my question? Like a short thank you? \n\nI thought it would be proper etiquette tho no one cares, but after I already replied, I saw their mail address which literally says 'donotreply@....'.\n\nI'm sure it's not going to affect my application in a negative way(RIGHT???) but I was genuinely curious. Should we thank colleges for answering admissions questions? I think nobody cares but is it annoying for them if you send out thank you's?",
