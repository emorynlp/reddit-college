  "title:": "Do I have to categorize art teacher letters of rec as \"other\"?",
  "text": "I was looking through commonapp, and I realized that art teacher letters of rec are categorized as \"Other Recommender\". It doesn't explicitly state that the \"Teacher\" category cant contain recs from art teachers, but I was wondering whether it was better to separate it anyway?  \nMy art teacher has already submitted her letter under the teacher category, and I know she'd be alright resubmitting them (since she's already written it), but I'd also feel kinda bad asking her to go through submitting it all over again :')\n\nOverall, not a big deal. I've already got recs from two other core subject teachers, but ya know.",
