  "title:": "I console my mom after every rejection",
  "text": "Every time I get rejected (or accepted), my mom is sitting in the living room waiting for me to tell her how it went. And every time I get rejected/waitlisted, she becomes on the verge of tears. It's not like a typical Asian parent \"my kid's a failure, what will I tell my friends whose kids got into MIT\" kind of tears; it's a \"my kid worked so hard and I really wanted him to be happy and get in\" cry. Then I go over to her and assure her I'm not too sad so she feels better.\n\nIt's so sweet. I love my mom. Her reactions are far better than mine: she starts jumping and screaming when I get accepted. I wish I had made a \"Mom college decision reaction\" video because it's so funny and heartwarming to watch her react to my decisions.",

When I got rejected which happened most of the time she was like, yeah that University was shit that they didn't took you (not shitting on University, she says this just to relieve me) and says you deserve better. When I got accepted she was much more happy than I was. So yeah, I consider myself very lucky to have her. Also I always tried to hide the date when decisions are coming, so that she won't remain awake out but my father used to tell her \ud83d\ude10\n\nEdit : Thanks and I noticed that you edited your comment",

Did you write them anything about why you should get in and what did you say?  Was it original, undone, creative, out of the box type - or standard cut and dry?\n\nEither way, it's up to you - you can always do something amazing this year while working that sets you apart truly and re apply next year.   \n\n\nOnce you get older, you'll realize how little this matters.  Just be yourself, but if that self is wanting to go to a great school - thats ok too.  Rather then jump into a school that isn't right, take this next year and think - what makes me special, what sets me apart, what am I great at that others aren't - and do it.  Make them want you.",

                  "text": "I am sorry you didn't receive the acceptance letters you deserved because you are very intelligent and have the scores to back up your GPA. \n\nThe hard facts of your application should have put you in the running and ultimately delivered a few invitations from some of our larger universities.\n\nI am thinking your essays were not original enough (cultural story they have heard time and again...) or lacked a narrative to keep the readers engaged to the very last word.\n\nThe big red flag to me: \"published multiple papers.\" What were the topics? Did they have expected outcomes or challenge accepted views? (\"well, we all knew that...so why spend time going through the motions?) Anything really fascinating as a result of your research? Level of difficulty to get published? Next, WHERE were they published? Your school newspaper or a real scientific journal?--did you provide links and titles/dates for verification? Most kids in the US are not publishing any research and still get admitted to T20's so it may have looked like an application that was too polished and bought and paid for. I am sure you were only following advice.....\n\nLastly, did you apply for financial aid? That can be an obstacle, but if you had the $$ for expensive consultants, internships at various labs, and your background is truly verifiable, they get annoyed when international expect a free ride.\n\nOften when a student looks \"too good to be true\" it is, and every school not surprisingly rejects because it's so obvious. Consultants can be a wealth of good advice but every student is unique and the best consultants promise nothing because no one controls the jury of admissions officers. \n\nI wish I could offer some real answers--these are just ideas for you to consider. Perhaps a gap year and a new essay and an outstanding LOR from your actual lab mentors will change the tide next year...feel free to dm me for ideas. Wishing you good luck!",

Though she may be disappointed overall for a little while, I bet she will end up far more disappointed in the mistakes of the schools than in you. \n\nCountless factors are stacked against nearly every student applying to college these days.  Don't kill yourself trying to find where you went \"wrong\" - you didn't. \n\nGo crush it at the school you end up at. Keep doing the things you love and working hard. You'll be a bigger fish in a smaller pond, with more opportunities to stand out from the pack. \n\nWhen you end up happy, well-paid and fulfilled, your mom will be smiling the biggest smiles of her life.",
