  "text": "I am from south east asia. I started highschool late because I used to be sick when I was a kid. I graduated highschool in 2020 but because of covid everything got delayed. I previously applied to the U.S. in 2019. But now I found this college that I really wanna go to. Its a top school for my major, offers full ride. But if I apply now I'll be 24 by the time I start freshman. Also, in my country, I'm still a freshman at an average school. I really wanna get the experience of the school I'm eyeing. Should I apply again? Am I gonna be too old for the school?",
