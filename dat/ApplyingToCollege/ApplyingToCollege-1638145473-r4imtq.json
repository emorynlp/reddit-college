  "title:": "Sending letters of recommendation + transcripts to colleges after a gap year?",
  "text": "I'm in a situation where I attended a college for two weeks in August/September 2021 before withdrawing from the school (no credits earned) and taking the rest of the year as a gap year. I am applying to schools for Fall 2022, but because I hadn't planned for this to be a gap year, it's made the application process a little difficult. Teachers can no longer access my Common App since I already graduated high school, and I am not a transfer student since I received no credit from the school (literally was in class for four days). I am in contact with my high school counselor, but they are not completely sure how this process works either. How do I send my letters of recommendations/transcripts to colleges if not through the Common App? Do I mail them or does my counselor/teachers?",

      "text": "Are you not able to invite recommenders directly? If not then yes, you should be able to mail documents as long as you notify the colleges you are applying to. I think you'd likely mail them to the undergrad admissions office and I would also think your reccomenders should send them themselves if possible (FERPA waived and all). But you should reach out to colleges directly and inquire about it if possible.",

So the only way I can invite people is through the Other Recommenders section, which is for people besides teachers/counselors. Did your school do the same thing?",
