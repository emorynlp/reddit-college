      "text": "Pretty common for students to work.  Most work on campus, especially if they have a work study award as part of their financial aid.  Or they work places really close off campus, a lot of which is typically retail or restaurant.  Depending on the school it may be possible to find part time industry work related to your major fairly close to campus, but those job typically require junior or senior standing.\n\nOn campus jobs really run the gamut, you could be in a lab doing research scut, sitting at the entrance to the dining hall making sure all your classmates swipe in, setting up/tearing down conferences and special events, in the financial aid office answering the same 5 questions 100 times a shift (that was one of mine), give tours to prospective students, sit behind the counter in the library in case someone needs help with something, call alumni asking for donations, etc.",
