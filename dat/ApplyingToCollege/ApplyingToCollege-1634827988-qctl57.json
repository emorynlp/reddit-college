Been dealing with family issues since middle school that have caused me to shut down n not really do much for weeks at times. Played varsity baseball and football and was in DECA. Friends think I can get into App State or East Carolina (in state), Im feeling less confident after a meeting with my counselor.",

The less competitive (score-wise) the major you're targeting the better your score will look.  But, looking at their CDS data, only \\~1.5% of admits have below a 3.25 GPA, so the odds are long.  Not sure if that's weighted or unweighted, though; if unweighted then you might have a shot, assuming your weighted is higher than 2.9.",
