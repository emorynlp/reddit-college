  "text": "Hi everyone, I am 18F and I am applying to some colleges. I was wondering if I could write on my college applications and get a referral that I worked/interned for my mom's small company when I never really did? Is that safe? Could it have any repercussions in the future? \n\nThank you and please let me know.",

In sequential order, it starts with an application being denied, followed by an acceptance being rescinded, then being kicked out of school as an admitted student, then having a degree revoked.
