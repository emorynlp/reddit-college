  "text": "Essentially I got into Northeastern but I have to spend my first year of college at the NEU campus of humanities in London. \n\nAfter that year, I will transfer to the Boston campus.\n\nPros: I can explore europe, new experience, smaller cohort=better connections, decent internship opportunity, looks good on resume \n\nCons: Awkward transition to Boston campus after year, new country, don\u2019t get that \u201cfreshman college experience,\u201d limited course offerings. \n\nCould you guys share your input on what you would do if you were in my situation. \n\n(Please disregard financial aid in your responses.)",

Keep applying to more colleges for RD or wait for EA colleges and see if any of those options are better since you\u2019re no longer bonded by early decision.",

              "text": "yes our co-op program is good, but it shouldn\u2019t be the only reason you want to go to northeastern. in terms of socially Ive had trouble maintaining a friend group but that is largely due to covid remote classes and out of boston co-op. \n\nIs there a deadline on when you have to accept the Northeastern decision? Definitely wait it out, I would still consider a good state school like Rutgers over it",
