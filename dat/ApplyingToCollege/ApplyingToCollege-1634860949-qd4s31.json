  "text": "I have some schools in mind that are matches for me but I honestly have no idea what some reaches are. So I would be more than grateful to hear some opinions.\n\n**GPA:** 3.646\n\n**Courses taken**: 2 AP's (ap lit and ap lang), 9 dual enrollment courses, and around 8-10 honors courses, also 3 years of Spanish and pre calc.\n\n**EC**: I have 8 listed EC's, 7 are pretty strong.\n\n**Essay:** I think it is solid, it talks about how I didn't apply myself my fresh/soph year and then how I fell in love with watching my academic career grow.\n\n**Recommendation letter:** Very very good, well recognized AP teacher.\n\n**Preferred location:** anywhere\n\n**Major**: Debating between marketing, finance, and entrepreneurship\n\nI would love to hear some opinions thanks!",

(roughly a less than 10 percent chance.)\n\n**Northeastern, BU, Babson, Boston College** would be examples of reaches for you. (roughly a less than 25 percent chance.)\n\n**U of San Diego, Fordham, Virginia Tech, Michigan State, UPitt, NC State, Clemson, Loyola Marymount, Drexel, Seattle University** would be examples of target/match schools for you. (roughly 30-70 percent chance, depending on the school.)\n\n\\^\\^\\^ Sort of random assortment of schools with strong business programs. Just listed them to give you an idea of where you stand in terms of competitivity. *(Is that a word? Lol)*\n\nBest of luck. :)",
