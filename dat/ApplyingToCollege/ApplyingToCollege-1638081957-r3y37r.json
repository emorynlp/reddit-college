      "text": "It really is what you make of it. Some teachers are shitty and a pain to the point where you\u2019re teaching yourself, but then you get those occasional really good ones. We are pretty average for CS not gonna lie. I will say though the school itself really sucks. I\u2019ve been here for 3 years and i\u2019ve had countless issues with finaid, registrar, teachers, etc. \n\nA lot of kids in my classes struggled to land CS internships our second year summer, not sure if that has anything to do with the students themselves or what it was but it was a pretty reoccurring theme over here. \n\nGood Luck wherever you go!",
