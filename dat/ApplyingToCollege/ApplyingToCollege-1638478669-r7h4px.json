  "text": "I\u2019m applying ED to American University which has a really high acceptance rate (83%) for that pool of students! I\u2019ve demonstrated interest, have a relationship with my AO, have stats higher than the average, solid essays, good EC\u2019s, etc. I think my chances are pretty ok. The only thing I\u2019m worried about is the two other ED applicants I know about from my school. We have pretty different schedules/applications. Our courses are similar rigor wise, but I\u2019m aware that their grades are better than mine, even if it wasn\u2019t the same courses. We all go to a REALLY competitive high school when it comes to the top 20% of students and the AP group. Is their applying going to have an effect on my chances of admission? Additionally, do schools want to see more of the same with above average stats, or do they want to see something different with stats still above the average, just not as high as the prior example?",
