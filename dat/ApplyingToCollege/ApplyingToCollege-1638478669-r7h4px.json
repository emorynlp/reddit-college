  "title:": "Hey A2C ~ Will other applicants from my school have an effect on whether or not I get admitted?",
  "text": "I\u2019m applying ED to American University which has a really high acceptance rate (83%) for that pool of students! I\u2019ve demonstrated interest, have a relationship with my AO, have stats higher than the average, solid essays, good EC\u2019s, etc. I think my chances are pretty ok. The only thing I\u2019m worried about is the two other ED applicants I know about from my school. We have pretty different schedules/applications. Our courses are similar rigor wise, but I\u2019m aware that their grades are better than mine, even if it wasn\u2019t the same courses. We all go to a REALLY competitive high school when it comes to the top 20% of students and the AP group. Is their applying going to have an effect on my chances of admission? Additionally, do schools want to see more of the same with above average stats, or do they want to see something different with stats still above the average, just not as high as the prior example?",

      "text": "For the vast majority of high schools, you're going to be lumped into some sort of geographical bucket for comparative purposes, possibly subdivided socioeonomically.\n\nBut for some schools, you MAY be compared specifically to classmates. Whether this is the case can be hard to riddle out, but generally, if your HS sends consistent numbers of students to specific programs, it's more likely for that to be the case. If a school is uber-competitive, that also makes this a little more likely.\n\nAll of that said, this stuff is out of your hands, so don't worry much about it! Instead, try to focus on making YOUR story and application packet as compelling as possible. Oftentimes, focusing on what the \"successful applicants to [school x]\" do actually does a detriment to your own application because you'll come across as inauthentic, explicitly or otherwise.\n\nHope that helps, and good luck out there!",

          "text": "Thank you so much! I knew about the geographical thing just because my admissions officer represents a specified region. I am really hoping that they won\u2019t compare me, just because if it\u2019s based on grades, then I\u2019m the 3rd choice. I\u2019m not super fond of the other applicants Bc of personal reasons, but I still want them to succeed. It\u2019s just hard knowing that you\u2019re not as good as your competition is.",

              "text": "Of course! \n\nBut I'm going to push back a little on your last sentence :). Except for in very specific contexts, you won't be compared to your classmates solely in terms of numbers. Every single word and character of your application packet has the potential to set you apart, so if you attend to stuff like formatting activity descriptions consistently, writing stellar/vulnerable/memorable essays, and demonstrating interest properly (if your school tracks it), you'll be fine!",
