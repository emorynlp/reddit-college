  "text": "Is it too risky to apply ED and not know how much financial aid you are getting? I ran the Net Price Calculator and the number there is affordable, but my parents are small business owners, so it might complicate the financial aid. How negotiable is financial aid, especially when you apply ED, and under what circumstances can you back out of ED due to financial reasons? (people usually say if it varies a lot from Net Price Calculator, but like how much?)",
