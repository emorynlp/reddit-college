  "text": "I thought it wasn't required. I submitted the mid-year report of mine but not the predicted. Will there be issues? I don't think my school will be willing to (they will be but you know, annoyed) make a report for me because they made one for mid-year report earlier than anyone else's.  \nSo, am i in trouble?",
