  "text": "It\u2019s not a class that I\u2019m currently taking but I\u2019m taking the 2nd semester of ap calc bc. I told my counselor that I want to replace it with a study hall and she got all judgmental. First, she asked if my Kim was ok with this (what does my mom have anything to do with this???) and then she asked for my list of colleges so she could notify them but the way she worded it was so judgmental and almost sounded threatening. I know that it\u2019s standard procedure to let colleges know about updates but I wanted to do it myself and now I just feel weird and am not sure if I\u2019m making the right decision to not take the class",
