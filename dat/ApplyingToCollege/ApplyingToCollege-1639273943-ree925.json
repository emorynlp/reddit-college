  "text": "I just logged into my common app and noticed that like 2/3 of my additional info section has disappeared. I checked back on submitted applications and they were fine, so basically things just disappeared at random? I haven\u2019t messed with my common app since October. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve noticed this either. With some of the college-specific sections, I\u2019ve come back to find my answers have randomly disappeared.\n\nI guess moral of the story is to double check everything all the time.",
