  "text": "So I'm currently working through my supplemental essays and Lehigh in particular is giving me a hard time. When I first filled out my Common App, I only saw three essays to complete - A general \"why this major\", a \"why this college\", and an anti-racism focused one. However, it turns out that the specific program I would like to apply for (Computer Science and Business) also has ANOTHER short supplemental attached to it that I did not see until now. This would be fine, but that supplemental is asking \"why this program\" when I already raved about that specific program in the other two supplemental at minimum in passing. I feel like I'm at risk of coming off as \"fake\" interested in the school and hyper focused on the CSB program. Should I rewrite the other two supplemental, or leave things as is?",
