The rule of thumb: never ignore states or ordering of words.\n\nThe University of California, San Diego (UCSD) is not the same as the University of San Diego (USD). Similarly, the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is not the same as the University of Chicago nor are either of those the same as Chicago State University. The University of Michigan is not the same as Michigan State University. The University of Miami is in Miami, Florida; Miami University (of Ohio) is thousands of miles away.\n\nThe potential for confusion even arises in Canada: The University of Montreal/Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (UdeM) is not the same as the University of Quebec at Montreal/Universit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (UQAM).",
