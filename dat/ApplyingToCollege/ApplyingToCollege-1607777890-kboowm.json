  "text": "Tw\\~ cancer,death\n\nIt's coming out on 17th so 18th December for me who lives in Asia currently. And 9 years ago, on December 18th 2011, my mom took her last breath after a lengthy 2 year battle with cancer. It's scary that it's been 9 years. I feel like just yesterday my mom dropped me off at the elementary school and gave me a tight hug. And now she's gone. and I'm going to have to open my decision without her.\n\nMan, I miss her so much. If she was here, I would have had the help to do so much more things. If she was here, maybe my dad would have actually been more present with us than working day and night for our family. If she was here, if she was only here.\n\nps- to anyone looking forward to decisions, please remember that these are the last 7 months you're going to spend with your family all the time. Spend your time wisely.\n\nUpdate- [I got in](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/kfcv28/there_has_been_an_update_to_your_application/)",

My mom is great and is enthusiastic, but he was the dude that would jump up and down with happiness and go nuts when stuff happened. \n\nEvery little achievement of mine would make him so proud, and I loved making him proud. He missed me learning to drive (something he always looked forward to) and college admissions (which he was also crazy excited about). Every time I open a decision, I imagine how he would have reacted and miss him so much. It\u2019s really hard, but remember that she\u2019s watching over you and I know you\u2019re making her proud.",
