  "title:": "How should I go about having an inaccurate school report?",
  "text": "Really confused about this, I asked my counselor for a copy of it and it seems to have a lot of misinformation in order to make the school look better than it actually is.\n\nThey omit certain restrictions on AP classes, downplay the fact we are an underserved community (Just says we are \u201ceconomically diverse\u201d), doesn\u2019t mention we are a Title I school, and even lies about having certain AP classes that we don\u2019t even offer. The NMSC info doesn\u2019t have numbers, it just says that there WERE people given awards (only 2 at my school but this isn\u2019t stated in the report) and that the class of \u201822 has finalists despite them not being announced until February. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how to address this. I asked my counselor and didn\u2019t get an answer. I don\u2019t think I should contact colleges because I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m supposed to acknowledge seeing the school report. Any help or advice? Am I just screwed?",
