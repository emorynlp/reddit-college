  "text": "I shot myself in the foot with this one. I thought I wasn't good enough to be enrolled into a UC so I didn't apply, and it's too late to create an account. \n\nI did apply for CSUs though. However, there is also the option of CC to UC. I'm worried that I just shut myself out of good opportunities. \n\nI'm feeling iffy about both of these options. I want the best for my future.\n\nTransfer students and CSUs have less opportunities and I'm afraid I won't be able to land internships as much or make any actual friends like UC freshmen if I enter in as a transfer.\n\nPlease, if you have suggestions, comment them down below.",

San Jose state is one of the favorites amongst local tech companies due to its location in Silicon Valley. If you apply yourself wherever you go, you\u2019ll be successful, trust me.",

      "text": "While transfer students do have less opportunities, I would say CSU students having less opportunities is false as a blanket statement.\n\nI would know a bit about this, I'm actually both. That said, I am at the unarguably best CSU if we define best by acceptance rates, student outcomes, and funding, but I would say both Cal Polys, SDSU, and SJSU students have A TON of opportunities. Just as much as most of the UCs. Some others have amazing opportunities in certain fields, like CSULB for nursing, CSUF for business, Sonoma for viticulture, etc.\n\nIf you end up at a Poly or SJSU, you're going to have pretty similar opportunities overall vs. the UCs. Fun fact actually, Cal Poly SLO engineers get paid more than engineers from ALL UCs in all majors except for a few like CS and CS at UCLA/Cal. Our business school has the second highest undergrad median starting salary of all UC/CSU business schools- it's a whopping $10K higher than UCI's for business admin, 19K higher than UCI bizecon. And we would all say UCI is a great school.\n\nI'm a business major heading into an fairly prestigious internship that pays $41/hr, aka $85K a year. I'll be having a $100K first year TC when I graduate. I'm not the only one. I was shocked at how many people were repping their big4 internship swag when I first came to campus.\n\nSo yes, overall you'll have less opportunities at the CSUs because there's random, admittedly no-name schools like CSU Channel Islands or CSU Monterey Bay that have next to no meaningful outcomes.\n\nBut at the top CSUs? It's about the same. Personally, from Cal Poly SLO? It's even better.",
