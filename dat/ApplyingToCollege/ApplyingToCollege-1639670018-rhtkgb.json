      "text": "Neither are safeties, Denver has a 59% acceptance rate and American is 36%. Like Tulane, American looooves people who apply ED (they have an 81% acceptance rate for ED applicants lol) so if you\u2019re applying RD you may have a tough time (They do have an ED2 in February if you end up really liking it). They also have the better business school.",

I would reccomend adding another college or two to your safety list, while taking into consideration the generosity of the school's financial aid department.",
