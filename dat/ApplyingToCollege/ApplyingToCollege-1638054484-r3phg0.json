  "title:": "Which New York SUNY has the best vibe?",
  "text": "My HS (public in NYC) requires we apply to at least one SUNY or\nCUNY. As I want to leave the city I am trying to pick a SUNY. However my initial choice Binghamton -looked great online but since then I\u2019ve heard has an isolated campus (?). I\u2019m a poli sci major - so my next choice was Albany but I didn\u2019t hear great things about that either (?). I really don\u2019t want to be too far north because it\u2019s so cold. And Stoney Brook doesn\u2019t seem great for my major. \nHonestly I want solid academics and some fun, but not isolated in the middle of nowhere. Which SUNY should I pick?",
