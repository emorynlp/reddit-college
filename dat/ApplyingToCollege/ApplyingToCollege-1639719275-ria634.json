  "text": "I know on here you'll see advice saying to go to community College or in state college for two years then transfer, but transfer admissions are *even more* competitive.",

      "text": "The institution you attend does not change your likelihood of being able to transfer to another institution. The exception to this is that many states have created preferential transfer programs from city colleges to state universities. \n\nAs an aside, state universities and city colleges are not \"really low tier\", they're different kinds of schools from private research universities. That makes them less prestigious, but undergraduate degrees are very similar everywhere.",

      "text": "Transferring honestly isn\u2019t a great solution for many.  You lose the friendships you\u2019ve made, the connections you\u2019ve established with professors, the support and sheer fun of the clubs and activities you\u2019ve joined, and possibly postpone your graduation if classes don\u2019t transfer or your new school has program requirements that your former school didn\u2019t offer.  With some exception, it\u2019s often a good idea to simply fall in love with and excel at your state college.  But 2+2 community college programs can be terrific if you are a late performer who wants to go from CC to a state college or university.",
