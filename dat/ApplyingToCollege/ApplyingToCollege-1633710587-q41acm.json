      "text": "Mostly in Europe (especially EU states), some even free for international applicant and in English, others with (compare to US tution) 'symbolic' fees either for international or to study in English.\n\n\nI would advise you to look into Denmark university, they wil even pay you, when some criteria are met. Netherlands, Belgium, where you can apply with same application as into UK universities ( UKs are not cheap, but they provide  good loans) \n\nGermany/Austria has some programs in English. Switzerland has good unis, but you should probably know German ( especially around Zurich area they don't offer undergrad programs in English)\n\nSpain is quite easy to get in and tution (at public universities) is extremely low (max 500\u20ac a year) even for international students.\n\n\nOutside of Europe, I am not sure, but if you know Spanish , probably universities in Mexico, for example UNAM in Mexico city.\n\nAlso New York university in Abu-dhaby/ Singapore/ Czech Republic has quite high scholarships.",
