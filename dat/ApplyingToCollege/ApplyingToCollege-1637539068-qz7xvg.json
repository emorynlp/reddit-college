  "text": "When filling out the UC application, it says that honors courses are only counted when they are taken in the state of California. Should I still have \"honors\" be in the course name to show that I still took an honors course, as denoted on my transcript? Also, just to confirm, I should NOT mark these honors courses as approved-honors, correct? I know AP classes count, I am specifically asking about \"honors.\"",
