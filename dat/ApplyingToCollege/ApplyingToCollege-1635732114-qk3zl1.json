  "text": "So this is probably me being paranoid. But Brown didn't have a question about whether we wanted our SAT scores considered, whereas every other college I applied to did. I saw them in their copy of my common app, but I'm not 100% sure if they are going to be considered. Will they be automatically? Do I need to self report them again in my portal?",
