  "text": "I\u2019m considering asking one of my teachers for a supplemental letter of rec to cover my recruiting for her creative writing class, which was a months long project I did during quarantine last year in response to the class not having enough applicants that year. While I tried to include in my common app - doing question 5 - I feel like I don\u2019t cover the whole value of the project. It took 349 words on my UC PIQs to cover it.\n\nNote: I\u2019d ask my teacher to totally focus on the recruiting.\n\nCons: it\u2019s another letter of rec and a ton of online college advice sites say that supplemental from teachers are generally just fluff. It could hinder my admissions officer and weaken my application\n\nPros: recruiting a whole 36 students as my own project displays initiative and passion. I think it\u2019s one of a kind enough to be more than just another teacher recommendation and cover what my common app can\u2019t. Plus it\u2019d be from my teacher\u2019s POV.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I could include my story in the \u201canything else we should know about\u201d section instead, but won\u2019t that be too much? To be honest, all I know about the common app is that there\u2019s a prompt essay and supplementals, so I wonder if there\u2019s another section I could write my story.",
