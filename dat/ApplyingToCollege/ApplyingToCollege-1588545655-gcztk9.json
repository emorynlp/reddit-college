  "text": "I took the 20 rejection letters available on [ivyhub.org/decision-letters/](https://ivyhub.org/decision-letters/) and added my own rejection from Berkeley. I had a machine learning algorithm learn from these letters and spit out its own generation - to create a 'generic rejection', if you will. Here's the result:\n\n    \n    The admission committee has completed its Regular Decision meetings, and I am very sorry to tell you that you will go on to great success in your educational plans and on through life. Our experience is that the vast majority of students who do not gain admission to maintaining its Regular Decision may be hoped to achieve success in your college plans and on the time and effort you have put into the college search and application process. We hope this decision in no way reflections, and sixteed students who apply this year. As the number of well-qualified applicants who apply to Northwestern. As sure each student apply reserved for Early Decision process, it is with regret that I inform you that we are not offering you admission to the University of Pennsylvania.Your choices and resinical pursued applicants. Respectfully and thoughtfully reviewed multiple times, by many individuals. Please see this is a careful consider plans on selection process. For answers to that the vast majority of opportunities are final. We were humbled by the talental from selection clarity, and since our decisions selection processors, we considered many other applications for answers to some consideration. We wish you the best with your candidacy, the Admissions Committee decisions made a student or applying under our Early Decision plans and the difficult college of colleges there in advition to a candidate's competition for admission to Rice has gown considerably in recent years.\n\nThere are more variants it generated - I'll share them if you guys want.",
