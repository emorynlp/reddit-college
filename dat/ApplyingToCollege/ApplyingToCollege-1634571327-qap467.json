  "text": "Like a lot of schools, my school made everyone's grades pass/fail second semester sophomore year because of COVID. But they also gave us the option to choose to take classes pass/fail in junior year. I was doing badly on a class (math) so I took it pass/fail. Everything else was for a grade.
