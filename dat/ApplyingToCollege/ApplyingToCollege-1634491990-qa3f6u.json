  "text": "I feel like my stats are trash compared to so many people. Like I tried pushing myself on the SAT and I got an okay score but not at all what I wanted especially because I'm applying as a CS major to top schools. I feel like I'm going to get rejected everywhere. Does anyone else feel the same way?",

My Super score is a 1350(770 in Math and a 580 in reading) my extracurriculars are okay with some CS ones and my GPA is a 3.77uw and 4.31w and I've taken a handful of advanced classes. My parents think it's better for me to submit my scores but idk",

      "text": "It might help to try to define \"good enough\" and \"so many\".\n\nThe SAT score of a guy with a 1500 is lower than \"many people's\" since \"many people\" have higher than a 1500.  Ditto the guy with a 1550.  Thousands of test takers score higher.\n\nAre those scores \"trash\"?\n\nYour stats may indeed turn out to not be good enough to get into a T10 school.  You may get rejected at every T10 you apply to.  Statistically speaking, that would not be surprising; those schools are highly selective and one's chance of admission at a given T10 is not independent of one's chances at other T10s.\n\nSo what if you do?",
