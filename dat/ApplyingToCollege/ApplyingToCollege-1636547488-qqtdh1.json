It's a huge school meaning you'll find its alum anywhere you go, pretty easy to get in for qualified students, and usually offers a good amount of scholarships (even to international students). Arizona is a good state to get tech jobs as there are many tech companies in Phoenix.\n\nI heard that it's probably not worth it to CS students, but if you want to academically challenge yourself, take a look at Barrett Honors College too!",

If you're into FAANG type of companies, I personally know a ton of people that intern/work full-time there.\n\n  \nIf you're a space nerd like me, there aren't many better school choices than ASU (I'd argue it tops some T20s). We're 1 in 7 institutions in the US to develop and send instruments into space and the 3rd most funded school by NASA (I've also interned there!). Let me know if you have any other questions!",
