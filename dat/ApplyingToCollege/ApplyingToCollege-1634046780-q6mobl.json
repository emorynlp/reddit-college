      "text": "You seem to be doing great on your EC already.  I'd probably just lean into what you're already doing and shoot for BETTER rather than MORE.  That is, instead of finding more EC, I'd suggest you look for more responsibility or success in what you're already doing.   If you really feel the need to add a new area, I'd look for some writing-based EC for breadth, but only if you think you can be successful at it.  Adding more purely for the sake of having a longer list is for fools.",

          "text": "Yep, mostly agree. Try for leadership positions in the things you're doing. Be president of the BSU and other clubs. Or do a sub-project within those clubs and lead those. Social Media Manager or Recruitment Leader is and sounds a lot better than \"member.\"  \n\n\nAlso, think about which teachers you want to be your recommender right now. Talk to them and be open about yourself and ask for advice.   \n\n\nStart looking into the field of psychology and start making some sort of plan wherein that wide-field you want to go to. Start mapping it out. You may change directions in the future but this shows you know how to make a plan instead of letting the winds blow you where ever they may.  \n\n\nBut above all make sure you keep your grades up and take the hardest course you can. Blow away the SAT/ACT too but hopefully, many schools will keep the test-optional thing going for years to come.  \n\n\nIf you want to have more in-depth and personal advice feel free to DM me.   \n\n\nStart looking into colleges now. It's never too early.",
