  "text": "I'm a first-year student at a half-decent state school majoring in CS. I'm hoping to transfer for my second year (i.e., I wanna apply for fall 2022). I know that getting in as a transfer student to some of the really nice schools is impossibly difficult, but I'm hoping that some of the T20s are doable.\n\nI got pretty screwed fall 2021, just like so many other people. I had some pretty decent ECs - a few ISEFs, grand+special awards at ISEF, GSF awards, co-authored a paper published to a top journal (like legit top) under a T3 uni prof, and a bunch of other things. I don't think there was a systematic flaw in my application - the essays and recs were defo not bad and my school grades were also solid. This is evidenced by the fact that I got waitlisted at pretty much every T10 CS school - MIT, CMU, you name it. I didn't, however, actually get accepted to a single T30.\n\nSo yeah that's just me giving some context. I'm coming to realize that there are things I want that my current school doesn't offer and I really want to transfer to a nicer school before all the shit I did in HS loses value.\n\nNow, at my state school, my understanding is that A+s can be given at the discretion of the professor, i.e., there are some profs at my school that don't have an A+ grade in their course - the maximum you can get is an A.\n\nThat being said, none of my courses are like that. I just realized I'm getting an A instead of an A+ in my calc course, making it the third course I'm likely going to get an A in. For context, I'm doing 7 courses (including some super basic intro courses) and I'm probably getting A+s in all of the others.\n\nI know that at my school, your GPA doesn't get impacted *at all* if you get an A instead of an A+ because of what I mentioned earlier. My worry is that the As are going to look less nice on my *transcript* even though I'm probably getting a 4.0.\n\nWhen trying to compete for a vanishingly small number of seats, will my As screw me over?\n\nInsight would be greatly appreciated.\n\ntysm",
