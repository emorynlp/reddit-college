  "title:": "Is it worth putting Hackathons in Common App Honors?",
  "text": " I've won first place at MIT Virtual Hackathons in the past and am considering putting them as Honors. I'm also wondering what type of Honor it is?\n\n**I don't know what level of recognition it classifies as (school, state/regional, national, or international)**.\n\nBut I do know that people from all around the world were selected from the initial application to participate. To be specific, my team won 1st out of a total of 300ish and 500ish total participants respectively. It might also be noteworthy that I was among the overwhelming minority of high schoolers participating in these events (the rest were adults in the tech/biz/health industries).\n\nHere's a generic example: [https://covid19challenge.mit.edu/](https://covid19challenge.mit.edu/)  \nThere is only a singular competition per hackathon and has participants from all around the world... It wasn't geographically split up though, which is why I'm confused about the level of recognition. \n\nHopefully, the link gives more insight.\n\nAny advice?",
