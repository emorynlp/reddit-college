  "text": "Hey guys I really wanted to study at Harvard but the school system in my country sucks we don\u2019t have extracurricular and class leadership or even school counselors . So it\u2019s kind of impossible for me to get there so what school do you think I can apply to and get actually accepted but at the same time it is a good school and has a good scholarship and financial aid system??",
