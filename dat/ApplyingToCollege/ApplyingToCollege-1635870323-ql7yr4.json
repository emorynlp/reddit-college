Don\u2019t overthink it. Don\u2019t ask yourself,  \u2018what do we want to read?\u2019 Ask yourself, \u2018what do I think I want to  say?\u2019\u201d",

      "text": "That's some really poor advice. It doesn't help at all. This is why being a former AO college dean doesn't qualify them to help in writing essays. Of course, you have to be aware of an audience. That's the entire point of communication!   \n\n\nI, personally, would want to say this entire admission process is horrible. That going to higher education to feel like having a chance to survive is a nightmare situation. That all these people are complicit in maintaining an unjust and cruel system.  This game of status-seeking and hierarchy is arbitrary and there is little to no meritocracy. But by not playing this game I will be crushed and have no power to change it.   \n\n\nNah, I don't think that's how to play this admissions game well.",
