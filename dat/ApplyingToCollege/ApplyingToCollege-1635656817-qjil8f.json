  "text": "Hi! I read that if you have very impressive ECs on your resume, AO will check to see if there is an official website with your name on it.\n\nAs an international student with impressive ECs (international level and I honestly believe it will be a make-or-break factor), how can the AO verify this? I'm worried that they will ignore my top ECs because my name doesn't show up in a google search in English (a lot of my achievements are in Chinese). Would it be a fine if my transcripts and LORs mention my extracurricular activities? Also, there are some minor activities that are listed on the transcript but not on the LOR (I didn't list them on the \"bragging\" sheet), is that a fine too?",

      "text": "When they check, it is usually through the guidance counselor. If anything looks fishy or too amazing to be real, they will call the school and ask for verification.\n\nIf you have lied, they will automatically reject you and often the other colleges will be notified. This happened to one of my clients, who added in a bunch of stuff after my final edit of her app. \n\nShe spent a year at community college.",
