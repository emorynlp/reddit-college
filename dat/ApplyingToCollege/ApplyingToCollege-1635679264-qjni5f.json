  "text": "To start out, I am a National Hispanic Scholar, and as of two days ago, no one had really reached out to me about it. However, yesterday I received a handwritten note from a member of Northwestern's CLAVE program (a group that works with their admissions department) encouraging me to apply next year and gave me his personal email. Will this help my chances of being admitted next year if I apply ED? Or is this not necessarily a sign of interest in me as a student?",

That's all they have about you.\n\nApply ED only if: (1) it's absolutely your first choice, (2) it's definitely affordable according to the NPC estimate, (3) you don't need to see financial aid or scholarship offers from other schools, and (4) you will be prepared to withdraw all other apps upon an acceptance from your ED college.\n\n(I know of a hispanic student who was waitlisted in RD last year at Northwestern, no NHRP but good SAT. I wonder what would have happened in ED.)",
