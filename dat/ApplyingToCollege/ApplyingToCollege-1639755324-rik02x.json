  "text": "Got the results of the only SAT I was able to take this morning (was supposed to do the November one too but I got a really bad cold - not COVID - and besides feeling like shit I didn\u2019t want to risk getting a bunch of other people sick). Ended up with an unusual 1320 - 760 R/W, 560 Math. I honestly have no idea how this reflects as a business major but I swear I sometimes think I have dyscalculia or some shit. Anybody else get similar scores today",

Probably means you need to brush up a bit on geometry/algebra and you'll be able to do that in future courses when necessary. Because you answer so quickly you can make impulsive mistakes you might not make if you had been grappling with the material concurrently in class.",
