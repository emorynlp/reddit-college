  "text": "i am currently writing one of my essays that focuses heavily on my cultural background. i included many \"cultural\" words (from a different language but written in english) in quotations (the apps won't let me use italics) but am not sure if its okay to have foreign words due to the fact that AO's might not have the time to decipher them all. should i leave the words in or is it too risky and i should just replace them with their english counterparts?",

      "text": "This is absolutely ok in general, but try to be aware that using too many of them can make your essay difficult to understand. I typically recommend doing this only with nouns, specifically, and only when their technical meaning isn't extremely important to the story you're telling.\n\nHope that helps, and good luck out there!",
