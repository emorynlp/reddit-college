  "text": "hey! so i\u2019m applying for fafsa rn, but there\u2019s one thing i\u2019m iffy about. my household income in 2020 was pretty okay (~90k), but then my dad lost his job late spring 2020. now our household income is around ~35k. my dad is not retired. his income is basically $0 once he stopped receiving covid relief. how should i go about this? all of my college savings had to be used up since my mom\u2019s the only one with a full time job. i work part time, but it\u2019s barely enough.",

      "text": "You should talk to your college's financial aid office- you need something called \"professional judgment\". It's for when your FAFSA doesn't match your current circumstances- basically exactly what you are going through.  The financial aid officer can ask for documentation and then adjust your aid package. \n\nIn general,  you go ahead and file the FAFSA as is, knowing it will be off, and then contact your college(s) of choice and set up appointments.",
