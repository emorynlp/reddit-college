  "text": "So long story short, I fucked up my sophmore and junior years, for a number of reasons that I don't wanna get into. By \"fucked up\", I don't mean that I got a few Cs, but that I straight up failed the majority of my classes for three semesters. My cumilative GPA would have been below a 2 if not for the fact that my school didn't count Fs into GPA calculations due to COVID.\n\nMy question is: what colleges should I apply to? Right now I'm thinking of going the community college route, getting good grades for the next two years, and transferring to a four-year institution, but I also want to apply to four-year universities this year. Will any college even accept me? I'm looking to major in CS, and I live in Massachussets, if that matters. My grades this year have all been decent (mostly As and A-s), and I think I'll get a good score when I take the SAT in November (\\~1400), but I'm not sure that'll matter considering how bad my grades were for the last two years.\n\nAny advice is appreciated <3",

Their counselor is helping them submit a letter explaining their circumstances and they'll also be using that space within the extenuating circumstances on the application to explain what happened. They're looking at colleges with 75-85% and up acceptance rates - if I remember correctly, Lasell, Lesley, Merrimack, Salem State Uni, Simmons Uni.",
