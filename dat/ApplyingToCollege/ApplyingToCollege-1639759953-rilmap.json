  "text": "I wanted to make this post as a source of optimism for all of you who are dealing with college apps and the associated stress. This past week I was accepted to a top 5 law school but the road was certainly not an easy one. \n\n4 years ago I was in the same position as a lot of you. My older brother had attended an HYPSM, so I felt an immense amount of pressure to attend a prestigious university. This pressure came from family members, my friends, and worst of all myself. I felt that my worth would be determined by where I went to college. I even applied ED to Cornell because I was so desperate to attend an Ivy League, not because I had any sincere interest in the school. I was rejected. I remained optimistic that I would have some luck in the regular round. I did not. In total, I applied to 18 colleges, I was rejected by 15 and accepted to my 3 safety schools. \n\nI will not lie, I felt worthless, I felt like I had spent 4 years working hard to build what I believed to at least be a respectable application. Nevertheless the experience taught me something. When I started college I promised myself that I would attend a top-tier law school and I worked everyday to reach my goal. I did not rely on dumb luck or some miracle, because I knew that nothing helped me when I was applying to college. I relied on myself. I worked hard and smart and I am happy to report that I reached my goal and I have made those around me proud. \n\nI wanted to share my story in the hopes that it will inspire someone or at least remind you all that rejections do not define you. Keep your chin up and let them motivate you.",
