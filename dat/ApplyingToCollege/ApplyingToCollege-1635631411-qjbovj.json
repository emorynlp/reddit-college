  "text": "My kid is applying to one that says their merit aid deadline is November 1st.\n\nShe waited until the last minute(par for the course). She is eligible for a fee waiver through her school, which she says she submits the app and then her counselor puts through the waiver.\n\nWill it still count as submitted today of she is waiting on the waiver? Should I just pay the application fee?",
