  "text": "Is there any benefit to taking my math classes early? I\u2019ve been skipping a few math classes and this year is the last year I can actually take a math class at my school- next year I\u2019ll have to either take college courses or a class outside of my school. Will these courses show up on my transcript? I\u2019m concerned because I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll only have two math classes on my high school transcript and I don\u2019t know if the year I took them actually shows up.",
