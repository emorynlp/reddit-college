  "text": "I'm currently in WUSTL and I'm considering transferring due to cost/underwhelming career help/average cs courses. Currently paying sticker price or \\~75k for WUSTL and UMass would be around 30-35k as I have residency. In my sophomore year. Looking at price and academics alone, which would be the better option? Thanks!",
