  "text": "Hey, A2C!\n\nI'm submitting all my applications on December 15 because the organization that helps me with applying to US universities has this quite strict deadline. I have written a paper on Physics and, even though I've tried, I don't think it'll be published by then. Because of that, I'll have to submit it as an application update through my portals. Will colleges consider this achievement the same way they would if I submitted my apps with the paper already published? On my Additional Information section, I've mentioned it has already been submitted for publication.\n\nThanks in advance!",
