  "text": "I just realized that I only participated in Science Olympiad for ~15 weeks, not the 27 I put on Common App. Fwiw I did like 3 hours each week. I only did it one year and it's listed pretty low on my list of activities since I didn't advance past invitationals. Is this something that means I should email the 5 colleges I already applied to or is it not a big deal?",
