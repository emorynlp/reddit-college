  "text": "I know a big one is immigrant story. I'm not writing about that. My idea was to write about how being thousands of miles away from home alienated me from my culture and I slowly lost my cultural identity, and how I overcame that through my culture's art. Thoughts?",

              "text": "oh its just a term i picked up from college essay guy's vids and articles. here's kind of what I mean:\n\ncommon connections:\n\n* basketball taught me teamwork and hard work\n* theater helped me overcome stage fright and become more confident\n* helping my sick grandmother inspired me to be a nurse\n\nall of these are obvious connections that anyone could make. the AO reading the first few sentences of your essay already can guess how it ends. unmemorable and probably written by tons of other people already.\n\nuncommon connections:\n\n* basketball inspired me to pursue aerospace engineering\n* theater helped me cope with racism and inspired me to become an activist\n* helping my sick grandmother inspired me to become a nutrition science major\n\nthese are kind of randomly put together, but you get the idea -- most people writing about basketball, theater, and sick grandmas aren't going to make those connections. it subverts expectations and leaves a lot more room for interesting writing. the AO will probably find these sorts of essays more memorable and unique.",
