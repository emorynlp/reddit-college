  "text": "Stanford is extremely overrated and only gets so much interest in this sub due to the sub being primarily Californians, the plurality of whom are from the Bay Area. It is not T5 in USNEWS, it has a higher acceptance rate than Columbia and Harvard, and it now lags harvard and mit in startups and venture capital per capita. Also, Stanford doesn\u2019t command the same respect as HYPM outside the US. It is often compared to prestige of Harvard on this sub, which is hilarious, because anise active internationally believes Harvard is a whole different level, along with mit and perhaps Yale. Stanford just isn\u2019t at the same level perception wise",

      "text": "columbia is overrated. only people in New England know of it, and it games the rankings by choosing when to include GS statistics. When my classmate first told me he got into colombia, I thought it was for a vacation.\n\n^I could use that as a counterargument, but really: all of them? Fucking good schools. Between the two though, Stanford has a stronger name because its clearly the \"best\" in the West, which isn't an argument Columbia can muster. But who cares? They're so clearly among the best schools in the world. Who's comparing?",

      "text": "This is humorous.  Other than Harvard and maybe MIT the difference between these schools in terms of prestige is epsilon.  But I'll touch on some of the points you raise:\n\n>It is not T5 in USNEWS\n\nWorth noting that Stanford's US News rankings (mean and median) over the past 10 years are roughly on par with MIT.  Those two are the lowest among HYPMS+C with a median rank of 5.5 over the past ten years.  Does MIT deserve to get booted from the conversation based on that stat?  Also, US News is not the only arbitrary college ranking around!\n\nIn the WSJ/THE 2022 list they appear as follows (among U.S. universities):\n\n* Harvard (1)\n* Stanford (2)\n* MIT (3)\n* Yale (4)\n* Princeton (8)\n* Columbia (16)\n\nIn the QS 2022 list they appear as follows (among U.S. universities):\n\n* MIT (1)\n* Stanford (2)\n* Harvard (3)\n* Yale (7)\n* Columbia (8)\n* Princeton (9)\n\n>higher acceptance rate than Columbia and Harvard\n\nI may be using acceptance rates from last year, but they're all very close.  In order of lowest to highest:\n\n* Stanford (4.34)\n* Harvard (4.64)\n* Columbia (5.45)\n* Princeton (5.78)\n* Yale (6.08)\n* MIT (6.70)\n\n>now lags harvard and mit in startups \\[...\\] per capita\n\nUsing founders data from [here](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/heres-where-funded-founders-went-to-school/) and undergraduate population data from [here](https://www.univstats.com/) I computed per capita numbers.  In order of highest to lowest (per capita):\n\n* MIT: 367 / 4530 = 0.0810\n* Stanford: 465 / 6996 = 0.0665\n* Harvard: 293 / 10063 = 0.0291\n* Princeton: 95 / 5422 = 0.0175\n* Yale: 103 / 6092 = 0.0169\n* Columbia: 115 / 8221 = 0.0140\n\nHere are some other metrics we might use:\n\nTotal number of applicants, which is a measure of interest.  Here MIT is punished for its STEM focus:\n\n* Stanford: 47498\n* Harvard: 43330\n* Columbia: 42823\n* Yale: 36844\n* Princeton: 32804\n* MIT: 21312\n\nPer capita Ph.D. production.  If you're going to look at startup production, why not academia?  Stats (rank in U.S. per capita) from [here](https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/top-feeders-phd-programs#total-phd):\n\n* MIT (#4)\n* Princeton (#15)\n* Yale (#17)\n* Stanford (#22)\n* Harvard (#31)\n* Columbia (#43)\n\nNational Merit Scholars (non-college-sponsored) per capita.  This data is for 2019 and is 4x the number of non-sponsored NMFs as a share of total undergrad population:\n\n* MIT (11.6%)\n* Yale (9.4%)\n* Princeton (8.4%)\n* Harvard (8.3%)\n* Stanford (7.0%)\n* Columbia (3.3%)\n\nNumber of National Academy of Science members on faculty.  Wwe might want to look at this on a per capita basis, but I don't have faculty data so these are absolute numbers.  Data is for 2018 from [here](https://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2018/07/top-50-universities-by-membership-in-the-national-academy-of-sciences.html):\n\n* Harvard (183, #1)\n* Stanford (156, #2)\n* MIT (117, #4)\n* Princeton (87, #5)\n* Yale (71, #6)\n* Columbia (60, #8)",
