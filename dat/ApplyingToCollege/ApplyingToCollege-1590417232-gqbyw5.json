  "text": "\"In our house, English is not English. Not in the phonetic sense, like short\u00a0a\u00a0is for\u00a0apple, but rather in the pronunciation \u2013 in our house,\u00a0snake\u00a0is\u00a0snack. Words do not roll off our tongues correctly \u2013 yet I, who was pulled out of class to meet with language specialists, and my mother from Malaysia, who pronounces\u00a0film\u00a0as\u00a0flim, understand each other perfectly.\nIn our house, there is no difference between\u00a0cast\u00a0and\u00a0cash, which was why at a church retreat, people made fun of me for \u201ccashing\u00a0out demons.\u201d I did not realize the glaring difference between the two Englishes until my teacher corrected my pronunciations of\u00a0hammock,\u00a0ladle, and\u00a0siphon. Classmates laughed because I pronounce\u00a0accept\u00a0as\u00a0except,\u00a0success\u00a0as\u00a0sussess. I was in the Creative Writing conservatory, and yet words failed me when I needed them most.\nSuddenly, understanding\u00a0flower\u00a0is\u00a0flour\u00a0wasn\u2019t enough. I rejected the English that had never seemed broken before, a language that had raised me and taught me everything I knew. Everybody else\u2019s parents spoke with accents smarting of Ph.D.s and university teaching positions. So why couldn\u2019t mine?\nMy mother spread her sunbaked hands and said, \u201cThis is where I came from,\u201d spinning a tale with the English she had taught herself.\nWhen my mother moved from her village to a town in Malaysia, she had to learn a brand new language in middle school: English. In a time when humiliation was encouraged, my mother was defenseless against the cruel words spewing from the teacher, who criticized her paper in front of the class. When she began to cry, the class president stood up and said, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d\n\u201cBe like that class president,\u201d my mother said with tears in her eyes. The class president took her under her wing and patiently mended my mother\u2019s strands of language. \u201cShe stood up for the weak and used her words to fight back.\u201d\nWe were both crying now. My mother asked me to teach her proper English so old white ladies at Target wouldn\u2019t laugh at her pronunciation. It has not been easy. There is a measure of guilt when I sew her letters together. Long vowels, double consonants \u2014 I am still learning myself. Sometimes I let the brokenness slide to spare her pride but perhaps I have hurt her more to spare mine.\nAs my mother\u2019s vocabulary began to grow, I mended my own English. Through performing poetry in front of 3000 at my school\u2019s Season Finale event, interviewing people from all walks of life, and writing stories for the stage, I stand against ignorance and become a voice for the homeless, the refugees, the ignored. With my words I fight against jeers pelted at an old Asian street performer on a New York subway. My mother\u2019s eyes are reflected in underprivileged ESL children who have so many stories to tell but do not know how. I fill them with words as they take needle and thread to make a tapestry.\n\nIn our house, there is beauty in the way we speak to each other. In our house, language is not broken but rather bursting with emotion. We have built a house out of words. There are friendly snakes in the cupboard and snacks in the tank. It is a crooked house. It is a little messy. But this is where we have made our home.\"\n\nhttps://thetab.com/us/2017/03/31/got-into-all-ivies-64085\n\nAuthor is Cassandra\u00a0Hsiao\n\nWhat do you guys think of this essay?",

Once you open the coconut,inside it can be made soft or hard ,it can even be grated.

There are sooo many novels, articles, etc. that play on the \"passionate immigrant child uses writing as her only defense against racist white people\" cliche. There have got to be thousands of kids to whom this applies.. This doesn't strike me as original, brave, or interesting... I mean, it could be, but there's no way of knowing for sure just based on her essay or some limited background info.. Amazing that something like this is basically worth potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars..",

It feels like a narrative and a short story rather than an essay and that\u2019s the most compelling aspect about it for me. \n\nbut also, this girl had seriously STELLAR ECs. she was student body president, got some prestigious thing (not sure what it is) from the New York Times, won national playwriting competitions (and some several years in a row), and interviewed famous celebrities like Chris Evans. for someone majoring in creative we toting/theatre, she really pushed the boundaries with what her could do with ECs. it\u2019s very impressive and she\u2019s also a super genuine girl, so she really deserves it all :)",

In fact, most of the prompts seem to specifically encourage this type of essay.\n\nHowever, I have no idea how college admissions officers don't get tired of this shit. The amount of \"I tore my ACL and lost my season \ud83d\udc94\" and \"my parents' immigration held me back, but I overcame and embraced my culture \u270a\" would make me go nuts (both are obviously momentous events to these individuals, but they are extremely common in apps and therefore cringe\u2122). At a certain point, I would simply ask: why should you attend my University? And however they choose to address it should show more than anything sob stories could.",

Her story had a unique element to it that was especially noticable because of her diction when contrasting her experience with language and overall flow of the passage.\n\nHer story wasn't particularly unique, but the way that she communicated it shows an incredible grasp of written communication further emphasized by her central struggle/subject matter, exemplifying her ability to grow from her beginnings with every word she writes. I'm not sure if that was an intentional effect, but seeing how well she writes is really a testament to how she overcame her adversity.\n\nAs for the prompts, you definitely make a good point!  The prompts are written by the colleges themselves, and intentionally invite these types of responses. I never thought any different, as putting my opinion out on what essay types really demonstrate student potential doesn't make a bit of difference to the college system. I'm sure there are some benefits to emotional prompts that I'm missing \u2014 maybe they're easier to write/find inspiration for than a practical version?",

Show them what they will never comprehend, and revel in your conquest.  They think they know all about us\u2014all about what makes us try, succeed, and laugh.  But they don\u2019t.  They have no clue about ostriches.  You have knowledge that they don\u2019t, and therefore you have power.  They are completely powerless on your turf.  Go write yourself an ostrich essay to thrust in front of the world, and let the world be its jury.  Don\u2019t ever let anyone tell you your ostrich essay isn\u2019t serious enough\u2014an admissions officer who doesn\u2019t see what you see in ostriches is like a wing that can\u2019t help you fly.",

No wonder we have to turn to Europe and Asia to recruit properly educated STEM graduate students and workers.\n\nI am actually a little shocked by the farcical levels reached.",

You\u2019re overreacting, and maybe people just want to share a successful essay on a sub that\u2019s literally all about applying to college, and they\u2019re not trying to convince you of anything.  No shit the essay\u2019s trying to get your sympathy; that\u2019s what essays are for.  You\u2019re the one trying to project an agenda onto it, and your reasoning does, in fact, reek of the idea that immigrants shouldn\u2019t be able to succeed if you can\u2019t.",
