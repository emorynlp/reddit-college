  "title:": "Vanderbilt Chancellor's Merit Scholarship Recommendation?????",
  "text": "I was interested in applying to the Chancellor's Merit Scholarship Program at Vanderbilt, and I couldn't find it on the website itself, but a third-party website with advice said that we need a recommendation that can speak about our service? What if our service is in the form of a student-led organization? I don't have anyone that can speak about it? Is the recommendation still a requirement?\n\nAnother thing (rant), my CommonApp supplemental for Vanderbilt almost exactly fits the Chancellor's prompt, so now I'm going to have to write another essay, unable to reuse it (since the committee can see both essays!!!!)",
