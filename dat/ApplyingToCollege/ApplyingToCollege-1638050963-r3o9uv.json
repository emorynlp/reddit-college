  "text": "isn\u2019t it amazing that people will score higher than 99% of people who took the SAT, and their score will still be in the lower percentiles of the highest ranked schools and be considered low? i swear this whole process is designed to drive ppl aiming for T20s insane. obviously not a groundbreaking thought but talking to friends that started out in the same gifted program in middle school who now go to less competitive schools where they and everyone else scores around 1000 has made me see how drastic the high school you go to affects your goals. would you guys rather put your kids in a competitive private school or a standard public school?\n\nedit: let\u2019s imagine cost would not be a hindrance",

Private schools usually have better resources for college counseling which is why private school kids are over represented in T20 schools",

      "text": "It\u2019s kinda tough thing to decide really. \n\nEither way I would want to make sure that my kids have access to all of the APs and ECs that they want to take. \n\nFor example, my (rural public) school only has 7 APs and essentially no non-sports ECs besides NHS. As an already stressed high schooler things like self-studying and having to take ECs you aren\u2019t passionate about just for apps ends up adding unnecessary extra stress for someone aiming at t20. \n\nI wish my parents would have sent me to a \u201cfeeder\u201d school because the resources (not just limited to courses and ECs, but also counselors, application \u201cfluff\u201d opportunities and the \u201cconnections\u201d) are much better for the student who really wants to be at a top school.\n\nI think that if my kid is really expressing a serious desire to attend a very selective school (and has the commitment to do well) then I would try to help them get into a \u201cfeeder\u201d school if the financial situation allows for it. Obviously it\u2019s not that easy for a lot of people though.\n\nHowever, I think it would be very inappropriate to make my kid go to a competitive high school if they *didn\u2019t* express any desire in wanting to be surrounded by more stress for a better chance at t20.\nThere is also the social aspect of most high schoolers. They go to a high school because their friends are there. Most average 8th graders do not care about getting into an ivy or t20 and therefore do not want to be put into a top HS.",

Being a dedicated, hard-working, curious and all around good person is way more important. Competitiveness fosters growth, yes, but social growth is just as important as academic. I want my kids to have the privilege to fuck up and make mistakes and to have the opportunity to hang around dumbasses and not just be around other wealthy kids all the time. Public schools are eye-openers, and I believe that the experiences you can have at public schools all around best any private school.",

      "text": "All of those kids from the feeder schools would have gotten into IVY's anyway.  Super smart, highly motivated with parents who can afford to pay full price. . . .  \n\nThe issue isn't the kids who are in the top 5-10% at these schools.  It's the kids who are in the 50+% of those schools who probably would have been top 5% if they'd gone to another school (and with far less stress).  There are kids at competitive schools in Tx (which auto-admits based on class percentage) who are bumped out of that top percentage based on their grade in eighth grade Algebra or that they took music classes instead of weighted electives or because the school decided they weren't smart enough to take AP classes (the district I worked at in had higher rated gifted classes which you needed to qualify for with testing that decided if you were gifted in science or social studies).  Some of those kids if they'd gone to less competitive schools would have had higher comparative GPA's, better extra curricular (due to less pressure to be perfect and teachers assigning huge amounts of homework) and less people even applying to those schools for you to compete directly against.  \n\nI've worked at schools in different economic areas.  You need a school that gives you the ability to take (and teachers who can get you to pass the tests) a variety of advanced and AP classes and a peer group that is academic.  \n\nThose super competitive schools have the bad side effect of making above average and super bright kids think they're average (or even below average).  So the kid who would be applying to T20's if they attended generic suburban school end up at big out of state flagships and other less competitive schools.",

At my school, only a small group takes APs, so we're all friends with each other, share notes, have study groups, etc. We all learn because we like to learn, not because we're in some academic Hunger Games.  \n2. Better for the community. Only the white kids could afford to go to my siblings' private school, and it created serious segregation in the community. The rich white kids got well funded classes and academic clubs and sports, and the poor kids in Black neighborhoods got worse educations at a crappy school. The privileged parents in the community wouldn't put any time or money or bargaining power into improving the public schools, since they all went private, so the public schools stayed bad. At my public school, everyone goes to the same place, and as a result, everyone in the community is invested in improving the schools.  \n3. More diversity. Builds on previous point, but I don't want my child to only befriend and speak to and empathize with other white privileged people. That seems like a recipe for nurturing internalized racism and elitism.  \n4. Ivy Leagues aren't the end goal anyway. My siblings got into Ivies, probably in no small part because they went to that school. I probably won't get into Ivies, and that kinda sucks, but I also had a much happier and healthier high school experience than any of my siblings and I've still got great scholarship opportunities. I think they got the short end of the stick, to be honest.",

This subreddit as an example shows that, but if I had gone to an elite private school like you\u2019re saying then I\u2019d be at a much better of spot than I am now, with way better counselors who know how to game the admissions system, classes specifically for things like SAT and ACT prep built in, and a multitude of other opportunities like mission trips and elite extracurriculars. Many of my teachers had no clue how to write rec letters, some of them expressing that to me directly. At a place like Phillips Exeter, that would not be the case.\n\nAs for that self selection, how do you think these kids got in there in the first place. They weren\u2019t starting clubs or acing the 8th grade PSAT on their own, they were very likely aided in a major way by their current resources. With over 50% of Phillips Exeter students being able to pay the entire tuition which costs more than the median families income in America, (57,000$) there\u2019s more than just intelligence going into the selection process. \n\nHow can a school taking in 13 year olds possibly judge the \u201cintelligence\u201d of students appropriately, they can\u2019t. Kids are malleable, and attending an elite institution like Phillips absolutely makes you a better candidate for colleges I won\u2019t deny that, with great education (and cost) comes great students. It\u2019s the entire reason most kids want to attend elite colleges as well. If the private school doesn\u2019t help these kids get into Harvard, parents wouldn\u2019t be paying. Please think about this before you respond. \nIf you happened to go to Phillips Exter, don\u2019t think that what I\u2019m saying negates your accomplishments getting into college. I am not saying these kids aren\u2019t motivated or smart, but they have been given a massive advantage and you\u2019d be crazy to deny that.",

                      "text": "You're completely wrong about \"gaming the system\" and the SAT prep. I don't go to Exeter, but I attended an \"elite\" private school up until sophomore year when I chose to switch to my public high school. \n\nThere's not a distinct advantage imo. My counsellors are just as shit now as they were in private school, and I think you're missing the point that the staff does not have all this omnipotent power over your application. Your rec letters are wholly dependent on the relationship you foster with your teacher. I find it hard to believe that an American teacher would have trouble writing a letter of rec. Yes, there may be teachers with years of experience who could cultivate a better letter, but you'll find inexperienced or new teachers in private schools as well. You get to pick who your recs are and it's up to you to take such factors into consideration. Ultimately, the rec is supposed to convey your narrative from another point of view - smt that doesn't require rich eloquent teachers to do. \n\nI don't know how your counsellor could \"game the system.\" My private school counsellor was a harvard grad and obv that comes along with connections to the admissions department. But it's not like he could get anyone in. He would only contact them if we had a specific question (ex. how do I portray XXXX on my application) - you could do the same by googling the admission office's phone number.\n\nI realize a bunch of private schools do offer SAT prep. If you're applying to T20s, I'm assuming you'd have enough initiative to study for this yourself thru Khan academy, SAT prep books etc. The SAT is really just high school math and it's testing how well you learned basic algebra. \n\nI agree with the self-selection bit tho. The majority of students at these schools had resources with PSAT prep etc that would've helped in their application. But again, these are minute disparities. The only major advantage I'd point out is that some of these kids have gone to private middle/elementary schools that made them more academically capable by the time they apply to exeter. \n\nUltimately, I still think the application is dependent on you. There's no use whining about such disparities because 1. They don't have large bearing if you're driven and smart 2. There's nothing you can do about them. Teachers at my public school are trash, and that means that I have to do a lot of self-study off of khan, textbooks etc to make sure I learn the material. I've been doing this since COVID, but I recognize that NOT everyone learns like this and some people require teacher support. But, and I say this in the least conceited way possible, if you intend to apply to the ivies, don't you think you should be capable of self-study? I'd bet the majority of harvard students could pass their courses by self-studying them. \n\nAt harvard, the most popular major is econ and the majority of econ grads go onto wall st and high finance. Now econ at harvard is not meant to be a direct gateway to finance in the way Wharton is. Econ at harvard is really a social science intended to prepare you for graduate research. Wharton on the other hand is business tailored. Those harvard econ grads won't have learned any of the finance/business skills taught at Wharton, but they still end up at wall st and other top finance firms. It's cuz if you go to Harvard, you're capable of self-learning finance and usually any other skill set (especially with the online resources we have today).\n\nTop private schools have become a lot more accessible over the years with financial aid and recruiting initiatives. But they still need rich families to pay tuition to fund the amount of aid they can provide. Be completely honest with yourself, you'd probably end up in the same school you will now as you would've in private school. In some cases, you'd prob do better. In public school, I have a higher GPA, more time for ECs, top class rank etc that would've been unfathomable in a place as competitive as exeter.",

Also, by gaming the system I sort of meant just having the slightest idea of how the application process works\u2026 I\u2019m a little salty because the counselor I have is notorious for being terrible about applications and helping their students, so maybe I\u2019m a tinge biased, at a good school I just don\u2019t see something like that happening. As for rank/gpa, as far as they tell us (could be false) the colleges take into account your context like the competitiveness of the school you go to, but they don\u2019t really have time so you\u2019re probably right on that one.

      "text": "From a parent\u2019s perspective, this is an interesting question. We chose a private preschool through 6th grade for our kid, which instilled a deep love of learning and confidence. Kid then went to a magnet public school, came home one day and ranted about the 7th grader that slept through Math, and hated every minute of that experience. Kid had the choice - public, public magnet, or private high school. Kid decided on private, is a junior with three APs (one last year, two this year) and four classes at the JC done during Covid. Again, all of this was the kid\u2019s choice. The kid didn\u2019t want to waste time during lockdown, so elected to take classes at the JC, with our guidance, but not being pushed. The kid had agency in this process - and had to be an active participant in education decisions. Kid loves the teachers, the ECs, the resources.\n\nIf the kid was not in a place to push, we wouldn\u2019t. What matters most to us is a love of learning, confidence in expressing opinions, and a strong work ethic. These are what the kid will need to be successful, not test scores. \n\nI love reading your experiences, concerns, and sharing in your joys. This Internet Parent is over here sending good vibes to you all as you navigate this complex era of your life. \n\nPs - price is an object! It has been freaking expensive, snd we have given up a LOT to do this. When you think about your future kids, just know it is a commitment!",

      "text": "I mean, as someone who hopped between both several times (9 years at public, 4 at private), I think it's much more dependent on the atmospheres of individual schools than whether they're public or private. Many different competitive and less-competitive private schools had very different strengths and experiences. I'm not sure I ever attended a \"standard\" public school though (they were all pretty competitive) so it's hard for me to say what the \"average\" public school experience is like.",

The difference is just wild.\n\nIf your goal is not top schools and just general happiness, I think having experience at both is very important. Better world view and more appreciation for the struggles of others.",
