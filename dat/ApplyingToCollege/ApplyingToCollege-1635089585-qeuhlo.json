  "text": "Hi guys I am an international student and still not sure if I want to ED. What are some good Mid tier colleges that offer co-op or internships for cs/business. I am really scared.\n \nI have university of Rochester, Umiami, Skidmore in mind. But I am not sure about these. Specially UMiami as I can't find any opportunities related information for these. \n\nPlease suggest some good colleges that are also good with aid too. I have done research but it still doesn't feel enough. ED feels like a huge commitment and I can't have the most thorough information about colleges.",

      "text": "Hi! Late reply but hope you can use this for RD. \n\nFirstly, fin aid comes in two forms, need-based and merit aid. For the former, unfortunately intl students (am one myself too) get almost 0 aid unless you are an exceptional applicant accepted to a T10/T15 school. Majority of schools are need aware and unless you have an inspiring background (eg. first gen, grew up in poor rural village helping parents with work whilst independently pursuing school etc) many will flat out reject you if you need aid.\n\n\nFor merit aid, they are limited, but available. The ones that I know of are ASU, Umass and IU. Unfortunately EA deadline has passed so I'm not sure if they will give out as much. \n\n\nFor CS + Business, it depends on whether you want to work more on software dev (the CS side) or in tech consulting (the business side).\n\nIf your focus is on the CS side, skills are more important than school prestige. Umass has a T20 CS program and will get you a good job, whilst ASU is a top feeder to silicon valley if you work hard on your projects.\n\nIf your focus is on the business side, the business sch prestige (not the prestiege of the whole university) is more important. IU Kelley is the highest ranked and will get you into Chicago or New York.",
