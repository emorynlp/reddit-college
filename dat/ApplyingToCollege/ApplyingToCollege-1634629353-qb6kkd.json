  "text": "In most countries, the CIE A Level exams weren't conducted physically this year and grades were awarded using School Assessed Grades (SAGs), which obviously caused grade inflation. \n\nIn such scenario, can a good SAT score (along with good grades) somehow convince the AOs that I actually deserve the grade? How would the AOs look at great grades with average or no SAT? Do I need to worry about the inflation or will the SAT, LoRs and other components balance that?",
