              "text": "sure thing. Fee waivers basically allow you to apply for free to a particular college. You can either receive fee waivers upon request if the application fee is turning out to be a financial hardship, or you can use fee waivers that you might have received in your emails. A ton of schools email fee waivers to students that they want applying to their institution (manhattan college, drake, CRWU)- these can be good options for safeties if none of them happen to be on your list",

For example, each year, far more applicants have perfect SAT verbal scores or perfect SAT math scores than are admitted. While academic ability is important and necessary, and transcends test scores and GPAs, for applicants who are academically qualified, other factors bear significantly on admissions decisions.  \n>  \n>In a recent admissions cycle (in which fewer than 2,000 applicants out of approximately 40,000 were admitted):  \n>  \n>Over 8,000 domestic applicants had perfect GPAs  \n>  \n>Over 3,400 applicants had perfect SAT math scores  \n>  \n>Over 2,700 applicants had perfect SAT verbal scores\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cMIT is fortunate to attract applications from so many of the world's most promising students, all of whom seem destined to change the world. It is a very difficult choice to select so few of these many qualified applicants,\u201d says Matt McGann, director of admissions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm arguing that 1. US colleges often reject qualified applicants. 2. A large part of this is due to shotgunning as there are no hard limits on how many schools you can apply to (you can bypass the 20 school limit with coalition or individual school portals) and 3. UCAS doesn't have the same shotgunning problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think (and I'm sure most will too) a good admissions system is one where universities admit qualified students, and rejects unqualified students. UCAS is a system that does that better than the American system. Therefore, I prefer UCAS. It shouldn't be that hard to understand.",
