  "title:": "What do you do when a college admits you but you didn\u2019t complete/ submit your app?",
  "text": "Title says it all. In September I went to a meeting my school held with college advisors for 3 different schools. For 2/3 of the schools, I submitted the 5 minute application, however I did not complete the through application (that schools usually email you your personal link to the portal) because I wanted to wait until I had SAT scores that I was satisfied with. I am a bit bummed that I was not able to submit priority deadline (No essay, no scores, no ssar, no resum\u00e8, no FAFSA, Litteraly nothing)! However, I saw unopened mail with my name on it on my moms dresser and it was an admissions letter. \n\nWhile I am elated that I got in, I am confused because I never officially completed/ submitted my application!\nI have a few questions, such as :\n\n1.) Do I still go back and complete it?\n2.) Did this happen to anyone else / does it happen often?",

          "text": "Sorry If it\u2019s unclear, I mentioned how I did the five minute application that results in the school emailing you the in depth application, but I did not do the in depth one yet. I was waiting to get my SAT scores back. It\u2019s not a big Ivy League school lol. Just a school in Florida, it\u2019s in my home town so I most likely won\u2019t attend. It was a safety school, I just found it odd how they accepted me when I didn\u2019t officially submit any stats.",
