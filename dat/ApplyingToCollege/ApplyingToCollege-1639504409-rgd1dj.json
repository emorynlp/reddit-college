  "text": "So, today I got an acceptance letter from two schools in England. University of Brighton and University of Sussex, however going there is out of question. \n\nI wasn\u2019t considered for financial aid, which was so important for me. \nBoth of my parents are so sad and I feel like an UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT. \n\nI am not an extraordinary kid, but I gave it my all and it\u2019s not enough. I am literally the dumbest girl alive. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get accepted to anywhere in US this academic year as well and even if I do, there will always be something that\u2019ll hold me back. \n\nI can never change my circumstances, I can never accomplish my dreams. \n\nI don\u2019t even have the courage to submit my Common App applications now. \n\nThis is my punishment for dreaming beyond my worth.",

      "text": "Hey, I know how you feel and trust me, you'll get over it. In my country there's a program that gets kids into prestigious high schools abroad and I dreamed of getting in ever since I was little. Come high school and application cycle, I got accepted but without a scholarship (even though I specifically said my parents could not afford that, as seen on the fin aid papers). Personally, I felt the same as you do now, knowing I was good enough for them to accept me but not good enough for them to give me money. At first I thought I was a failure, but as the time passed I realised there is whole life in front of me and that I'll have many opportunities to work and study abroad. There are thousands of masters, phd and exchange programs waiting for you out there but you must not lose hope. You are worthy of everything you wish and you should never hate yourself for striving for better. So take your time, cry it out if you need, raise your head and press that apply button. And I'll have my fingers crossed for you.",
