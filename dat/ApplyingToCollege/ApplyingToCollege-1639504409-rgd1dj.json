  "text": "So, today I got an acceptance letter from two schools in England. University of Brighton and University of Sussex, however going there is out of question. \n\nI wasn\u2019t considered for financial aid, which was so important for me. \nBoth of my parents are so sad and I feel like an UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT. \n\nI am not an extraordinary kid, but I gave it my all and it\u2019s not enough. I am literally the dumbest girl alive. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get accepted to anywhere in US this academic year as well and even if I do, there will always be something that\u2019ll hold me back. \n\nI can never change my circumstances, I can never accomplish my dreams. \n\nI don\u2019t even have the courage to submit my Common App applications now. \n\nThis is my punishment for dreaming beyond my worth.",

      "text": "Hey, I know how you feel and trust me, you'll get over it. In my country there's a program that gets kids into prestigious high schools abroad and I dreamed of getting in ever since I was little. Come high school and application cycle, I got accepted but without a scholarship (even though I specifically said my parents could not afford that, as seen on the fin aid papers). Personally, I felt the same as you do now, knowing I was good enough for them to accept me but not good enough for them to give me money. At first I thought I was a failure, but as the time passed I realised there is whole life in front of me and that I'll have many opportunities to work and study abroad. There are thousands of masters, phd and exchange programs waiting for you out there but you must not lose hope. You are worthy of everything you wish and you should never hate yourself for striving for better. So take your time, cry it out if you need, raise your head and press that apply button. And I'll have my fingers crossed for you.",

There is no way to tell what will happen with US colleges until you actually apply to and hear from them. This is a temporary setback. \u201cIt\u2019s a bend in the road, not the end\u201d as Anne Shirley would say. You don\u2019t know what opportunities are waiting for you around the corner, things you never even imagined you could dream of.\n\nAlso, your worth as a human being is not in what colleges you are accepted to. It\u2019s amazing to be alive, to be sentient, to speak languages and understand other people, to care about people and laugh with them.",

      "text": "Why would you be considered for financial aid? Education is a big contributor to the UK and US economies. Give me one good reason why any university would go out of their way to give you financial aid when they could accept another international student who's willing to contribute to their economy by paying full tuition. Sorry, I know this hurts and you've tied this to your self-worth. I was in the same position 3 years ago. I had a great cv, and most of my American/rich international friends ended up getting into MIT, CalTEch, Harvard, you name it.  I had applied to many US universities but every single university rejected my application because I had asked for financial aid. But I had been admitted into the physics bachelor's program at Oxford as an international student. I know how outrageous the cost of studying in the US and the UK is. I had dropped out of Oxford after a semester and started studying on a full scholarship at KAIST. There are many problems international students face here, but breaking their parents' banks is not one of them. If you're willing to apply to KAIST, hmu. I'll be happy to help in any way possible.",
