  "text": "So, today I got an acceptance letter from two schools in England. University of Brighton and University of Sussex, however going there is out of question. \n\nI wasn\u2019t considered for financial aid, which was so important for me. \nBoth of my parents are so sad and I feel like an UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT. \n\nI am not an extraordinary kid, but I gave it my all and it\u2019s not enough. I am literally the dumbest girl alive. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get accepted to anywhere in US this academic year as well and even if I do, there will always be something that\u2019ll hold me back. \n\nI can never change my circumstances, I can never accomplish my dreams. \n\nI don\u2019t even have the courage to submit my Common App applications now. \n\nThis is my punishment for dreaming beyond my worth.",
