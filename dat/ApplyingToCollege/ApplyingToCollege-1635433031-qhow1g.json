  "text": "ok i need to go tf off about collegeboard and my counselor. so i applied ED to my top school last night (\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udd73) but my concerns are far from over!! my counselor has not only failed to sign my ED agreement, but she also hasn't sent the counselor recommendation yet even though she has sent it to other schools?? also! i paid to have my scores sent officially by collegeboard and, even after i checked the box stating i only wanted my most recent SAT sent, they sent that along with my first attempt and my abysmal SAT subject test score, neither of which i wanted to see the light of day again. and one of my grades is incorrectly marked and my teacher has yet to change it, so i can't request first-quarter grades yet!!!! those red X's in my portal reminding me of all the things i haven't done are mad stressing me out, and that shit isn't even my fault. anyway i just needed to put that into the universe.",
