  "title:": "Will i still get financial aid at Cornell Human Ecology if Im not an NY resident",
  "text": "Hi guys. I know that Cornell HumEc is part of Cornell's public school system. The thing is, most public schools tend to not give much aid to out of state residents, but I was wondering if this also applied to HumEc since Cornell is still mostly private. Does it work differently with Cornell, or will i not get any aid if I apply for HumEc as an NJ resident? Sorry, I'm just a little confused",

      "text": "Did you run the NPC for Cornell?\n\nAs I understand it, NY residents do qualify for different tuition cost than OOS students for certain Cornell Colleges, but that has no impact on OOS aid.  It\u2019s just different.\n\nTechnically, no college at Cornell is \u201cpublic\u201d but several are run under contract with the state of NY.",
