  "text": "Hey fellow A2Cers, I didn\u2019t know there was an optional Chicago video until only a couple days ago and didn\u2019t have time to make it until today.  \n\nEA decisions are supposed to come in around 10 days around the 20th and I\u2019m wondering if AO\u2019s would even still be looking at them at this point.\n\nAnd will it be the factor in me not getting in over some others at my school who did submit the video?  I\u2019m very worried :(",

      "text": "It\u2019s probably too late for EA but it can\u2019t hurt to submit it, especially since they allegedly defer a lot of their EA pool. It is optional but I imagine a good video can help and a bad video can hurt an application.\n\nThe other reality is that we have no idea what the process is. Like your application might be the one up for discussion on Monday, in which case the video might come in handy if there is some big debate on your application. Who knows\u2026\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m applying RD and made a video. But everyone on here assures me that the RD acceptance rate is 0, which is unfortunate since I like UChicago :/",
