      "text": "My MIT interview was very chill; I was asked why MIT and about my interests, and my responses guided the conversation from there onwards. It didn't seem like the interviewer was super well aware of what I had done, and in general it doesn't seem very high stakes - it's more of a casual conversation about your goals and interests. Your mileage may vary, but my interviewer pretty much told me that he didn't have much bearing on my app unless there were major red flags.",
