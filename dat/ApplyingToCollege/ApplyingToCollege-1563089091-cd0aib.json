  "title:": "I'm in shock. I just got drafted by the Korean military. I'm a recent admit to Brown. What do I do?",
  "text": "**EDIT: I want to say I'm mentally stable for now. Thank you so much for your help everyone, and I'm sorry I couldn't respond to everyone. I'd like to cherish the time I have time left before losing my phone. Also, I disagree with the moderator's decision to disable comments in the other thread about conscription. Firstly, there is important advice and information other redditors can contribute. Secondly, I feel that we need a discussion bringing awareness to the topic. I know this is A2C, but I don't see how enabling the comments for some discussion can hurt. It's important to people like me, and young people concerned about social justice.**\n\nI'm a male dual citizen and apparently they have guidelines not well known to the public that if you don't follow, you will be conscripted for two years even if you're not from Korea. I don't even speak Korean.\n\nWhat do I even tell Brown? Do I need to apply again in two years with new essays and everything? Will my high school SAT scores and GPA still be valid??\n\nThey caught me at the airport and I had to get escorted. I'm so scared. I cried too much today and the staff here don't seem to care; no one asked if I was alright and just walked by me as if they were used to this scene. I had no idea this could happen to me; I was only on vacation. All of a sudden I'm going to be isolated from society in some military camp just because I'm a dual-citizen male who didn't renounce his Korean citizenship before March of the year I turned 18. I already looked my situation up, and apparently this happens very regularly to unknowing Korean-Americans like me, and the US doesn't do anything about it. It's a trap designed to get more conscripts, and I'm a victim. There's no escape.\n\nI'm sorry that I'm going into venting mode right now, but it feels like I'm fighting a battle alone with no one besides me. No social movement even talks about conscription even though it's a blatant violation of gender rights and human rights. I literally feel so alone and it's painful.\n\nI also feel stupid and embarrassed. I'll have to explain to my friends about how I was stupid enough to not know to renounce my citizenship. It's embarrassing. Also, in Korean culture apparently, if you complain about military service, you're not a \"man\" so you have to stay silent about it. This means I can't talk to anyone I potentially befriend in Korea.\n\nI have to explain to my roommates why I can't attend. I even made tons of close friends from the Facebook page. I was so happy about going. My life was set. Now I'm in a situation that I STILL feel like has to be a nightmare.\n\nI'm so glad I wrote this post and getting my emotions out, but at the same time, I feel like I wasted the little time I have left before I get transported and my phone taken away. I honestly think I'll try to kill myself. I've heard horror stories of hazing, abusive/violent superiors, intense training starting 6 AM, and how the two years go by extremely slowly. My uncle told me stories about how he was punished by being locked inside a gas room where it disabled his eyes and made him cough. And how he was outcasted (he's autistic) and beat by his soldiers at times. And how he slept the latest and woke up the earliest because soldiers said they'd kill him in his sleep, and he believed it. He said it psychologically changed him and he's the main reason why I'm so scared of the military. You also get paid $110 a month so it's not like the US military\n\nLooks like my question post turned into a rant post. I'd be thankful for any help you can give me, and PLEASE some words of encouragement and emotional support. I also stopped crying writing this post. I should also say thank you since I'll be offline for two years; you helped me a lot through admissions and I'm so grateful you guys exist. I'm so scared and wish I could just die right now. Every person I see walking by makes me hyperventilate because I'm so scared they'll drag me away right now. Please help mr",

To be taken without warning from the airport while on vacation -- that is honestly one of the most terrifying things that could happen to anyone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLuckily, Brown does have a policy in place that will allow you to defer your admission. ([https://www.brown.edu/admission/undergraduate/ask/deferring-enrollment](https://www.brown.edu/admission/undergraduate/ask/deferring-enrollment))\n\n>Brown will allow students fulfilling mandatory military service in their home country to defer enrollment once we have granted admission. \u00a0Students must make this request in writing, as with any request for deferred admission.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease contact Brown as soon as possible. I believe they will want an email with your information but try and call anyone at Brown because your time is limited. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish you the best of luck. Here's hoping the two years will go as fast as possible.",

      "text": "Hey, I\u2019m a Korean male who has to serve, also currently attending an Ivy. There are so many comments here already, but I just wanted to help you out a bit. I know it sucks to suddenly get this news.\n\n1. You most definitely will not need to re-apply. I have friends at Brown, and based on experiences with my own school, they are generally very supportive of taking two gap years for military service. They already know that when they admit Korean citizens, they will have to take two gap years\u2014so they won\u2019t rescind your acceptance or anything. \n\n2. Korean military is really not that bad, especially if you are smart. There are pretty \u2018easy\u2019 positions you could do with the American military, and translator positions are available as well. If you do a little research, I\u2019m sure you could find some easy positions.\n\n3. It\u2019s probably illegal for them to force you to go NOW, unless you are already over the age of 25 (which I assume you are not). What they WILL probably make you do, though, is take the physical examination (which you must take, legally, within the year you become eligible for the draft). This just takes a couple of hours.\n\nThat means you can take the time to attend Brown for a year or two to get mentally prepared, then apply or something. This is the most common option chosen among Korean males.\n\n*Or I really do think, you should just go back to Brown and never return to Korea until the age of 35 (which is when \u201cconscription period\u201d ends). For kids like me, who have family in Korea, this is not a viable option, but for you, this is definitely not that unrealistic of an option. I\u2019m serious. It sounds illegal, but it\u2019s only illegal in Korea, and my cousin who graduated from Columbia did this and is now 30, and is living a fine life.\n\nConscription sucks, and I\u2019m sorry to hear this. But hope this helps you clear things out a bit.",

Thanks for the clarification.\n\nI am not exactly sure on the legal technicalities of the issue, but at least based on my personal experience, I do know that if you come to Korea after the age of 25 (or somewhat around that), you are, at least by default, forbidden from traveling outside of Korea because they think you are at high risk of evading the draft. The first page of my passport explicitly says this. I don't know about other consequences though.\n\nFor OP, I forgot to say, but PM me if you need any personal help with the situation. I will try my best to tell you what I know, as I am also in the process of researching things for my military service.",

IMO it\u2019s really not an issue that we can tackle until the SK-NK relations are settled somewhat. But plenty of people find it contentious, and I\u2019d actually argue that it\u2019s more acceptable to voice your concerns these days. Take it from somebody who\u2019s lived in Seoul for nine years straight now. \n\nI hate to be the person saying this, but even if you end up serving immediately, take solace in the fact that conditions in the military have improved. \ud734\uac00 opportunities have increased and you\u2019ll also be able to use your smartphone during free time. You might even find yourself making a lot of friends\u2014I know a dude who went to the army and became friends with several of his peers. They can be your support group and your connections to Korea in the future.\n\nYou can do this. I believe in you.",

The difference here is that I know I HAVE to go, unless I get a citizenship change.  \n\n  \nI am sorry this happened to you, but I don't think this is as bad of a situation you think it is. In my attempt to help you with your panic, let's say that somehow you DO HAVE TO GO:  \nFirst, I feel like you are terrified of what can happen. While I may be speaking from ignorance, based on what I see from the post, your cultural background and perspective are far from Korean. Many things you have been told about the military is not true anymore. The system is far better now. The bullying, psychological damage, abusive superiors are something that can be reported as you can demand proper self-protection. The time in the military has been cut down shorter, and the 'strictness' has been reduced, apparently. I heard stories that you can even order food (idk). But this is the 'normal' military experience most Korean men go through, which is most likely not going to be your case. Because you are a dual citizen that can't even speak Korean, I doubt that they would take you through the \"normal\" process to enter you in the military. There are many areas of the military program that would suit you best. One of the most well known is the assisting US military that is in Korea. You could serve there, or you could serve in communication, etc.   \nSecond, most of the time, you don't have to go right away as you are drafted. You can choose when to go, either it is after graduating from undergrad or finishing grad school.  You can go to your university on schedule. That gives you a few years for you to do something about this situation. \n\n  \nCongratulations on getting accepted to Brown University, that is amazing, a dream of many. That said, don't panic and try acting on it too quick, as sometimes your actions can backfire to you in the future. Again, stay CALM. You have time.",

Being in a part of that division means you can get treated much better than if you were in the Korean Army, but it might impact how long you stay. \n\nYou have options. It may be a very terrifying situation for now, but you need to get over this hump to demand and explore your options. \n\nDo keep in mind they may be unsympathetic to you if you cannot speak Korean well.

Because you were accepted to Brown, I know you are smart, resourceful and hard-working enough to get through this. \n\nI work with Korean students in North America who have this difficult situation. Some of them give up citizenship knowing it will affect how they will be seen by their family in Korea, some defer serving, and some get it over with before college. The ones who have been happiest with the decision are those who do their military service and then attend university. First, they don't spend years dreading military service feeling like their lives will be delayed. Second, they appreciate university so much more and work so much harder because they have been out of the grind of school. Third, they actually make amazing friends and form bonds through the difficult experience. All of my former students say that it wasn't as bad as the stories their Grandfathers, Uncles, and Dads told them. \n\nRight now, you are in shock and panicked. Do what you can to calm down. Try to contact your family to make sure they know what is happening and can help you. \n\nYou are not alone. This happens to many young men and they get through it. You will too.",

      "text": "Ouch. This kind of stuff happens much more than it should. As far as I know, there are ways to postpone your conscription as a dual citizen if you fall under certain categories (eg, if you have been living overseas for more than 10 years, you will be able to postpone your conscription up to age 37). However, the Military Manpower Administration (\ubcd1\ubb34\uccad) is one shitty organization and they may exploit your unknowingness of the local law to conscript you immediately.  As such, I strongly recommend that you get in touch with a local lawyer for legal advice.\n\nMeanwhile, there are some resources that you can read up on even if you don't speak Korean.\n\nhttps://elaw.klri.re.kr/kor_service/lawView.do?hseq=42707&lang=ENG\n\nhttps://elaw.klri.re.kr/kor_service/lawView.do?hseq=45610&lang=ENG\n\nThese are the official English translation of the Military Service Act which covers stuff on the fore mentioned 'categories'.\n\nhttp://www.mma.go.kr/contents.do?mc=usr0000193\n\nThis is the MMA page regarding citizens with more than one citizenship. However, they are in Korean so you'll need a translator for these. It's considerably terser than the above websites so they might be missing out on some details.\n\nIf finding an appropriate legal counsel is a hassle, you might want to contact the guys at the Center for Military Human Rights(\uad70\uc778\uad8c\uc13c\ud130), an NGO whose primary aim is to alleviate the harsh conditions servicemen have to suffer. Although their area of expertise is a little tangent to the situation you're experiencing, I'm pretty sure they'll be able to provide some help.\n\nAnd also, if you're having trouble looking for a Korean speaker who can help you out in finding legal counsel/seeking help from the aforementioned NGO, I'll be glad to help you out in doing so (although my English isn't quite the best).",

By fleeing, he would essentially be going AWOL.  The second he told someone at the U.S. embassy about his status, they would not hesitate for a second to return him to the Korean authorities because they would otherwise be aiding and abetting someone in Korea who is AWOL from the Korean military.  This is not some far flung, strange case - Korean-Americans get conscripted into the Korean military all the time.  The fact that he can't speak Korean or that he's never lived in Korea means nothing because he is a Korean citizen.\n\n\\>  Regardless, he has every right to speak to embassy officials even if that goes against whatever cultural standard you may have.\n\nI'm an American; my cultural standards have absolutely nothing to do with this.  And yes - he has every right to speak with a counselor officer at the U.S. Embassy.  However, after confirming that he is a duel citizen - the counselor officer will tell him there's nothing the U.S. Embassy can do to help him get out of serving his conscription.\n\nI've spent most of the last 40 years in Korea.  I've seen this exact scenario play out many times over the years.",

      "text": " As a Korean born and raised in Korea who will be conscripted in the future, I do feel your frustration and hopelessness. Although you are in a very confusing and stressful situation, I would strongly advise you to calm down. Panicking will only make things worse and you wouldn't be able to make the right decisions. You can definitely postpone conscription for study if you apply for postponement 5 days before your conscription date. Since you cannot speak Korean, I would definitely suggest you consult someone who can speak Korean and aid you (perhaps your parents?). [This is the english version website for military manpower administration (this is responsible for drafting etc.)](https://www.mma.go.kr/eng/index.do) Although they are less helpful than the Korean version (another reason why you need someone proficient in Korean), it will still give you some help in figuring out your situation and making the right decisions. Check out their FAQ section. If you have any questions, please tell me and I'll do my best to  help you.",

How did you not know about this? \n\nYou\u2019ll definitely be able to defer your admission like others have said so don\u2019t worry about that. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you and that you can\u2019t reach out to anyone, but it\u2019s not anywhere near as bad as you think.

The internet is filled with Korean-American men asking questions about it, so it seems suspicious that somebody would grow up in a Korean household without knowing the first thing about it. \n\nOn the flip side, it is unfortunate that this targets men, and that it is men who will bear the burden of serving in the military while Korean-American women do not.  Our discussions of gender roles have not yet grown to include men's issues, unfortunately.  However, perhaps the OP can take some comfort in knowing it's a bonding experience, and something that will connect him to the roots he claims with his citizenship.",

Thank you for being a voice of reason and empathy in this thread. \n\nAnd to any help it might be to OP: I found this paragraph on the Wikipedia page for conscription in South Korea: \n\n\u201dIn general, the South Korean public tends to be intolerant towards men who attempt to evade mandatory military service or receive special treatment, especially if they are exploiting family wealth or political connections. Draft evasion is a punishable crime, but many entertainers, athletes, politicians and their children are known to have fabricated medical or other reasons to seek exemption from military service. According to a 2017 report by the Military Manpower Administration, the most common evasion tactic was extreme weight loss or gain (37%), followed by fabrication of mental illness (23.7%), and deliberate full-body tattoos (20.3%). Studying abroad or migrating overseas to obtain foreign citizenship are considered the preferred option for sons in wealthy families, while nearly a hundred high-ranking politicians including sitting members of the National Assembly have managed to arrange unexplained exemptions for their sons. These cases of draft evasion are to be distinguished from conscientious objection on political or religious grounds.\u201d\n\nThe thought of something like this happening to me terrifies me to no end.",

      "text": "**I'm making an edit and striking through some parts of this message because I had a r/selfawarewolves moment. Some of this was misdirected anger and not entirely helpful to OP or others in the same situation.**\n\nAlright dude I'm gonna tell you exactly what you need to hear, but you're not going to like it. \n\nFirst off, you need to grow up and accept the reality of your situation. \"No social justice movements to support me\" \"I'm so glad someone out there is defending me\" Seriously? What the fuck. ~~OP, this entire situation was caused by negligence on you and your family's part. There is no way that no one in your circle didn't know about this. My parents are Korean, and like you, I consider myself an American and not Korean, but that's not an excuse for not knowing incredibly common laws. (Despite what you claim). Be honest OP, were the laws really \"unclear\", or did you just go in and think, \"welp, there's no way this could happen to me\"?~~\n\nReddit, and especially a2c, is filled with young people with no real life experience. Don't listen to the advice saying things like, \"Just go to the US Embassy rofl\" or \"ask r/LegalAdvice\" . There's nothing they can do to help you. This is (as I and many others have said in this thread) an incredibly common situation that thousands of Korean-Americans face every year. It is United States policy to let people serve out there mandatory conscription for dual citizens. (KATUSA is also another crapshoot suggestion that you're not eligible for because you don't speak Korean.) \n\nLook I know my words are harsh, but it's better than being coddled by other teenagers who have no idea what they're talking about. You don't need internet strangers to \"defend\" you. What good is affirmation from people who know as little as you do that ~~you've done no wrong and~~ things will magically be fixed?\n\nThis does suck, I understand. To be pulled out of your life abruptly and put into an unexpected situation. A language you don't even speak, your friends doing things without you. It's awful. But again, I want you to look at this realistically. You say you've made \"close friends\" already on the admitted students page already. Really? Do you actually believe that people you've known for maybe 6 months max and sent memes to each other are your \"close friends\"? You're going to be in for a rude awakening if that's the case. \n\nI know your world is spinning right now and it's hard to think straight. But you need to calm down, face reality, and look at what your real options are. \n\nFirst off I would talk to your parents, and try to get a translator. (I want to warn you that the RoK army has no patience for people like you and me, and they may seem harsh.) You can try to postpone your service for either 2 years or until you're done with school. ( I don't remember which. Again, double check everything, even what your parents say, with official sources.) Your options are limited because you've stepped foot on Korean soil, best of luck. (I've also anecdotally heard of people deferring and then just never coming back. I don't personally know anyone who's done this, and in theory you're liable to be deported but I'm not sure how likely that actually is. Best case scenario with this particular method is that you're blacklisted from Korea. Please do more research if this is the path you choose.)\n\nIt is looking highly likely that you will have to serve at this point so I'll say a few more things. Your uncle's experience in the military seems standard for his generation, and it was even worse the generation before. However, it is no longer like that anymore (as another comment mentioned). You'll come out of this alright.~~But you have to get rid of this self pitying, victim mentality. No more of this, \"blatant violation of gender and human rights\" talk.~~",

Your account is new and your most recent comment says \"Of course the children of A2C are downvoting this\".\n\nPeople, he's a troll. He's feeding off the pleasure of toying with someone in great distress.\n\nDespite this, you're being upvoted so let me address some of the points you brought up, whether or not you were being serious about this.\n\n1. OP was not negligent. He is an AMERICAN who was simply going to another country on vacation. It's not like he decided to live there. Also, these changes in Korean law were relatively recent, and most parents probably assumed the laws stayed the same (that dual citizens will not be drafted).\n\nYou know how there are efforts to educate undocumented immigrants about how to deal with ICE? Telling them about the right to remain silent, right to deny entry to home without a warrant, etc. to protect them from the laws they're unfamiliar with. These undocumented immigrants are not negligent. They simply were never informed or educated. Same with OP and his family\n\n2. The victim mentality is natural and completely understandable. How else is he supposed to feel? Emotional support and consoling is absolutely something that helps people in distress. Let's be very clear here. Conscription is sexist. And in my opinion, a humans rights violation as well. What OP means is that he wishes his voice was heard. Suffering is one thing, but feeling as if no one is there to support you is another. OP said people simply walked by him, and before making this post, there was no one to console him, and you can clearly tell that the support of this subreddit made OP feel a lot better. OF COURSE he will feel victimized and afraid.\n\nI cried reading OP's post and comments, and I can't comprehend how you have the audacity to say things like that, even for a troll.",

It's not like I just made this to dump on OP and \"troll\" him like you assume. \n\nI am *absolutely not* \"feeding off the pleasure of toying with someone in great distress\". His parents, (and himself to a degree), failed him spectularly. How could they just stroll in to the country when they knew this was a chance, and never tell him about any of this? That pisses me off to no end. This really fucks with his plans. Just because I didn't tell him that everything was going to be sunshine and rainbows or suggest brain dead ideas like, \"Cross the border\" or \"go to the US embassy\", doesn't mean I have bad intentions. \n\nHe and his parents *were* being negligent. The changes you were talking about were almost a decade ago. And the change was simply allowing dual citizenships. Nothing to do with them serving or not. I don't know if you're korean or not, but to korean americans, this is an incredibly common situation. I am in awe that he had no idea at all. Every Korean American male has heard of, or knows someone who was stopped at the airport. Every single one who goes to Korea double and triple checks things a year in advance. Not doing that *is* negligence. \n\nAnd yes, of course he will feel victimized and afraid, and he should be supported. But how long is he going to wallow like this? Forever, if this sub keeps filling him with grand ideas about how he'll get out of this without a hitch. How will he feel when that inevitably doesn't pan out? \n\nTo be 100% clear, I'm not trying to spin this as something that is a \"positive experience\" for OP. Nor am I trying to justify the existence of the draft. I'm just trying to give him a hard dose of reality, and some actual fucking advice. \n\nLiterally just read the last 3 paragraphs of my original comment and the reply. I don't know how you can read that and come away thinking, \"He's a bad internet troll!\".\n\n**I've made an edit to my original comment after re-reading the last line of this comment**",

      "text": "Wow OP, what happened to you sounds really scary! I'm also from a country that has mandatory service (for both men and women), but I was prepared for it and expecting it, and I actually lived in the country and spoke the language before... I can't even imagine having it dropped on me one day like that! \n\nListen, try to take a deep breath now. As people have said here, contact the university as soon as possible and inform them. Then, try to let that go - try to make the best out of where you are. Try to make friends with the people in your unit - in my experience, that's the thing that'll help you get through it best. \n\nAs for the bitching thing - I'm not Korean, but your description sounds rather similar to how my country is, and honestly people are people everywhere, so I'm fairly certain what I say applies here too. Here's the thing: you're expected to \"man up\" and do it, yes, but you're absolutely not expected to like it, and you'll definitely not be the only one who won't. As long as you're there and not activity attempting to run away, you'll likely be able to bitch about it to your unit-mates very freely and they're likely to do the same. You'll also be able to complain to people who've been there before, and they'll compare your stories with theirs which leads to whole new conversations and topics. The only two exceptions to this are: 1. while you're at \"boot camp\"/basic training don't bitch to, or within hearshot of, your commanding officers (absolutely do talk to them if there's a specific problem they can help you with! Just don't generally \"I don't want to be here\" bitch next to them. Honestly, even that might be acceptable in specific situations, but as a general rule of thumb it's best to avoid), and 2. when you talk specifically to *soldiers who are more senior then you* try to keep your complaints in a half-cheerful tone that's inviting agreement rather than full-on crying rant mode which might make them tell you to \"toughen up\" or something like that. \n\nNow, the first while - the basic training part - that's going to be the hardest. They'll be tough on you and a lot of things will feel unfair. This is done in order to drill discipline into you, and also in order to teach you that you can do a lot more than you think you can. Honestly speaking, it sucks. But try to remember that this part is just that, and that it ends, and that not all your time there will look like that. \n\nYes, your friends at home will move on and will have new things and people in their lives. I'd be lying if I told you nothing will be different when you come back, but they're not likely to forget about you, and you can still go back to being close friends with them! Plus, you'll have new friends from your service, and you'll also make even more new friends in university when you go. \n\nBest of luck, OP! please update us on how you're doing when you get the chance!",

Singaporeans, Koreans, Israelis, and Swiss citizens all serve in the military before, during, or after college. You're not alone in your experience and it's going to be just fine.\n\nMost schools will be accepting of the situation and I'm sure Brown will be no different, your best bet is to email their admissions office or call them to explain your situation.\n\nLastly, don't worry about your friends you'll make plenty more and it's going to be fine even if you serve your 2 years first. There will always be people that you get along with and you might find people you gel with even better.\n\nThis is a bad situation for sure, but it's going to be okay. You're not the first and you won't be the last either. For now, just take it easy and try to sort out your affairs before enlisting.",

(have your mother or whoever who speaks Korean) and tell them you want to delay for education. Get acceptance letters and proof of admission ready. You can delay for as long as you're in school. You can even come to Korea during breaks. (IT MAY have changed... I came back.. they called, I said I'm here on break... they said ok..)\n\n2. You then need to get a masters or phd. Same as above.. delay due to education. HOWEVER, this applies to STEM fields IIRC... I'm currently working as a medical researcher... but I've seen people who are of physics background.\n\n3. You can then apply to work as a government researcher/worker. This means you will have to come to Korea and work 3 years here making crap wage... but at least you are \"free\" OR do a phD in a government university such as KAIST... you get military exemption that way. You'll have a Brown degree meaning you can easily get these government research positions here in Korea.\n\nGood news is... you can avoid the military... bad news is... you're going to have to spend some time in Korea. Good luck. PM me if you need any other help... and try not to have this on your mind.. it's a pain in the ass burden",

      "text": "It's kinda unfair to you that you're called to serve, but it's unfair in the same way for all of Korea that they're in that situation.\n\nBrown should be able to defer you within reason, so just get in touch with them, it's easy.  \n\nI currently live in Korea, though I haven't served, that said, I work with a few Korean-Americans who have.  The military has changed  from how it was in the past [particularly the dictator-era past].  \n\nThis isn't a trap, per se, but it's a law for all Korean men to serve.  Many, many Korean-Americans don't interact with Korea at all, so they don't have to serve.  Actually, one of my friends, his brother didn't serve, but he did, even though both lived their whole lives in America.  He was annoyed by serving, but it isn't the end of the world.\n\nPeople complain about military service all the time.  What isn't tolerated is talking about avoiding it, or complaining about it excessively, considering that all men have to do it.\n\nNowadays, recruits are allowed to use their phone regularly after hours.\n\nI think the gas thing is a training activity that happens once.  It's pretty common across a few militaries [https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/gas-chamber-surviving-basic-training.html]\n\nThere isn't as much abuse as there used to be mostly cause Korea is a modern country with lots of prospects for personal growth, and, for the most part, people are there to get through their two years and then get started with life.  Again, strong contrast to the dictatorial past and a lack of economic opportunities.\n\nFor what it's worth, all Korean Americans who serve are low-key put on suicide watch when they go in.  However, I encourage you to see this as an opportunity.  Military service sucks, but there are a lot of aspects that people miss, namely the regularity and simplicity of it all.  There's no studying late into the night in the military or worrying about your grades or long-term projects.  You just work hard all day, sleep, and if you sleep early, you wake up early.  From what I can tell, the day starts, the day ends, and very little carries over.  \nIt's an opportunity to basically get a bit more physically disciplined and also be exposed to different types of people.  I'm pretty strongly into social justice, but I'm not really impressed by the way you used those concepts in your post.  I feel like having a more-grounded perspective by understanding others and other situations/institutions will help you develop your views a bit better.  \n\nIt's not bad to be an emotional person.  I encourage you to keep that with you and cherish it.  However, part of being a strong person in the future, especially now that you're legally an adult, is dealing with issues of great adversity.  You have a lot of options of dealing with this issue, including not-serving.  When you're put to task, you're literally taking the worst options:  Panicking and considering suicide.  This isn't an abnormal or unexpected response, but hopefully it's something you want to change about yourself, and going through the military might help temper that response.  \n\nAnyways, don't commit suicide.  After 6 years or so, you'll have presumably finished military service and/or graduated Brown.  That's pretty huge.  Then you have some 60-70 years to live that life.  Also, for reals, if you believe in social justice, then don't commit suicide, devote your life and your effort to that cause instead of wasting your work.",

I genuinely wish you all the best and whenever I'm stressed, I remind myself that one day I will wake up with the love of my life in our own house and eat eggs and bacon with her.\n\nEDIT: I just talked to the military department (it's on the second floor) at Incheon Airport and they said me and my brother (who is a rising freshman at college this fall) would not be held. I was told people over 25 or 26 (I don't remember, sorry) (and under 35 I assume) are the ones who get stopped from leaving the airport. Plus, there is a duration (multiple months, I believe) I would need to stay to be held from leaving. I'm not sure if all this is 100% true, I will find out when I leave.",

Korean military when your uncle went and now is VERRRY different, and the pay is around $300 currently (which isn't good at all but way better than $110).  You can postpone your enlistment for several more years if you want, or just not come back to Korea until you are 38+ years old. Korea is not a bad country if you do decide to come and you will learn Korean real quick if you do serve. Hope you well and don't stress too much, it sucks a lot especially when it comes as a shock; but I guarantee you if you do your time you'll probably be proud and make a bunch of new friends when you are finished.",

I'm hoping that once you get in contact with the right people, that you will not have to defer admission. I can tell that this means a lot to you, and it should because you life doesn't need to be derailed because of this. If you can't go to the US Embassy yourself, can you get a family member to do it for you? Once you are able to do that, please renounce your Korean citizenship immediately.\n\nEDIT: I see a lot of people saying that your parents should have known that this was going to happen. I don't understand why they wouldn't have told you then? What is going on?",

To have a simple oversight fundamentally change the trajectory of the next few years of your life is awful- I wish I could give you a hug! From the other comments, it looks like once you\u2019re discharged you\u2019ll still be able to attend Brown, but that doesn\u2019t negate the suckiness of the present situation. Please, please, please don\u2019t do anything drastic (I noticed you mentioned killing yourself). As someone who has been through extremely difficult and unexpected times in their life (against their will), it may help to keep Brown as a beacon in your mind. Take the military day by day, and soon you\u2019ll be right where you\u2019ve always wanted to. I know it\u2019s going to be much harder than that, but you\u2019d be surprised at how effective sheer mental will can be at guiding us through traumatic experiences. Make sure you contact Brown for a deferred enrollment. I wish you the best; you CAN do this!",

First off, I'm really sorry for what happened to your uncle. Everybody who enlists have to go through 4-6 weeks of basic training which involves basicallu everything you'll do in your next 1-2 years in the army. For the gas training (\ud654\uc0dd\ubc29 hwa saeng bang), don't worry, everyone's scared of that and it will be easier than what your uncle told you, because training is getting easier as equipment improves.\n\nSince you're a fluent English speaker and you got into a prestigious university, I would maybe suggest going as a KATUSA (working with US troops). It's like a lottery and the chances are basically 25%. \n\nHope everything works out best!",

It is a pathway to becoming an officer, rather than a regularly enlisted person. It is very competitive between applicants, and the people currently enrolled in the program.\n\nI would suggest looking into something like that for yourself.

For most of my life, I dreamt of not going to the military, but over the last few years I've warmed up to the thought, and decided to keep my citizenship. Military service is now at an all-time low in terms of the service length, at a year and a half (18 months). You used to not be able to use phones or many personal items for that matter, now you're mostly free (when you get free time). If you read this, good luck, and it probably wont be as bad as you think! Also try to delay your Brown enrollment, they'll probably allow it.",

You get free time on weekends as well. I think you feel really stressed because it happened suddenly but if you take time to think and gather your senses you will be okay. A lot of guys have gone through military here and even if they disliked it they have said that they made some really great friendships while being there.

I know it fucking sucks and it is not what you want to do - unfortunately it is a part of being a Korean citizen. But I think you're being too scared and you're thinking too much and worrying too much about it. You can keep trying to talk to people- a lot of people delay their entrance into the military if they have university to attend or something. Try looking into that and seeing if you can delay it. A lot of koreans go overseas to hold off on their service for a couple of years as well. You will be okay. Don't think about ending your life over something like this.",

Who\u2019s gonna answer the call? They have chosen YOU. Do you care about being free and having all the rights you have now? There\u2019s a very good reason all men are required to join the military. Like others have said, sometimes life throws you a curveball, and how you respond to adversity defines your character. Step up to the plate and prove to yourself that you can tackle adversity.

Look at it this way, you will earn your stripes and the right to call yourself a man among other koreans. That will last you for the rest if your life. Now think. You've served alongside all the other poor korean bastards and you hear about privileged kids who abandon their korean citizenship for an american one just before their draft date ( look up singer yoo soong joon or ask mom and dad about him because I guarantee you they know). Wouldnt you hate his los angeles living ass while you slave away at the barracks? That's the phenomenon in a nutshell. \n\nGuess what, I didn't serve. I'm american of korean heritage.

      "text": "I\u2019m so so sorry that this has happened to you. I\u2019m literally heartbroken for you. \nThere\u2019s a lot of people in the comments saying that this is a horrible situation to be in, but you should just suck it up and treat it as a learning experience. I just wanted to disagree and say that while you may not have any legal recourse, you never have to accept that this is ever an okay thing to happen. Nobody should ever have their will stripped from them and be forced into something like a slave for any period of time, let alone two years. You are absolutely right for being angry and upset about this, you are being coerced into service and it is akin to slavery (I\u2019m not trying to be dramatic but it\u2019s true) and it doesn\u2019t make you any less of a \u201cman\u201d to complain about this. It might not societally conventional to talk about how you don\u2019t want to be conscripted because in Korea, military service is what makes you a man and Korean men who dodge the draft are looked down upon pretty severely, but you have every right to be furious and about this and you have nothing to be ashamed of at all. Don\u2019t let anyone try and tell you that the military\u2019s not actually that bad, or that you\u2019ll ultimately come out stronger from this experience, because the truth is that you shouldn\u2019t be in this situation where you are being forced into conscription in the first place.\nI know a couple of kids who delayed their college matriculation for two years to go serve in Korea. Just contact Brown and I am sure they will be understanding.\nYou could try to buy some time by saying that you\u2019ll come to Korea and serve after graduating Brown, but keep in mind that probably every kid in your position make these promises but then never come back to Korea. They\u2019re probably used to these typical excuses so try to come up with something more original that will get you out of Korea, then just never go back for a really long time. Have you also tried contacting a lawyer? Or could you get your mom or dad to contact a lawyer from the US?\nAgain, I\u2019m so upset for you and it\u2019s just absolutely horrible how your life can just be controlled like this. It\u2019s beyond wrong, and I\u2019m sorry there\u2019s nothing I can do to help. If you ever need someone to talk to, pm me. If you need any help translating documents or just don\u2019t understand something, I\u2019m from Korea and I\u2019m pretty fluent in Korean and I\u2019ll help you.",

Get in touch with the Consulate, ask for any emergency consular services. \n\nTell them where you are and ask them to meet someone from the embassy if possible. \n\nTell them you do not know where you will be taken to, that your family and university have no knowledge of any of this and that you would like to be put in touch with a Korean lawyer in order to better understand your rights, specifically regarding any mental / physical medical conditions, draft deferments and exceptions for dual passport holders and non-korean speakers.\n\nYou mention gender which no one has addressed, but if you are LGBT+ be sure to mention that as well, but be very careful about any of the Army guys hearing that. While the military is not what it was during your grandpa\u2019s time, Korean society is not as progressive as it is in other places, particularly in the military.\n\nTo a hierarchical strict society like that, it is already bad enough that you are \u201ctrying to betray the country\u201d by not fulfilling your duty as a citizen. Anyone you meet in there if you end up being conscripted, make sure to explain you had no idea and were just on vacation.\n\nI would also mention to embassy staff that you are willing to join the US military upon return and graduating Brown if they can assist in avoiding conscription. Don\u2019t sign anything though.\n\nI\u2019m not sure that it will change anything though as the koreans have the law on their side and US-korean interests are very aligned on military matters.\n\nIf if helps, I used to go to school with the daughter of a korean military guy assigned to their embassy in my country. She was an artist and dreaded going back after high school because of conscription but she survived.\n\nIf anything, ask your captors how does it work for people that don\u2019t speak korean.",
