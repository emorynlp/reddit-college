  "text": "Hello college applications reddit!\n\nI'm a dude looking to go into sound engineering and have had lots of trouble finding which majors to go into, but have for most schools decided to just apply for the theater/music majors. For UCLA this requires a supplemental application, which includes a \"Design approach\" and \"Portfolio\" section. \n\nDoes the \"design approach\" mean set design? Lighting plot? If so, what gels am I allowed to use? And is it ok that I've never done set design? I was a lights, sound, and rigging crewhead at my high school and have worked outside of school as a lights/sound operator so set design was never my job. \n\nFor the portfolio section, I have not had photos taken at most shows I did lighting design for, and since I usually work as a sound tech there's not really anything visual for me to show? Maybe lighting plots? \n\nI need to turn in applications very soon so any help quickly would be awesome, also any advice that could be provided about majors at UCs for someone looking to be a sound engineer would be awesome.\n\nThank you!",
