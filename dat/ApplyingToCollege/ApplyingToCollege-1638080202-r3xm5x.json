  "text": "Context: I'm currently failing AP Calc BC and am not 100% sure I'll be able to get my grade back up to atleast a D before our semester ends (Dec 15), passed AB last year, did all required math courses in the UNC system (NC HS student)\n\nI took Math 1 (9th grade math) and 2 (10th) in 7th and 8th grade respectively, so would those credits count towards my HS progression, and if I only have 3 credits for math in HS would colleges usually still look at apps? (Can't ask counselor/principal at the moment)\n\nColleges I applied to: UNC, UNCC, UNCG, NCSU, VT",

I\u2019m guessing it probably does vary from state to state, but I don\u2019t know exactly what NC\u2019s policies are. In the school I went to in NY, you didn\u2019t have to take 4 years of math, but that might not be applicable everywhere.",
