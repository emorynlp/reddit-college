  "text": "I'm so scared of applying to college. I keep studying and studying for the SAT, but at the end of the day, I just lifelessly lay around from the inevitable exhaustion. 3.3 GPA, 1460 on PSAT, 4 EC. I can't! I can't! I used to dream of getting into Yale. Oh boy, Yale seems a far distance away.",
