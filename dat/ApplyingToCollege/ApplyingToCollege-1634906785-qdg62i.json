  "title:": "Need help with Common App essay",
  "text": "Wrote two essays\n\n* The 1st one is me ranting about \"Being special is no longer special\" in which I described how I asked myself why I felt an urgent need of becoming extraordinary and later realized that being special is nice, but  it\u2019s not a sufficient metric for our overall well-being. I also wrote about how I stop comparing myself with others, and strived towards slowly improving myself and learning new skills instead of just going with the crowd without knowing what I really want to do with my life.\n* The 2nd one is about how playing video games helped me overcome social anxiety by helping me overcome my fear of talking to strangers.    \n\nWhich essay should I submit???",
