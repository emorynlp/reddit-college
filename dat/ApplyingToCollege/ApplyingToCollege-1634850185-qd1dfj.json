  "text": "I know most of you are stressed with the college apps right now. Making sure you have the right stats, amazing and/or unique extracurriculars, the perfect essays, etc.. \n\nIt\u2019s great you guys want to aim high. But i\u2019d still apply to some safeties you would really consider attending. I think it\u2019s 1000x more important to attend a school that\u2019s in your budget rather than go to a well known school and be in debt (if you get scholarships, great!!). Especially for undergrad.. It\u2019s not worth going over 100k in debt. \n\nTake it from me who applied to many prestigious universities and got into several of them for STEM. Going to my state school was the very last thing I wanted to do. Can you guess where I ended up??? Yup.. my state school\u2026 I was going through a lot of financial hardships and mental issues. I got a full ride at state flagship and it\u2019s a good school! I love it so far. \n\nAlso, make sure to ask yourself if you would genuinely be happy at a certain school and if they would fit your needs. \n\nGood luck the rest of the way!",

We would be full pay at any university in the US.  So, those prestigious universities would cost our kids (us) about $76k a year.  Instead, we're paying half that (with merit scholarship) at an out-of-state school for our eldest.  There's no opportunity or experience my kid would get at a higher-ranked school that's worth another $160k.  And my daughter loves her school, is getting a decent education, has friends, is doing research with a professor, and planning to attend grad school (where the money we saved on undergrad will go to good use).",

To name a few:. A good work ethic, the ability to problem solve, the ability to work well with others, good communication, living below your means (having money in savings allows you to take risks in your life and career), your health, who you marry, whether you get divorced, how much debt you have (again, you can't take as many risks if you have a lot of debt for school, house, cars), etc...\n\nEmployers hire for knowledge, skills and experience.  The degree is just a minimum requirement to apply.  In most jobs, the employer doesn't much care where you got your degree.  Given a young applicant from a higher-ranked school who has no work experience or specialized knowledge and an applicant from a state school who has some internship experience and/or hobbies related to the position and most employers will hire the applicant who already knows something.\n\nAnd those \"opportunities\" at more prestigious schools?  They don't actually offer research with the one Nobel prize winner on staff to freshmen.  You can get good research/internships/clubs/travel abroad/etc... at any decent state university.",

The claim specifically that IB starting salaries have a floor of 100k is completely ridiculous - there was a lot of excitement this past summer because some firms were beginning to offer those salaries in light of the pandemic. The thing about the bonus is that it's year end, so in the meantime you have a job that pays decently but not amazingly, on top of expenses, debt, and the cost of living in Manhattan. It's definitely not a cakewalk to get there, and even if you make it you're gonna have a rough break in.\n\nThe salary improves with time and promotions, but turnover can be pretty unpleasant too. In general, the whole \"go massively into debt because IB pays well if you get it and it's set for life\" is a pretty oversimplified view of the career path, which tends to happen if you start taking sigma male grindset memes unironically. It pays well, sure, but it's not as easy as getting into Harvard and then it becomes a cakewalk.\n\nAnd, for the record: I work as an engineer, if I was actually adverse to hard work I would probably have gone into finance and gotten a cushy desk job lmfao",

                      "text": "Please link me to where you got 85K at age 34 because that number is bullshit; according to [payscale](https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/best-schools-by-type/bachelors/ivy-league-schools), mid-career pay is well into 6 figures and 85K is very close to the median *starting salary* for an Ivy. And this is out of *all graduates*, so if you only look at CS and finance grads, the median starting salary would be much higher.\n\nyou call me an \"optimistic kid\" but I know many people who have these kind of jobs, and they are who I get my information from. btw many quant jobs are in chicago which is not HCOL, and these 200K+ FAANG jobs are also in places like Seatle and Austin, not just SF. yes I know quant trading are competitive (other wise why would it pay so much?), but from what I've heard from actual quants, as long as you are decent at math it isn't too hard to a job. In fact I don't think I know anyone who qualified for USAMO and went to a top school but couldn't get a quant position.",
