  "text": "Hi,\n\nI'm applying to UC schools and I do not live in California.\n\nI know that UC does not include Freshman grade for UC gpa. \n\nSo does that mean that I don't have to report any of the Freshman grades, but only courses and honor types when applying to UC schools? Or do I still have to report freshman grades?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",
