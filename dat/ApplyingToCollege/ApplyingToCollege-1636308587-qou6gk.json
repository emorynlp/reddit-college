  "text": "Guys, who are filling ISFAA, are you printing the form out and then completing it by pen? Or are you completing it on the computer by typing and then making a pdf form? \n\nAnother thing, I couldn't find any tutorials on YouTube on how to fill up the ISFAA. If you have any resources which you think might help me to fill up the form please share it :)\n\nThanks for your time.",
