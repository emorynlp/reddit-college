  "text": "Having procrastinated to the last moment,\u00a0I\u2019ve realized that EA for some of the schools I want to go to ends tomorrow.\u00a0\n\nThis  wouldn\u2019t be a problem except for the fact that I\u2019d lose opportunity to  some scholarship funds which are only applicable to EA applicants.\n\nHowever, I am not your high-achiever a2cer. My stats are bad to begin. I have a 1.92 GPA, but a 30 ACT. Having almost entirely failed last year, I\u2019m in a pickle.\u00a0\n\nI have two options:\n\n1. Apply early (tomorrow) Unfortunately, it would be a application where: the essay is rushed, there aren\u2019t any LORS and my EC\u2019s are nonexistent. I have my  doubts that this is worth it which is why\u2026\n2. I\u2019m  thinking about applying RD. I\u2019ll actually have good LORs, some EC\u2019s and a good essay. I\u2019d lose out on some money but then again, I doubt I\u2019d  get any merit-based funding.\u00a0\n\nAdvice is needed. Which route? Yes, I know CC's exist. \n\nIf anyone has any insight on scholarships for the situation I am in, please also let me know.\u00a0",
