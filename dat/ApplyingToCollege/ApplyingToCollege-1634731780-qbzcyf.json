  "text": "1. As Uchicago allows you to upload your response to their essay questions as a pdf, what spacing should I use and which font? Should it be TNR 12pt 1.5?\n\n2. If I\u2019m using one of this years prompts, should I still include the prompt at the top of my essay and just italicise it?\n\nThanks!",
