  "text": "Hey, \n\nI have worked on a research project in a US summer program over the past 4 months, and I have done a lot of things that does not fit in the 150 characters, and I think it is important to highlight because It will not be mentioned elsewhere in the app. Do you advise with adding the \\[see add'l info\\] in the end of the activity's description to talk more about it in the additional information section of the common app? The only reason I feel like it won't be good to add because like.. they intentionally are locking at 150 characters to not waste their time, and it wont make sense. \n\nThanks in advance, and i appreciate any opinions!",
