  "text": "So 10 mins are left for the deadline and I still have to write one optional essay, edit my additional information and complete my financial aid documents. Any suggestions of how to get all of this done.....?\n\nIn all seriousness, I have been burnt out for the last four days, literally skipped one night sleep and pulled another all-nighter. All this just to go RD. \n\nI know I am better off with RD considering that my application would be way better 2 months later but still I am disappointed not applying to one school early. I probably can't wait for the descion of one school. But maybe it's for the best.\n\nBtw I am open to advice of colleges(if there are any) who have EA deadline after 1st November",

(Keep in mind that it is still Nov 1 in the US for another 9 hours.) Note that for some colleges, the Writing Supplement may be a separate submission, and it would not be unusual for a college to allow another day or two to submit that.",

Just real quick off the top of my head - Virginia Tech is December 1st and LSU is December 15th\n\nThere\u2019s also a smallish amount of schools with EA2, I know UMass Lowell has it on January 5th\n\nThere\u2019s way more than that but I\u2019d have to google it to get a better list",
