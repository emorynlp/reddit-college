      "text": "What's a safety for you might vary a lot, but here are some examples.\n\nIowa State, Arizona State, Oregon State, and UCF are some big engineering schools that are pretty safe.  For some students, schools like Ohio State, Michigan State, or Penn State might be safe too.\n\nPrivate schools like RIT, Drexel, WPI, and Rose Hulman can be good too and are possible safeties for some students.",

      "text": "Less selective schools that are \"strong\" in engineering over time tend to become more popular and thus a little less safe for the major than is needed for a true safety, so be aware of this. If that turns out to be the case, add it to the list as a target, and continue looking for safeties.\n\nFor CE, you'll want (1) an ABET-accredited program (whereas ABET may not matter for CS, so make sure you understand the differences) that (2) you know you can afford. Affordability is critical for a safety. Be aware that public universities tend to offer little to no need-based financial aid to out-of-state students and charge them more. Lower ranked publics do often offer large merit to out of state students and you would need to check their scholarship websites - ideally, someplace with automatic merit, so you may find a chart (like Bama has) or merit scholarship calculator (like ASU has). Private universities offer need-based aid without regard to state of residence though naturally lower-ranked ones offer less need-based aid and more merit for good stats. Whether these are affordable depends on your budget.",
