  "text": "I\u2019m not sure how I should fill out the activities section for Junior Varsity athletics.\n\nJust to preface, this is listed as my 7th activity, so I don\u2019t really care if it doesn\u2019t end up sounding super impressive.\n\nI have played JV Boys Tennis all four years of high school. For 3 months in the fall and a large part of the summer, this has been a major time commitment preventing me from doing other activities.\n\nFinally as a senior I played 3 varsity matches as another player was injured, and I remained the first reserve player through the rest of the season. Should i include this?\n\nAlso, all four years my teams has been very successful. We lost a total of 6 out of 80 of our matches in my four years, and won sectional all four years. Should I mention these achievements even though they were varsity achievements? I did atleast contribute to the varsity\u2019s success by scrimmaging with them. Should I include my JV record? \n\nA lot of people on here say that JV vs Varsity doesn\u2019t really matter unless you were really good, so idk what to do.",
