  "text": "hi, i am applying to 6/9 of my colleges with EA, and 3 with RD (I wasn't sure about ED, so I decided against it) I'm a bit confused on how long I would have to make a decision if I got accepted through EA, and if you are able to wait until the RD results come back to choose a college?",

      "text": "You have until May 1st no matter is you apply EA or RD. You might get your EA decision back before the RD deadline, so then if you get accepted or denied to more schools than you accepted, you could add or drop schools from your RD. Every school gets back at a different time, you can look up the specific school and how long it usually takes for people to get their decision back.",

      "text": "EA is only an early action on the admission decision, not on your choice/acceptance. You will have until the same May 1 date as RD.\n\nCheck with your schools to be sure, as there could be outliers, but that\u2019s how it worked at every school I\u2019ve dealt with, and is the general definition of EA",
