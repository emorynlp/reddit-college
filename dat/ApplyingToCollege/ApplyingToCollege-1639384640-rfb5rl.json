      "text": "A whole host of reasons:\n\n1. They like you but you weren\u2019t competitive for the early pool. They want more information (mid-year grades, LOR, etc.) before making a decision. Some schools prefer to deny and only defer a small number of students that apply early (looking at you Stanford and Pomona). \n2. You are a legacy student and they want to preserve the relationship but also want to be able to couch a denial with high RD numbers. \n3. They are assholes who defer everyone who doesn\u2019t get in early (looking at you Georgetown).\n4. They know you are a high stat kid and they want to really know if you love them because they are obsessed with their yield rate and don\u2019t want to be anyone\u2019s second choice (looking at you Northeastern and Case Western).",

          "text": "Also (ugly but true at a few schools): need blind refers to straight-out acceptances. Some places will be need-blind on acceptances but then be need-aware in who they call up from the deferred list, sometimes even with a phone call to check if the student will accept it. That way they get better yield and acceptance rates while staying \"need blind\" and having more control over their budget.",
