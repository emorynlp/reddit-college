  "text": "I have a massive list of colleges, most of which I don\u2019t really want to apply to but I\u2019m applying to them anyway for my parents. All the schools on my list are super-selective places where I have no chance of getting in Bc I can\u2019t apply to \u201cno-name\u201d schools. I have a mountain of supplemental weighing me down, and I\u2019m probably gonna have to redo my Commonapp essay. My classes are kicking my ass, and it takes everything I have to do well, or sometimes even keep up. I\u2019m not getting enough, and I don\u2019t have any time to exercise, and I\u2019m eating nonstop. Everyone in my family is going through so much personal shit, and I don\u2019t want to add to that by breaking down, but there are so many days when I think it would be easier to just give up. I feel like a fucking robot. I\u2019m fucking miserable.",
