  "text": "I'm a junior in High School, hoping to major in some form of biochemistry, although I'm not entirely certain as of yet, and I'd like to reach a better understanding of what types of universities I can expect to attend from people with experience while creating my long-term plans.   \n\n\nA little bit about me:\n\n\\-My average is currently 100.41  \n\\-My class rank is currently 9th, however, I attend a large city school  \n\\-I take a reasonable number of APs, as well as doubling at my local CC for college credit  \n\\-Not enough ECs, since my school doesn't really offer any STEM-related clubs or activities, although I hope to start up meetings with my school's chapter of the ACS chem club (there are no meetings rn)  \n\\-Former job experience as a piano instructor, although it didn't end well (personality conflicts with my bosses), so I would be unable to use them for references.   \n\\-I attend one of the country's top music schools currently for classical piano; this is my first semester. I got an A on my NYSSMA level 6 piano solo.  \n\\-Marching band and NHS  \n\\-No sports in HS  \n\\-Have not taken the SAT yet  \n\n\nAny advice on how to build my EC's and resume given these circumstances would be greatly appreciated, as well as practical advice about which schools would be smart to attend.   \n\n\nThanks.",

      "text": "You have a great spike in music it seems, and I think your stats and rank should be fine. Continue piano, and you might consider applying to colleges as a double major in music and biochem to help your case, obvs you can change your path once you enroll. Make sure to study for the SAT, and/or take it twice. I think you\u2019re good for STEM clubs, you might consider getting involved in research this summer. I did some research, it was fun. Look for either structured opportunities, say RSI but more local, or reach out to professors at a local university if there aren\u2019t any structured opportunities near you, but since you\u2019re in a big city I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to say there\u2019s probably a lot of them available.",
