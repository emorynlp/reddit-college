  "text": "Is there anyone who passed the duolingo test? Please help me i\u2019m getting insane. Because even though i got 135-145 in my practice exams, by the reason of not looking at the screen for a extended time, they are keep making my test invalid.\nBut, I tried to gaze only at the screen and I never look anywhere else, even when i\u2019m writing. Please anyone give me some information of how you passed the test. I heard some people got passed by using MacBook and is that true? (B/c i\u2019m not a MacBook user.) \n\nI just desperately want to see my score. I took 6 times but I haven\u2019t even see my score yet. \n\n+ and is that true that we can only take the test for 2 times in a month?",

      "text": "Relax, Duolingo Test is easy if you know general English and can converse with people in fluent English. You don't need to prepare for it but give it's practice tests to see the type of questions you will get in real test. I got **140** in final test and I give 6 practice ones. \n\nMy practice scores averaged **125-145**. So yeah",
