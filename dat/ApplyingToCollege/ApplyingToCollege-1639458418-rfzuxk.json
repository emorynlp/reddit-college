So no need to use it for coffee only. \nI do like supporting local businesses, but a lot of the teachers don\u2019t actually live near the school, so I want to get them something that they could reliably use almost anywhere. \nAgree that Amazon is universal, but it likely the same as giving cash so if feels more impersonal.  But I am sure teachers are happy with anything. My sense is at the high school level, they don\u2019t typically get anything.",
