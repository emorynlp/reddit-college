  "title:": "Can Admission Essays be a Book Analysis?",
  "text": "one of the colleges I'm applying to gives me the option to write an essay of my personal choice. It says It can be one I've already written, one that responds to a different prompt, or one of my own design. I have completed an analysis on a passage from \"Their Eyes Were Watching God\", and I'm wondering if it would be appropriate to use, considering the fact that college essay questions seem to be more of a personal part of admissions as opposed to academic based.\n\nFYI: the requirement is between 250-650 words. My analysis is 400 pre-editing. An essay is not required.",
