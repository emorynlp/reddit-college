  "text": "I tried asking on r/financialaid but got no response. If anyone can help, please do so. I'm filling out the CSS profile, but I'm confused by something. For the part that asks about the home we're living in, I filled out that it's a rental home because we're immigrants living in a rental house. However, we also have a primary home in our home country, so do I list that in the parents' assets section as a real estate? If so, how do I indicate that this is not a business real estate, but it's just our primary home in our country?",
