  "text": "Thanksgiving rant lol\n\nDon\u2019t want to disclose too much information (in case of being doxed) but for my area and age, I would humbly say I am pretty well-accomplished. \n\nGreat grades, president of multiple organizations and EC\u2019s, appeared in local newspapers/ my city\u2019s televisions stations for my service and leadership, everyone (teachers, classmates, friends & friends parents, family members) anticipate my success often being quoted as saying \u201cyou will be so successful\u201d, \u201cyou will go so far\u201d, etc. I even have some classmates ask if I ever have a mental breakdown because of how much I do, while others mention my accomplishments every time they speak to me. \n\nBut the truth is I am struggling so much. I have a teacher who has made racist comments to me in the past now trying to tarnish my image for absolute no reason . My dad sent an email to my guidance counselor with such cruel language about me then cut me off from his life. I am trying to overcome an eating disorder. I am so incredibly overwhelmed with my life and honestly look so put together. \n\nSo, instead of being jealous of the kid who won a big competition, or comparing yourself to the teenager on Instagram who seems \u201cset for life\u201d , take a deep breath and remember everyone\u2019s life is so so so different behind closed doors :)",
