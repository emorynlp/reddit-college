  "text": "So for very selective colleges, should I submit a score of 3 or 4? I only have 7 AP scores, so leaving out all my 3s and 4s would mean I would have very few scores listed which looks bad. Also, I got a 4 in AP Physics 1, which is my only science AP, so I feel like I need to include that. \n\nThoughts?",

      "text": "Always submit 4s, no matter how selective the university. As for 3s, it depends - it\u2019s better for colleges to see a 3 than to think you chose not to submit and got a 2 or 1 (like at my high school, where we were required to take every AP test we took the class for, it would be obvious if you left one out), but typically they have no reason to assume you took the test, and it\u2019s fine to leave it out.",
