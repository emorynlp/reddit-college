  "text": ">!throwaway account since this is a bit sensitive and I don't want this on my main!<\n\nThis whole month has been so annoying. The first week after I submitted my ED application to my dream school, I had a seizure for the first time, which I \"conveniently\" used as an excuse to not work on my essays for up to 2 weeks thanks to all the appointments and checkups (like MRIs and EEGs) I have to go to. But even after that, I barely worked on my essays during thanksgiving break, and I just instead watched anime and sat on discord. What the fuck am I doing with my life? I have no idea.\n\nIn total, I haven't been able to complete a single application this entire month - I keep freezing up at writing essays, and it literally takes me hours just to write a single 150-word prompt. Add onto my shitty behavior of being a major procrastinator - as in writing 5 words and then taking a 5-hour \"break\" - and you get to where I am. And at this rate, I just don't know if I'll be able to finish all my applications (I have about 40 essays left). All I can hope for is to get into my ED school first round and not deal with this dumb stress.\n\nSorry for my incohesive as fuck post, but I needed to vent somewhere.",

      "text": ":( hope you've been doing okay physically; I know how much this is taking a toll mentally. Maybe it might be a good idea to go without writing (or thinking about writing) for a few days, just so you can relax yourself? Or if you really want to write, one thing that's helped me is to just write in a few bullet points about what I want to say, without thinking about the structure or the floweriness. It helps me be loose, and it's a little bit of progress. It rlly helps in the later stages of writing essays because I'm not starting from a super blank slate :)\n\nRegardless, it might be a good idea to rest for a while--and I mean really rest, without pressuring yourself to write.\n\nGood luck, and I'm cheering for you <3",

      "text": "I can *really* relate to this post (without the seizure ofc). I've been procrastinating A LOT too (in fact im doing it rn) and i feel so bad bc of it, but i cant stop myself. what has really helped me recently is remembering why I wanted to get into college in the first place. even petty reasons like proving people who don't believe in me wrong have motivated me so much. just imagine how great it would be to rub your acceptance in the face of someone who has always hated on you (sounds awful and i probably wont do it irl, but just the thought of it helps ). another thing I do is go to the library and sit there writing essays until I have finished the ones I need to finish. This really works because there are no distractions and you will have social pressure from the people in the library to actually do work. \n\nIf those don't work, then go to further extremes. Delete discord, youtube, social media apps, etc. get a website blocker for your computer. give your phone to your parents and tell then not to give it back to you until you're done writing essays. dont go to sleep until you're done. those might sound really harsh, but sometimes it's the only way i can get work done. having ADHD has made college apps a nightmare for me :((",
