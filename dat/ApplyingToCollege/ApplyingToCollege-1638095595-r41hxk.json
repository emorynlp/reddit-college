  "text": "See title. I tried to register for the last SAT testing date but they were no longer accepting registrations. I know SAT scores aren't mandatory for many colleges due to COVID but from what I've heard they're heavily encouraged. Would bronze medals at the IMO/IOI make up for the lack of a result? I'm applying for CS if that's relevant.",
