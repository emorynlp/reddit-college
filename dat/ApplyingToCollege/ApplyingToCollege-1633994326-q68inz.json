  "title:": "Is transferring from a T10 to Harvard/MIT/Stanford possible?",
  "text": "Due to some health issues, I'm going to have to take 2-3 gap years after freshman year, and I thought it would be a great opportunity to consider transferring to Harvard, MIT or Stanford. I'm currently at a T10 (one of Duke, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern) and it's pretty good here, but my major (CS) seems a little lacking at times compared to the three I mentioned above. Still very good, but obviously those three are dominant in CS.\n\nDuring my senior year, I didn't apply to HYPS since I didn't think I'd be qualified due to my HS GPA, so I'd like to at least give it a shot in my transfer year. At the very worst, I'll be still going to my current university and some lost application fees. Is it possible, or have there been transfers from T10 to these schools? Or should I save my application fee?",

      "text": "the fact that you're at a t10 aside, harvard/mit/stanford will want to see that you've racked up some pretty significant accomplishments if you intend to transfer after 2-3 gap years. if you're going through health issues, trying to prepare a competitive transfer application on top of that does not sound like a good time. it's certainly not impossible though, if you're really stuck on transferring.",

      "text": "It\u2019s pretty much not possible for you. Those three schools obviously have very low transfer acceptance rates, but they of course do admit some transfer students. The problem for you is that they tend to only admit transfers from schools where the transfer will make a huge difference, for the most part that means community college. A Harvard transfer admissions counselor will have a hard time looking at an application from a T10 and actually believing that going to Harvard will make a big difference for you compared to someone currently studying at a community college.",
