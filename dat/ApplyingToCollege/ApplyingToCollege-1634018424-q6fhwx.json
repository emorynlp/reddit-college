What can\u2019t you do with philosophy other than be an engineer or a nurse?\n\nMy son has a philosophy degree and he has a job working making motion designs for movie trailers. \n\nThe skills of learning how to think creatively, problem solve, write well, present your thoughts in a clear and cohesive way, and use logic \u2014 not to mention having an understanding of the historical context of the way people think are transferable skills that can be used in pretty much any job. \n\nFor law school you can major in anything at all \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter.  So if you want to do a more job training education like marketing or CS or engineering you can do that too",

There are no particular philosophy jobs that specifically require you to have philosophy. Of course you can get jobs, but most of them can be taken by another major\u2019s student.\n\nFor eg, the search results that come up for philosophy major jobs are:\n1) HR: Most people that go into HR have a psych degree. You don\u2019t necessarily need a philosophy degree.\n2) Journalism: You could just have a journalism degree, which most employers would ideally prefer.\n\nWhereas for a random major like Geography, you can get jobs as a surveyor or a cartographer. This is a geography related job that requires a specific geo degree. I mean, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but save teaching, there aren\u2019t really any philosophy jobs.\n\nThis is what I meant.",

Some colleges are doing better than others though for sure. I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s anything wrong with trade school type degrees. I think there\u2019s a lot of benefit to them for some people. And for others not so much.
