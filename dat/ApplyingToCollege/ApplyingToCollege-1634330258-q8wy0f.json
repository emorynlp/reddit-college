  "text": "let\u2019s say i only put my ACT on my common app, but i decide i also want a college to look at my SAT after submitting my common app. Can i self report it in the college portal after i submit my application even if it\u2019s not in my common app? or would the AO question this and wonder why it wasn\u2019t also on my common app\u2026the reason why is that i\u2019m still ambivalent on whether i should submit both my ACT and my SAT  or just my ACT, but i may decide add my SAT later",
