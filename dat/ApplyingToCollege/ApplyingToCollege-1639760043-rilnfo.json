  "title:": "Baking or Extra Coursework for Last EC on Common App",
  "text": "I have one more spot on my common app activities and I was wondering if I should just put my hobby of baking (idk to seem quirky ig \ud83e\udd2a) or to put my extra coursework I did at my local CC over the past two years. I took four college courses (related to my major) outside my school transcript and will be taking another this spring. I'm gonna be mentioning this in my additional info, sending my cc transcript, and having one of my LOR's mention it. Should I still put this in my activities?",
