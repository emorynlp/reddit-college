  "title:": "Question regarding CSS profile",
  "text": "On my commonapp it says that my parents are separated, but can I still write \"married or domestic pratners\" on my css profile? They're not legally divorced and their separation was very recent, I'm assuming most financial documents still have them as married. I tried filling out the CSS with them as separated, the whole process became much more confusing since the situation at my house is a bit complicated. Financially they are still very much interdependant, with my father paying all expenses. The only difference is that they live in different houses now. Does having different relationship status on my commonapp and css cause any issue?",
