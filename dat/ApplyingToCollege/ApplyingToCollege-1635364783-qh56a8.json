  "text": "Working on my essay right now. When I was in the fire academy a phrase I would hear often was \"embrace the suck\"\n\nI was planning on writing about how difficult it was and how this phrase help me get through it, I want to relate it to college, about how sometimes finals week, late nights, projects can suck and you just have to embrace it and learn to love the suck.\n\nDo you think its a good idea to write about how this mentality can encourage you to work had and persevere? Or am I making college and myself sound too negative?",
