      "text": "Any responsibilities related to your family that takes up your free time.\n\nDriving siblings to school or practice, having to cook dinner because your parents work, cleaning up around the house, taking care of your siblings, that sort of thing. \n\nFor low-income students and/or students with large families, family responsibilities probably take up more of your time than high-income students and/or students with small families, so it's important that students from the first group I mentioned mention their responsibilities under the extracurricular section.",
