Luckily my teachers noticed that I understood all of the topics and liked learning for the sake of learning, and connecting different subjects (most universities work this way for work). They (presumably) wrote about that in their LoRs for me, and I wrote about it in my essays.\n\nFor the essays, my framing was everything. Nothing was about \"woe is me\" but rather just a simple acknowledgement that I didn't have the best grades, a quick mention that I have social anxiety and ADHD, and then on to the fact that I love learning and applying myself to the topics that I am interested in. My essay wasn't about why I wanted to get in, it was entirely about my love for my topic of interest, and how the specific university would help me get there.",

These factors include effort across a whole semester in different types of classroom, demonstrating a variety of academic skills and adapting to the expectations of different teachers.\n\nAt higher levels of achievement, there was even a negative relationship between ACT scores and college graduation, according to the research, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n\u201cGPAs measure a very wide variety of skills and behaviors that are needed for success in college, where students will encounter widely varying content and expectations,\u201d said Elaine M. Allensworth, lead author on the study and director of the University of Chicago Consortium on School Research. \n\n\u201cIn contrast, standardized tests measure only a small set of the skills that students need to succeed in college, and students can prepare for these tests in narrow ways that may not translate into better preparation to succeed in college.\u201d\n\n^ \nThis is an article about the research (2actually)\n\n2. GPAs don't just test your test taking ability but so much more (factors needed for success in college). SATs test you how fast you can add, subtract, divide, multiply, and how quickly you can solve math and understand english). While I'm not denying that SATs do test \"something\" that MIGHT be helpful, it is still undoubtedly far less of an indicator than GPA (+school report). \n\nI'm not saying \"remove SATs\". I'm just saying \"GPAs are and should remain far more important than SATs in the college admissions process\".",

The Ivy\u2019s are better for academia anyway. Better to go to a more hands-on school with a friendlier environment anyway. For all the WUE peeps here, there are so many good schools that often go overlooked. Don\u2019t fall into the trap of top 10 this, highest score that. Don\u2019t lose hope because you value yourself by your GPA. It\u2019s poison, and getting out of that is hard but you\u2019ll be so much happier.",
