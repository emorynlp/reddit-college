      "text": "Another vote to delete scores from the testing section when you are submitting your app to schools where you're applying test optional. That's safer. While it would be fine for most schools to leave the scores and just check test optional, last year, if I recall, there were a few schools where this was an issue.\n\nThen re-enter your scores in the app when you are submitting to a school where you want your scores considered. And as always, check your admission portal later to make sure your scores were received.",
