  "text": "TW: stress, anxiety. \nI\u2019m such a mess rn. I had a bad day at school and it\u2019s stressful. I go from 7-4 to school, then have French class from 4-6 and today I had a meeting from 6-7:30, but it started later than it was supposed to, like half an hour late, which I used to answer messages. It\u2019s currently 8:13 and I\u2019m spiraling down in anxiety and panic. I\u2019m swarmed in homework, presentations and more stuff, when someone from a college calls me. Not anyone, but the DIRECTOR OF ADMISSIONS FOR GODS SAKE. They have been talking to me and following up, shit is, I\u2019m not done, not even near done. But they want me to send my common app info in, the essay and my last school transcript asap. They\u2019re pressuring me so much to do so, that I got sick last week thx to stress (not confirmed but I know that was it). I get they want me to get a good slot and apply and whatnot, but this pressure isn\u2019t doing me any good. And today he said \u201cso if you do get in,\u201d and I was like \u201care you shitting me?\u201d You\u2019re putting all this pressure on me to just\u2026 SPIKE UP MA FEARS? How dare you. I know I know that\u2019s how it works, my anxiety lets me make bad jokes. Anywho, I\u2019m in panic and in mental pain due to the strain of everything I have to do. I was drinking tea and calming down when he called, I just feel unsettled and want to cry to let out my emotions. I will calm down and breathe after I post this, but I\u2019ve almost no one to turn to with this kind of situations, and thought you guys could relate. Love to all, don\u2019t die in the stress like me.\nEdit: it is the next day and I\u2019m feeling better. Still lots to do, but I know now that this isn\u2019t a bad thing and working proactively will help.",
