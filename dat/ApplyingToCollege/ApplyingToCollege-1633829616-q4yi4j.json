  "text": "Just need to get this off my chest but I hate my school SO MUCH. We have an award that gives a full scholarship to our state university to the \u201chighest achieving\u201d student based on GPA at the end of junior year and their senior schedule/courseload and SAT score consideration, and despite the state university\u2019s statement that course rigor should be considered in the high school choosing the student, my school doesn\u2019t do that.\n\nAnd I was so f*cking close with a 3.97 GPA and the person who got it had a 4.00 despite barely taking any AP courses or honors while I\u2019ve put myself through shit the last 4 years with 14 AP courses and keeping all my grades above at an A+ except ONE CLASS at an A- which brought my GPA behind the person who won. And my school doesn\u2019t weight GPA out of \u201cequity\u201d and thus almost every school scholarship in my state that offers it to the \u201chighest achieving student\u201d who pads their schedule with easy classes goes to them. And now they have a fancy new award to put in their honors section that in my opinion, they don\u2019t deserve.\n\nNot sure why I\u2019m even writing about this but I feel like I need to get this off my chest\u2026 I\u2019m mad at my school for not taking class rigor in consideration for this award when the college that offers it says they should. I\u2019m mad at myself.",
