  "text": "So basically for my personal statement, I used third person view to better convey my story, however, at the conclusion part, I switched back to first person to show that the person in the story was me. I'm just doing my UC applications and they stated to \"Use your own voice. Your answers should reflect your ideas and be written by you alone. Use \"I\" and \"my\" statements in your responses.\"  I've used the third person essay for my state flag ship(which is the school I will most likely attend) Am I screwed pls.",

In the Yale Admissions podcast, they mentioned that essays like yours typically fall flat because of course they know you're the person in the story. It's YOUR common app essay. Can you still tell the same story and reflect on it without taking the third person angle?",
