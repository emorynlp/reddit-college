  "text": "Hi! I submitted my ea/ed apps without reporting a class rank, since my school and transcripts don\u2019t provide one. However, I\u2019m just graduating HS and got to know my unofficial class rank because of a random situation (the top 3 people get notified for school events throughout the year for senior year but person 3 was absent and I happen to be person 4!). my counselor already submitted everything in his behalf and we both selected \u201cschool doesn\u2019t rank\u201d (school profile explains it\u2019s only for specific circumstances), but this rank is really good (3% of graduating class). should I just explain it briefly in the additional info section?\n\nI\u2019m an intl applicant and I know context within our high schools is extremely important",
