  "text": "I have procrastinated for way too long. Literally I haven\u2019t started my essays, asked for recs, got my fafsa done, or started ANY surveys. I\u2019m so behind it\u2019s not even funny. I only have 2 months left before my deadlines come, and I\u2019m just not in the best shape! I feel like I don\u2019t even want to start and just keep procrastinating, but I know that\u2019ll make it all 10x worst. I got to get my shit together",

I end up not liking a lot of my ideas and end up ignoring them entirely instead of writing these ideas and giving these ideas more time to get better. It helps to write any ideas, even if you think they\u2019re not good, down on paper, and eventually, one of them will turn into something great. Best of luck with the application process!",
