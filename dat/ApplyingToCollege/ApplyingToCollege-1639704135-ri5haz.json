  "text": "I got into Stanford REA yesterday and now some of my friends and classmates asked me to start a online blog of sorts where I could post and talk about essays that got me in. I was down with the idea until around half an hour ago one of my other friends sent me this\u00a0 [article](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2012-jan-29-la-me-plagiarism-20120129-story.html) from a decade ago that says that\n>Stanford will test Turnitin on the 7% or so of its 36,000 applicants who make it past other hurdles to be offered admissions, Shaw said. If plagiarism is detected, students will be allowed to respond but probably will face revocation. \n\nSo now I'm wondering if I post my essays and start a blog with them so soon after being accepted will my essays will be flagged by Stanford for plagiarism because of me posting them online and have my admissions revoked? \n\nDoes anyone know if this article is accurate, and Stanford actually scans essays after being accepted? And if they do would they care of it comes back to my own blog/website? \n\nAny info or advice is appreciated.",
