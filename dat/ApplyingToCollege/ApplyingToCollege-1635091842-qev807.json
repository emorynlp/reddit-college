  "title:": "Three MAJOR questions for before Nov. 1st ED/EA deadlines",
  "text": "Hi Reddit! Just three questions as a senior about the common app:\n\n1. I was able to get into a finance program for a certain bank, but the problem is that it starts Nov. 1st, so I am not active in it before my ED/EAs are due. Should I put the acceptance down as an honor, or can it go in as an activity and say that it hasn't started? If so, what do I put for the hours/weeks devoted?\n2. I have taken 5 APs before being a senior, the scores being 5, 4, 4, 3, 3 respectively for AP World, AP Bio, AP Lang, AP Psych, and AP Calc AB. Should I report the 3's? Will it be looked at negatively by schools like UVA, UMich, or other similar caliber schools? The other problem is that I got the college board AP award with distinction thing, so if I don't report, they will still know I got 3s. Should I put that honor down?\n3. Lastly, I am taking 5 APs as a senior but it might have been a bit too much. I have A's and mid to high B's in all the APs except for BC Calc, which is literally sitting at a borderline F to D. Assuming this stays the grade until Mid-year or even end of the year reports, is this grade for one class a factor for a rejection or a rescinded acceptance? Especially for the aforementioned schools like UVA, UMich, UMD, or private schools like Emory?\n\nThanks very much in advance!",

      "text": "1. I'd put it in the activity section, adding planned start date somewhere. (It is not an honor.)\n2. You can use the AP award in honors, that's fine. Put the 3s, don't put the 3s, it isn't going to make a difference in your admission decision. See the wiki at the top of the subreddit for a section on AP scores.\n3. D or F can be a problem on the mid year report. Try to get it up to at least a C, minimum (ideally B). Get help after school, make sure your teacher knows you are trying(!), get a tutor, whatever. D or F can definitely be cause for rejection. Whether a D is cause for rescinding depends on the school. F can be a cause for rescinding.",

          "text": "Thanks! My school also has a feature where the class still appears on the transcript but the grade in that class can be voided, so basically I am still in the class but nothing I do for a grade matters because there would just be no grade that appears on it. How would college AOs view my transcript if I were to do this?",
