      "text": "There's nothing wrong with that but those are going to be common choices. The point of a question like this is to see if you have a compelling reason for picking Cornell Engineering over MIT or another comparable school. If the words you pick could just as well describe another engineering school, this question won't hurt you but it probably won't help either.",
