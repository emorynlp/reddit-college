  "text": "my school gives out formal recommendation letters that are to put it lightly, really bad. It's the same three lines that are used again and again. when I first asked for a recommendation letter from my class teacher, she said that we have to get it from the school office and that she can't write one for me. I have got three recommendation letters: 2 from teachers and 1 from the principal but they're not the kind that I've seen online and stuff.\n\nI'm worried now, can anyone help me out?  \n\nI'm an international student btw",
