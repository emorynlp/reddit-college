It's unusual to have it happen on the day OF the deadline, but I don't it's somehow \"meaner\" when it happens then.  In fact, isn't in refundable until after May 1?  A student hearing ON the deadline might be able to request a refund.\n\nIf students feel like a waitlist notification could potentially introduce a cruel degree of \"what if\" or uncertainty into their decision, then they should politely tell every school who offers them a place on the waitlist that they don't want to be on it.  That's a valid choice!\n\nBut if you accept a place on the waitlist, it means you understand that you may hear you got a spot after May 1 -- or even on May 1 itself.  And yes, then you could be in the position of forfeiting that first deposit you sent elsewhere.",
