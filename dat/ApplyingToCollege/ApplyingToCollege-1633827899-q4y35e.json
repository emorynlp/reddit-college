  "text": "I have 3/4 of my LOR and I\u2019m basically ready to start applying, besides from essay. My last teacher is the sweetest man ever but he hasn\u2019t given me my letter yet. Is it okay to send a text over our school platform, or should I just go in person and gently remind? \n\n\u201cHey mr\u2026. I was wondering about how much longer it may be until you can submit my LOR. Again, thanks for writing me one!\u201d",
