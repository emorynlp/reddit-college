  "text": "I am in my senior year and my gpa dropped to around a 90(probably will stay around 89-91 overall first semester) from 95 unweighted that I kept consistent over the last three years of high school. However, I am taking 5 ap classes for some reason my senior year. I took 1 my freshmen year. 3 my sophomore and junior year. \nI just found out that Northeastern asks for a mid-year report if you are deferred to regular decision from early action. Is early action worth this risk? Does Northeastern ask for mid-year report anyway if you do regular decision?",

      "text": "Hope you're doing well, OP!  Most schools end up receiving your first semester grades even if you apply RD, so in my opinion, since you really like this school, it's better to apply EA to find out your decision earlier and possibly get in earlier, and if deferred, you have a chance to submit a Letter of Continued Interest to let the AO know that you'd really wanna go!\n\nGood luck, and I hope it works out for you.\n\nHave a nice day!",
