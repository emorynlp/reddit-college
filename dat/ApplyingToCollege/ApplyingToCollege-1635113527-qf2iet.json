  "text": "For the Stem Preparation section, MIT asks for the year (grade from 9th to 12th) that you took certain classes with a dropdown menu from which you can select one grade. I took Regents Physics last year (11th) and I\u2019m taking AP Physics C: Mechanics this year (12th). I took Regents Biology in 8th grade and took College/Dual Enrollment Biology last year (11th). What should I select for the years since I am only able to select one year?",
