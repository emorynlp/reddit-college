  "text": "Hello everyone, I\u2019m a junior in high school right now and was looking for some advice at what I could do between now and the end of the year to improve my odds at getting accepted to a top 20 college. I have a 4.3 weighted gpa and a 3.8 unweighted one, I have a 1320 sat currently which I took without studying, and am confident I can get above a 1450 in due time. I\u2019m on varsity soccer and swim, founder and president of physics club, and am also in a few other clubs. I volunteer weekly at the hospital and have 2 medical journals published with my name. What can I do and what colleges should I aim for with this stats. Thank you all and good luck!!",
