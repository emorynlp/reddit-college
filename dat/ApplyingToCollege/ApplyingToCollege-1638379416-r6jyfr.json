  "text": "So yesterday I was hyped because I received an email from Macalester College saying an admission decision for my Early Action app was made and posted in my portal. My first reaction was \u201cbruh for real? It hasn\u2019t been a month!\u201d nevertheless I was still hyped af. I login to my portal, click on the \u201cstatus update\u201d and first thing I see is a beautiful letter telling me they are moving me to Regular Decision because my application was incomplete (the fucking DET score). \n\nYea ik im defo a dumbass because I didn\u2019t check before that they didn\u2019t receive the scores. The experience was nice tho, 9/10",
