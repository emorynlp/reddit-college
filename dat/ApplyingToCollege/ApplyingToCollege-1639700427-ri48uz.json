  "text": "My registrars office accidentally submitted all my test scores to my schools instead of just my ACT which I wanted. I was wondering what I should do. I got a 34 ACT 36 reading and science 35 math and 30 English and my two SATs were 1490 and 1480 with 760 math and 730 and 720 English respectively. I also got a 800 and 780 on my two math 2 subject tests. I want to get into a T20 and I\u2019m very concerned about what to do.",
