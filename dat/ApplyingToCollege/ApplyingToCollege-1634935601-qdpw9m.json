  "title:": "Help me select one from UIUC, Purdue, U of WM",
  "text": "VERY VERY general question but imma just ask it. i am applying to industrial / systems engineering major and i need to select 1 (or maybe 2) from UIUC, Purdue or Wisconsin, Madison because 10 days till EA deadlines and i don't think ill have enough time to apply to all three and write those essays. I really want to apply to them EA because I already have lots of schools for RD and I don't think I will be able to finish them in time. Some important things to consider: i really prefer unis in cities and urban areas. and dorm & food quality are important. I have 3.9 unweighted gpa and 1530 SAT. (btw I already have 12 schools in my list including safeties, targets, reaches but I am just not sure about these 3 schools). Also I'm international but don't need aid. Thank you and you can pm me for any questions!! ",

      "text": "Depends on which one is your instate school. UIUC is most likely going to be the (slightly) better school for design, but is it truly 25k per year better than Purdue? Madison is similarly priced. I'd go for Purdue in your situation, speaking as someone trying his ass off to get into UIUC mechE (instate).",

      "text": "Purdue has an easier application -- a few short essays. I'm a current student in biomedical engineering, and I applied the night of the deadline with some quick paragraphs. Don't bother with the honors college; it's hard as shit and not worth it imo. You can probably apply to two schools. UIUC was a close second for me, and I applied late and still got in. Both schools have an amazing engineering program, but keep in mind that Purdue will put you in \"First Year Engineering\" and you don't get into your official engineering major until your sophomore year.",
