      "text": "Hey, so I had emailed Duke asking for a CSS Profile fee waiver. They got back to me and said eligibility for a fee waiver can be determined only after I submit the application. Assuming you have done that, (since I see you are applying ED) they would ask you for your name, financial aid id and date of submission of application. As for the email that I had sent, I mainly stated my demographics, said how I loved Duke for its academics and diversity, and that the CSS Profile fee is a financial strain for my family, so whether it would be possible to provide me with a fee waiver. Hope that helps!",

But logically, yes, they will probably check the eligibility as soon as you submit your application (assuming you have already emailed them and they contacted you). If that's 1st November, then probably. Hope that helps!",
