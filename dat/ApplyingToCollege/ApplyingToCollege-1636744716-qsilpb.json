      "text": "There are lots - don't take the below as a comprehensive list at all, just some that came to mind.\n\nOlin and Harvey Mudd are great on the selective end. Cooper Union has a good engineering program. Caltech of course too.\n\nRose Hulman is really good for engineering and not as selective admissions wise. MSOE is decent and even less selective.\n\nSwarthmore is a good one if you want a LAC that also offers an accredited engineering program. Lots of LACs are good for physics too - Reed, Carleton, Haverford, etc.\n\nPlenty of good mid-size options.  Those include engineering focused schools like RPI, WPI, and Colorado School of Mines, as well as more broad based research schools like U of Rochester.",

              "text": "There a lot of really selective mid-size options in urban areas that are good. CWRU, Rice, Carnegie Mellon, Johns Hopkins, MIT, U Chicago, etc.  It really just depends on how big starts feeling too big for you.\n\nFor smaller schools I think Reed is probably the closest - it's not in the densest part of Portland, but it's only ten minutes or so from downtown by car.  Mines, Haverford, and Swarthmore are also close to cities if you want easy access, but it's different from being really in the city if that's what you prefer. \n\nIllinois Tech would be a possibility too as a less selective option.",
