  "text": "My semester doesnt end for another 2 weeks but I accidentally put the grades I have now. SDSU sent me an email saying that if they drop below what I submitted them as, my application will be rescinded. Do other CSUs care? I logged into the other school's portals but I dont see an update application button.",
