  "text": "So, I just had my first semester finals of senior year and got Fs in AP Calc and Physics. Basically, my chances of going to a 4 year were average and now they are dead. I have plenty of actual job experiences such as house framing and internships with GCs and architects but meh academics. I was already mediocre for most schools and this isn't making me feel any better.\n\nTo add on, I wouldn't say paying for college is hard, but merely not a light discussion with the parents. They insist on a straight 4-year cause \"I'm too smart\" for a CC and that money isn't a problem. My concern is that I would be relegated to a mediocre 4-year school and not getting the most out of it.\n\nI was planning to take calc and physics again with some general ed to save costs and take it more seriously. I figured instead of paying thousands for Calc 1, it would be better as it's not a core class to my major.\n\nI don't mind either but I keep hearing that I would be missing out on key classes and that it's hard to switch as an engineering major.\n\nFinal question is: How do I justify to my Asian parents that a CC plus transfer is equal to a straight shot at a big 4 year?",

      "text": ">I would be relegated to a mediocre 4-year school and not getting the most out of it.\n\nYou just got Fs in the most important high school classes for engineering. Realize that even at a \"mediocre\" school, engineering will throw more at you than you are currently prepared to handle. That's ok, you can rise to the occasion if given the opportunity, but you may be underestimating what is involved in studying engineering.\n\nThat said, I'm not sure there's anything wrong with going to CC first, as long as you are realistic that (1) you might not get accepted to much more selective schools as a transfer and (2) it might take longer to graduate.\n\nIntuitively, a \"mediocre\" engineering program may be just what you need, considering that you are smart according to your parents but have a sketchy high school academic record. If you can find an engineering program that would accept you in spite of the Fs, it's not a bad plan at all.",

          "text": "I should have said that these are my first grades ever lower than a B+ and that I have had a rough half-year after coming back from 2 years online ( add family problems too but I'm not concerned about that). An in addition that these classes were completely new with new teachers. Not saying it's not my fault but there are other factors involved. \n\nAlso, what do you mean by transferring I can't get into selective schools?",

              "text": "Whether a school will take into account your high school grades for transfer admission will depend on the school and how far into CC you are when you apply to transfer.\n\nJust a guess, but if you attend CC first and successfully transfer to a selective school for engineering, I would anticipate a 5th year of college just to fit in all the requirements. It might not be a much less expensive route.",
