      "text": "Hey! If you're applying to ivies, you can just search for \"application fee waiver xyz uni\" and there's usually a page for it with a form. The form is pretty easy (I know about Harvard & Columbia), and the waiver is pretty much approved in a few hours/one day at max. Other than that, a lot of colleges and unis give fee waivers if you apply early to them, for those, I'd rather subscribe to the email lists and attend virtual info sessions. Stay in touch with the admissions officers too, and email the unis, don't hesitate, YOU'RE APPLYING TO THEM, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND, you should ask questions. Good luck!",
