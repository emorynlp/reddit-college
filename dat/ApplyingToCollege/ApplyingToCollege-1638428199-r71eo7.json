  "title:": "since uc berkeley is adding a new aerospace engineering major in fall 2022, will it be a more or lesser competitive major for first year students applying this cycle because it's a new major?",
  "text": "[https://www.dailycal.org/2021/10/12/uc-berkeley-to-establish-aerospace-engineering-major-for-fall-2022/](https://www.dailycal.org/2021/10/12/uc-berkeley-to-establish-aerospace-engineering-major-for-fall-2022/)\n\ni recently applied to uc berkeley with the aerospace engineering major, with no alternates bc uc berkeley doesn't do alternate majors.\n\ni'm curious as to if it will be more or less competitive to get accepted directly to aero since it is a new major at berkeley. i was hoping that it means it's less competitive since it's new, and maybe it's less likely that incoming students would choose it.. but i'm not sure, bc it could be the other way around- berkeley has amazing access to  resources and internships for ppl interested in aero, given that it's in the bay area...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: i read in the article they're planning on accepting 40 freshman to this major in fall 2022, so maybe i answered my own question. that sounds pretty competitive... i think?",

      "text": "Hey ok I go to cal right now and basically from my understanding you made the right choice if you are interested in aero. For every other major, Cal accepts people into undergrad COLLEGES, as opposed to major. For example, if you apply as an English major, you are not accepted into the English major itself, but rather into the college of letters and sciences. Similarly, if you apply to electrical engineering, you are not admitted into the electrical engineering major, but into the college of engineering. Each college has a different acceptance rate, technically, with L&S being the easiest (as far as I know). \n\nThe new aero program differs in that it is the only major (or one of the only majors) that will admit directly into the major itself because you're required to be in the major for 4 years. This make me think that  more space will be available to admit students like you into aerospace because cal students who are already here won't be allowed to apply into it. ... so because of that I would say the acceptance rate for aerospace would be higher. ???",
