  "title:": "My mom actually listened to everything I said about Colleges!",
  "text": "I an am international student who just got accepted to a great college through ED and with great aid this month. I couldn't be happier!\n\nSo we went down to my hometown this weekend to check on the extended family. While we were all united and talking about the future, my mom announced to the whole room that I was going to NY for college and that I received a great scholarship. Everyone was happy to hear the news and congratulated me for it. However this one uncle was like : \"I know these kids who go to the US, they never come back home. They turn their backs on their country\" And RIGHT AWAY, my mom strikes back with arguments about why I chose to study abroad, why I chose to go to the US but not France or Germany, why I chose this specific school, and how it is not my fault that I am seeking education outside of the country.\n\nMy mom literally summarized what I have been saying to her for the past 6 months (Thinking that she barely listened to me) and crushed my stupid uncle. I could see the pride in her eyes, even though she didn't want me to go in the first place.\n\nThat made my weekend, my boring weekend filled with very religious and conservative relatives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: OMG, I didn't expect this much love, upvotes, and any awards! I hope you guys get all you want and good luck for the rest!",
