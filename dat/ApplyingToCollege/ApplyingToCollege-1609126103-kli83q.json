  "text": "You were crossing the street around 6 PM when a drunk driver ran you through. Didn\u2019t even stop. I\u2019d like to think that it was painless, that you didn\u2019t suffer, but that\u2019s probably just me trying to cope. *Ford F-150s are probably pretty painful at 45 miles per hour.* \n\nA2C, my friend died a few hours ago.  \n\nI was telling Georgetown about my special talents when I got the call. My pen spinning tricks didn\u2019t feel so important anymore. People aren\u2019t supposed to cry when you ask them what\u2019s up. \n\nBut then again, you weren\u2019t supposed to die at eighteen, either, were you?\n\nI remember sitting next to you on the bus on our way to the first day of first grade. We thought we were cool because we weren\u2019t wearing those shitty two-point seatbelts. Your mom had made you get a haircut the day and you didn\u2019t like it. \n\nI remember playing basketball on the hoop in your driveway, your dad bringing us bottles of water with a smile after you buried the game-winning shot over me. \n\nI remember celebrating with you after you made varsity. \n\nI remember when you got into your dream school ED. You had all the shirts and hats and posters in your room. You facetimed me while you were joining all the giddy groupchats filled with future classmates that all had *[college] \u201825* in their Instagram bios and smiling profile pics. But what\u2019s the point of all these shiny, earthly things when...\n\nfuck. \n\nI\u2019ll never get to make faces at you from across the locker room while coach is trying to get us to focus on the new offense he wants to implement for tomorrow\u2019s game. \n \nI\u2019ll never get to shoulder-bump you after you score.  \n\nI\u2019ll never get to pass you when we\u2019re both waking our dogs at midnight because we were up late studying for that god-awful electrochem test that we both ended up getting Bs on even though we thought our Quizlet had everything. \n\nfuck. \n\nAnd my feelings are probably nothing compared to your family\u2019s. *Fuck,* your family...\n\nYour older brother who taught you how to play chess is probably flying back from college right now, and your younger sister who ran to you when she was scared won\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong until tomorrow morning. Your dog is probably just confused why you hasn\u2019t come yet. \n\n*She doesn\u2019t get that you never will.* \n\nI can\u2019t even begin to imagine how your parents feel. They thought they were saying goodbye for the afternoon, but they didn\u2019t know they were saying goodbye forever. \n\nThey didn\u2019t know that you wouldn\u2019t graduate high school. \n\nThey didn\u2019t know that they\u2019d never make you another dinner again. \n\n*I wonder what the last thing you ate was?*\n\nfuck. \n\nThere\u2019s a certain cosmic irony for me in this sub. As we\u2019re all panicking about our essays and last-minute apps, we miss the forest for the trees. Hug your parents. Take deep breaths. Tell your friends what they mean to you. \n\nI wish I could\u2019ve told you before it was too late. \n\n**College bros, can y\u2019all please promise me that you won\u2019t joke about wanting to die?**\n\nEverything is ephemeral and nothing is real. \n\nNone of us realize how good we\u2019ve got it.",

Nothing is more scary than the unknown. I sat in the PICU for hours with my parents scream crying outside the door while I was finally being hit with how fucking final it was. Id never hug my dog again, call my friends, play video games, read, cry, feel. For anyone depressed or suicidal reading this, your parents will miss you. People will miss you and you are loved. \n\nOP, I\u2019m sorry for your loss. Nothing I say will make it any remotely better but stay strong",

          "text": "I mean it\u2019s hard for the mind to imagine death, to imagine nothingness, no thought. We recoil at the idea of it because we can\u2019t perceive it, we can\u2019t perceive life without life. Like have you ever seen Ben 10 or the Flash where there is some higher dimensional entity that our brains can\u2019t process so they take some familiar form, like how Barry sees the speed force as his mom? Death is kinda like that. We can\u2019t even really perceive it, so we joke about it, we make light of it, we shape it into something we can hope to understand, when we never will, because when we do die we won\u2019t be ourselves, because we won\u2019t exist, we won\u2019t be. Even if you believe in an afterlife or something of the sort, we can never be sure until we jump into the abyss, so there\u2019s still that mystery to it. That\u2019s my guess for why we joke about it. Just my view of it tho, life advice, don\u2019t just blindly listen to some kid on reddit.\n\nEdit: I really hope this doesn\u2019t come off as rude or inappropriate in anyway, I just meant to give my view on why people joke about death. This naturally is a pretty touchy subject (and to be honest I\u2019m typing this really late and am not the most coherent currently) so if this comes off as inappropriate just comment and I\u2019ll delete. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, I hope things get better.",

          "text": "I used to think about what death would be like all the time. What it would be like, if this whatever of a soul was gone, and whether it would just be an emptiness. I would wonder, if my consciousness could be stored into data, would my soul really exist, or will just another me, live on in my own body.   \n\n\nI think we make jokes about death because its a way to cope. Humor is a way we face tough topics, in a manner that makes it more lighthearted, or as a way to cope. Comedians make jokes out of their disabilities, or personal issues. Whether it was parental abuse or losing their legs, its a way to keep going, even when things are tough. Making something more commonly joked about (like 9/11, or the holocaust) can be seen as very inconsiderate (it is at times), but often the more lighthearted comments (\"bro this homework is killing me\", \"I'm going to commit neck rope/toaster bath\") are just something we do.   \n\n\nAnyhow, that fucking sucks OP. Fuck it hits hard, and I can't even imagine what it would be like for parents to feel. Seeing their dreams and loved ones disappearing. Fuck. Maybe we can start a gofundme or something. Idk. But I sent my respect and regards to the afflicted family.",

I lost my best friend to a drunk driver when we were 8 so I know how it feels.\n\nThe way you describe your friend just begins to show what an impact they had made on you. Please stay strong and if you need to talk or rant or simply just need a new person to text, my DMs are open always.\n\nKnow that you are truly wonderful and so was your friend. From the way you described them, I am 1000% positive they loved you as well. Thank you for the reminder too. I've been holed up in my room working on so many things, that I forget time doesn't simply stop when I'm by myself doing work. My parents get older, my siblings grow up with little memories with their sister. It's heartbreaking to realize that like you said \"none of us realize how good we've got it.\"\n\nIt's at times like this you wish people would simply drink responsibly and not drive, or simply just don't drink. Humans don't learn until they have to learn.\n\nMake sure you take deep breaths as well mate. I know you need to be alone to grieve, but be with your family, and your friends family too. You got this. You seem strong. I believe in you.\n\nWish you luck today and forever. Stay safe.",

You might become depressed to the point of suicide thinking you have know where to turn or anybody to turn too, turn to this sub, turn to anybody you can find online because believe me when I say there is a silver lining and no matter how badly you fuck up in school or in life suicide is not a option you should have.\n\nSadly OP's friend passed and may they rest in peace, stay safe as best you can, watch what you eat or drink, who you hang around with, and where you go. Wanting it or not death can be in the corner of your eye and you can happily walk into it without ever even wanting to. Yall are young and have potential to educate people to bring a good and proper change, find a calling that helps others. Don't give up that chance. Don't believe your figurative legs are broken and that you can't have them mended and climb again. Find the silver base line and see what you can work with. Just dont die, don't give up.",

Of course, dwelling on the ever-present possibility of death and not focussing on your immediate future doesn't do well, but I'm sure that's not really what you meant. You should always live as if it would be your last moment, but this is more of a nice thought than reality. \n\nThe fewest of us say goodbye without believing we will return to say Hello again.\n\nLive your life for your friend as well. As he can't go to college, take him with you in your heart. Because that is, ultimately, how he will be immortal. He'll live on in your memory and in everyone else's who loved him. \n\nTake time to grieve. And of course, feel free to DM any of us if you want to talk.",

I wish this horrible experience upon nobody. We all wish we could \u201cdie\u201d when facing the stress of college but what we really want is detachment from reality for a while. That\u2019s the kind of repose that everyone on here, myself included, would love to have for a bit. \n\nOP, I may never meet you again in my life and this may be the only time we ever interact, but I can only tell you that I am glad to see that others share my same philosophy to appreciate what is held most closely to one\u2019s heart. I\u2019ve spent a good deal of time thinking about just how much I love appreciate my family and friends, and I hope you will continue to do the same.\n\n**l know your friend will be very proud of you.**",

We fear so many things on this earth but most of those things are *known*. Death is the end. We don't know what happens next. Do we enter another dimension? Be reborn? Just stop existing? I'm semi-religious but I still cannot wrap my head around the finality of death. \n\nSo instead of saying \"Ugh this test is gonna make me jump off a cliff\", I'll say \"Ugh this test is gonna make me scream/cry/hurl\". Just a synonym beyond death because as much as Gen Z jokes about death, I think that we only do so because that's how we cope. Very few of us truly want to die, but we don't have other coping factors like religion so we try to normalize death as much as possible.  Its really not a thing to joke about though. So let's cut down on it please?",
