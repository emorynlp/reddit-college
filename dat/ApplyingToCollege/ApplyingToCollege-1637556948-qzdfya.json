  "text": "Hello fellow stressed students :) Until now I've taken pretty hard high school classes, like APs and whatnot, so my gpa is cool and good but I don't have a lot of free time. I'm an aspiring musician and this year and last year I've basically had no time at all to write songs. I've pretty much decided that I want to go to music college now so what do you guys think I should do?\n\n1. keep taking hard classes at the expense of my free time\n2. take really easy classes (I only need to take 3 more courses to graduate anyways) and pour all of my time into music, writing songs, getting gigs, doing music competitions, ect. ect.\n\nWhich one of these would be more appealing to a music college? A student with hard classes but not a lot of ECs or someone with easier/less classes and many ECs? Idk how much my school subjects even matter if I become a music major because it's not like my chemistry grade or whatever will ever be relevant to what I'm studying. Does going into an artistic field like that make your classes less important? What should I focus on?? someone help lol ty besties",

      "text": "Look at schools with music programs that you like and see what their requirements are. The answer is a lot different depending on if you want to go to a school like Juilliard (do your music!) vs UC Berkeley (prob harder without rigor unless you have competitions/awards to showcase that you were not slacking off). Some schools also accept portfolios or supplements for some creative majors (UCLA Herb Albert School of Music, for example \u2014 make sure to meet UC entry requirements), so that could balance out a less rigorous looking senior schedule. Taking some hard classes (but not too many) might help you keep your options open.",
