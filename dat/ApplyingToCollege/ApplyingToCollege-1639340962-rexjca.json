I had a couple of quick questions building off your previous posts:\n\n1. So, you would say that the most vital aspect to your acceptance was your personality and ECs, right? I know it varies from person to person, but for you, that\u2019s what it seemed. Do you feel that your supplements and essays demonstrated your personality or was it mainly your interview? \n2. What would you say was the strongest part of your app (that you felt most confident with)? For me, I feel really comfortable with my GPA and SAT score, ECs as well. \n3. I know I can find this info online and stuff but did you show any specific passion for a major that you think boosted your admissions chances? \n\nIk these are some repetitive basic questions but thanks a lot!",

          "text": "1. I'd say my acceptance actually wasn't very contingent on my EC's because it was what I was rated the lowest in... My AO did mention, though, that my volunteer work was impressive and it seemed like they cared a lot more about that then the recycling program that I started at my school which I honestly thought would hold more weight. Personality wise, I absolutely think that's the main reason I got in. My interviewer wrote about 3-4 pages about me, highly vouching for my \"maturity\" and told them that our conversation was wonderful and rich. Both AOs said they could really see my personality shine through my essays, as well, in fact it was the majority of what they commented on in my application. \n\n2) Probably my essays, interview, and teacher recs... My grades were certainly enough to consider me for admission, but so are 70-80% of applicants grades. Although, my admission officer did specifically make note in my application that I was val of my school and held all A's and he noted my AP scores as well (5x 5's and 1x 3) which I thought was interesting.   \n\n3) Hmm... I don't believe so. I had friends here who did actually have this noted in their file (niche interests). But actually something interesting about our file is that our intended majors aren't even listed, it only lists the department of the major you listed first (for me, it was Social Sciences for Economics). Harvard is really the only school I applied to that didn't seem to care much about my major and it actually makes sense given that you can change your major here pretty much up until your Senior fall!",

I actually have another post here where I detailed a little bit more about what they wrote in my file...\n\nBut what I got most importantly out of it is, everything in your application truly matters and can help make up for other things. For example, my EC's were a bit weak (compared to the normal pool that has a lot of national/state level extracurriculars) but the quality of my teacher recommendations, essays, and interview really helped make up for that.",

          "text": "So I actually disagree with this. I think it *depends* on your file. Both of my AOs in my application comments said that they wanted to see an alumni interview to help \u201cguide discussions\u201d, basically to make a final decision on my file. I think if you\u2019re a shoe in applicant by the committee, then it probably wouldn\u2019t matter as much (as in, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily hurt your file if you had a bad/mediocre interview). However, I think it also can heavily help you. My interviewer rated me a 1- in personality and a 2+ overall as an applicant (notably, a full point higher than what both admission officers rated me, so it could\u2019ve given some additional context to my file). He said I was a \u201cdiamond in the rough\u201d and I feel like it really helped my file to the point where I think if the interview report wasn\u2019t as good, then I might have been rejected. \n\nAlthough, don\u2019t let that scare you because one of my friends had a bad interview where her interviewer completely destroyed her and wrote a lot of bad things about her so then her admission officer ended up interviewing her to kind of get his own feel.\n\nI don\u2019t really know why people say the interview isn\u2019t important, I really think it can be the tipping point that gets you in as I feel like it was with me personally. I mean, it\u2019s the only organic and least formulaic part of your application aside from your teacher recommendations.",

At least from what he said and the feel of the interview, it went about as well as it could have. So I've been hoping that it gives me enough of a boost. \n\nOh no, now I'm getting optimistic. Time to head back to ivy rejection simulator for the next 3 hours, lol.\n\nThank you so much for the reply.",
