  "text": "Okay, so, i'll try and make this as simple as possible. \n\nI'm 16 and i want to study journalism in any college in the usa actually, but the thing is that i'm not american, i have never been to the usa and even though i know some english i think it's not enough. \n\nBut that's not the worst part, in my country i'm around middle class but switching to dollars i'm like low low LOW class, so there's no way i can afford thousands of dollars in just a semester in harvard or any other ivy league school and the other thing is that i am completely and absolutely clueless about how the school system works and about all of that sat and stuff, how to apply, costs and housing, course selection(?) and it's just so overwhelming.\n\nAnd to make things just better, i'm trans so i am also looking for a trans-friendly school with good insurance, and finding universities that cover hormones and other trans stuff for international students it's kinda rare or at least not easy to find.\n\nSo basically i'm asking for suggestions of universities that are affordable or that have good schoolarships, open to international students and trans-friendly, PLUS any tips and explanations for beginners because i think time is gonna pass me by and i still don't understand a thing about american school system, i would be absolutely and forever grateful to whoever has the patience to explain me this because honestly i'm really dumb lol.\n\nAnd if you have any other tip/suggestion that you think may work for me, i'm all ears.\n\nP.s. i'm so sorry if there's any mistake or if you can't understand something, english is not my first language, so feel free to correct me or let me know if there's something wrong. \n\nThank youuuu.",

      "text": "Good news is that if you\u2019re low-income, there are plenty of schools like Harvard, Yale, etc that are need blind for internationals that will give you a full ride if your family makes <65,000 a year. Bad news, all these schools are highly highly selective and will be even harder for you considering you\u2019re international. Good news, institutions of higher education in the US pretty much all have progressive student bodies, especially the Top 20s, so you will certainly find support for your gender identity if you do get in. I\u2019m still a high school senior in the process of this whole admissions thing but if you have any questions feel free to dm!",
