  "title:": "How does having small class size and multiple valedictorians effect their significance in college admissions.",
  "text": "My class size is tiny, 133, and I am ranked #1, but there are also like 10 others who are also #1. This is because my school does not do any weighting for GPA and doesn't do + or - on grades either, the letter grade is all that is on the transcript. Because of these things I feel that even though my school is quite competitive and certainly the best school in my area, the previously mentioned stats don't really mean that much when it comes to admissions. Is this worry warranted?",
