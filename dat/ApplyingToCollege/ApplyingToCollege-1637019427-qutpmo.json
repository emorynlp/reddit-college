  "title:": "I failed a junior college dance class. Can I still get in to UC Davis??",
  "text": "Last spring, I, as a high school student, took a dance course at my local junior college. I got an F in the class because it was online and I didn't do my work... I then retook it over the summer and passed. While the F no longer affects my junior college GPA, it still appears on my transcript and it does not appear that there's anything possible I can do to remove it from the transcript altogether. Even though I retook it for full credit, how will this affect, if at all, my UC admission decisions? I'm a senior in HS now and already applied to UCs. My dream school is UC Davis so I'm really worried that this could cause problems. Do they even look at JC transcripts? If they do, will they care that I failed since I retook it? Please help!!!",

      "text": "My understanding (which is very basic) is that for a grade of F, the course would not provide A-G credit (say, if you were using it for fine art, not that I know if that's possible). I guess the next question is whether it would ordinarily be an A-G course and thus affect GPA.",
