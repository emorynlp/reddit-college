  "title:": "Good GPA, Extracurriculars but terrible PSAT",
  "text": "I\u2019m a junior (16) at an IB school looking to attend a quality institution in hopes of getting a double major in Poli. Sci. and some STEAM. Currently finishing Sem. 1 my GPA is 4.3448. I participate in varsity sports as well as giving community service. I like to think I\u2019m very well rounded and have a strong, respectable character. Unfortunately, I lack the expertise in doing well on standardized testing, recently I got my PSAT score back. I got a 1040. I did better in Reading and Writing but pretty average in Math. \n\nHow crucial is it to have a good SAT/ACT score? And how can I compensate for this? Is it possible I still get in a good school like Berkeley if I manage to maintain my current figures? \n\nSorry if this comes off as bragging, I genuinely just want to know whether or not I need to improve.\n\nThanks",
