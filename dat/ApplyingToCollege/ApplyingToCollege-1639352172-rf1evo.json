      "text": "Don't simply search up a rate. Pay attention to where you are getting the rate (for the love of pete, please do not use what \"google\" says - use links from the school website, if at all possible) and pay attention to exactly what the rate represents - which class year and whether it is overall vs EA/ED, etc.\n\nMost selective colleges have not had increases in acceptance rates recently, though of course there are exceptions. For class of 2025 (current freshmen), rates were down virtually everywhere.\n\nFall 2020 data is for class of 2024. This includes data from the 2020-21 Common Data Set and [https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/](https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/).\n\nIs there a particular school you are concerned with?",
