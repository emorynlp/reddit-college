  "title:": "Should I retake the ACT or just submit my current scores? (pls help)",
  "text": "I just got back my ACT score and it's a composite 30; got a 35 in English, 31 in Reading, and a 27 Math and 25 Science (screaming, crying and throwing up). I studied my ASS off and I'm really surprised about the Math and Science results.\n\nThe next int test date is February 11th and I would be completely down to retake the test but I wanted to ask if anyone knows if it would be a good decision. I'm applying RD, and all the schools I'm applying to release decisions late March-early April. Could I submit my application in the regular RD deadline as usual, and submit my current scores and include that I will have a future sitting before decisions are released? I would make sure to update my app with the new test scores as soon as I get them, and I really do believe that hardcore Math/Science studying could significantly improve my score.\n\nI was also considering maybe taking the SAT instead, the next int test date is March 11th and I could study my ass off to get the closest I can to a 1600 and submit that instead of my current ACT score, but I really don't know what to do at this point.\n\nI am pursuing an English/Lit major in all the schools, so I would assume that not having the greatest STEM credentials would maybe not affect me as much, but I don't know if I should retake the test to improve those two scores. \n\nAside from test scores I have really strong ECs and have strong essays and GPA. My top school is currently Barnard and from what I've researched their 25th percentile is 30 and 75th percentile is 33, so I don't know if I'm worrying for nothing. \n\nP.S: I know that a 30 ACT is an overall good score the reason I\u2019m worried is that the schools I\u2019m applying to have averages of 34-36, I'm sorry if I sound obnoxious as hell.",

      "text": "A 30 over all is a great score, and because of the major your going for isn't related, I wouldn't sweet the math and sci scores to much. In my opinion, Apply with your current scores, if it isn't going to kill you, take it again but do not kill yourself studying. It's not worth it and you will regret it if you burn out. \n\nCall up the admissions department and see if you can get any more info about what they are looking for when it comes to ACT scores. Just call like you are inquiring about it for the future and don't mention your full name. You're probably fine but it could help settle your mind.",
