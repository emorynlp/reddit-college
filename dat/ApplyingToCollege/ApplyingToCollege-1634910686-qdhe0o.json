  "title:": "Applying as a transfer senior to CSUs?",
  "text": "Has anyone ever tried applying as a senior to transfer to a CSU campus? \n\nI\u2019m attending UC Berkeley as a junior transfer, and I\u2019m miserable. The attitude here is super cutthroat and competitive, it\u2019s virtually impossible to access disability services (or really any other services on campus, but I am disabled and have been waiting on accommodations since May), and I just can\u2019t seem to find a way to flourish here. In fact, I went from the best mental health of my life back to wanting to die in just two months of attending because yeah, it really is that soul-crushing. \n\nAnyway, I want to go to a CSU that\u2019s closer to home and that doesn\u2019t use its \u201celite\u201d status to treat minorities on campus like garbage. I just haven\u2019t been able to find an answer as to whether or not CSU campuses even take seniors. \n\nI never took a comm class, either, so I might not even be eligible. \n\nAnybody know? \n\nAlternatively, I might just drop out.",

      "text": "Do you have an academic counselor you can talk to? They might have connections on campus ( at Cal) to get you the resources you need. Isn\u2019t there a disabilities services office?  There has to be an advocate for you. Now, on the other hand, if you simply hate the vibe there and you\u2019re suffering- that\u2019s another story. You will likely have to take additional classes at your next university because there is a residency requirement. I would suggest contacting the disability office at SFSU and try to set things up before you transfer out of cal. At least you\u2019ll have an idea what to expect before you get there. Good luck to you.  No place is worth compromising your mental health.",

The administration at this school is useless, and without those documents my professors are awful to try and work with. And there are plenty of high-ranking universities where people don\u2019t actively try to trip up the students around them. It\u2019s hard to build community when absolutely everything (including pretty much every extracurricular activity) is treated like a competition.",
