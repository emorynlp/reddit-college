  "text": "I was just thinking, let\u2019s say A and B got into Georgia Tech and Cal tech respectively. However, B wanted to go to GaTech but got rejected and A vice versa. \n\nSo they enter a college swap to see if anyone wants to go to their school and swap places. Of course, you must have the actual stats the get in but if one of the other person agrees and you could swap schools if you don\u2019t favor the one you got into, how would that work in real life?\n\nPs. This is just a stupid thought that came into my mind like 3 mins ago.",

Then I can just swap all the others. Further instead of actually swapping with other kids, I could just sell my spot to some uber rich kids and make a fortune and get some CC spot in return while at the end of the day still going to my favorite college. \n\nSo pretty much this system would be very skewed towards the rich.\n\nI do know this is a joke.",
