      "text": "not a professional on writing college essays, but i think the approach i took worked out well:\n\nthe first thing i did was consider the most appealing aspects of each college. for my top school, i was interested in the amazing neuroscience program and the diversity on campus. \n\nthen i kinda blended those two together. why did i want to go? because being in a diverse, accepting environment would enable me to focus on my studies while being able to express myself freely. i wouldn\u2019t be hung up on whether or not people accept me, so i could really grow as a student and as a person. i said that would allow me (and it does!) to take advantage of the neuroscience program, which would help me achieve my life goals. \n\nfollowing that, i described what i could offer to the school\u2014i could contribute to the preservation of a diverse and welcoming environment on campus by joining certain clubs related to advocacy. \n\nlook into specific things about the college (opportunities, the atmosphere, its overall attitude) and pick out what you find meaningful. talk about why it\u2019s meaningful to you and follow that up with what you can do to give back.\n\nsorry for the long wall of text. hope it helps at least a little!",

      "text": "These were really hard for me too because I really had no clue what to write. Other people know better than me what constitutes a good college essay but what really helped me was just brute forcing my way through one and honestly answering the question \u201cwhy them\u201d. After that it\u2019s a lot easier to see what in your essay is good and what isn\u2019t so you\u2019ll have some tangible direction for writing.\n\nAs for researching schools; I made [this list of questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1umtiDG4PSj0C7h2wF6S0zbWr8AS5uznCABsBqcT_lIA/edit) to ask interviewers about schools and evaluate them. I think if you can fill this out for your school then you\u2019ll have more than enough content to write about.",

      "text": "The best thing that you can do, based on my experience, is do a lot of research on the institution; and, especially, look into new developments, programs, buildings, or relevant coursework within the area that you're looking into. Universities are looking for students that will make use of the school's resources, and if you can not pinpoint an area of interest and explain how you will use the school's resources to advance your goals, then you will be able to stand out compared to most. It is even better if you are able to connect your personal interests or passions with the school's offering, because it allows for a cohesive story about why the school is perfect for them.\n\nAs an example, a couple years ago, a student had a resume peppered with various business awards, and he had entrepreneurship experience running a leather bag business in his community. Incidentally, Princeton University opened up the Keller Center, a hub for entrepreneurship and innovative thinking; hence, the student was able to communicate how excited he was to make use of the center's many resources, pitch business ideas, and, overall, collaborate with like-minded peers on entrepreneurial topics. To even mention this new center would have required research, because, at the time, it wasn't super well-advertised, and so this showed the student's initiative and ambition, two traits that admission officers look for. \n\nAs another example, there was a student that was looking into Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. He wrote his essays about how he hoped to join the general department. However, we were able to research several professors, and find out about several departments that are somewhat more overlooked - the Computational Social Science lab and the AI for Business center at Wharton. Even more, he researched the professors' publications, and connected his work in high school to a professor's ongoing research.",

I described the \u201cephemeral sense of belonging\u201d I felt there. I went on to discuss how a single-sex high school made a gender-diverse women\u2019s college especially appealing. Then I described the importance of a low faculty student ratio, and finished it off by saying what circumstances stopped me from applying ED. \n\nMost essays I\u2019d imagine do not involve that much heart and soul. But that is how I honestly felt so I demonstrated that in my writing. The essay worked, and that is where I\u2019m enrolled.",
