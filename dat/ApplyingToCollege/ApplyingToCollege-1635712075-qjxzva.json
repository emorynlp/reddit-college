  "text": "Hey y\u2019all,\n\nSo i am a high school senior applying to college and need some advice. I\u2019m a pretty competitive student (5.31/6 gpa, 1520 sat, Compete nationally in powerlifting, have good ecs). \n\nI am applying to a good amount of colleges that are in the T-50 range, but the main concern is the cost. My parents make 250k but since I have 5 siblings split over two households and two mortgages that amount gets spread quite thin. \n\nMy coach can get me into a pretty small (6k) college for pretty much no cost at all to go there, which his son did\n\nI would study and train powerlifting on a premed track.\n\nSo what should I do, Undergrad at a prestigious, large school where I\u2019ll come out with 50-60k in loans, or go to a super small college with no loans at all",

      "text": "If you're going pre-med I'd advise against taking out loans for undergrad.  That said, you could probably go to a large school on the basis of your SAT score w/o paying much.  Just not T50.\n\nSide note:  you might look into the Morehead-Cain scholarship at UNC.  It has a specific athletics requirement.  Super-duper competitive, though.",
