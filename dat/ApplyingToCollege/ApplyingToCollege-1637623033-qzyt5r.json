  "text": "I interned at a professional CS company in SFO as a s/w developer. It was a full 8 weeks, 20 hours/week job. I had a mentor, daily status meetings and completed the project which is now deployed to the app. In return, I had a nice thankyou party and gift cards. Since I did not get a \"paycheck\", should this be listed as an EC or Job internship?",
