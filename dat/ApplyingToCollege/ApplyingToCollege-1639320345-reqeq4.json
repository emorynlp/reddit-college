  "text": "Hi!\n\nI am a junior applying to the MITES and MOSTEC programs and I am unsure which of my scores to submit. I plan on being a biology major, and since MITES/MOSTEC look for people who are strong in math and science, I want to submit the score that will make me look the best.\n\nWhich should I submit? \n\n**SAT**: 1430 total, 740 EBRW and **690 math**\n\n\n**PSAT**: 1370/1520 total, **740** out of 760 EBRW, **630** out of 760 **math**",
