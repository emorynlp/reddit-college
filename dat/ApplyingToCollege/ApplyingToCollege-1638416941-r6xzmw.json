  "text": "-Location/Region: anywhere in u.s., urban or suburban. lots of things to do in the city/area. i\u2019m from south florida (extremely diverse here!) so i would love a somewhat diverse school/area.   \n                                           \n-Major: I\u2019m interested in finance, marketing, and psychology. Must have great business programs / majors.  \n                                              \n-GPA/Test Scores: 3.9 UW, 4.3 W. 1080 SAT (retaking it saturday, but still plan on going test optional everywhere that allows me to) \n\n-Curriculum: rigorous, but not insanely difficult. i would like to be challenged but not to where i\u2019m constantly drowning. \n                 \n-Size: preferably medium sized (not too picky, but certainly not a super small school.) i\u2019d love to to be able to connect with my professors at some point. \n       \n-Costs: doesn\u2019t matter too much. low income so financial aid and scholarships should help. also will have some support from parent. \n\n-Schools you\u2019re currently looking at: University of Florida, University of Central Florida, University of Michigan, University of Miami, Spelman, Baylor University, Howard University, a few others. \n\n-Additional: african american. graduating high school a year early (had no junior year)\n\n- Essay, EC, LOR, ETC:  small business owner, (secretary of SGA, social media influencer/content creator w/ 650k+ followers, 100+ volunteer hours, few other clubs )\n\nessay is decent. i wrote about surviving a public mall shooting, how it affected me mentally, how i recovered/am recovering, how it changed my perspective on life. \n\nletter of recommendations should be pretty good.",
