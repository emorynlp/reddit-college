So you can only have the \u201chighest position\u201d in one club. \n\nI couldn\u2019t account for that on my application. Additionally, for a particular organization I am in, I hold roles on the local, state, and national levels, and I was not able to reflect that bc the selection was only one role per year, so it was frustrating.\n\n^^ like right now for example I have 3 positions for this one organization but I was only able to state ONE of them on my application. I\u2019m not sure how doable it would be to have the different tiers (I think it could honestly just be multi select check boxes??) but I think that would work better.",
