  "text": "i\u2019m not the type of person to say that someone deserves something but i have seen so many of my friends and even just random kids get rejected when they deserved to get in. at some point what can u even do. sports, music, fine arts, charity, straight a\u2019s, perfect scores? it doesn\u2019t even matter anymore. i understand there are so many qualified applicants that they can\u2019t take them all but why is a significant part of our future determined by a random chance lottery? how do they even differentiate anymore. the people ik are some of the kindest and most genuine and hardworking people and they\u2019re all so smart and talented and it hurts to see them all get rejected when they all worked so hard for it. what\u2019s the goal anymore. it\u2019s not even like getting a 4.0 and a 36 gets u a full ride at other good schools either. this might be the end for my a2c career bc i don\u2019t think i can work through supplements knowing a rejection is on the other end.",
