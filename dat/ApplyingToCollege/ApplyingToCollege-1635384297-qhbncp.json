  "text": "The only other section is the community-based section, which specifically says it\u2019s for internships/activities that weren\u2019t paid.\n\nI don\u2019t think I can confidently say it was an internship either, it\u2019s just a summer program I was paid for (stipend).\n\nbtw, I kind of want to put it in paid work because in the community based section, it would just become another # as the application only let\u2019s me describe 3 activities. It would literally be this:\n\nGrade 12 -> number of activities: 1 (won\u2019t even let me tell them what the activity was, it\u2019s just a number)",
