  "text": "With the pandemic happening last year, many students had remote learning (including me). Do you think that the colleges will take this into account when looking at extracurriculars? I\u2019m currently a junior and trying to make up for last year. Also does the amount of time you\u2019re in a club matter? For instance is 3 years in a club better than 2 years?",

      "text": "the pandemic is definitely going to be a factor, but don\u2019t rely on it - with things starting to open up and the large amounts of virtual organizations people have founded/joined there will definitely be competition especially since you\u2019re a junior right now. with that being said, it\u2019s okay if you didn\u2019t get as involved as you wanted to last year, just make sure you bounce back strong! also in terms of the clubs, i think your impact on the club matters more than how long you were in it",

Your high school transcript (grades + rigor of curriculum) will be the most important piece of your application.",
