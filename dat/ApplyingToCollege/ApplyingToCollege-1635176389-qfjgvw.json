      "text": "> gonna get rejected everywhere bc of yield protection\n\nA) Yield protection rarely happens and assuming that you're a case of yield protection is pretty arrogant. Especially when pretty much any school people claim \"yield protect\" also have admitted kids who ended up at places like HYPSM. If you're confident enough that you'll be yield protected everywhere, then you should also be confident enough that you'll get into your REA school anyways if you think about it lol. \n\nB) If you continue to apply for RD anyways, a reasonable assumption would be either i) you didn't get into your REA (so it doesn't matter) or ii) you got in but don't like it/don't want to go anymore (which is common; plenty of people do not end up going to their REA school). \n\nC) Applying to somewhere else does not suddenly make you much better than the school you're applying to and most top schools *know* they're competing for the same students. If you apply RD, somewhere like Duke or Cornell was probably always going to assume you applied to other peer schools. And outside of a few schools like the Ivies that have sworn off merit aid, a school that really wants you could easily try to offer you merit aid to entice you. Even schools that don't have merit aid play other games like likely letters to get you on board, and places like Columbia still have a scholarship program that just doesn't grant money (they play other games like granting you extra money in lieu of work study which doesn't break their no-merit aid agreement, and offering other perks.) Even schools like Hopkins and Vanderbilt and WUSTL offer generous merit aid so if you're outstanding enough, it's not like they don't have other mechanisms available.",
