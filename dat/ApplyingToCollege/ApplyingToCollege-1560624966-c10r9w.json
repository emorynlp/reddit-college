  "text": "the high school class of 2019 is gearing up to graduate- choosing grad schools, applying to jobs, saying goodbye to friends. they're so scared to leave, but so excited for what's coming next. on a whim born of nostalgia and emotion, they decide to check their old high school email addresses. \n\nthere's hundreds of new emails, but only from one source. \n\nthe university of kentucky extended their application deadline just *two more days*, and this exclusive offer is only for YOU. they've been extending your deadline for all four years. they never gave up on you, even when you might've given up on yourself. even without knowing it, the one constant in your life was your exclusive wildcat application, and now you've missed the chance to use it.",
