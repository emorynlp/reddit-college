  "title:": "Hey there guys! Is it okay to send my TOEFL scores through ETS to universities before I submit my application? I\u2019m asking because I\u2019m afraid it might take toefl pretty long to send the scores so I was thinking if I could send the scores first then submit the application for the universities?",
  "text": "Edit: Oh. I had another question. How do I decide which universities to officially send my scores t because some school\u2019s website do not staye whether self-reporting the grade is fine? Shall I send it to all the public schools I\u2019m applying to and just self-report for the private ones?",
