  "text": "So I just got accepted into ASU and now I have to wait about 2-3 weeks for my financial aid package. I\u2019m not experiential any need based, but I\u2019m hoping for a good merit scholarship. I have a 31 act (32 superscore) 3.8 gpa and i\u2019m like top 20%. I\u2019m only saying this just because I\u2019m not sure how much money they give in merit, if any, for out of state applicants. i\u2019m from new york btw.",
