      "text": "I\u2019m not completely sure whether I understood your question, but if you\u2019re asking on whether you can also apply for spring instead of fall, then each UC has a different system regarding this - UC Berkeley and UC Merced are on the semester system, while all other UCs are on the quarter system. UC Merced allows you to apply for Spring 2022 (freshman, sophomore transfer, junior transfer). UC Santa Cruz is open for Winter 2022 (junior transfer). Riverside is open for Winter 2022 (sophomore transfer, junior transfer). The deadline for these was July 31, 2021 - I would assume that the applications for winter/spring 2023 would be around the end of July in 2022. I hope this helps!",
