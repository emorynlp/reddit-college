It's about that what if . . .  (for the next couple of months)\n\nwhat if I didn't make that typo\n\nwhat if I didn't use the same answer twice (whoops)\n\nwhat if I would've made it\n\nI get it because I worked really hard and I wanted my app to be considered equally (and now they might think its a joke)\n\nbut at the end of the day, SEECOND SEMESTERRR SENEIOR YEARR so i feel like we'll forget within a month or two. (don't want to assume that ur a senior but I hope you manage to forget about it also and do something fun)\n\nGood luck with everything! Don't dwell. Trust me, my dumbo mistake was worse than a small typo! You're not alone",
