  "text": "Like I did well in the classes of the teachers I asked recommendations from and they liked me, but I always hear people gushing about how much they love the teacher writing their rec/how the teacher thinks they\u2018re the best student ever \n\ndo you think colleges will be placing the same amount of emphasis on rec letters as they did in previous years?  I did give them a brag sheet/wrote out stuff about myself but I feel like my teachers don\u2019t know me that well at all bc of online junior year \n\njust wanted to rant a little lmfaooo",
