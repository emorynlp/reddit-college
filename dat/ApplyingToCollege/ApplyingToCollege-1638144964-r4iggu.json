  "text": "My dad wanted me to write about how he went without a job for a few months (not even related to COVID, he lost his job because of the trade war with China) in the UT COVID essay and exclude the fact that he earned $100000 from stocks and another $100000 from the months he worked in 2020. I didn't want to lie and say my mental health was affected by that and sound like a privileged jerk. And he has also complained that I don't qualify for financial aid and that we are \"middle class\". Which middle class person has a house worth $500000, rents out 2 others each worth over $200000, and has a ton of money in stocks and their bank account? For some reason I can't convince him that we're rich. Also he cares a ton about prestige and thinks it is worth it to spend $50000-65000 a year on a private university that I don't want to attend over $30000 on a public university I like. Since I'm probably doing premed I don't see the point in spending that much money on a school I don't like.",
