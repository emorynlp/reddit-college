I have no structure in my day to day life so it's always a scramble for time last second.\n\nLike even if I get into a T20 I feel like imma be miserable just because of my shit work ethic \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "A big advantage in college:  you have a lot more time on your hands than people think. You\u2019ll be in class 15 hours per week. 20 maybe with help sessions and/or labs. I always stacked 4 hours MWF and 1.5-3 hrs of classes TuTH (depending upon whether or not I was taking 15 or 18 hours). Study 3 hours per day. That\u2019s only 30 of class/study hours M-F + 6 more on the weekends. \n\nThat\u2019s far less time than people invest in school in HS between 7 hours of school per day + studying. \n\nYou\u2019re going to meet a lot of people who are legitimately interesting and curious about things in ways that many of your HS peers aren\u2019t. Find those people. The attitude/behavior/enthusiasm is infectious. There is always an opportunity to learn/discuss over meals, hanging out, whatever. It is a much more immersive experience. \n\nYou probably also won\u2019t have as many activities. HS students tend to be over scheduled. Pick 1 or 2 things you really, really like. There will be times when you\u2019re busting your tail in papers, but the reality is you have a lot more flexibility with your time than you think. \n\nOne other thing:  parties. Have fun. But if you\u2019re one to drink, the easiest way to screw up a schedule is to ditch studying for a party where you end up with a massive hangover the next day. You put yourself a few hours behind to go to a party AND your productivity is garbage the next day. That\u2019s how being a few hours behind schedule turns into being a day and a half behind schedule quickly. If you\u2019re going to go on a bender, make sure you are current on everything.",

      "text": "No matter whether you go to a T20 or not, imo college is a good opportunity to change some of those bad habits from high school. Get in the habit of sleeping more and at regular hours, doing assignments ahead of time, making compromises for a healthy work-life balance, etc. It feels difficult to do in the hamster wheel grind of high school, but college is a good time to start with a clean slate in terms of both mindset and behavior, especially after the relaxing summer break you get after senior year.",
