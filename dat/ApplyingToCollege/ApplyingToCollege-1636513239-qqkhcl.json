  "text": "Studied for and retook the SAT, managed to get good scores on the practice tests so I\u2019m hopeful for my results. Decided to take the ACT as well recently just to see how I performed. Ended up with a 32 without studying. Would it be realistic and/or worth my time to study for the next month in an attempt to get a 35-36 to beat/match my SAT score (which I have reason to believe will be within that score range comparatively)? I\u2019ve heard mixed opinions on the benefits of taking both tests, but haven\u2019t heard of whether any advantage can be gained in the admissions process by getting high scores on both tests as opposed to just one.\n\nEdit: in case you couldn\u2019t infer, it would cost me \u2248$90 to retake the ACT due to late fee charges for the next upcoming test.",
