  "text": " I've read some things online saying that the university that I go to for my undergraduate doesn't really matter if I'm planning to go to a graduate school and that I should instead focus on avoiding debt. I have good grades and impressive ECs, so I have the option to go to some higher-ranked schools, but is it really worth going there instead of my state school?",
