  "text": "Hey y\u2019all! I\u2019m applying to Pitt and I can\u2019t choose the semester I want to apply for. It literally says that there are no terms available left. I emailed the admission team about it twice and never got a response back. Is anyone having this same problem? I\u2019m not sure what to do next cause I can\u2019t do anything else till I choose a term which I can\u2019t do.",
