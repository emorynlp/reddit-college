  "title:": "Will it look better to colleges if I switch orchestras?",
  "text": "I auditioned for an outside orchestra (let\u2019s call it orch A) And got in. However, I had auditioned for another orchestra (let\u2019s call it orch B) earlier and had been waitlisted. Recently they took me off the waitlist and invited me to come play with them in December. I cannot manage both orchestras at once so I have to choose one. My counselor said I could put down Orch B as an EC and just say I\u2019m starting in December. Orch B is better in every way than Orch A (easier travel time, more prestigious, more concerts, more valuable for money, etc). Will colleges care that I switched orchestras? Would it look bad? My plan is to put Orch A down from September-December, and then put Orch B down for December-June. I don\u2019t have to tell them I switched either. Another idea I was thinking about is to just put Orch B down from December to June since I won\u2019t be having concerts in Orch A till January by which time I\u2019ll be in Orch B, so idk if it would be meaningful to colleges or not. Orch B has 3 concerts and we will be performing at Symphony Hall, MIT, Harvard, and they rehearse at BU. \n\nI can\u2019t do both orchestras at once as their rehearsal times overlap. Should I put down Orch A and Orch B in my common app, or just Orch B if I were to switch to Orch B in December? Orch B is much more prestigious and competitive, but Orch A is still a huge time commitment (10 hours per week), albeit, less of a time commitment than Orch A (20 hours per week). Would it make a difference to colleges? I\u2019m also first chair of my section for Orch A so it would show leadership and skill. I\u2019m applying Early Action as a senior btw.",
