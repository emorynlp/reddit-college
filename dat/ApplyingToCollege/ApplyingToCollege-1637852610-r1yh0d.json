  "title:": "Things To Remember - Advice from a College Freshman",
  "text": "Hi high school seniors applying to college, it\u2019s me, your friendly neighborhood college freshman.\n\nI did my fair share of lurking in this sub throughout my senior year, and as I see similar posts pop up on my feed I decided I wanted to put out a post of advice that I wish someone would\u2019ve told me (even though I most likely wouldn\u2019t have listened). Excuse my formatting, I\u2019m on phone ):\n\n\n1. Decision dates are AWFUL and rolling admissions are BALLER\n\nWaiting to open a letter that could define your future, knowing that it will all be revealed at a certain date and a certain time is painful. Unfortunately a lot of prestigious schools do decision dates (because they like to make you suffer! jk it\u2019s so they assess every application that comes in BEFORE making you suffer ;)). However, I\u2019m sure a lot of you have applied to schools with rolling admissions and have already gotten in/will be getting in over the next few months. First of all, congrats! Second of all, use this opportunity to fall in love with that school.\n\nWe all have a dream school or a school we yearn after, but something that last years college admissions taught me is that college admissions REALLY don\u2019t make sense. You really never know which way a decision will go unfortunately, and it\u2019s much easier to recover from a rejection/deferral/waitlist when there\u2019s already another school you\u2019re vibing with, because you had the time to attend admitted student events, research the programs/student organizations, talk to facility, talk to students, look in depth on the website, and look over your preferred majors curriculum (and even visit!). That is the beauty of rolling admissions.\n\n\n2. Strip away the rankings\u2014 do you WANT to go there?\n\nWhen looking at all the schools you applied to, it\u2019s much easier to choose which one you really wanna root for if you know why you like it, and why you want to go there. Did you apply to that ivy league because you enjoy campus traditions, campus culture, the student organizations, and the location, or did you apply because it\u2019s an ivy league and pReStiGe = bESt?\n\nPrestigious schools are overrated (as we all know). They\u2019re expensive, ignore a large subset of the population, and are inherently biased towards the rich and legacy. That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t actually offer a good education, it just means they\u2019re overrated. There is nothing wrong with wanting to go to a prestigious school (my top 2 were prestigious, although I didn\u2019t know that at first \ud83d\ude05), but make sure you want to go because of the school, not because of the prestige.\n\n3. When you finish submitting all your applications, take a break, and get on to SCHOLARSHIPS\n\nMy dream school I was fortunate enough to get into, but unfortunately I could not attend because I could not afford the tuition. If I had more scholarships, I still probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to go, but there is nothing wrong with extra money.\n\nTake the break first, you need it. And then research and apply! Make sure to avoid scams and try to search scholarships through your high school or college (if you\u2019ve gotten into a college already). Good luck!\n\n\n\nI hope my 3 points of advice were helpful in any way, shape, or form, though i\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard it all before. I will probably make another advice post closer to decision day, because that was the worst time for me for sure (i made my decision 2 days before the deadline after weeks of indecision and anxiety). Good luck out there kiddos, I\u2019m rooting for ya",
