  "text": "Guys, I have worked on my essays in google docs. When I pasted it from there to the common app, the paragraph breaks seem to be too huge when I previewed it. However, when I added no empty space between paragraphs in the common app, it seemed perfectly fine in the preview version. Anyone faced this? Also, do the admission officers see the preview versions of our applications? If they see the preview version, then I think it should be fine? What do you guys suggest/think?",
