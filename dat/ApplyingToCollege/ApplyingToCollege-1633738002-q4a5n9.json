  "title:": "Sending 4 LORs to UPenn?",
  "text": "Hi all, I'm having a lot of difficulty deciding if I should submit 3 or 4 LOR to UPenn ED. Here are the letters I want to submit:\n\nCounselor LOR - UPenn requires it\n\nBusiness Teacher LOR - I am applying to Wharton so I felt this one was necessary. I'm close to my business teacher so I know her LOR for me will be strong. However, business isn't a core subject and UPenn requires an LOR from a core subject teacher :/\n\nMath teacher LOR - I want to major in statistics at Wharton and my math teacher teaches a core subject so this LOR meets the core subject LOR requirement. This letter will be strong as well\n\nCommunity service leader - my application doesn't really highlight any of my community service, so I wanted to get an LOR from my community service leader. I've been working with my leader for the past 5 years so he's seen my personal growth. The work I've been doing with him is also very meaningful to me. I'm making an educated guess that the content he writes about in my LOR won't overlap with what my business and math teachers will write in their LORS for me.\n\nAll of my LORs highlight different things about me, so would it hurt my admission chances if I submitted all 4 of these LORs to UPenn ED? Thanks",
