  "text": "(Repost because my first post was deleted somehow)\nI\u2019m a senior-equivalent studying at a non-US high school (with no US citizenship), and I\u2019m desperate for some tips on college and applications, really appreciate if someone could help me out.\n\nOur education system doesn\u2019t count GPA, we are given letter grades, and the place I\u2019m from is notorious for being academically intensive. I\u2019m studying at the top secondary school in the region, so despite my grades being fairly above average at school I hope unis will take my school\u2019s context into account (I heard they will right?) But then I do have predicted grades for our standardised school leaving exams, they\u2019re pretty decent and I\u2019ll submit it in my applications. My ECs are okay too, I got clubs, sports, competition experience, MOOCs, courses, and I managed to get mentored by a professor over the summer so I helped him conduct research in a lab.\n\nAnd for some info on myself, my mum raised me as a single parent, there\u2019s only me and her in the household. She went to high school but I don\u2019t think she graduated. So I\u2019m first gen. She couldn\u2019t find a job since COVID, we don\u2019t really have a stable income source and we\u2019re currently living off her savings. I wish I had more details on our financial situation, but every time I ask her she\u2019s rather reluctant to tell me how much money we actually own, so I just get the sense we\u2019re in a somewhat poor situation. \n\nI still have to go abroad however. The place I\u2019m from has been in a political crisis for the past 2 years, it\u2019s getting more and more politically unstable and I don\u2019t see another choice but to leave. My mum\u2019s decided to sell the flat we live in- luckily she bought it many years ago, it\u2019s government subsidised so we\u2019d have to find a way to repay the subsidies before the flat could be sold. And if it is, the money generated could be used to pay my college fees, assuming I would have zero aid, grants or scholarships, while having an equal amount of cash to spare. Then she\u2019ll leave with me to the US, but since there\u2019s a huge possibility she can\u2019t actually stay there she also considers going to another country, where she has a valid visa. In the meantime, I\u2019ll most probably be remaining in the US after graduation, maybe immigrate, because I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be going back to my hometown in the near future.\n\nRecently I just started realising how flawed the plan is, as there\u2019s no guarantee that we can even sell the flat in 1 year\u2019s time- said political crisis is causing many people to migrate as well, so there are a lot of way better, more expensive private houses and apartments on sale before our crappy little flat :P\n\nSo I\u2019m targeting mainly US public unis because tuition is generally cheaper. Not too worried about my college list because I\u2019ve checked it with my school counsellor and she says it\u2019s around my range. Though, I\u2019ve decided to ED johns hopkins. I\u2019ll be filling for financial aid, but it\u2019s making me extremely anxious because I know my chances are gonna be so much lower because of it. So happy that they gave me application fee waiver for being first gen though. \n\nMajor questions that I have:\n1. Can I not request for financial aid during the applications and only apply for it at a latter date, ie once/after I get in? Does it work that way?\n2. I know some public unis don\u2019t give application fee waivers to international students, but would they make exceptions if I try to email them to explain my situation?\n3. Any recommended places where I can look for aid/scholarship/grants as an international student?\n4. Can I apply for a green card while on a f1 visa?\n\nI\u2019m doing the research on unis and applications all by myself, so my knowledge on these matters is awfully limited. Greatly appreciate it if y\u2019all folks could give me some advice, regarding my situation, application tips, tips on how to reduce my costs and expenses in college (could really foresee myself needing this lmao), whatever, really. God knows how much I need it.\n\nTo whoever reads this and/or responds to it, thank you so, so, so, so much.",

      "text": "Check r/IntltoUSA\n\nPublic universities offer no need-based financial aid to international students and charge them more. Selective public universities do not need to offer merit scholarships to out of state students, and accordingly are not going to be affordable.\n\nYou would need to look for (less-selective) public universities that offer large automatic merit scholarships. If your stats are high enough, that might be full tuition. Getting someone else to pay for your living expenses (room and board) is much more difficult. Unless your family can afford the 15k/year in living expenses, public universities even with large merit scholarships are not very likely to be affordable. Search for scholarships that also provide room and board - these are hard to find.\n\nPrivate universities that offer need-based aid to internationals are a better option if you can get accepted. They are extremely competitive. Acceptance rates for internationals to top US schools tend to be around half the overall rate.\n\nGoogle your visa questions extensively.",
