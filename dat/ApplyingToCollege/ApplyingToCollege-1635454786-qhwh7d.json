      "text": "Yes. Just Google the college\u2019s name and \u201capplication fee waiver\u201d. Something should pop up. Lots of colleges will waive your fee without parent or counselor verification; it just depends on the college. You can also indicate your need for a fee waiver on the Common App or Coalition App. Sometimes, it will need to be verified by the counselor, but each college will set that up differently. If you\u2019re unsure, just ask the college if you can obtain a fee waiver and they should provide you with further instructions.",
