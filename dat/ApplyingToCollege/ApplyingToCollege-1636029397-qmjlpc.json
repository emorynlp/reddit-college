If you\u2019re struggling on what to write, I\u2019d suggest searching up the College Essay Guy to get some help. I\u2019d also recommend putting all the essays you have to do on one document and so you can see how many essays you have to do per day/week/etc to be on time for deadlines. Check to see if you qualify for the common app fee waiver (or try seeing if any of ur schools offer fee waivers) and if you need to do the CSS profile. Don\u2019t lose hope! You might be out of time for most EA/ED deadlines (though a lot EDII deadlines are in January too), you still have a lot of time!",

                      "text": "Consider more in-state options with higher acceptance rates (generally speaking I see this with schools that have roughly ~60%+ acceptance rates). These schools tend to have no essays required to apply, but if affording college is an issue, you have a dilemma. Many schools (specifically public in-state schools from what I\u2019ve seen), have honors colleges or offer institutional scholarships only available if you write the essays that they require. Writing essays are literally **unavoidable** if you also want to be able to **afford** college. Plus, nearly all schools require the common app essay (and even if they say they don\u2019t I still advise against not submitting it). If you say your SAT is your strong suit, I\u2019d advise spending a lot of time on your essays.",
