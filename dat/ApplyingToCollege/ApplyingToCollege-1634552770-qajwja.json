  "title:": "Question regarding the academic rigour mentioned in all college websites.",
  "text": "Hey guys. So I had a question regarding what exactly constitutes as academic rigour. For context, I am an international applicant from India and I am interested in majoring in English, History or Political Science. So in India, we need to choose a particular stream after 10th grade. I chose Humanities, which essentially means I only have two years of mathematics and science instead of the preferred four. Will that be a problem? For further information, I have English, a second language, History, Political Science, Sociology and Psychology. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks!\n\nAlso, I had another question regarding Cornell's English Proficiency criteria. They said that the criteria might be waived as long as my school is in a country where English is the official language, unlike other colleges on my list which simply require my school to have English as the primary mode of instruction. Is India considered one such country by Cornell? I will eventually get around to emailing them and asking them, but I wanted to know first from fellow Indians in Cornell or others who might know. Thanks again!",

          "text": "That's true. I had asked University of Kentucky about it as they hadn't mentioned specifically any waiver. They replied that it was fine as long as my school had an English mode of instructions. Besides, some of the colleges on my list don't require English proficiency tests. Also, how are you doing bro??",

      "text": "Academic rigour is a relative term. The rigour of tour academic record will be assessed relative to other applicants from India. Studying Political Science, History and English seem to be the standard core subjects of people opting for the humanities stream, in which case you won\u2019t be disadvantaged at all. \n\nThat should clear your doubt. However, in STEM at least, I have seen kids dual enrol with colleges in the US even from India and studying college level classes which will certainly go a long way in increasing their record\u2019s rigour. \n\nI doubt humanities folks are doing that because I frankly haven\u2019t seen any dual enrolment classes available for non-STEM subjects.",
