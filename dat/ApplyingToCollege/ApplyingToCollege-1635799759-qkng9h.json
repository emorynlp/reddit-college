  "text": "Heeey y\u2019all\nHope everything\u2019s good and well\nI\u2019ve a question, I\u2019m an international and in my country, high school goes from 7th-12th grade. It\u2019s mandatory and is registered like that. All my documents have from year 7 forward. Should I include all of them when I calculate my GPA or not? Because someone at the school\u2019s office told me that they legally have to report all of the grades mentioned above. Ty<33",
