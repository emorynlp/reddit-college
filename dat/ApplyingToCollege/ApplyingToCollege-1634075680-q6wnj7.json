  "text": "Hi everyone! I\u2019ve basically been debating this for weeks and weeks (I\u2019m a very very indecisive person and just keep bouncing back and forth). I\u2019ve made pro-con lists, gone through the whole tour process and just can\u2019t seem to settle down. I plan to study engineering and was wondering if anyone could give some insight if they have experience with one of/either of the schools?! Thank you!",

          "text": "Obviously this isn\u2019t my only two but my top two reach schools. I\u2019ve really loved Columbia for a while. The location, great engineering program, infinite opportunities makes it seem amazing. I don\u2019t know as much about Harvard, however I love the location, it\u2019s \u2018college-town\u2019 vibe being surrounded by so many schools, and obviously an almost equally as good engineering program. I don\u2019t mean to come off pretentious and act like I belong at an Ivy because I know there\u2019s a high chance I won\u2019t get in, but I\u2019m just so torn right now and could use any insight I could get",
