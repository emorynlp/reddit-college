  "text": "I'm in the process of reporting courses and grades at my current community college, where I'm a sophomore in the Fall 2021 semester. When selecting the semesters for my current college I chose Fall 2020, Spring 2021, Fall 2021, and Spring 2022. I plan on transferring starting Fall 2022. It won't let me bypass the \"academic history\" page because I have not reported final grades for Fall 2021, which is in progress, and Spring 2022, which hasn't happened yet. Anybody have a solution?",
