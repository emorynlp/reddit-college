  "title:": "Asking for emergency LoR over fall break?",
  "text": "Last month I talked to my math teacher for a LoR (due November 1st); she told me that she would be willing to write one, but she probably wouldn't be the best teacher to ask. I didn't follow up with her because I went and found another teacher (English), but at the end the teacher wasn't willing to write me an LoR and I'm panicking.\n\nMy math teacher *really* dislikes being asked to write recommendation letters at a late notice, and I'm afraid if I ask her she won't write a positive recommendation letter even if she agrees. I'm trying to write an email to her but I'm not sure if I should tell her what happened, or just tell her I still want her to write me a letter of recommendation. She's the only other teacher I can ask now at this point in time.",
