  "title:": "I got into jhu ed and I'm kind of regretting it",
  "text": "I was really impulsive about doing an ed to be honest. My mom hired a college counselor for like a 45 minute \"strategy\" session and she said I probably wouldn't get into a college if I didn't ed, and told me jhu was probably a good idea to ed to. I knew I wanted to major in STEM but I wasn't really sure what beyond that, and I heard JHU had research opportunities and was a good engineering school so I kind of just figured why not. College in general has always stressed me out a lot, and for some reason instead of doing more research I just pretended applications didn't exist until they were on top of me lol. Apparently jhu is mostly just premed students? I don't want to do premed, I'm not really sure if I'm even doing biology, which seems to be the main focus of the college. right now I'm planning on majoring in electrical engineering and/or physics/math and everyone irl is telling me I'm an idiot for ed-ing to jhu for those areas. Apparently the location sucks too, and the school is supposed to be really depressing, and apparently there aren't many career planning things for engineering students compared to med students :/ at least this is what i'm seeing online lol, everyone online seems to hate jhu and I'm just kinda regretting doing an ed now lol. this must sound really entitled and I should be happy I even got into a college like jhu, maybe I'm just being self destructive. the school seemed fine at first glance and I visited the campus, it looked fine, idk. oh well, I guess I'm stuck here now lol, it's entirely my fault anyway for not doing more research, idek what I want out of college so who cares I guess. i'm really sorry this is such a first world problem lmao I'm way too entitled ok bye\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: ok so this was supposed to stay in my drafts and I am incredibly embarrassed right now. thank you so much for the positive feedback, I really appreciate it. I think I'm just being self destructive and finding reasons to regret, because there were reasons why I chose JHU, research was and still is important to me and I liked the campus and classes offered, I was just having a breakdown and wanted to get my thoughts out, very sorry for subjecting everyone to that lol. Many people are pointing out that random people on the internet don't count as research and I am realizing that too, I was spiraling through posts in the heat of the moment but right now I'm extremely happy with the outcome and I am excited to explore stuff in college. anyway sorry lmao and thank you all so much for being so nice <3",

What I can tell you from my experience visiting JHU is that you will have great faculty no matter what major you end up entering and that you will have the JHU name attached to you where ever you go which can be a powerful thing. The people are interesting, you probably won't mix with the super depressed/competitive ones (like the BME majors) to be honest lol cuz you'll never meet them to begin with since they're stuck in their room doing work. Location-wise, I didn't like it, it is not your Boston, it's a castle on the hill, but I believe that comes with opportunity. Whatever you end up doing, look to the surrounding area for the problems and for direction in your work.",

Also if you're feeling dumb I applied to Brown as an intended Engineering major, even though it's not regarded as like a top tier school for engineering. Also as a Baltimore resident the area isn't that bad. While Baltimore has dangerous places like almost all cities do, and there's still a ton of fun stuff to do around the college and in other parts of the city.
