  "text": "I spend way to much time on here and r/chanceme. I'm looking for a good way to forget that these subs exist and stop making me feel so inferior to everyone else. Being here makes me feel unaccomplished and will never get accepted to a good university. I wish I cared where I went to college back in my freshman year.  I'm only a junior. Can't I just save those feelings until I get rejected.",
