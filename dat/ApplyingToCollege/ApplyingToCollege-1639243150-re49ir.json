  "text": "So Cornell, my Ed school, strongly recommends first quarter grades which I didn\u2019t send because my school doesn\u2019t generate quarter reports. Will this negativity affect me. I have a 4.0 gpa ,so my grades are not bad and I think the admissions can assume my grades will be good this year too.",
