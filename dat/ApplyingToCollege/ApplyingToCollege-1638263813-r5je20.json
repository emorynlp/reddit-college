  "text": "I finally submitted my UC app and got to payment section when I accidentally hit the back button on my mouse and my credit card info wasn't filled out yet. I wasn't able to get back to the payment screen and the only option was to submit the application. My fees and payments says that my credit card is pending and my total due is 0. Am I fine to fill out the credit card information after the due date?",
