  "text": "I go to a high school that offers lots of AP classes, I only took two in total. The rest were honors and high honors. \nOther than that, I have a pretty strong application, 3.93 UW gpa (4.95 W), 4 year varsity athlete in two sports, I started my own photography business and my essays are good (I think). I\u2019m also applying test optional.\n\nMy top choices right now are UCLA, Tufts and WashU. Thoughts?",
