  "text": "I was rejected from Stanford the other day, and I\u2019m not so much sad about that anymore, but whether a college will even accept me. I have a 92 average because of family difficulties my freshmen year, but I feel like that\u2019s really pushing me back and I won\u2019t get into college because of it. Anyone else not happy with their GPA and wish they could\u2019ve done better? I know I can\u2019t change it anymore but I just feel so unmotivated knowing it\u2019s setting me back. And I\u2019m second guessing if colleges even consider those difficult backgrounds. It was my father\u2019s death, but rather than looking at that context, I feel they\u2019ll look at the hundreds of other people with a 92< and push me off, just like Stanford did.",

You have fine grades and will be accepted to plenty of excellent institutions.\n\nYou also have experienced a great deal of loss, and I am very sorry that you have had to go through that at a young age.",
