  "text": "i remember discovering this sub earlier in my first semester of junior year and watching all the seniors lose their shit lmao\n\nI literally got so scared bc that would be me in a year and that all my grades I was going to receive and ECs were going to *actually* count, unlike some stupid club I joined in sophomore year\n\nI found it absurd *a year ago* that it felt like days ago telling ppl at college fairs that I'm just a freshman/sophomore looking around then BAM I had to start serious college research???? like?????/\n\nand then here's me, actually waiting for the dreaded mid-december (wanting to stop time from flowing but also to just fast forward to *that* date) Im doing everything the seniors were talking about last year in this sub: religiously checking portals and inboxes and dealing with the rollercoaster of god complex to \"im disgusting and no college will ever accept me\" syndrome \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1ei cannot believe in a few months I'd be deciding where I would be for the next four years (or more). this all feels like a fever dream.\n\njuniors **and seniors**, how are you feeling??\n\nedit: sorry it wasn't clear, but im a senior as well yall \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\ned 2: juniors feel free to PM me if yall want to talk about/rant/want some advice about stuff!!!

      "text": "Senior here, I'm losing it. The process and its consequences are living rent free in my head and preventing me from being able to concentrate on my super important schoolwork and exams. I feel like a failure every single time I'm on this sub because- no joke or exaggeration- literally every single person here ~~whose profile~~ I ~~stalk~~ check turns out to have achieved way more than me, over high school and in life + writes way better than I do. I feel like a clown even applying anywhere because every good to average school for my major seems like a reach for me when I check out the kind of people applying. Call it imposter syndrome, but for people who never achieved anything in the first place. It also doesn't help that being an aid-seeking intl drops my chances down even further.\n\nI feel like being what I thought was the average teenager where I'm from- doing decently at school, no major life achievements, occasionally playing minecraft, watching youtube videos on whatever caught my interest- made me miss the bus on being successful and high-achieving in life before I even knew what was going on. Or worse, that some people are high achievers who work hard, remain motivated and succeed in whatever they do at every stage just by nature and I'm simply not among them. I honestly don't know what to do with my life, but I hope it all works out in the end, and I'm confident I'll lead a decent life.\n\nDamn, you read all the way to the end",

But I am glad I discovered this sub it\u2019s great to see people succeeding. \n\nGood luck to the seniors \u2764\ufe0f",

To top it off I got mail from a college today, the college got my info from one of those fake scholarship sites. She basically said I was stupid to sell my info. I\u2019m tired of her shaming me for no reason. Luckily I won\u2019t have to deal with either of my parents after high school, unless I want to.",

My grades are holding up (worried about my class rank though) and I am feeling good about my upcoming SAT, so I am grateful for that. But as the months go by I worry more and more that I am going to end up at the beginning of senior year knowing I have the stats to apply to top schools but not enough depth to my ECs/awards to actually have a chance because I didn't apply myself enough. I know there is still time but things are moving fast.",
