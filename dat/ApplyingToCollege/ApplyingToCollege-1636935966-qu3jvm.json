  "text": "Over the summer I took an intro to business course at my local community college and I got a 90 in the course. I was wondering if it was worth putting on my high school transcript because my unweighted gpa is a 97.5 and my weighted is a 99.8 and I\u2019m afraid that the course will hurt my gpa. Will putting this course on my high school transcript help or hurt me?",
