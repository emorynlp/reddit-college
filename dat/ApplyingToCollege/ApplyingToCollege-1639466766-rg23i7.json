  "text": "How are you these days?\n\nI feel extremely bad and devastated when seeing those with their mentor failed right at the early decision or did not get enough financial aid.I am just an international students  trying to make my dream come true. But it seems so hard when my budget is so low and I have no mentor. I have to overcome all the difficulties alone. I am scared that I may fail though I am really trying my best.\n\nWhich door can I walk through? Which path should I go on? :(((",

      "text": "Hey, i\u2019m not an international but i am a first gen student in america. It\u2019s so hard having the lack of support/finance but either way, hard work WILL pay off in the end. Being prepared without a mentor will overall give you the success of having your own initiative, and WILL help you in college and life in general. College isn\u2019t the end-all-be-all, what you do with your college life is. \nAnyways- I have no doubt that you will make your dream come true. I\u2019m sure you do have a dream school, which is obviously the goal, but that isn\u2019t necessarily your dream I think. I\u2019m assuming that your dream is to be successful with the career path you choose, which i can undoubtedly say that it will happen. Being independent and having your own drive are keys to success, and you have these traits.\nNow please- prioritize your mental health. College applications can be a slippery slope, but keep going! Write the applications but be sure to sacrifice a day/couple of hours just to hang out with friends or family doing activities that have no correlation with academics or ECs. This will really help preventing burn out, making you also more efficient in school.\nI will cross my fingers that you get into your dream school- but if you do not, then just know that you will become successful, and achieve your overall \u201cdream\u201d :)",
