  "text": "So I\u2019m applying to UMich as one of my reach school. I think I have a good shot at getting in but whether I can go is mainly gonna be determined by money. Anyways, does anybody have tips for their supplemental essays like what to include and what to avoid writing about? Advice for either or both of the supplementals would help. Thanks in advance :)",
