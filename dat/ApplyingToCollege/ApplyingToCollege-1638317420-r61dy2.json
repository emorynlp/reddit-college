  "text": "Hi A2C, I\u2019m in a little bit of a predicament. There\u2019s a lot of colleges I\u2019ve been accepted to, but for my dream school, I don\u2019t necessarily have the money yet and I\u2019m trying to get it. The college decision process has absolutely stressed me out, because, I\u2019ve met great people going to the respective ones I\u2019m going to, but it\u2019s all gonna come down to one school. One major factor for picking one is the social environment there, because I wanna meet friends in college. What are your thoughts, and what should I do?",

      "text": "There are some websites that allow students to answer questions about their school, including questions about social life. Googling the school name + social life should give you a good idea. You can also search \u201cday in the life + school name\u201d on YouTube or find the school on Instagram and go to photos tagged with the location and stalk the Instagram accounts of the students that go there lol!! Finally you can totally email the admissions office of the school & ask to be put in touch with a student to ask questions (which looks good for interest purposes too)! As for stress\u2014 take a breather, eat a snack, watch a comfort movie, log off of Reddit for a while! Wherever you end up will likely be wonderful for you (and if it isn\u2019t, you can probably transfer). Try not to stress unnecessarily. You got this!",
