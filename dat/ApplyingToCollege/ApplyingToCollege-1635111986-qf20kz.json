  "text": "I have looked everywhere and I just can\u2019t get a clear answer. If my schedule changes after the submission of my Common App which has that course selected, how do I fix it? It is a minor mistake as I should have checked earlier. Do I submit a change to these schools or change it if I\u2019m accepted with my updated classes?",
