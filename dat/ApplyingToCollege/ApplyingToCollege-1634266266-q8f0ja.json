  "text": "I'm currently looking for an online journalism school. I graduated high school back in 2016 (was unable to attend college right after high school because of financial issues, plus the fact that my family became homeless for nine months shortly after I graduated)\n\nThe biggest issue for me is going to be financial aid. Since I'm from Massachusetts, is that going to prevent me from taking courses at an out of state online school? \n\nAny help would be extremely appreciated.",
