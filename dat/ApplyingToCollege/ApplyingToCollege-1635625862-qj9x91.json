However my test scores do not appear at my common app review and it also says *\" This college has chosen not to include certain Common App answers in the PDF they receive for your application. As a result, the following answers will not be displayed on your PDF: Partial SSN, ACT / SAT Tests, Case Custom Suppres \"* at the end.\n\nDoes this mean the university wont get my test scores?",
