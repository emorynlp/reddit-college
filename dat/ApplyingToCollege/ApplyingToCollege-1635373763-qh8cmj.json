After you've picked up several thousand followers, take up a cause, slap a 501.c.3 on it, and drop the @ in your additional information section.\n\n2.  Create your own blog or website, ideally related to something like beauty products, photography, etc.  Feature yourself prominently and include the link.\n\n3.  Enter some beauty contests.  Even listing your participation says you have the confidence to put yourself out there and are probably well above average pretty.\n\n4.  Win some Yearbook Superlatives (e.g. Most Likely To Become A Trophy Wife or Most Likely To Be A Model)\n\n5.  Subtly work this into your essays.  You can't be direct or it sounds like you're narcissistic and self-absorbed.
