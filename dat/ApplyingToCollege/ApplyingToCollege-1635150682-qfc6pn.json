  "text": "I'm from India, and I have a Debit card from an India bank. (No credit card) can I still pay for common app using that? \nAlso, if I pay through flywire, does it pay directly from my bank account (like paypal does) or does it ask for a card? \nPlease answer my question. I'm applying to college in ED and the deadline is in 5 days",
