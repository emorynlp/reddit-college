  "text": "I recently got a box in the mail from my dream school! I was a little surprised because it was just unexpected. \n\nI opened the box and saw a letter telling me they would waive my fee if I applied ED2 (which I planned to), a hat and flag of the school, a free drink from one of the cafes, some lemonheads, and some other things telling me about the surrounding area, and school traditions. \n\nI\u2019m hoping this is a good thing. I\u2019ve shown a lot of interest in the school: going an interview with a senior, interview with an alumnus, a guided tour, and a day on campus that included a lunch with the student and sitting in in a class, and an information session. I always had a ton of trouble falling in love with a college, but I really love this one.",
