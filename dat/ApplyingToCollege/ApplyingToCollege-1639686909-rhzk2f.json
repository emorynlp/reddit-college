          "text": "I love tufts a lot! I\u2019m really glad I got accepted here. The students here are all sOO sweet and friendly, personally I\u2019ve never had an even mild bad experience with the students here, but I have heard of some antisemitic acts done once or twice my students. The school made sure to take control of it before it turned into a large problem though so I wouldn\u2019t let that deter you, everyone is very friendly. The class size really depends on what you take, my Spanish class is only about 15 students but my Comp15 class was well over a hundred. It doesn\u2019t feel suffocating though. As for professors, it really does depend on who you pick, I recommend using rate my professor when choosing. Generally I\u2019ve had amazing experiences with my professors, most of them were very kind and genuinely wanted me to preform well, one even went out of their way to stay in contact with me over the summer to help me look for research opportunities outside of tufts, and now they are my major advisor. However, I have had bad experiences with professors, nothing extremely worrying but it\u2019s worth saying that, similar to the students, not //every single// professor is great. Just the majority. \n\nOverall I really do love it here and I could talk about my experience for hours if allowed lol. Obviously it has its faults but despite them I still wouldn\u2019t have chosen any other school I think ( plus tufts was VERY generous for my aid ) \n\nFeel free to pm me if you have any more questions or would like me to be more specific on anything I\u2019ve said!",
