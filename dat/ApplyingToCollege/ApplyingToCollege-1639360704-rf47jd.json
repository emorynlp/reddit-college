From talking to a few friends that aren\u2019t as extroverted they also do well socially although their circles are smaller. I believe it\u2019s what you do with the environment that will make your social life. many opportunities to make friends throughout the first half of the semester. \n\nbiggest tip is to set goals on a few things before coming. for me i said i wanted to make a network of friends and focus academically. this meant i put academics and friendships over clubs. I did not do any business or preprofessional clubs this semester and i 100% would do it over again. Clubs recruit every semester, but the time to make friends and establish friendships don\u2019t come around that often.",

One of the promotional videos mentioned it but this isn't mentioned anywhere on the list of student clubs and organisations.\n\nSorry this reply took longer than expected.\n\n1. I have only one semester under my belt so I cant really offer any great response to this other than I took a stress management and relaxation class for a PE where we learned ways to handle stress, this included lots of sleep/ meditation LOL. Another class I took was my FWS, which is called Korean Globalization and we talk and write about how the Korean Wave was globalized. We watched kpop dance videos and watched parasite and train to busan, along with a string of readings that were pretty intresting. These classes are not Dyson specific as everyone is required to take 2 credits of PE and 6 credits of a FWS (first year writing seminar).\n2. Uhhh I guess really looking into how Dyson and its resources can be used to help further your goals. Don't just write stuff you see on the homepage, but look a little deeper into the research and stuff Dyson does, there's alot of professors at the top of theirr field doing crazy work here. For example, I wrote about CERES2030 which is a project aimed to get rid of poverty around the world in 2030. This project is headquartered at Cornell. I wrote about this (a paragraph) because it ties into my concentration of International Trade and Development. \n3. This is a hard question because alot of clubs at  Cornell are similar to clubs in other schools. But if I had to say CFA, Cornell Filipino Assocation. Pretty sure this is not exclusive to Cornell, but it is a club I wanted to join since learning about it when I applied because I lacked this community in my hometown. \n4. YES! THERES ALOTTT. A friend of mine is a part of Cornell Daily Sun which is the student publication that is funded by students and alumni. There's also a bunch of writing clubs that are associated with a different topics, Creme de Cornell for food, Thread Magazine for fashion, etc.\n5. Being a part of Dyson my classes are small but a part of a larger community which was the main reason I committed. I wanted to be able to get to know my professors well while also being able to see new faces everyday. \n6. Food but lowkey a let down LOL because North dining sucks (freshman dining). West is where our dining is at but its far from freshman dorms. \n7. IDK about the design your major thing but I have heard about it. I would email an advisor to gain a better answer. However, you are right that you can only double major within your college. But because Dyson is technically apart of CALS, you can double major into CALS, but if you are only in CALS you cannot double major into Dyson. \n8. It's just a fancy name for certain parts of our curriculum. Everyone goes through it. It is basically certain requirements for CALS but they designed another class just for Dyson students, like a FWS.\n9. Some concentrations are unique to Dyson. However, its more of what you do out side of Dyson that makes the experience worth it. Dyson allows alot of  flexibility to explore outside interest, study abroad, etc. This is what you need to take advantage of to get the best experience in Dyson.\n10. See response to 2\n11. I do not know about this club\n\nHope that helps!",

CAS lets you take classes in music, history etc. to graduate, whereas eng requires Physics and Chem.\n\nBoth CAS and engineering have the lowest admit rates in the school (other than dyson) so neither is significantly easier to get in. \n\nJust apply to which one is a better fit for you",

Engineering requirements are more science based, ie you take up to Calc 3, differential equations, both chem and physics, and some other requirements. CAS is the same with taking up to calc 3 because it is standard for all CS majors but you are required to take a foreign language instead of all the STEM courses.",

My initial plan was to do a double major in Physics and Math but because I applied without asking for financial aid, I\u2019m planning to transfer to CoE (that if I get accepted, don\u2019t get your hopes up, boy). The reason why I\u2019m planning to transfer to CoE is that if I major in Mech eng with a minor in Aerospace and decide to head to industry after graduation, it will be an option, but I\u2019m planning to continue graduate studies, but for Physics, it won\u2019t be an option so I\u2019ll be kinda stuck.\n\nTL;DR is it difficult to transfer from CAS Physics to CoE?",
