  "text": "I\u2019m from a really small town in the south and my school literally only has 2 APS (US History & Biology). The AP Bio teacher isn\u2019t even certified\u2026 my school ranks one of the lowest in the state and every club I\u2019ve joined has been fairly inconsistent except student organizations. When I read all of these posts and see people wondering if they\u2019ll get into T10 schools with national wins, I just shake my head. There aren\u2019t any opportunities in my town for things that get people into these good schools. My GPA is amazing but that\u2019s all I have tbh and it\u2019ll probably be considered inflated. My family keeps talking about Harvard and I refuse to set myself up for disappointment. Anybody else in a similar situation?",

Also, it\u2019s important to understand that the majority of colleges in the U.S. admit the majority (50%+) of their applicants. If you\u2019re smart about where you apply, you\u2019ll be fine.",

What I\u2019ve seen on here is that AOs will know you went to a small town (esp based on class size), and will know the classes available from your counselor\u2019s school report. Just do the best you can, and you\u2019ll be alright. :)\n\nAs for Harvard... you could always pretend to apply and then just simply pull up a fake rejection letter? Just tell your parents there\u2019s no app fee for Harvard, or else they\u2019ll catch onto your plan like mine :\u2019)",

If there are any 4Y universities within easy commuting distance of you, could maybe try to take a summer class or two (if that's an option).",
