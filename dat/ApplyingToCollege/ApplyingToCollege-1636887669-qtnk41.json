  "text": "I'm an international, so I may not have the most accurate impression of T10s. I definitely have read online regarding what I'm asking about, but  I want to have a recent, consolidated but also in-depth (hopefully insights from students that study there that others may not know of; unique programs/traditions/resources) compilation here. \n\nThere is also an admissions slant to it regarding what AOs are looking for and what is each school's unique \"fit\".\n\nUnis I have in mind are, but not limited to: HYPSM, UPenn, Colombia, Brown. \n\nSo this comment I saw from a post specific to Colombia is what I'm looking for ([https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mrevgz/student\\_trait\\_in\\_columbia/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/mrevgz/student_trait_in_columbia/)) :  \n\n>I'm almost certainly attending Columbia, and I had a call yesterday with my interviewer (a current junior) who described the Columbia student body as:  \n>  \n>Highly independent  \n>  \n>Worldly (or \"street-wise\"\u2014 after all, they live in NYC)  \n>  \n>Cultured, and willing to take every cultural opportunity Columbia offers  \n>  \n>Competitive without being cutthroat  \n>  \n>Self-driven  \n>  \n>With very diverse passions and interests (and LOVE for learning outside your major, after all there's a Core to complete)  \n>  \n>Care deeply about and engage with social and political issues\n\nOther examples I can think of off-hand (definitely requiring more elaboration) are how Brown has an open curriculum allowing students to take Pass/Fail and have a culture more focused on exploration and intellectual thinking development; or how Penn has a pre-professional culture although (at least from what I see from their admissions office) they also want to encourage interdisciplinary learning and exploration too. \n\nAny insights are greatly appreciated!",

      "text": "Hi! I work in higher education. I sympathize with where this question is coming from, but I think the question might have the stick by the wrong end.\n\nConsider, for instance, that many students are admitted to more than one of the schools you're describing. And many students who are admitted to one of those schools for undergrad attend another one for grad school. The cultures can't be that different if the same student can attend several schools without a problem. In fact, I would argue that most colleges are broadly the same, but that's a conversation for another time.\n\nThat's why most of the qualities the junior attributed to Columbia are qualities that all of its peers, and indeed colleges in general, are looking for. The only quality that probably *is* more particular for Columbia is the ability to handle living in a big city, and that's because every school tries to make sure its admits can handle going to that school.\n\nAlso consider what admissions officers always say, and truthfully: they're building a whole class with lots of diverse components. They aren't looking for 2000 individuals who each fit exactly the same mold.\n\nFinally, contradictions are the way of life - on campuses as everywhere else. UPenn has a pre-professional ethos, but also a deep love of histories and archives, perhaps because of its location in the historic city of Philadelphia. MIT admits students who worked hard in their high school classes, but the campus culture admires undergraduates who *punt* schoolwork in favor of *hacking* and *tooling* on their own. Yale is stodgy and sends people into government work; it's also the queerest Ivy. I would recommend being yourself rather than trying to guess what list of personality traits any one school is looking for.",

          "text": "Thanks for the thoughtful answer!\n\nIn hindsight my wording may have been a bit off, I think what I was looking for is more of the distinct and unique part of each school's curriculum or culture (eg Brown's open curriculum; Colombia's core; UPenn's pre-prof; Yale's RCs), rather than what qualities the colleges are looking for in applicants / \"fit\". As you have mentioned, it converges around those few main qualities. \n\nI get the being myself part, and I'm not trying to force-fit myself into other schools, rather I hope to get a sensing of how I will fit in there with insights regarding the schools (I know most of the general stuff can be found online).",

      "text": "The only schools that I think actively care about fit are MIT, UChicago, and Caltech. HYP takes mostly the same sort of students, brown/Dartmouth probably also admits similar students, Columbia probably a mix of both since they can't rely on H/S students picking Columbia over H/S, etc. there's a lot of shit that goes into it but it's definitely not that stratified\n\nLike I've anecdotally heard that a good essay can get you into UChicago, Stanford but I doubt that's the same for Harvard.",
