  "text": "I'm not even going through this right now, but my older sister is. She might be the most qualified person I know (near perfect act, has done lab work internship in professional lab, 4.0 unweighted, etc.) and she was rejected from brown. Like not even deferred just flat out rejected. I mean I know that ivy league is kind of a gamble no matter how qualified you are but still this is making me really scared for next year especially since I am nowhere near as qualified as she is",

      "text": "Applying to college is what you make of it, like anything else. The problem is that most people don't really know how college works and think there is something special about a few universities that except the smallest fraction of students, and convince 17 year olds to tie their worth to acceptances to those schools. \n\nIf you approach the process by asking yourself what you want out of college and find a good fit for who you are, you're likely to get plenty of acceptances and have your choice of many fine institutions.",

      "text": "Once you've demonstrated you can do the work it comes down to what the committee thinks you would add to the class.  It's not a purely an academic determination.  Someone who is \"interesting\" might get the nod over someone else with slightly better stats, who has more research experience, etc.\n\nIf you get the time, you might want to read [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Valedictorians-Gate-Standing-Getting-Applying/dp/1250619033).  Written by a Dartmouth AO, it does a better job of explaining what I was trying to convey above.\n\nAlso: there's no need for you to be scared because you're not as \"qualified\" as your sister and she didn't get into Brown.  You might not get into Brown.  That's okay.  Not getting into Brown (et. al.) isn't something worth being anxious about.",
