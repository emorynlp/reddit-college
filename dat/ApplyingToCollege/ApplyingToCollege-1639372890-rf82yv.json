  "text": "I have a dream school that I have wanted to attend for years. Unfortunately, everyone in my town, my relatives, my classmates, my teachers, my coaches... everyone who is anyone in my life knows this because 1. My favorite hoodie has the school on it 2. people are always asking me where I would like to go to school, especially after my sister got admitted to her dream school 3. my parents have not been shy about my aspirations. I just realized that if I get rejected (95%+ will happen), it will probably take me more than a year to stop getting inquiries about whether I got in. A year of me just reliving that rejection over and over again...why did I get myself into this situation??\n\nAny advice? maybe a mass email that just says \"I didn't get into -----. Please don't ask about it.\"",

      "text": "Yeah, never a good idea to exclaim that type of stuff out loud. I've literally only told two friends where I've applied and gotten it, otherwise just immediate family. In your case, best thing to do is pray, and if you get rejected, just be upfront about it, but don't do anything rash. Mass emailing is not a good idea. If it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. If you have to tell people that no you didn't get in, then that's what you have to say. Don't lie to yourself or others, ya know? That's all I can say.",
