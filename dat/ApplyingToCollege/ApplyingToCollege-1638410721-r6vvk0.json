  "text": "Most of my ecs are music, I have like 2 small ecs related to econ which is my intended major\n\nAre my chances shot? Would there be any value in applying as a music major and just changing once I get there?",

At least, I hope they don't. They might volunteer at a cat Cafe a few hours a week, but their school ECs probably don't have a lot to do with animals)\n\nYou can totally apply for music if it interests you enough to major, double major, or minor in it, but you don't have to at all.",

      "text": "You should definitely have *some* major-related EC's, but in my experience having EC's in a large variety of areas helps rather than hurts. It breaks down the \"nerd vibes\" so to speak and shows colleges that there's more to you than just someone who obsessively studies just one thing to the neglect of all the other talents and interests in your life. I find it best to balance spikes and well-roundedness. Personally, most of my EC's didn't really have much to do with my intended major, and I still got acceptances from great schools",
