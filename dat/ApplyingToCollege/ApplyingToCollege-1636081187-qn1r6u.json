  "text": "Hey everyone I'm a junior currently making course selections for senior year. I have taken a decently rigorous course load throughout high school, (mostly A's, a few B's) so I want to keep that up. While I have  schools in mind that have around a 50% acceptance rate, I'm also going to be applying to some highly selective schools such as Amherst and Rice. With that being said, I also know senioritis will hit me like a truck plus essays, so I'm not sure how tough I want my schedule to be. Here's my junior year schedule and prospective senior year schedules. My intended major is applied math (I think). Edit: (I've italicized the differences)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJunior (current)\n\nAP Calculus BC\n\nAP Statistics\n\nAP Language and Composition\n\nAP Biology (double period)\n\nHonors Spanish 4\n\nAP Computer Science\n\nlunch\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSenior (A)\n\nCalculus 3\n\nData Structures\n\nHonors Creative Writing/ Honors Film and Literature (s1/s2)\n\nAP Physics C (double period mechanics and E/M)\n\nAP Spanish\n\nAP US Gov/ regular econ (s1/s2)\n\nlunch\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSenior (B)\n\nCalculus 3\n\nData Structures\n\n*AP Seminar*\n\nAP Physics C (double period mechanics and E/M)\n\nAP Spanish\n\nAP US Gov/ *AP macroecon* (s1,s2)\n\nlunch\n\nlol I don't think I\"ll be able to handle this one, but the rigor here is like 12/10\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSenior (C)\n\nCalculus 3\n\nData Structures\n\n*AP Seminar*\n\nAP Physics C (double period mechanics and E/M)\n\nAP Spanish\n\nAP US Gov/ regular econ (s1/s2)\n\nlunch\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo overall my questions are, would it hurt to take a regular class second semester senior year and take honors english as it's less rigorous than my junior year schedule? (especially going from an AP to honors english class) Taking a regular class second semester senior year seems nice because it's one less class I have to worry about especially since it's s2 and I'll want to enjoy it. I'm also really interested in the film and literature class. At the same time I don't want to look like I'm not upping the rigor senior year. Which senior schedule, A, B or C?\n\n**Note**: I can fulfill my consumer education requirement and 3 years of social studies requirement at the same time (ap world, apush during fresh/soph year)  by taking an econ course, so that way I can get a lunch instead of taking a diff social studies course like sociology and a separate consumer ed course.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnd of long post. Any advice would be appreciated. u/admissionsmom if you could offer some advice I'd really appreciate it that as well. Thanks guys!",

      "text": "You absolutely should take an English class Senior year.  AP Seminar is unlikely to fulfill a college's requirement, regardless of what your high school does.\n\nIf you have been successful with a rigorous schedule to date, there's no reason to ease much. Selective colleges look for students who continue to challenge themselves.\n\nMy daughter took pretty much the same Jr schedule (AP Chem instead of Bio) and has another 5 AP courses as a Senior, and has completed all of her EA and RD college applications/essays already.  At the top schools, that will be the profile of the other applicants.",
