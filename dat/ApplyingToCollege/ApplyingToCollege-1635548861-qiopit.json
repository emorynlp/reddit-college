  "text": "it\u2019s near the beach. some people are incredibly smart but got screwed over in college apps so now they\u2019re humble (almost everyone else is this pretty smart hard working kid that just didn\u2019t get into their top school). and the profs here are all as widely acclaimed as any other professors. the weather here is perfect. people actually have fun. party scene exists. fun scene outside of the normal party scene exists. people are nice. hardly any stuck up people. \n\ni will say this : anyone that calls it UC socially dead has probably stayed in their dorm all day. my first week moving in i made like 30 solid friends. like people i can hit up and grab lunch with whenever and can crash at their dorm if i needed to. tbf, i\u2019m pretty socially capable. but the reality is that anyone can make friends here. and there\u2019s so much fun stuff. \nmy dream school was harvard. i didn\u2019t get in. out of all the UCs tho i wouldn\u2019t go back and choose a single one over UCSD. \n\nhave fun in college yall :) working hard is good but getting to work hard with fun people is even better. \n\n\ngo tritons \ud83d\udd31",

Great academics, great social life etc. You\u2019re using social life as your parameter as it being the best UC, when comparable octal life exists at other UCs, though I will admit SB and SD are best for social life.\n\nI have visited your school and I like the vibe, it\u2019s great. But it is not currently the best UC, it sits behind Berkeley and UCLA for now.",
