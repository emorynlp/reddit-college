I'm sorry to everyone that I confused....i was just conveying what youngarts told me by email, idk what happened\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI emailed them and this is what they told me: The finalists were notified on Tuesday (Nov 16) and all winners will be notified by early December (Dec 9). Though, I have heard from other sources that finalists will be announced until Thanksgiving. That could be from previous years, though. So I would say that all finalists have been notified this year (2021-2022) and merit/honorable mentions/ect are still to come. The order, like other people have been saying, generally goes from biggest recognition to smallest. I wish they gave us more information. Hang in there, guys! And good luck!",

However, in their reply, they just said \"finalists\" and did not specify \"poetry/writing finalists.\"\n\nI will send a follow-up email to them and ask if this just applies to the poetry/writing category, but I am guessing that all finalists have been notified just from what they told me.\n\nI will update you on what they tell me!
