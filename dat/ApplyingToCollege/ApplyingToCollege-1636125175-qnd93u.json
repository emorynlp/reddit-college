Most of these students have never been to campus and continually repeat the same info based on reviews from A2C, CC and  YouTube which are mostly from students who have issues with Berkeley.   **Happy people don\u2019t complain.**. Yes Berkeley has issues - plenty of it believe me.  I\u2019ve had my highest of highs and lowest of lows here and now I\u2019m graduating this Spring.   Hardest 4 years of my life but would i change any of it? Nope, no regrets.",

The community vibe here on campus and in the city is very uniquely Berkeley.  The food scene is great.  Berkeley is a 20-minute train ride to San Francisco (though i rarely go there these day).   I am surrounded by people who challenge and inspire me to do my best and I absolutely love that about Cal.  Academics is rigorous (you have to earn your grade here; not a perk for some) and the professors here are great (the ones I\u2019ve had).   I once had the honor of learning from a Noble Peace Prize winner and research with a renowned expert in the field - pretty awesome stuff i probably wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity elsewhere (maybe).",

I felt less stressed when just doing my work not listening to the negativity. I am doing great academically and have a lot of opportunities/ connections lined up ever since I got here. What is making me feel so anxious is just the one sided negative content I am hearing on Reddit that made me super uncertain about how future employers look at my school. I realized how ridiculous that is today as these negative comments are from people who are failing out, don\u2019t take advantage of opportunities or just want to be bitter. I literally saw another comment shading Stanford and saying it is not as good as Harvard and if you go to Stanford you are regarded way lower/ have less opportunities. This is absolutely insane. I noticed this happens to other schools as well. I also read the same type of thing about it being competitive/ cutthroat for premed when looking at other Ivy subreddits. The grass is not greener on the other side. I also plan on getting therapy since I realized I may have severe anxiety due to how I responded to all the negativity I\u2019ve been seeing about my school.",

They\u2019re all insanely good universities but that doesn\u2019t exempt them from being flawed or garnering critique in one form or another. Clearly you\u2019ve had a good experience so far and you need to let that speak for itself rather than searching for the answer in others. Posting these questions on Reddit is an open invitation for more negative opinions and consequently(as per you) added anxiety. \n\nConsider leaving the subs in question (or even Reddit as a whole) and go back to focusing on the education and experiences Berkeley has to offer.\n\nPS: I highly doubt there\u2019s any reputable companies blacklisting Berkeley alumni, try to relax and live in the moment. You go to one of the best universities in the country; you will be fine. And good luck on the therapy.",

I am so sick of the negativity I really feel so lost in terms of the social aspect, reputation, job opportunity. I am sorry if I offended you it just makes me so upset to hear these things and i honestly feel so sick of all of this. My classes and academics are doing great.",

Sometime the bay area fog covers things up, and yes it is pretty hard at times to even see across the bay with the sun in your eyes. \n\nThat said, it's colorful and the campanile makes it easy to spot even in difficult conditions. \n\nThough to be honest if you want a good view, you really will need binoculars or something because the distance makes determining detail challenging regardless of ones visual acuity. \n\nI should also note that if one lived in Oakland or Emeryville, then the view is much better and easier, than if you were viewing even from the optimal spot in San Francisco. \n\nAnd certain areas of silicon valley like San Jose have no view of uc Berkeley at all, which was frankly disappointing.",

It\u2019s a unique place in the sense that not a lot of people will hold your hand, and you have to find the resources yourself. People are willing to help you succeed from the programs that I took part in whilst at Cal, but you need to find your niche and people who will help you succeed. Though I had the option to choose Cal, I\u2019m happy with my college choice so far.",
