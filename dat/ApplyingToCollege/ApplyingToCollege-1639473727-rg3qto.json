  "text": "Sorry this is gonna be weird and rambly\n\nIt is 1am where I live right now and I am so worried about my early decision that I'm sick to my stomach. I have tons of schoolwork to do but I've barely done any of it cuz I'm so worried about everything. My school's decisions come out at 3:30 pst I think. After using a  chance me website a few days ago I think I have like 50% chance of getting in ao I have no idea what to expect. I feel like I jinxed it for myself by talking about decisions so much at school yesterday.  I'm trying to convince myself that the school actually sucks but I can't stop envisioning everything I'll do once I get in.  It doesn't help that I was on their merch store website a few hours ago and I found a t-shirt that is sooooo drippy ahhh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nto everyone else out there, I wish you the best of luck (unless you're applying to the same schools me and the AOs are choosing between us /s)",

And if it helps, the same clothing manufacturers tend to provide the same style of college wear to multiple schools, changing just the school name and emblem.  So that drippy sweatshirt can likely still be yours.  But best of luck to you!",
