  "text": "\nMy situation is a bit unique. I go to a special education school for kids with learning disabilities and mental illness. As you could probably guess, these schools aren\u2019t known for their extracurricular opportunities. We don\u2019t have any clubs, or sports and the school isn\u2019t even open after classes end. I also can\u2019t do clubs at my local public school because I get home after clubs have already ended. \n\nI live in a rather rural area so there aren\u2019t many opportunities outside of schools. The opportunities that are available often conflict with my parents schedule. I need my parents to drive me since my area has no public transportation and I can\u2019t drive myself. Working a part time job is also out of the question because my parents won\u2019t allow it.\n\nAre there any ways for me to get involved in extracurriculars? I\u2019m interested in possibly joining academic teams such as debate and mock trial.",

Such as online Model United Nation events, or online math competition or vocabulary competition.\n\nIf you can, particulate in community service.\n\nYou can also literally involve yourself into your hobbies more intensely. Say you can start creating music or drawing, digital painting, maybe try hand at crafting? Cosplaying?\n\nAnything that isn\u2019t directly related to your primary academics (even a educational event that is NOT a required part of your academic syllabus) is considered extra curricular activity",
