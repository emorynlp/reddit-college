  "text": "I'm trying to move into student apartments near my college. They want a co signer that makes at least 45K to sign also (for everyone). I don't have someone that makes that much, what other route can i take/do?? Or tricks/tips. Thanks!\n\nEdit : My parents don't make that much; i'm using my chapter 33 GI Bill for school! And FAFSA for whatever it doesn't cover.",
