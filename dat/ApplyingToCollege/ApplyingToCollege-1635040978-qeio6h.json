  "text": "Hi,\n\nI just submitted my university of maryland application for early action and they asked for my official sat score report.   \n\"I acknowledge I need to send my official SAT/ACT scores by the deadline in order for my application to be considered complete. \"  \nDoes this mean I have until Nov 1st to press the send button on College Board, or do I need to do Rush Delivery now? Or is there a separate deadline for SAT score reports? Help!",
