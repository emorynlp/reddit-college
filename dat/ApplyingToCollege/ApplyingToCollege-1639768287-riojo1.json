  "text": "I made the decision based on fit, but I could comfortably afford all of my options. Turned down Brown, Tufts, Amherst, Williams, and my college doesn\u2019t break the USNWR T100. \n\nI\u2019m a political science and French major on a full ride scholarship. I\u2019m also involved in campus student government, community organizing in my city, and some teaching programs. Also heavily involved in a nonprofit I worked with in high school.\n\nI can speak to:\n\n- My experience so far versus my friends\u2019 experiences at Ivies, selective LACs, and non-selective LACs\n- My experience in the scholarship program\n- My experience with getting involved on campus\n- What it\u2019s been like staying in-state\n- My admissions process and decision-making process\n\nKeep in mind that I am only a freshman, too.",

          "text": "My school has around 15k undergrads, so it\u2019s smaller than a lot of the big state schools you might have in mind. Most of my classes so far have honestly been pretty small, with the biggest at around 35 students. It\u2019s only going to get smaller from now as I take mostly upper-level major classes that are usually around 20. I\u2019m also in a lot of honors classes (capped at 20) and seminar classes (capped at 8), so I feel like my experience isn\u2019t that different. \n\nI went to a large public high school where classes were around 30-40 people, so this is pretty standard for me, if not actually smaller in many cases.\n\nThe STEM classes and the gen-eds are the massive ones, AFAIK, but that seems to be true for most schools as well. \n\nJust adding here that the school feels way smaller than it is. I always see 1 or 2 people I know walking from Point A to B on campus!",

I also love my school a lot, but I went to a school with a huge prestige culture where over half of my classmates went to elite OOS schools. Everyone expected that I would go to HYPSM or something like that, basically. \n\nI had teachers and classmates make kind but inaccurate assumptions about my school (ie \u201cWhere are you headed next year? Harvard?\u201d) despite me not having shared where I applied. I then had to see the look of shock on their faces that they quickly tried to get rid of when I told them the actual school. I also had a lot of people say, \u201cidk\u2026 that\u2019s a dumb choice that I wouldn\u2019t make. You\u2019re screwing yourself over a bit,\u201d and other less generous things.\n\nEven now, I\u2019m in some scholarship groups that have a crazy prestige culture, and I\u2019m clearly the odd one out. \n\nI reassure myself knowing that I know what\u2019s best for me and my education. I\u2019m having a great time, and I\u2019m not ashamed of my school at all. Other people may judge me, but they\u2019re not the ones going to college with me. Also, my school has perks that they don\u2019t get, like really nice dorms, special treatment, early guaranteed registration, etc. \n\nI\u2019m lucky to have a really supportive family, so that\u2019s never been a problem. They were initially confused about my choice because price wasn\u2019t a factor at all, but they\u2019re totally on board now.",

I felt like the adults at my safety school *really* cared about my success during the admissions process and when I considered my time in school. They were committed to helping me out and winning me over, and I knew that support would continue in college. It has. I have great relationships with my professors and advisors/faculty mentors, and I know there are at least 5 adults on campus who care deeply about my success. \n\n2. I felt weird about the mission of top schools. I wanted to support public education and their whole \u201ceducating the elite\u201d mantra was weird to me. I also disliked the sellout environment with a lot of people going into finance/IB/consulting and didn\u2019t want to get sucked in. Lastly, I also wanted to work in the community, but I felt bad knowing I\u2019d contribute to a cycle of students leaving the area when they graduate and abandoning the work they did there. \n\n3. I didn\u2019t want to lose all the connections I\u2019d made in high school. I was really involved in my career field and had a huge, statewide network by the time I graduated. Staying involved with that work and those people has been a huge benefit. I\u2019ve gotten internships and EC positions and travel opportunities as a result of it that I wouldn\u2019t have if I left the area.\n\n4. The work I want to do in my career is based in my state, so there wasn\u2019t much a point in my leaving the area only to come back later and have to fight to build connections.",
