  "text": "I made the decision based on fit, but I could comfortably afford all of my options. Turned down Brown, Tufts, Amherst, Williams, and my college doesn\u2019t break the USNWR T100. \n\nI\u2019m a political science and French major on a full ride scholarship. I\u2019m also involved in campus student government, community organizing in my city, and some teaching programs. Also heavily involved in a nonprofit I worked with in high school.\n\nI can speak to:\n\n- My experience so far versus my friends\u2019 experiences at Ivies, selective LACs, and non-selective LACs\n- My experience in the scholarship program\n- My experience with getting involved on campus\n- What it\u2019s been like staying in-state\n- My admissions process and decision-making process\n\nKeep in mind that I am only a freshman, too.",

          "text": "My school has around 15k undergrads, so it\u2019s smaller than a lot of the big state schools you might have in mind. Most of my classes so far have honestly been pretty small, with the biggest at around 35 students. It\u2019s only going to get smaller from now as I take mostly upper-level major classes that are usually around 20. I\u2019m also in a lot of honors classes (capped at 20) and seminar classes (capped at 8), so I feel like my experience isn\u2019t that different. \n\nI went to a large public high school where classes were around 30-40 people, so this is pretty standard for me, if not actually smaller in many cases.\n\nThe STEM classes and the gen-eds are the massive ones, AFAIK, but that seems to be true for most schools as well. \n\nJust adding here that the school feels way smaller than it is. I always see 1 or 2 people I know walking from Point A to B on campus!",

I also love my school a lot, but I went to a school with a huge prestige culture where over half of my classmates went to elite OOS schools. Everyone expected that I would go to HYPSM or something like that, basically. \n\nI had teachers and classmates make kind but inaccurate assumptions about my school (ie \u201cWhere are you headed next year? Harvard?\u201d) despite me not having shared where I applied. I then had to see the look of shock on their faces that they quickly tried to get rid of when I told them the actual school. I also had a lot of people say, \u201cidk\u2026 that\u2019s a dumb choice that I wouldn\u2019t make. You\u2019re screwing yourself over a bit,\u201d and other less generous things.\n\nEven now, I\u2019m in some scholarship groups that have a crazy prestige culture, and I\u2019m clearly the odd one out. \n\nI reassure myself knowing that I know what\u2019s best for me and my education. I\u2019m having a great time, and I\u2019m not ashamed of my school at all. Other people may judge me, but they\u2019re not the ones going to college with me. Also, my school has perks that they don\u2019t get, like really nice dorms, special treatment, early guaranteed registration, etc. \n\nI\u2019m lucky to have a really supportive family, so that\u2019s never been a problem. They were initially confused about my choice because price wasn\u2019t a factor at all, but they\u2019re totally on board now.",

I felt like the adults at my safety school *really* cared about my success during the admissions process and when I considered my time in school. They were committed to helping me out and winning me over, and I knew that support would continue in college. It has. I have great relationships with my professors and advisors/faculty mentors, and I know there are at least 5 adults on campus who care deeply about my success. \n\n2. I felt weird about the mission of top schools. I wanted to support public education and their whole \u201ceducating the elite\u201d mantra was weird to me. I also disliked the sellout environment with a lot of people going into finance/IB/consulting and didn\u2019t want to get sucked in. Lastly, I also wanted to work in the community, but I felt bad knowing I\u2019d contribute to a cycle of students leaving the area when they graduate and abandoning the work they did there. \n\n3. I didn\u2019t want to lose all the connections I\u2019d made in high school. I was really involved in my career field and had a huge, statewide network by the time I graduated. Staying involved with that work and those people has been a huge benefit. I\u2019ve gotten internships and EC positions and travel opportunities as a result of it that I wouldn\u2019t have if I left the area.\n\n4. The work I want to do in my career is based in my state, so there wasn\u2019t much a point in my leaving the area only to come back later and have to fight to build connections.",

          "text": "That\u2019s a bit complicated. \n\nI definitely benefitted **a lot** by having a really strong education before college, and most of my classmates at my college don\u2019t have that advantage. As a result, I feel like I am generally the most or one of the most high performing students in all my classes this semester. But, I also am dealing with a really different set of circumstances and advantages. A lot of my classmates have to work 25+ hours per week or commute over 45 minutes to get to campus or take care of their family or work third shift to get a scholarship through the university. It\u2019s no wonder I have more time to perform better, plus I had a really strong foundation. \n\nI do, however, have a really strong group of peers who I would say have had the same advantages and foundations as me\u2014some in my scholarship or the other full ride scholarships at the school, some from the honors community, and some who are just super engaged. \n\nFor extracurriculars, again, a lot of people can\u2019t invest in campus activities in the same way, but the subset of people who can definitely rival the groups you\u2019d find at elite schools. \n\nWith a big school like mine, there\u2019s enough people in the really engaged group (despite being a lower percentage than you\u2019d find at somewhere like Harvard) to have strong extracurriculars. \n\nBut in the classroom, I do feel it a bit since some classes have to work overtime to make up for the weaker foundations of high school or otherwise simplify material. That\u2019s less of a problem at the upper level, though, I\u2019ve heard, and it\u2019s also not true for STEM classes which I see to be pretty uniform across all schools. Also, I\u2019ve heard the seminar classes I\u2019ll be taking in every future semester are rigorous and thoughtful. \n\nTL;DR: Yes, I\u2019ve found a group. Extracurriculars are involved, but classes are a bit less so.",

          "text": "Sure! \n\nI think I\u2019ll split it into a few categories: \n\nAcademic: \n\nI think LACs definitely have more rigorous freshman classes overall.\n\nTheir classes are smaller, and they\u2019ve had to write more essays and do more readings to support their learning versus me. This is true even at the LAC in my state with a very similar acceptance rate, and it\u2019s definitely true with my friends at more selective LACs. \n\nI think they\u2019ve had more seminar and discussion-style classes versus my lecture style classes (though again, I\u2019ve heard this difference goes away in upper-level classes). \n\nI think at LACs smaller class sizes also make attendance feel more mandatory since there\u2019s not as much anonymity, even if there\u2019s no attendance policy. \n\nProfessors, in my experience, are super friendly and are generous with their time. I feel like my professors are not research-obsessed people who see teaching undergrads as secondary, so I would say it\u2019s the same there.\n\nI would say that I also get a wider choice in classes due to having a bigger university, and I have more choice in professors for classes. A lot of my LAC friends have to take a specific class with a specific professor because the class is a requirement and only one professor ever teaches it. \n\nI also get a more generous AP credit policy, so I basically have an open curriculum. LACs (like a lot of other private schools) don\u2019t accept them as much, so people have more gen-ed\u2019s to complete. \n\nAt my school, honors students get to register first, so I always get the classes I want. There\u2019s no separation of registration at the LACs I know of, so my friends are more stressed about it.\n\nExtracurricular:\n\nI get more clubs because I\u2019m at a bigger school, so I have more options. This is less a factor with my friends at selective LACs because students as a whole are more involved there. \n\nI think my university has a strong alumni network and is well-known in the state/region. YMMV depending on the LAC\u2014some have big and strong alumni networks, some are more well-known than others. \n\nI find that research, internships, clubs, etc are available to me, but fewer people are directly telling me, \u201chey, you have this available.\u201d I need to seek out the resources more directly versus my friends at LACs. Same thing applies with the career center and their resources. \n\nMy university is in an urban area and my friends at LACs are in rural areas, so I find I have more opportunities to get involved in the community, though this is a result more of location. They still have opportunities, just numerically fewer because of their towns\u2019 sizes. \n\nSocial:\n\nI still feel like my school is pretty small, but if I want to avoid people, I can. My friends at LACs are guaranteed to see people they know *all the time* and in ways that make it hard to avoid them. \n\nMy food choices are better as a result of a bigger student body, especially for folks with dietary restrictions (although some LACs are known for having a good meal plan). If you have any restrictions, even just being vegetarian, PLEASE look into this ahead of time.\n\nI\u2019ve found my social life involves attending Greek parties (I didn\u2019t rush), but my school doesn\u2019t have a very high Greek percentage. I also just spend time with friends more casually most of the time, and we go to some parties at friends\u2019 apartments with like 15-30 people. My friends at LACs have more limited party options, but some of them have more Greek parties than me because more students rush. This is really dependent on the school itself. It can get claustrophobic for people, but others really like it.",
