  "text": "After having a 3.9 unweighted for my first two years, I got a 3.4 unweighted this semester. I had 3 as and 4 bs, all in AP classes.\n\nWill this downward trend affect me a lot if I decided to apply to selective schools? I'm pretty confident I can ace next semester, I basically just forgot how to take tests after two years off. My ECs are pretty good and unique, I'm just worried one semester will ruin everything.",
