  "text": "Hi, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am currently finishing up my UC application, and I want to report two EdX courses I am taking in the \"Activities and Awards\" section for Spanish. I merged them into one category under \"Independent Studies in Spanish\" as an Extracurricular activity, in which I also talked about my other Spanish pursuits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWould this be okay, or should I list those 2 EdX courses separately as \"Other Coursework\"?",
