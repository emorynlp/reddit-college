  "text": "Hello, \n\nI thought I'd wake up early to work on my college essays but I just ended up crying for almost 2 hours instead! \n\nWhy? You probably didn't ask? Well, my grades are dogshit!!! 2.3 at University, 2.950 at CC, after returning.... \n\nI did early college to get my associates, unknowingly failed PE, transfered to big boy college and got harrased, mental health spiraled, pandemic hit, 2.3 gpa end of first year \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4dwas hospitalized after a psychotic episode. Took a break, went back to same CC for 2 quarters (winter 2021, spring 2022), first quarter: A, A, A-; 2nd quarter A, A-, and an offer to write a letter of recommendation from my history prof!! Got my AA spring 2022, took another break, working on mutual aid, sub para educator, selling my art.  \n\nBright side: I think its safe to say I think there's a variety of material to work with for my essay. I get that only 2 quarters of good greats doesn't do much for the pattern of improvement, but it shows I tried God dammit! \n\nI want to get into an art school or a competitive in state school for art and history, with a 55% acceptance rate. \n\nChance me? Encourage me? I'm gonna start crying again lol",
