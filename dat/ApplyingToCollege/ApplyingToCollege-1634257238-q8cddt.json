  "text": "A friend and I have been working hard on a project for the ISEF science fair for a while. We have obtained research mentors and facilities and also have learned a lot about the subject. Over the summer, we asked our school's science fair admins if partner projects were allowed and they told us that they weren't. However, when we contacted our actual regional fair, they told us that our admins were completely incorrect and that partner projects were in fact allowed.\n\n We contacted them letting them know the good news that they were in fact allowed but they did not seem happy and they still seemed hesitant as it seems that they have a grudge against partner projects and that they are praying on our downfall.  Even more recently at the science fair club meeting, we were told by the same admins that ISEF no longer accepts team projects because \"they ran out of money.\"  We are pretty sure this is BS but are not 100% sure.\n\n Can anyone verify what the truth is?",

Teams competing at Regeneron ISEF must be composed of members who all meet Regeneron ISEF eligibility.\"\n\nThus implicitly permitting team submissions. Email ISEF with details of your administration's statements to confirm, and to leave a paper trail if something goes wrong.\n\nAs usual, high school admin is fucking stupid.",
