              "text": "If you're a junior, you still have most of junior year. Will you be able to get a 4.0 junior year gpa?  If so, then that's the best you can do, and even with Ivies, you will be in the mix because you have fantastic ECs and showed improvement.  If you think you might get some Bs this year, then step one is to do whatever you can to get straight As this year. Teacher tutorials, extra credit, video series, even private tutoring - maybe a hs senior or college student who went to your hs. Good luck!",
