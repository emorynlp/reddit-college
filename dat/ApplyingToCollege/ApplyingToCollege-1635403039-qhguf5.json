  "text": "So I made a mistake while filling out my common app, and have already submitted it to one college (my early decision). In the section \"Nationality and Geography\" the question was how long have you lived in the US, and I've accidentally put 17 years, but it's ZERO, I thought the question was how long have you lived outside the US. Should I email the college, or is there anything else I can do about this, really freaking out",
