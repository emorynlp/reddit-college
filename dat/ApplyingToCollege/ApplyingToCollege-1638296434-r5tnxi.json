  "text": "I am applying as a senior level transfer and am at the choose campuses section of the UC application. The schools UCLA, UC Merced, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara and UC Santa Cruz are all greyed out when I attempt to click on them to apply. Does anybody have an explanation for this? I double checked that I am applying for the fall 2022 section. The deadline is not supposed to be until tonight.",
