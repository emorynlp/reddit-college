  "text": "I found out what a scam college applications are. they're nothing like how i imagined it to be as a little freshman. it isn't brainstorming for days on end to find out who i really am nor is it a culmination of my 18 years as a person. I spent years of doing things for college apps only to find out that I should have done what I want to do instead of doing what I think the ao's think I like to do. \n\nI'm starting on the University of California's applications system. If I want, I can finish the entire thing and turn it in tonight. Same thing applies for all other universities. I can turn them all in literally right now. \n\nAs I write down the activities and awards that describe me, I feel no passion nor excitement over them. Orchestra? Forced to pick an instrument in middle school. Model United Nations? ao's love that, right? Community Service? I couldn't give a single shit about this toxic ass community of selfish humans that doesn't bat an eye what happens to me. I'm not a bright, optimistic person that my activities show. I'm not even the person I say I am in my personal essay that I spent countless hours toiling with my blood, sweat and tears over, which is a cycle im sure will repeat multiple times. Are you kidding me? I'm 18 years old. You want me to write about who I am? I don't even know who I am. \n\nI read my friend's personal statement. I had to do a double take to make sure it was his. The person described in 650 words in that word document that he sent me was something I could never picture him doing. \n\nThis isn't imposter syndrome. I'm actually describing someone that isn't me. For what? Just to burn over 100k a year, to get a piece of paper that says i spent over 100k a year? To study something that universities think I like studying? \n\nI took 2 SAT Subject tests last week. Due to a national holiday in my country, we have the week off this week. I was taking a break from overworking last week and playing some osu! and Genshin Impact like the weeb I am. As soon as i stop playing, my mother reminds me to update the family information in UCs. My mood suddenly plummeted. Why is it that simply mentioning the college application process can destroy my mood so easily? \n\nThere's so many things I wish I could have done differently if I could start high school again. Pursue activities that I truly enjoy, don't join clubs for college applications, study and play harder, sleep more, find out about my health condition sooner, exercise more, stress less, get a girlfriend, make friends sooner, take more AP courses, and the list goes on. \n\nThere is this feeling I never felt before. Whenever I feel happy, whenever I ace a test or do something that brings my mood up, I feel a certain dread approach me. It's telling me that I shouldn't be relaxing, or playing games, or reading light novels, or watching anime, and it's telling me that I'm not allowed to feel happy. Don't forget to edit your personal statement! Did you finish your college list yet? Which topics are you writing for the UC essays again? Which college in this university are you applying for? Are you sure you want to apply to this school? What makes this school different than this? Are you going to retake that good sat score because you screwed up the essay? Are you going to miss registration deadlines like last time?\n\nIt's October 6th. There's 26 days until early application deadlines for some schools. I don't even know what schools i'm going to apply to, let alone their individual deadline dates. And here I am, ranting about this to random strangers online, wasting my time that should be going into research and revising and editing. \n\nAs I finish writing this, I know exactly what I'm going to do after. I'm going to watch anime to forget what's coming up, pushing today's problems for tomorrow's me and hoping that tomorrow doesn't bring more problems. \n\nThe student i'm portraying in my application isn't me, but I don't even know if this is true because I don't even know what I am.",

I'm also boring too. No hobbies at all. Sometimes I feel the urge to Google \"fun hobbies\" so I don't seem so boring. \n\nAt this point though, you're right that college isn't really about showing who you are as a person. Why? Because it's impossible to take a person's life and write it on paper in just a few hundred words. No one can write an autobiography in 650 words. Just know that those activities do make you you, but it's just hard to see how it all ties together when everything seems so separate and independent. \n\nI think it's okay to relax. That's important to building who you are too! The college admissions process is tough and intensive. I believe in you though and that everything will work out okay!

I did whatever the hell I wanted in highschool and just zoomed through without ever thinking about college until late into my Junior year.

Now that I'm in college, I feel that the academic part of my life is almost all a scam because I sincerely don't believe I belong at the school I'm in now. Some people may call it impostor syndrome, but I don't think it's that, I'm literally the least qualified kid in my class and nobody will convince me otherwise because I literally was so lazy in hs meanwhile everybody else was and still are so passionate about academics. Like I literally think it's just another thing in my daily life and I don't even care about my future rn I'm just going with the flow as I always have done. I do NOT belong in my college, I swear to fucking GOD that my application made me look a million times better than I actually am.",

Maybe everything I wrote is actually just what I think colleges want to hear and I didn\u2019t even realize it. Idk, this turned into a rant too. I\u2019m just stressed and have like 35 essays to write in 2.5 months and I\u2019m at the point where I can\u2019t focus on making the perfect personal statement or anything anymore, even if just for there not being enough time alone.",

People get into a top school and then get complacent.\n\nJust try your absolute best and honestly you will be able to outcompete people from any school is work harder than them.

I've been struggling to even get the words out of my mouth and here it is, all my thoughts laid bare.\n\nEspecially this excerpt:\n\n>There is this feeling I never felt before. Whenever I feel happy, whenever I ace a test or do something that brings my mood up, I feel a certain dread approach me. It's telling me that I shouldn't be relaxing, or playing games, or reading light novels, or watching anime, and it's telling me that I'm not allowed to feel happy. Don't forget to edit your personal statement! Did you finish your college list yet? Which topics are you writing for the UC essays again...\n\nIt doesn't fucking go away. I thought I broke the cycle at the start of quarantine by giving myself time to pursue more hobbies but the dread persists. I used to daydream about making games as a wee little lad, and my favorite part was modeling assets. I learned how to use a proper 3D modeling software and rendered the most realistic fucking donut my monitor has ever graced.\n\nNothing. A small spark, then nothing.\n\n>The student i'm portraying in my application isn't me, but I don't even know if this is true because I don't even know what I am.\n\nI know the solution to this is to spend time figuring myself out and reevaluate my values, but it feels like the safe route for \"optimizing\" a college application is at odds with experimenting with my interests. Yes, I can pursue my interests while staying appealing to college, and a lot of my ECs I DID kinda enjoy, but the nugget of truth hiding underneath isn't as marketable as an easily quantifiable award. So you optimize the soul out of them until you have something to show for it. Far less risky to make a science fair project than to make an indie game, right?\n\nIt's one thing if it's a one-and-done deal. Shit, I threw away high school, didn't have much to do anyways, who cares? But how do I know this mindset ends here? Is this just a symptom of deeper misaligned values? How do I know \"T20\" won't just turn into \"top tech companies\"? If I don't know how to learn to balance myself now, how can I trust that I can guide myself on the tightrope of life when the safety net is gone (in what, like 5 years?). ***Why do I need this?***\n\nFucking hate it. I don't care if I don't know who I am yet, I just want freedom to figure myself out. I want fulfillment.",

I did exactly what you said you wished you did, just pursued what you wanted to instead of pursuing what you think ao's want. Instead of joining clubs, studying my ass off, doing all my work, and not having fun I was always in pursuit of myself. I saw that I can achieve greatness in other ways. Freshman year I said fuck being fat and started to go to the gym every day for the next 4 years (still do). That's a part of me that will always be around and an achievement always be thankful of. I can look in the mirror and be happy because I decided I didn't want to follow my coach's advice. I always sought out ways to make money and many times proved to be successful (shooting for business school here). \n\nMy junior year in highschool, instead of staying at home for online classes in the beginning of the pandemic I got a hard job working my ass off 50 hours a week and bought a 1990 Corvette 2 weeks before turning 17. When I was 16, I flew a plane on my own and solo'd. I maintained a hard labor job for 7 months and have a good rep with my boss. I'm now starting my own car detailing business this year along with several dropshipping sites with a close friend of mine. I also have a political internship thanks to a connection made through a car meet which is granting me many connections going into college admissions and figuring out where I want to go in life. If I were to give one piece of advice to someone who's not yet in the admissions process, just do you. Because of overwhelming support from my parents and the actions I took to pursue my several passions, I'm looking pretty good moving forward into college.",

Some people have different experiences than you that leads them to chose something or think they found themselves. Maybe they have, maybe they haven't. I would say the beauty about life is that it isn't linear. There is no rule for how fast your development should be or how slow,  the important thing is to keep learning about yourself, doing things that make you happy and not doing things to please others. If you feel like you've been doing a lot of the latter, ask yourself what is stopping you from doing what YOU want. If it's your parents then I think you need to talk to them and explain to them your feelings. Now what it sounds like to me is that you spent too much time doing something you didn't like and now you're feeling that you're left with nothing. I would say for that you need to think long and hard about things you enjoy doing, and then try to pursue those things. If you can't think of any right now don't worry! You have plenty of time to figure it out. Anyways, don't be too hard on yourself and have a good day!",
