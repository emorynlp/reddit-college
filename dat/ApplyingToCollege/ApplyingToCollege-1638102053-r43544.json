  "text": "i\u2019m really interested in taking cogsci, however i\u2019m afraid that my lack of experience/knowledge in the relevant fields (i.e. biology and psychology) will make my application weak.\n\nshould i just apply to another major that fits my classes and experiences more? (i know i can always easily switch majors to cogsci so i wouldnt mind doing this)\n\nthank you!",

Most colleges require, or at least strongly recommend three years of lab sciences, including bio, chem, and physics.  The strongest applicants to any school will have met/exceeded this.",
