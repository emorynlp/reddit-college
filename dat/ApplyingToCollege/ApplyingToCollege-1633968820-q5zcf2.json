Which school among these are best for ED and also which ones are relatively easier to get into for engineering(specifically computer engineering) compared to the other schools?\n\nHere is a link to my stats if needed:[https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/ph59xq/chances\\_of\\_me\\_getting\\_accepted\\_with\\_financial\\_aid/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/ph59xq/chances_of_me_getting_accepted_with_financial_aid/)\n\nedit: Please can you also include Vanderbilt in the list",
