  "text": "So I want to apply ED to some competitive schools, problem is, I want to explain the reasoning behind why I got 2 Cs and one D frosh and soph year. It was mainly because of the organizational problem within the schedule and idiocy from the faculty, which is why I transferred to a private HS and took a rigorous courseload there. Is it better to talk about this on the application, or should I just say less than necessary, considering that I will make it look like I cannot take responsibility?",
