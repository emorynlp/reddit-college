A bunch of universities in other countries are legally barred from making distinctions between local and foreign students, which is why they were asking.",

      "text": "Short answer is because they're American universities so obviously American citizens get the most spots. The longer answer is that pretty much all US universities (both public and private) get federal funding aka tax money from citizens. I've noticed a lot of international students think that only state universities get tax funding, but that is a huge myth. Private universities also get huge tax breaks for buildings, research funding, and scholarships and loans for domestic students. That is all from federal funds that citizens have paid their entire lives.",

      "text": "State universities have a charter to educate the residents of that state.  They tend to cap the total amount of both international and out-of-state domestic students, and tend not to award any financial aid.\n\nPrivate universities don't have the same sort of charter, and I don't actually know whether they have hard caps.  They likely have soft caps related to financial aid.  Either \"we don't give financial aid to internationals at all\", or, for schools that are need-blind for admissions, they may cap the % of internationals because this set of student is much more likely to need significant amounts of financial aid.  Admitting a larger % would blow up their financial aid budgets.",
