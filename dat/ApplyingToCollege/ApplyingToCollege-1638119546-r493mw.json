  "text": "If every single government of the world announces that students can apply to colleges only after they have finished their 12th grade.\n\nLIKE not making it compulsory, considering that some go to colleges even without getting to junior or senior high school. All I mean is, everyone applies to colleges during their senior year, but what if the norm was instead to apply after 12th grade and not during it.",

I know Physics 1/2 are gonna tank my GPA, and im planning on taking them when grad schools cant see them. If I had to wait until all my classes were finished before applying.... I'd probably take at least a 0.10 cGPA and 0.20 sGPA hit",
