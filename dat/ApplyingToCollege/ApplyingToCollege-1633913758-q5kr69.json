  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019m no longer a senior applying to college but I remember joining this sub and feeling out of place cause there weren\u2019t a lot of Art or Film majors out there. So if anyone is interested, I\u2019d love to offer some advice and share my stats + extracurriculars on how I got into Film School. \n\nIf you\u2019re interested, PM me but if this post gets enough traction I\u2019ll make a bigger post for everyone to see!\n\nI go to the University of Southern California, School of Cinematic Arts btw!",
