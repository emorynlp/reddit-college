  "text": "So I recently got hired for a job, about a week after I submitted my early apps. It doesn't really relate to my major at all, but it's nonetheless a pretty big time commitment (10+ hrs/wk), so I was wondering if it'd be worth emailing admissions offices about? My ECs are one of the areas of my app I'm most insecure about, so a part of me wants to notify them, but I also don't want to annoy the admissions offices if it won't really help. Thoughts?",
