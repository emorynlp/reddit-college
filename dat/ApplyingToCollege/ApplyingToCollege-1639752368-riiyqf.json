This is also why I love US schools, they don't have a cutoff. \n\nI've seen people w 1570, 1580 getting rejected and yet people w a 1480 get accepted (sometimes). \n\nSo, I'd honestly recommend sending to all T-20s if you have a 780+ in math (this prerequisite too, only if you're applying to a math heavy major)",
