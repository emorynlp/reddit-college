  "text": "I want to major in CS but i\u2019m having a lot of trouble deciding between Yale and Princeton SCEA. I know Princeton has great undergrad focus and a much better CS/eng department but from what i\u2019ve read about the schools, I like Yale\u2019s vibe and culture a lot better. How should I weigh these reasons and decide a school? Is it dumb to even consider Yale for CS over Princeton?",

      "text": "I'm a Yale first year who chose it narrowly over Princeton.  I would choose it again in a heartbeat, but from what you're describing I think Princeton is probably the right choice.  I am a strong advocate for \"going with your gut,\" but the intangibles like campus culture, vibe, friendliness are a lot easier to misrepresent than the strength of an academic program or employment opportunities.  Yale is friendlier than Princeton and its student body is probably happier but Yale and Princeton are just different shades of Ivy League.  If you can handle a higher workload and a lower GPA go to Princeton.",
