  "text": "Hello, I've already applied to all my schools and was wondering if there is a way to increase your chances of getting in, specifically for UMaimi. I've been thinking about emailing my admission Counselor and asking them directly but I don't know if that's the best way to go about it. Thank you!",

      "text": "I\u2019m surprised to say that UM actually does track demonstrated interest, so correspondence with an admissions officer can help. I\u2019m not saying you should email and ask \u201chow you can boost your odds\u201d though. Instead, ask questions about the application process or what happens after one is admitted, and in that email state that UM is your first choice, like \u201cI\u2019m definitely set on attending the University of Miami should the opportunity present itself\u201d blah blah blah. I will say though that I got into UM through EA with a big merit scholarship and I never made contact even once with my AO, nor did I engage with any of their events, email promotions, etc. Also read that they use demonstrated interest for kids that were deferred or are on the waiting list so idk how it can help rn before EA decisions are out.",
