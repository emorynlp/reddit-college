  "title:": "can i reuse my common app essay for the penn state personal statement?",
  "text": "penn state has an \u201coptional\u201d personal statement, and their prompt is extremely similar to the CA essay prompt i chose. the only problem is my CA essay is 650 words while penn states personal statement is 500. should i skip the personal statement and just send my common app essay? i should also note that the common app personal essay is also optional for penn state. so i\u2019m not sure if i should do one or the other, or if penn state favors their personal statement over the common app essay. should i shave down my OG essay for the personal statement and not include the common app essay submission? \ud83d\ude2d. really frazzled.  any advice?",

      "text": "Yes, you can condense your Common App essay.\n\nCommon App says Common App essay is \u201coptional\u201d for Penn State, which means Penn State has the option to use it.  However, a Penn State AO told me directly \u201cwe will not download, read, or otherwise consider your Common App essay as part of your Penn State application.\u201d",
