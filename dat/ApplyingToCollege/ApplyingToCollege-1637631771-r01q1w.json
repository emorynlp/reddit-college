  "title:": "I'm an online, homeschooled Sophomore/Junior and completely clueless on applying to colleges.",
  "text": "Howdy ho! I'm a 17 year old, 100% online high schooler as of last year. Middle school was always rough for me, and public high school was outright impossible for me to navigate socially. So, my mom offered online school as an escape, and I jumped at the opportunity. As I am brand new to the non-public life, I have zero clue on 'how to adult', if that's the right expression, and I am super stressed out about it. \n\nI have no idea how to get SAT/ACT testing, how to begin the application process, what I need on a 'transcript' or whatever to make my admission worthwhile (according to the internet, and my old school teachers, you need to \\*wow\\* the university people... and I have no sports/extracurriculars to my name \ud83d\ude2c), how to write an admission essay (I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THIS EXISTED OUTSIDE OF APPLYING FOR SCHOLARSHIPS OR SUPER FANCY, IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS!?!?!), and whatever other mysteries exist in the process. I always figured that public school would groom/prepare me, offer volunteer/internship opportunities, give me the big fancy tests, and help nudge me into the university(ies) of my choosing, with my mom tying up the loose ends. Now that I'm online, I feel like I'm naked in a blizzard. \n\nMy mom keeps talking about how I'll just *get into college* with very little explanation as to HOW that will happen. I'm sure that she can get the basics done for me, but I'm extremely unnerved about not knowing the logistics of it all. Honestly, I have no backup plan outside of getting into college. It just seems like the natural next step and, though I'm not 100% set on a specific field, I want to get a degree. \n\nEverything is so confusing and stressful- ACK! Help, please. Obviously, this is a very open-ended (?) post, and there are a MILLION options/pieces of advice that I'm vaguely asking for, but I would just like some direction. Anything, lol.",

      "text": "My grades haven't been amazing recently (Mostly B's, C's, and one or two D's) but that has been on account of my mental health and *shaky* work ethic. I am actively working on changing this, though, and this is my first step.\n\nThis stressor has been in the back of my mind ever since I started online, but I only recently realized how much it has been affecting me. I feel like there is no point to doing well in school because I likely won't get into college. If I can't get into college I don't have any life plans, and if I don't have any life plans why even try? \"I'm doomed already, so screw this Algebra assignment.\" Existentialism and what-have-you do not pair well with my depression.\n\n\\--------------------------------\n\nAlso, I am SO down for any form of community service! I've been looking for a semi-social outlet, and I love to help people. My school work is very flexible, and I don't have a solid job  to tie me to a schedule. I'm willing to put in that form of work, if need be.",

          "text": "Actually, I also go to onine school and I completely understand! \n\nI guess it would depend on what kind of online school you go to. If it's a Stride (formerly K-12 inc) affiliated one then you have a lot less to worry about! Those kinds of online schools are much like regular schools, just online. You'll still have transcripts and hopefully a counselor to dicuss credits, LOR's etc with. Some schools also have clubs that you can join and find on their websites. \n\nIn regards to testing, you can still take standarized tests! Again, its a it depends on your online school type thing. For example, if you do have a counselor then I'd try emailing them and asking about the process. Otherwise, I'd try reaching out to school districts in your area and see if they'd allow you to take the test there! Some places will allow you eventually and in some states especially, they have to.  \n\nWhen thinking abouts clubs and other EC's, I definitely get a head start now and try and do something over the summer. Beyond just any school clubs (if you have them), try looking around your community. Church (if you do that), Boys and Girls clubs, and other organizations do exist and have things you can take part in! If volunteer work is what suits your fancy I'd try looking around online (I had a good volunteer site I'll try and find) and see if there are any opportunities like in nursing homes or shelters. \n\nYou can also sometimes participate in sports or clubs at your local school district.",

I'd look into schools with high acceptance rates whose programs you like! \n\nI think I covered everything but if I didn't don't hesitate to PM or tag or comment or whatever if you have more questions or need clarification.",
