Also focus on your SAT and ACT scores, they can be a big help if your GPA is low (mine weren\u2019t fantastic, 1120 SAT). Also try to get involved in as much as you can and try and find something you\u2019re passionate about and take advantage of that!",

I was denied by so many colleges even though I had great ECs and rigorous courses. Good news is there\u2019s always hope! Im doing so much better in college and made the deans list my first semester!
