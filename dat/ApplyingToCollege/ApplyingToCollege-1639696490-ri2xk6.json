  "text": "Basically title. I have never been punished before and this was my first time getting a consequence. I wasn\u2019t suspended for this. I only got a letter to the parents then the school said they\u2019ll be keeping this on the record and transcript.\n\nEdit: if it helps I go to a private school in Canada",
