  "text": "Some outside conflicts got in the way of me submitting my documents at a reasonable time through IDOC. I\u2019m not making this post to be scolded for not submitting them on time - lesson learned. However, does MIT have hard deadlines on their financial aid documents? The EA deadline is tomorrow and I sent mine in to be processed 2 days ago. I find it unbelievable that I wouldn\u2019t get aid just because my documents were processed a couple days or even hours after the deadline.",
