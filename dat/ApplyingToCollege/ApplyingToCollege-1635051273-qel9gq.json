  "text": "I want to send one common app for bsmd programs and one for undergrad only. If I remove half the schools on EA list which are bsmd programs, submit common app, and then add them back, then add back the bsmd schools, will the rec letters stay or will they be deleted. Ik I can just ask my teachers to submit it again but it\u2019s just a hassle \n\nI want to split it cuz the undergrad major I\u2019m applying for has nothing to do with med school( math or engineering) so I don\u2019t want to let them know I\u2019m going for doctor career",

Schools don\u2019t see other schools to which you apply. And you say you would ask teachers to submit again, so you don\u2019t seem to be hiding anything from teachers.",
