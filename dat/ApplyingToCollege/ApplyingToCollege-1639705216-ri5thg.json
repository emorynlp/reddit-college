  "text": "so i got deferred from stanford, but for next semester i am dropping from an ap art class to a regs video game design class. not because it was hard and i was failing, in fact i have a 99 but the new regs class which i\u2019m replacing my ap art class with fits more with my major and i am more interested in it too. my only concern is that it will look like i\u2019m a quitter, when instead i\u2019m switching to find a class that better suits my goals (it\u2019s video game design which is still kinda art related but not exactly pure art). additionally, would it be a red flag since one of my main extracurriculars is art and i\u2019ve been doing it for all of highschool? i still have lots of outside of school art things going on, i just won\u2019t be taking art in school. thank you!",

      "text": "Literally do not panic. Unlike quite a few other schools, deferral from stanford is actually really good. Iirc they only accept + defer about 20% or less of applicants. So that means you actually have a pretty good shot! Just focus on being the squeaky wheel, update them with anything new in ECs, go for plenty of supplementals, and show off your passion! \n\nAnd for the second thing, having diverse interests from your major is definitely not bad! Sure stanford wants passion and leaders in certain areas, but they also want well rounded students! If you think it\u2019s worth it, submit a piece or two if you haven\u2019t already! Maybe it can help",

      "text": "I can promise you Stanford will not reject you over this. Stanford is one of the very few schools, imo, that stays true to its view of holistic admissions. It is probably the most random school to get accepted into. Few people get deferred, so you are definitely on their radar! Absolutely send them a LOCI. I\u2019m not sure if I would include the class on it, because in their minds, they probably aren\u2019t even thinking about the class. Drawing their attention to this detail could actually bring up what-if situations in their minds.",

But, if it makes you feel more comfortable, maybe you should contact the admissions officer and ask them? You can also put it in additional information and just explain what you are doing",
