  "text": "Ok, literally all I want from college is to be able to to do exactly that, what I just said, in a supportive and slightly challenging environment. I\u2019ll elaborate, but if there\u2019s a school that comes to mind right away, I would love any recommendations, anything would be helpful, the internet is so bad at this stuff. (Btw 1500 SAT 3.9 gpa, and noice extracurriculars, looking into med school after college, interested in math bio physics and visual arts, if that helps with anything)\n\nI was looking into applying to northwestern ED, I love their pursuit of interdisciplinary instruction, small class sizes, amazing academic advising\u2026. And that\u2019s really about all, after doing more and more uncovering of what the school is really like it honestly just seems too stressful, like I, not only a person with intense ADHD, but also someone who does horribly under pressure, feel like I would be destroyed there.\n\nSo yeah I really just want a tight bit community of people, smart and driven people (I know the stereotypes, but I really mean it) who integrate that intelligence (see what I did there, \u201cintegrate\u201d) with every aspect of their life.\n\nLike the main thing that turned me away from NU was that they say they have a work hard play hard mentality, and like I just don\u2019t want to do either of it hard, like I see no point, my playing is working so I don\u2019t need to do either hard yk?\n\nI kinda want it to be like when you run into your friends dad when your high and actually have a really complicated and engaging convo. Like that\u2019s what drives me academically.\n\nI also don\u2019t just mean that I would get high all the time or anything, I more mean I just want it to be like an absurdly intellectually driving, but also empathetic and beautiful school. (That\u2019s why I say calculus, cause I think of it as exactly that)",
