  "title:": "I was a B student in high school, did well at a state school for undergrad, and now I'm at MIT for a PhD",
  "text": "As a high school student, I definitely fit the bill of a depressed, unmotivated student wasting their potential. I would consistently show up late or occasionally skip school, and I only started working on assignments the night before they were due. I was in the IB programme, and my GPA was around a 3.1 with a handful of Cs and 2 Ds. I had a 1370 on my SAT which is good, but not incredible. At the end of my junior year, I realized that I was only setting myself up for failure in life and I wanted to start trying in school for once. I would go to places like collegeconfidential and feel like shit about myself because of my grades. Sites like these naturally attract the high achievers, which is fine, but it's demoralizing going online trying to get a better education and seeing peers list your reaches as safeties. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI ended up going to a state school for college (not going to name names for privacy reasons, but think Ohio State, Arizona State, etc.) and found a subject I was passionate about. More importantly, I found the motivation to work hard and go the extra mile because I was sick of not living up to my own expectations. 4 years later, and now I'm the first person from my department to ever attend MIT. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason I want to make this post is to tell the people who feel this way that you can still go on to do big things (even in school!) despite a mediocre high school GPA. If you have any questions you can comment or DM me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd be happy to send proof to the mods if they want.",

My department is relatively small so I'd rather not broadcast it to the world.\n\nThere were definitely times I felt like down on myself. I think it's completely normal to feel like you aren't as good as others, most people are their own biggest critic. It's easy to be upset with yourself for doing worse than a friend on a test, not getting a topic as quickly as someone, whatever. You'll probably complete around 200 assignments, exams, and quizzes through your college career; you're bound to do poorly on some of them regardless of your competency.",

This might sound weird, but in general I'd say big state schools are better than small private schools for undergrad researchers. They are usually bigger which lets you explore more niche subjects, more professors doing different work, and UROPs (look if your schools have them) are great and are offered at most state schools. If you make the most of your undergrad you can go anywhere you want.\n\nThe best advice for a potential grad school applicant is to get involved in research as soon as possible.",

Professor X could allow anyone into her class by signing the form, regardless of whether the person had the prereqs.\n\nI discovered a department that kept the blank forms on a counter top. It was super-easy to just grab a few, then scrawl something illegible that passed as a signature. After that, I ignored prereqs and took whatever I wanted.",

If your school has 200 students in your class and 20 get a PhD, that's better than if your class has 10000 students and 990 get a PhD.\n\nHowever I agree LACs can be good pre-PhD schools, especially since the students self-select as academically motivated and usually from high familial incomes.",

          "text": "This is info I\u2019ve acquired somewhere.\n\nOne of your brain\u2019s functions is to constantly assess yourself in relation to others, and to produce emotions to help guide your behavior towards exceeding or matching the perceived status of others. It\u2019s a useful process for species as they are constantly self-evaluating and competing within the group to be \u201cthe best\u201d. I\u2019d say it has the potential to produce incredible amounts of motivation in organisms, especially in us as our consciousness can direct that process to the most precise of details (which college you got into). A self regulating process for the group at the individual level to make sure everybody is on their perceived \u201cA-game\u201d gives you a species that may be more likely to survive in the long run. Social pressure is a deep-rooted, emotionally connected aspect of us and that\u2019s why it is so common and powerful.\n\nJust wanted to bring this up because you mentioned being stressed, and it\u2019s not sad when it is something your brain is meant to do given the circumstances. Maybe being aware that this pressure is partially a natural inner manifestation may help you align your perceptions to where you want them and what\u2019s best for you, given enough time figuring that out. Or it may give you the ability to assess what others expect of you, gauge it\u2019s importance, and how big of a deal it really is. This stress about \u201cstatus\u201d can also compound with the financial stress I\u2019m sure. \n\nIn a way we all delude ourselves daily because we should all just feel better or grateful that we were not born into slavery or something awful. But organisms are not \u201cdesigned\u201d to waste resources feeling blessed and content for their current situation. It\u2019s all about the now, everybody else, and what\u2019s up next. Or if things seemed better in the past then it is all about that nostalgia I guess haha.",

      "text": "Your post really resonates with me OP. I by no means want to hijack your post, but I want to add on some things because I am very much like you but have some minor differences that may apply to/help other people. \n\nI was vastly unmotivated in highschool, had crippling untreated ADHD, barely graduated, didn\u2019t have a license, and was addicted to a multitude of drugs that impaired my ability to truly introspect and figure out what I wanted in life. I was told not to even apply to college by my highschool advisors, but I did apply to an art school that accepted everyone and had a massive dropout rate, which was illustrated well once I dropped out a couple years later. I was the epitome of what you would imagine when you see someone not meant for higher education. \n\nAfter a few years of washing dishes for a living and thankfully having some support from my saint of a mother who believed in me, I went to community college while working with the intent of transferring to a state school. Much like OP, I dropped it into gear and dug in at my state school and made the deans list every semester and graduated summa cum laude. \n\nI\u2019m writing this in the first semester of my doctoral program and can tell you first hand that your past, your previous performance in life, or your own perceptions of yourself do not, and will never define you. You should always bet on yourself. It is okay to fail in life, and it will happen frequently, the most important part is that you fail forward. \n\nI\u2019m writing this with the hope that someone who is in a similar situation to the one I was in as a confused and mixed up teen can know that there is always another way. Believe in yourself, apply yourself, and treat life like a marathon, not a sprint. Some days will be harder than others, but you just have to keep plugging along.",

I went there and pretty easily made mostly A's and a few B's (mainly in 'extra' classes like Physical Education and Studio Art because I didn't take them as seriously despite being required) while I was in the AP program.  Graduated in the top of my class.\n\nDidn't get to MIT, Stanford, or any of the Ivy Leagues, but managed to get into a decent second tier (T20) school.  Turns out that I had been coasting for so long that by the time I got to sophomore year, I was in for a huge shock.  I went from getting straight A's to getting a D in organic Chemistry.  Things kind of went downhill from there for a while until I found a way to make things right again.\n\nMy problem?  Looking back was that I didn't see things long term.  I didn't know what I wanted to do.  I bounced around a pure science major to a liberal arts major to an engineering major.  \n\nOn the other hand, I knew a perfectly mediocre kid who went to the local state university and majored in History and English, and somehow managed to crack his way up to a decent Master's in Public Administration, worked at City Hall for a while, then applied for Harvard Medical and got in.\n\nIf anything that should tell you that if you play your cards right you should still be able to pull things back if you plan well and see things long term.",

He was in a few AP classes, and did a few extracurriculars, but nothing stellar. He went to a very small rural college and wanted to be a math teacher so he started off as a math major. He ended up injuring himself participating in a sport he loved, and it's a very region specific sport. He realized he'd likely never be able to compete in that sport again, so after spending 9+ months in the hospital he got his grades up and transfered schools to a very large state school. He switched majors to a certain biology major, and did much better in high school. He wanted to go to mee school, but knew he didn't have the grades to get in, so he got his masters at the same school in that biology subject. This time he was a stellar student and had a 4.0 GPA. He applied for med school and got rejected from all the programs he applied to, so he started looking for jobs. He ended up getting super lucky with the job he got as he worked at one of the biggest research centers in the world, and he worked on cancer research with some of the leading scientists. The connections he made there and the prestige that working there earned him gave him a leg up and he was finally able to get in to a very very good med program. From there, he did his residency at a very well known hard residency program. He eventually got accepted into the Harvard fellowship program, but ended up going to a different fellowship program because the guy who was currently the fellow there said he didn't like it. He gives lectures all over the country now at tons of prestigious schools. So never give up on what you dream of becoming!",

For me, the single worst thing about high school was the lack of freedom: they forced you to take these specific classes at these times of the day and raise your hand to go to the bathroom. \n\nIn college, nobody gives a fuck if you pay attention, take notes, wake up to go to class, or turn in your homework. The only person who cares about your success is you. What I realized is that if you want to do well the onus is on you to start that habit. My freshman year, I literally went to the library every single day for hours to work on homework. The first two weeks were a slog, but after that it was just a routine that was easier to keep than change up.\n\nMotivation has the half life of 10 seconds, form habits.",

I was honest and I told the prof that I looked up some videos on the topic and it seemed cool, and I don't know if I want to go to grad school but I'd like to try out research.\n\nIf you want to do a PhD or a research master's, if possible I'd do research at your school or an REU over an industrial internship. Industry internships are still good, but you only have a limited amount of time in undergrad and ultimately, grad schools care about your ability to perform research.

I considered transferring to a fancier school during undergrad but I ultimately decided against it. It's not like they're going to teach some special version of math just because you pay them more money.\n\nWhat I think really differentiates top schools from the others is how competent your peers are and, because of that, how quickly your class are allowed to move. From my experience, people from my cohort who came from higher ranked schools were probably more learned than those who weren't. I didn't see a big difference in competency despite the knowledge gap, and I think admissions committees would agree. To sum up: is there a difference? Yeah, it's probably a bit easier from a higher ranked school. Would I pay $200k to find out? No.",
