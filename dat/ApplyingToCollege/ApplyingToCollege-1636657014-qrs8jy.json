  "text": "I'm applying for Washington&Lee as an international student in ED1. Anyway, I asked them for a CSS waiver through the financial aid mail but apparently I have to fill out a form and could wait up to 2 weeks for a response. The question is: how long can I expect to actually wait? Is the 2 weeks number just a maximum or close to the average?",
