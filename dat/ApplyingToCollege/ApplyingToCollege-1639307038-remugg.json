  "text": "tl;dr: International junior with relatively low GPA and no ECs, realistic chances of building my curriculum by 2022 RD for top schools, and if not, as a transfer.\n\nSo I'm in my junior year of Spain's highschool equivalent, and I've been thinking for a while that maybe I should try to apply with financial aid to Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Yale and Amherst; but I'm not really sure if I could make it past the initial review, due to my average grades in freshman and sophomore years. I should also add that I've no particularly interesting EC or award, but I'm confident I can rank first in my hs and get a 1550+ on the SAT, and I've seen people getting into these universities with 1400s so maybe this would be representative of my academical progression.\n\nNow, my question is: should I even bother to apply? With relatively low GPA and nothing interesting to put in my application yet,should I start working now towards building my curriculum? Or maybe wait 3 years and try to get in as a transfer student? Or straight up not apply?\n\nPlease no \"You don't lose anything by trying\" or \"It's pure luck just apply\", I'm confident they will throw my application away the moment they see my transcript. Thank you in advance.",

It is to land the best possible college that your financial and academic situation allow. \n \n\nAn application strategy includes applying to realistic target schools. \n\n\nSo I would say if your whole college strategy is simply to apply to a bunch of highly selective extreme reach schools, you are wasting every body\u2019s time, yours included.",

Work on improving your grades and getting involved in some ECs that you\u2019ll enjoy. Most colleges are need aware for internationals so whether you get into one school over the other could depend on how much you willing to pay. If you qualify for a fee waiver make sure to apply to as many schools as you can(that give good aid) because sometimes getting into college can be completely random. Hope this helps!",

I'm now taking my first year of the baccalaureate having graduated already from secondary school and I'm confident that I can finish 11th grade with honors and 12th grade as \"valedictorian\". And I know that it doesn't scream that's why I'm asking if I could realistically start working towards my app to be at least considered a qualified student into these top schools.",
