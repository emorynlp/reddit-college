  "text": "Soooooo on U Miami\u2019s (Oxford) app they say \u201cIf you are admitted under an Early Decision plan, you must promptly withdraw the applications submitted to other colleges and universities and make no additional applications to any other university in any country. If you are an Early Decision candidate and are seeking financial aid, you need not withdraw other applications until you have received notification about financial aid from the admitting Early Decision institution.\u201d meaning that if I tell the school I\u2019m going to attend I can\u2019t just dip and go to another school without telling them, or that I won\u2019t accept any waitlist offers right. My mom is telling me it\u2019s saying that if I just get accepted I have to go. I\u2019m still going to message my counselor as well I think but if I\u2019m gonna look stupid I\u2019d rather look stupid on Reddit. Cheers",
