I sent an update abt an award I got in an EC, but it wasn\u2019t a big deal and I doubt it affected my admission. Ik a ton of ppl here who got in after deferral. Yale will just look at ur app again in the context of the RD applications",

But don't stress too much; the letter of continued interest and email to your interviewer is really all you can do.",
