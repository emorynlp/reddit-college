  "text": "Well, Indian international and my school does massive grade deflation.  \nChance me has become depressing, got rejected from Cornell today, and it is simply because in 9th and 11th they fucked everyone over and do not share school profiles or class ranks etc.  \nWhy deflate, i do not even get it.  \nThey basically deflated dreams, not even scores.   \nI HATE HIGHSCHOOLS",
