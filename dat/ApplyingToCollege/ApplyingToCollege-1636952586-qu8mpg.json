  "text": "i'm getting ready to submit my uw application (IF THE COALITION APP STOPS BEING ASS) and i'm reporting my sat score since its above their 75th percentile (and they're not even using it for decisions so. i guess it doesn't even matter lmao) but i took the november sat to try and up my score for my other schools. i indicated on the coalition app that i took it more than once but since those new scores aren't out yet, is there something i could do to indicate the new scores if they're higher (which i expect to be the case)? i'm not too concerned if theres not because of the reasons above !!! but im just wondering if there's something i can do",
