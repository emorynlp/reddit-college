  "text": "Hello again, people of /r/ApplyingToCollege! I am now a graduate of the College of William & Mary and the University of St. Andrews [International Honors](https://www.wm.edu/as/undergraduate/more-pathways/standrews/) Program. I'm now pursuing a PhD in History at a different public university, also in the South. \n\nI did an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/74nv7p/william_mary_freshman_ama/) here as an innocent freshman which in retrospect is too rose-tinted to be very useful, and another [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/hr9y2t/rising_senior_at_william_mary_university_of_st/) as a rising senior that still holds up. \n\nI've taken a bunch of History courses, have gotten really involved in Swing and Ballroom dancing on both campuses, been fairly active in student research, museum volunteering, and admissions tour guiding.\n\nI cannot say I have a great deal of knowledge regarding admissions, but can certainly now speak even more lucidly about the university experience. So yeah, ask me anything!\n\nHigh School Stats: GPA was 4.0 (95.5 unweighted) and 2060 old SAT superscored (750 English, 660 Math, 650 Writing). I took the US and World History SAT IIs as well (780 and 800 respectively). I am also an Asian male (Chinese-American) and out-of-state student.",

      "text": "One observation:  that you now disavow your freshman AMA might argue against college freshman doing AMAs in general (or not), and/or high school folks putting much stock in the wisdom of college freshmen.\n\nAm curious:  when you were at  St. Andrews, were your courses taught by St. Andrews faculty and/or were you in class with local students?  If so, how did those courses compare to the ones you took in the U.S. w/ largely U.S. students?  Harder, easier?  Significantly different in some other way?",

          "text": "I wouldn\u2019t disavow freshman AMA\u2019s in general.  But they do have to be taken with a grain of salt.  My two guys had an amazing freshman year and their overall college experience \u2014 they graduate this year \u2014 has been terrific professionally, academically, and socially.  But you can also find students who attended that very same school at precisely the same time and were disappointed in their experience.  So much depends on how ready you are for the college experience, how much effort you put into it, and whether your dream school (God, I hate that phrase and notion) was really a good fit.",

          "text": "Completely fair! I will say it really depends on the person. When I did my first AMA I had not even completed my Fall semester and was still riding the high of attending my dream school (I agree with /u/HappyCava, I definitely subscribed too much to the term as a high school senior). I think freshman perspectives can be helpful, especially for high schoolers interested in what their first year might be like, but I personally think I wasn't in a great position to be giving advice. \n\nI will speak mostly to humanities classes here (I don't really know much about how STEM works at St. Andrews, and languages operate slightly differently). St. Andrews operates on a lecture / tutorial system for the first two undergraduate years (known as \"sub-honours\"). You attend lecture a certain number of times a week, and you have a tutorial, a small seminar-style meeting with a tutor (your discussion leader, grader, and main point of contact for the course) once a week. You sign up for specific tutorials at the beginning of the semester and have the option of picking your tutor. \n\nBecause of this, it feels very different from most American systems. I found it easier personally, as in general I think St. Andrews assigns far less work than American universities (including W&M), and due to the tutorial setup, you only need to be prepared for a given class once a week. It also helps that you typically only take three classes a semester in your first two years (sub-honours) and two a term in your final two (honours), and for those you don't even have lectures. However, less assignments mean that each one counts more, especially for final papers / exams that can be up to ~60% of your final grade. I liked the workload and did well in the St. Andrews system, but those finals can be a killer, and some departments definitely grade harsher than others. \n\nWhen you are in the International Honors program, you are properly both a W&M and St. As student, so you don't take any separate classes sans a one-credit pass/fail at W&M designed for you to get to know your cohort. \n\nSt. Andrews has a really international student body, so the feel of the community is certainly very different. Very upper- to middle-class in general, especially from England, across Europe, and the United States. There are actually a ton of Americans attending St. Andrews, as it's an open secret that the university's been actively recruiting in the US for extra tuition dollars. As of 2019, Americans comprise [16% of the student population.](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/st-andrews-top-of-the-class-for-americans-r70td6bq8)",

It was a wonderful four years, but I'll admit it wouldn't have been sustainable without my parents footing the bill, and the student loans would've been too high for me to justify going otherwise.\n\nI will note that if you're specifically an in-state student with a lot of financial need, the program can actually get really good aid coverage.",

It's just the nature of the beast; in-state tuition is a wonderful thing and these are all well-regarded colleges and universities.  From my NOVA college kids' perspectives, however, it's not something that should concern you.  On the bright side, you might find a roommate you already like and enjoy who can accompany you to freshman events, activities fairs, and the like until you find a wider group of friends.  And if you prefer to expand your social gang and not hang out with people from high school you simply don't affirmatively try to find them and hang out with them.  There are thousands of students, hundreds of clubs, and a multitude of classes.  You'll definitely have the opportunity to meet people outside of NOVA.",
