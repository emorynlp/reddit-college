  "text": "Holy shit man. When they gave me my first school email in elementary school and it used my graduation year in it, I was like \"2019? No way. That's so far off, it'll never happen.\" My kiddy brain could not comprehend that someday it would be 2019 and I'd be a senior. Now it's actually here. I'm just kinda stunned.\n\nTime moves too quickly for my dumb ass. Anyway, happy new year A2C!!!",
