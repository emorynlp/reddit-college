  "text": "As ED1 decisions come out and RD and ED2 deadlines are approaching, I have been extremely conflicted about whether or not to ED2 to NYU. I think my safeties Ohio State and IUB are fantastic schools, but NYU's environment just feels like the perfect fit for me. Thus, I want to ED2. However, NYU is quite expensive and I'm not sure if I'm able to easily switch majors if I am dissatisfied with studying Liberal Studies at NYU. If NYU truly gave me no aid at all, would I be able to compare other aid packages and back out of the ED agreement if the tuition is something like 70k+? Would this be unethical?",

Don\u2019t expect more aid than what the NPC gives you, but if what you\u2019re offered is significantly different from the NPC, you could negotiate with NYU or back out of the ED agreement.",

      "text": "The agreement is generally more \"ethical\" than binding and rarely enforced. At most if two institutions contact each other (rare, but the top ones do share lists) and find a student applied Early Decision to both, then both might remove the applicant from the admissions process altogether. If you were to get a big financial package at another school AND accepted at NYU ED with little or no aid, the ethical thing would be to contact your admissions counsellor right away and explain the situation. You would likely be let off with a mild scolding. Personally, I would not apply ED unless I was sure I could afford the school and be fully committed to going there. Consider this a real world life test. It's like taking a job on contract at $150,000 a year and two weeks later being offered a better job at another company for $300,000. Do you burn bridges at company A and bail for the better offer? Part of that decision is ethical and part is contractual. If there are little or no real world consequences (as here) the real decision is ethical.",
