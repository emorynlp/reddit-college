Like I\u2019m in undergraduate student government and we actually do a lot, also the PR chair of a committee managing 2.4 million and also on FSCUE for admissions and aid ahah. What I dislike is you don\u2019t realize how rigorous the coursework is. I had some great professors and 2 which weren\u2019t the best (gave tons of work and not flexible) some classes (usually tech classes) professors mainly teach you the basics and let you find out the complex stuff or may expect you to know more than most other schools will. Thing is, if you get in they automatically hold you to a standard you may not be used to, atleast I wasn\u2019t. That being said, there is a lot of academic support just need to utilize it. Inbox me if you need anything case related, and as I said I\u2019m also part of admissions and aid if you have any questions on that end.",

La Universidad Nacional del Sur is a great university if you're from Argentina, not if you're from any other country. UBA is probably the go-to as an international student, yet it has a lot of flaws: classes so filled people have to sit on the floor or outside the classroom, protests almost every day and you don't know when the university will be closed until you get there, professors never (or at least not so often) giving high marks; if you're used to be a A-straight student you'll have a rough time (10/10 is close to impossible, 9-8/10 is really hard, 7/10 you had luck on your side, 4/10 you celebrate because at least you passed). \n\nArgentina as a whole is a disaster. Inflation, dollar in the skies, high crime rates, etc. Homophobia isn't really an issue here, but racism is. Look up \"Argentina president racist comments.\" Is more dangerous if you're a girl, as sex trafficking and feminicides are a big issue. \n\nOf course, is not the same being a tourist than actually living here. If you go to vacations here you may no notice all these issues, but take into consideration that careers here last at least 5-6 years, so you'll probably experience all the good and bad of Argentina.",

Thus, it isn't seen as \"elite\" as other colleges.\n\nAlso, ask any educated Singaporean or even NUS/NTU students and they will tell you not to trust the rankings.

      "text": "In Mexico it's kinda weird. There's like 5 systems with campuses all over the place, and some campuses are much better than others.\n\n1. Unversidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. Imagine it is like a big State school, but instead it is federal. Despite having a 9% Acceptance rate, It has like 400000 students and like 50000 professors, and it is in general good for learning, but terrible for job placement. Mostly because in Mexico your family/generational wealth kinda matters a lot and the UNAM kids tend to be from poorer backgrounds as it is generally free (5 dollars per semester). This is the best school for people who want to study a master's abroad. \n2. Tecnologico de Monterrey. This is like the Private UNAM. It also has campuses all over the place, and has like 80000 students. It is the best for job placement and it is considered the most innovative big university in the country. The hard thing is not getting in, as it has a 75% acceptance rate, but paying it. It is very expensive for Mexican terms, or about 20000 usd a year. \n3. Universidad Iberoamericana. This is another private university system with like 7 campuses all over the country. It is a Jesuit system and they offer a very prestigious education. They have kinda bad and easy academics, though they have like one of the highest job placements, because they are hella expensive and all the old money families go there.\n4. Universidad Panamericana. Very catholic (Opus Dei), so much so that they try to recruit the smartest students. Very easy to get into, but the coursework is hard for the average Mexican. Retention rate is like 50% for this reason. Also has the best med school after UNAM. I believe after TEC and UNAM it is the highest ranked.\n5. Instituto Politecnico Nacional. Another public university system, focused on a polytechnic model as opposed to liberal arts. Mostly the smartest but poorest kids in the country go to this system. Hard to get into, has a 25% acceptance rate\n\nThen there's much smaller universities that are mostly independent but also very prestigious\n\n1. Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico. Very prestigious and rigorous university that has the second best undergraduate programs in economics and administration. Also some of the best graduate programs. There was some controversy like 3 years ago because it was so hard for some people that a few students committed suicide and some others petitioned to the administration that they make it easier to pass. I'm not sure what happened after that.\n2. Universidad de las Americas Puebla. Probably the most prestigious independent university outside the capital. Getting in is quite hard, acceptance rate is 40%. Good business programs and decent med school. One of the best for job placement, but also kinda expensive. They do have more generous fin aid than others though. \n3. Colegio Mexico. Colmex is the highest level small university. It only admits every two years, and its acceptance rate is like 10%. The very best Econ and international affairs programs by a large margin, and their students tend to do big things in life. Studying here is like studying in Harvard. \n\nBesides this, it's mostly the same as the US. The most reliable option for most is to go to their state school, with most states having good schools like UANL, UDG, Veracruz, UAM, UAEM, BUAP, etc. \n\nOne thing to note is that for public universities, the SAT equivalent is basically all that matters. You obviously need high school grades, but they are a prerequisite for admission, not an admissions factor. C- tends to be what you need.",

This is an international university which trains economists, commercial lawyers (the University teaches English law, but we use civil law), specialists in business management, and IT specialists. I included this University to this list, because the University provides students with an internationally-recognized diploma and considered to be a hub of best lecturers. The only minus is about attitudes of students - they often do not attend their lectures, seminars and do not read manuals; when it comes to deadlines and exams, many fail.",
