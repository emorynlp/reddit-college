  "text": "Sorry to drop this one in the middle of a storm of ED panic posts, but I can't help but feel like I'm in the eye. \n\nI didn't end up making the original ED deadline for the schools I want, and when I got emailed about ED2 a wave of calm came over me. Lately I've been checking myself on the worth of decisions and the worth of the college I go to (despite the pressure of my family LMAO) but still oscillating thru that panic/calm cycle just like everybody else.\n\nThe school I plan to ED to, I am not in love with. Well... technically. The school's location and academics are perfect, but its past is shady and a lot of students report being unhappy. So if I were to be admitted, I'd be happy and my family would be too. But if I got rejected, I can't even describe the relief I would feel. \n\nIs that a reason not to ED? Wanting all of the outcomes equally?\n\nI'm not really sure. But I feel like the only one approaching binding early decisions as a breath of fresh air rather than a reason to hold my breath for three months. Does anybody else feel this way lmao (for yall still waiting on EDs or applying ED2)",

      "text": "I totally understand how you feel. I see ED2 as a wave of calm, but I do not think you should do ED2 to a school you aren\u2019t in love with and would be relieved if rejected from. Even if you would also be happy. Definitely do more research, but you should choose a school that you feel is right for you. The acceptance rate boost is nice, but not nice enough to go to a school you don\u2019t like. My advice, apply to some safeties you actually like and stick to RD!",
