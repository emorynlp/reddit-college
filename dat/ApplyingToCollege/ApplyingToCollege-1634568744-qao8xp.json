  "text": "Hey, I'm an international student applying for aid as a CS major and I'm effectively guaranteed to be rejected from my ED 1 so I wanted to know which of the 2 universities listed above would be a better choice for ED2. I love the vibes and feel of both and don't have any preferences so I'm more curious about which has a better CS program, which has better student outcomes, and which one is more generous to international students. Advice?",
