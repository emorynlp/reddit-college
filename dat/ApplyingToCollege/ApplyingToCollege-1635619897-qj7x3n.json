All of these are my safeties except michigan of course.\n\nFor regular decision I have: Duke, Harvard, Notre Dame, Stanford, Northwestern, Case Western and Vandy.\n\nI realized I can do REA since I only applied to Public schools. Should I do Notre Dame REA? I was going to apply here anyways and they only have 2 200 word essays. I still would have two days to submit my app. Should I do it?",

Don't grind them out and then click submit right after.\n\nMaybe plan the outlines out this afternoon, then have dinner.\n\nWrite the essays tonight.\n\nSleep on it.\n\nTomorrow morning, read them out loud and read them over. Make some edits.\n\nHave lunch, watch TV, spend time with family, etc.\n\nTomorrow night, read them over again. Read them out loud! Make sure there's not any grammatical errors.\n\nAfter that, you could sleep on it again.\n\nWake up early on Monday (11/1) before school, and read them over one last time, and then be sure to read through your application preview to make sure there's not any errors there either. Then, you could submit your application. That's the latest I'd do it though; the CommonApp website has been known to crash in the late hours of 11/1 lmao.\n\n\\^\\^\\^\\^\\^ That's a rough outline; sometimes inspiration strikes and you just want to write. I gave you that outline so you understand that taking breaks is important.\n\nBest of luck! :) \ud83c\udf40\ud83c\udf40\ud83c\udf40",
