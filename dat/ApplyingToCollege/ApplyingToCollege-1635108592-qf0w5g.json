Not sure about the CS programs at these specific schools, but here's the list:\n\nNo supplemental essays: **Northeastern**, ~~Bowdoin~~, **Holy Cross, Franklin & Marshall, Lafayette, Loyola Marymount, Skidmore.**\n\nNot only that, but no application fee either: **Colby, Tulane, Bard, Connecticut College, Denison, Grinnell,** ~~Macalester~~ (they have a supp), **St Lawrence.**\n\nI do know that Northeastern has strong CS programs.",
