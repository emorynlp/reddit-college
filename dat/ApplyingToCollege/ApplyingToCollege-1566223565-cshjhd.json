She quit going to the Chinese American church because she couldn\u2019t stand the moms all bragging. Apparently, most brought that cultural mentality with them. The irony is that my friend\u2019s daughter is a genius and high-performer, so it\u2019s not like she would have lost the mom competition. She just doesn\u2019t want to play, because she\u2019s a nice and kind person. \n\nI sure hope your generation maintains its commitment to education and hard work (though not at the extreme many are pushed to) but drops the irrational and mean-spirited social competition. Tiger mom herself didn\u2019t seem to drop her elitist mentality, though. Maybe it\u2019ll take a few generations.",

They just take it once and never again (and wonder why so many Asians head to their high school every other month). Their average is the \u201cknown\u201d average, for those in worse socioeconomic situations and completely unprepared.

I'm sure you have things that you do besides getting grades and ACT studying. I know it's easier said than done, but you have to focus on what makes you, well you! Your parents aren't the ones living your life, you're the one doing that. And yes, they do pay for college, but I know SO MANY successful people who didn't go to t10s. My mom went to CC, and now she's working at one of the best hospitals in the country! My dad's friend went to some small college in the middle of nowhere, and now he works at Google! Never lose hope my friend. Things will work out for you. I so used to have this mindset but I then realized that things will happen because they're meant to happen.

I'm telling you, all the successful professionals I know (minus a couple of people) all went to colleges in like West Bumblebee, Ohio (not a real place, don't look it up). It honestly matters how hard you work. While good schools have network, you can get that network if you work really hard at a state school! My cousin goes to his state school and because he was really eager and showed initiative, his professor offered him a research opportunity and now that's what he's doing. Would you rather be the best at a small school, or the worst at Harvard? Where will you make your mark, and where will you truly shine? It's something I've learned thanks to my parents stories.\n\n(Don't even get me started on Asian parents and careers. I wanna be a nurse, and the amount of confused stares I get from the immigrant friend community is insane. If you have any questions on rankings or just need to talk, feel free to PM me!)",

I basically ran away from home and it took a few years before he realised that he ruined the chance of us ever having a good relationship.

So many parents don't understand that at a certain point your child is living the life that you want them to live instead of their own and it makes me miserable to hear that so many people's parents just essentially tell their children how to live their lives instead of their children living their own lives. If you wrap the leash around your child so tight that they can't breathe when they get even the slightest taste of freedom, whether it be in college or a weekend away from home, most kids aren't able to handle the breath of fresh air and they just spiral out of control. Not sure if this applies to OP's situation but it just reminded me of this horrible parenting style.",
