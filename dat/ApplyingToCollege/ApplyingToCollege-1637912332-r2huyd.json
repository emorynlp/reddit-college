  "title:": "I didn\u2019t get into college, so I took a gap semester, tried again, and succeeded!",
  "text": "I took a gap semester after I didn\u2019t get into college. I stumbled through the whole last year both personally and therefore academically and deserved those rejections, applying the last possible second. I went on to fail half of my classes last term of high school just reeling, ended with a 3.1 Gpa, no APs, and when senior year ended everyone moved on but me. Last year was absolute hell but I got into Purdue and I can\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s my dream school especially because I want to study pharmacy. \nNot a lot of \u201caverage\u201d students on this sub and hardly any as below average as me. I would have loved to see this when I was struggling. \n\nThe worst thing happened: I didn\u2019t get into college. But it wasn\u2019t the end of my world. No matter what happens, you\u2019ll be okay.",
