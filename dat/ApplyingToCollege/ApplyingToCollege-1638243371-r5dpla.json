  "text": "So for background I\u2019m a sophomore at a nice-but-not-crazy high school where we send maybe 1-2 students to tippity-top colleges every year. \n\nI\u2019ve sorta been realizing that keeping an A in my classes could be hard this semester since I am right between an A- and a B for two of my classes\n\nI tried looking for an answer around the sub but either there weren\u2019t any clear answers or I just can\u2019t find out the right keywords to search because I didn\u2019t find much of any advice for kids in my situation.\n\nI\u2019m especially stressed because my AP Chem and precalc grades are sorta teetering and I don\u2019t want them to drop but it may be inevitable (we still have some tests and I\u2019m not planning on giving up but I want to just know what could happen)\n\nHow many Bs are too many for a sophomore year transcript (and then also for junior and senior year)?",

      "text": "There is no concrete answer to your question, but I\u2019ll offer the following. AP Chem and precalc are high-level courses for a sophomore, so you should be proud to be advanced in both math and science. Bs are very respectable grades. You want to do your best work academically while keeping your stress at a reasonable level and also having time for activities that are important to you and spending quality time with friends and family.",

      "text": "Not really your question but if you do want to get those grades up just the little bit you need then my 1 piece of advice is to talk to your teachers about it. Tell them you really want to get the A- and ask if there's any extra work you could do or material they would suggest you study to help you out in the test. Even just letting them know your willing to work hard for an A- is useful, it shows them that your dedicated and also may make them pay more attention to how your progressing in class. Some teachers are incredibly nice and will just round grades up from a B+ to an A- if you ask them. Even if they can't do much string pulling though, asking for help will definitely leave a good impression.",
