  "text": "I was already expecting disappointing news, so I made plans with the boys to go see NWH a few hours after my EA decision came out. Thought I could unwind and relax without thinking about a2c. But to see the first 45 minutes full of college app jokes, rejections, admissions officers, etc. really pissed me off. \n\nI just can't catch a break, the single largest cause of stress in my life is inescapable. The college apps are following me into the multiverse.\n\nSide note: If you are EA to MIT. DO NOT MAKE PLANS TO WATCH THE MOVIE Saturday night. If you are deferred or rejected, the first 45 minutes (and little comments throughout the rest) will make the movie unenjoyable.",
