      "text": "Location based \"why us\" are rarely good essays.  Keep in mind \"why us\" is really \"why you\" but in the framework of the school.\n\nThe school knows where it is, it knows what sorts of fun or newsworthy events it hosts, it knows who the profs are and what their areas of research are.  An essay that regurgitates all that back to them tells them nothing about you.\n\nYou could use it as the opener and then go into actual reasons that are more thought out and tell them more about who you are and what you want to do.",
