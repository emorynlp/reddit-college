  "text": "Hi all,\nI'm looking for a good topic for my personal Essay. Haven't really thought of anything extremely unique and could use some help thinking if these are good.\n\n1: Volunteering throughout the community and how it has inspired me to want to become a doctor in the future. I do a lot of volunteering (swim lessons, made a small nonprofit, volunteered at summer school as TA ). I'm not sure of this is interesting enough to stand out.\n\n2: I love to play arcade and carnival -style games. Specifically, the kinds you can win prizes from. I often do research and strategy to create the best chance of winning for me. If I were to write about this, I would write about how I apply characteristics I've learned from playing these games(determination, perseverance, risk-taking) to my own life and how it has made me a more successful student. I find this topic to be a little hit or Miss as I think it will be really creative but kind of weird.\n\nI wanted to stay away from traditional topics that many probably write about such as all-state musician, competitive swimmer, job experience, success in school,etc.\n\nId like help determining if these topics are worthy enough to write about to apply to top-20 schools.\nThanks in advance! \ud83d\ude4f",

      "text": "1. this isnt necessarily a bad topic, but its pretty generic and predictable -- most people will make the connection of volunteering -> helping others as a career. uncommon connections would spice this up (eg. how did doing seemingly unrelated EC inspire you to be a doctor?) but its alright if you don't have something like that\n2. I like it except for the ending point being \"successful student.\" maybe you could somehow tie in those values of determination and perseverence into being a good doctor? or perhaps even combine this topic with the first -- talk about how the values of determination, perseverance, hard work, etc. manifests in arcade games, your volunteer work, and so on and how it ties into wanting to be a doctor. arcade -> doctor is a more uncommon connection and I think it has more potential.",
