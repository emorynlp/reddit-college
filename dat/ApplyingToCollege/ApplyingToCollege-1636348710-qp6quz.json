  "text": "im probably asking a really stupid question, but statistically, do accepted ED applicants usually have lower stats than EA and RD accepted students? when i look at the averages for schools, would the ED stats be a little lower than that? how should I judge those things?",

      "text": "Probably. But it\u2019s hard to know why. The schools that you would be looking at only admit around 400 students each year. So as a result benefits like legacy that often only happen if applying ED will bring the stats down. Look at ED for what it is. A method to be compared to a smaller group with a minor advantage as you are guaranteed part of that college\u2019s yield, however understand that it has risks as it is a contract that you will attend this school if admitted.",

From what I\u2019ve read ED applicants are usually the most competitive pool (this is the reason that most schools give for having a higher acceptance rate in the ED round) so I\u2019m assuming that means their stats would either be slightly higher or more or less the same",
