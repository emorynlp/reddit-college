  "text": "I would like to stay anonymous, but in short, My dad passed away when I was transitioning from 8th grade to 9th grade that summer. This affected my GPA a lot, I had a ton of Bs and some As. In my sophomore and junior years, I had only 1 B and all A's with some A-s. this was roughly a 3.71 and wGPA of 4.53. I believe I took 11-13 aps and took 8 exams. I got a 5 on gov, bc, chem, ab and a 3 on bio, lang, comp sci a and prin. I got 1470 sat with a 790m 680r&w breakdown.\n\nthe question is do colleges care about my situation, because in my head why would colleges care about my situation and not just my stats, but on the other hand there are also QB and other exceptions.\n\nam I an exception, I'm not completely sure. It's always been an ambition to go to a good uni as  I am also technically a first-gen bc my mom didn't go and my dad passed away when I was 15. I'm also considered low income with roughly 21k annual. I'm still fairly active in terms of ECs I help with my mom's business with her web page and finances, I do a lot of soccer(varsity and club) and am a competitive gamer, and I'm in some clubs. I didn't do as much as I wanted to but I recuperated as much as I could in my sophomore junior and senior years. I'm applying as a math/comp sci major to a lot of t20s and I honestly don't know if I have a chance at all. How does the holistic admissions system work, and how would they view my trauma, would they see it as a weakness or a barrier I overcame. And how significant would they view it?\n\nin my common, I talked about my incident and for my other essays like y major of joy/excitement, I talked about my deep passion for math and obv other topics regarding that.\n\nmy list is\n\nBrown, caltech, mit(maybe), rice, vander, USC, upenn, Columbia(maybe), cornell(maybe), Georgia tech,\n\ncarnigne mellon, harvard, yale, stanford\n\nsubmitted\n\nUC- berk, la, Irvine, SD\n\nUT, UTSA, UTD\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand tbh i think im a little bit delusional but idk, with an app waiver, I applied to a lot of schools, ranging from the combination of high reaches to target reaches and safetys.\n\nAny advice would be helpful, and yes ik this post might be scrambled i was just writing down thoughts",

      "text": "First, my condolences on your father's passing. That isn't easy at any age, but I can't imagine how hard that was at the age you were. \n\nYes, colleges do care about these sorts of things. That said, and this is very common among low income/first gen students, your list is very reach heavy. These schools are reaches for everyone, including people who have had every advantage and privilege. That doesn't mean you shouldn't apply, but it's important to understand how difficult college admissions can be. It is not necessary to go to a fancy school to succeed, and just because you've heard a school is \"good\", does not mean that school is good for you. \n\nI would strongly recommend applying to fewer reach campuses and more \"safeties\". The quality of the education is no worse at smaller and less selective schools, which you may also find to be more affordable and more attainable overall.",

              "text": "Definitely understand the peer pressure - it's unfortunate the way people talk and act around college admissions. UTD is a great school, and I'd look for more campuses that you'd be happy at with open applications. You want to give yourself options in terms of affordability and institutional culture.",

I\u2019ve heard that an anomaly in your transcripts are easily seen and  it being visible in TWO areas is important.\n\nSome colleges like Emory, Stanford, Princeton and Cali schools don\u2019t look at freshman year - you might wanna look at that.\n\nTake your shots at T20s, I\u2019m trying to do the same \ud83d\ude02.
