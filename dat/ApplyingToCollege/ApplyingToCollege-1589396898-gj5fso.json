  "text": "I had just started my essay and an email popped up on my screen from NYU, I knew exactly what it was. I spent around 5 minutes just reading the admissions letter and sitting there in disbelief. Because of that I submitted my exam with, and I\u2019m not exaggerating, 2 seconds left on the clock. I don\u2019t even know how I finished because my mind was so distracted. \n\nNYU was my dream school from the very start of my admissions process, but I\u2019m gonna have to think long and hard on whether I will attend. I would be paying full price and I\u2019m not sure I want to do that to my family.",

Don't let money jeopardize 4+ years of happiness. Also, graduating from NYU does open a lot of doors in employment.",

No scholarships yet or financial aid either, but I\u2019m forecasting paying a couple grand for this coming year. Sometimes I wonder why Americans don\u2019t just apply to schools here as international students since the Canadian dollar is pretty weak compared to USD. It would cost much less and no standardized tests needed.",

If you attend a grade-inflated college, this means that this college tends to hand out high grades to a lot of their students and that a plurality (or even a majority) of students are consistently making A\u2019s or B\u2019s in all of their classes. On the other hand, if you attend a grade-deflated college, this means that your college grades more harshly; a decent number of students at this college are making low C\u2019s or failing their classes. The litmus test for a grade-inflated or grade-deflated college is their median GPA: if the median GPA of a college is in the A\u2019s or B\u2019s, it inflates its grades. If the median is in the failing range, it deflates.\n\n[Source](https://blog.collegevine.com/a-guide-to-grade-inflation-and-deflation/)",

As much as it pained me, it wasn't worth it to justify paying that kind of money. Went to a less prestigious school at an affordable price that I was initially apprehensive about because \"I was too good for them\" and it ended up being a really great experience. I was able to be the big fish in a little pond, so to speak, and I think I got the most I could've out of college. I've got a good job out of graduation and a full tuition scholarship to get my MBA next year at Pepperdine.\n\nReading through comments it seems like you have better options than I did. My advice is to avoid an \"NYU or bust\" mantra, you can excel at any school. Pick NYU for the things it alone offers- whether it be the location, a certain professor, relationship with your dream employer, the NYU student lifestyle, etc. if that's worth the extra cost to you. Think about what makes it your dream school- and once again, congratulations!",
