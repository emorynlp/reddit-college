  "title:": "Should I take the SAT or not, applying to CS at the UCs?",
  "text": "Hi,\n\nSo I'm applying to the UCs and I know that the SAT is *not* required nor considered. *But*, as my top choice major is CS, which is extremely competitive (as far as I've heard), I'm thinkin *maybe* it's a good idea to take the test. Just cuz if I do well on it, then I can have a sort of advantage/edge in my application as compared to other CS applicants who have similar metrics but didn't take the sat, if y'know what I mean. My SAT's on dec 4 btw, and I've kinda practiced more so over last 2-2.5 weeks.\n\nSo, basically, I'm mulling over whether I should take the sat or not, as an aspiring CS major applying to the UCs. Any help/guidance would be appreciated. Thanks!",

UC did not go test-blind for shits and giggles; they did so as a result of a court ruling. \n\nIf you are applying to other colleges that are not test-blind, then yes, it can help.",
