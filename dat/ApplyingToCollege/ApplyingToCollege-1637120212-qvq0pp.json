  "title:": "Can I turn a conditional admission to a complete one?",
  "text": "I applied to ASU and before I knew it, officials from their side misplaced my Duolingo English proficiency test scores. I asked the admissions department through mail whether everything is alright and how long would it take the admission decision to come. Turns out it wasn't alright and they weren't able to find my dept scores. \nI've been given the conditional admission now and it hurts to see it XD. My question is whether reporting about the error or resending the test scores could convert the conditional admission to complete admission?\n\nTL;DR: university misplaced my scores, gave me conditional admission, can I change it to complete one?",
