  "text": "i joined this sub (and reddit as a whole) earlier this year bc i knew that going into senior year w/o any knowledge of the admissions cycle was going to kill me!  i don\u2019t really use the app much anymore, and even when i did it was just a lot of lurking and seeing what people were saying during the big decision days last year so i could look into my future this coming spring\n\nbut i ended up applying ED (which i knew a hell of a lot more about thanks to a2c) to nyu and i finally opened my email about 20 minutes ago to find out i got in.  genuinely can\u2019t fucking believe it- i was so deep in the idea that i couldn\u2019t make it even if i Tried that i treated it like any other email i could ignore before i had to stare at it to get rid of the notif bubble lmao\n\nwe\u2019ll see what my parents say now bc ofc i had to thank my Real support in this trying time first- so thanks a2c and last year\u2019s seniors bc i really couldn\u2019t have done it without you <3",
