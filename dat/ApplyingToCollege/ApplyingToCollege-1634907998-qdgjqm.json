He had approached his coordinator for the LOR but she had flat out refused, so he called up the school vice-principal who obviously understood it better. He got his LOR almost immediately because of her. If your counsellor isn\u2019t aware of how international applications work (which is often the case because in India you apply only after 12th), then maybe talk to someone higher up because they\u2019re usually more open to listening and more informed about this. Ask your parents to talk to them too",
