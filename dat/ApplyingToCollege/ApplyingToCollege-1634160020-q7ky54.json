  "title:": "Do I need to use an essay editing service?",
  "text": "I\u2019ve been considering using an essay editing service for my CommonApp as I don\u2019t want to have anyone here review it due to plagiarism concerns (I know this is rare but I am a paranoid person) and I want professional insight. I\u2019ve had both my English teachers review the essay and they think it\u2019s good both content and grammar wise, but they are both very unfamiliar with competitive college admissions and the expectations of it.\n\nI, however, cannot really afford to spend much money ($40 at most). \n\nAre services that cost less than this even worth it? Are they necessary?\n\nI\u2019ve been looking mainly at wordvice as it is affordable and seems to have a good reputation.",
