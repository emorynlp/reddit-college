  "text": "I just submitted my UC apps and spoke to my counselor about this competition we did. But, she told me it wasn\u2019t a competition, just a project where they scored students. Since I scored the highest, I thought I won first place and put it in my UC application as an award. Stupid, I know. Now, I\u2019m freaking out about getting my application revoked because I technically lied.",

      "text": "Chill. You didn't lie, i.e. intentionally misrepresent. What you describe is a vague difference; I wouldn't worry about it. It's not going to make or break your app. If you are very concerned, at most you could send an email identifying a *mistake* in your app, though I don't know what UC does with app mistakes.",

          "text": "The UCs have way too many applications to call and check with counselors. They do randomly audit a small percentage of students\u2019 extracurriculars (ask you to send in evidence of your claims, like certificate photos and employer statement of hours). They might check someone that looks suspicious or someone up for a big scholarship that way. But OP do you have something that shows you had the top score on this project or a teacher who\u2019d have notes on that? Because I doubt they\u2019d nitpick over how formal of a competition it was. Im pretty sure they spend maybe 10 minutes per application on average and take it at face value.",
