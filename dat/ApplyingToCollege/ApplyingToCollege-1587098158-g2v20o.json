  "title:": "My dad is refusing to pay for any college that isn't a Christian university.",
  "text": "I go to a Christian high school, and most of my peers want to attend schools like Evangel and Liberty and Calvin. I am a Christian and I go to church and I'm even a preacher's kid. But when you're a black student who transferred from public school at a majority white school with some pretty racist students who all share the exact same ideologies without room for debate, you kind of don't want to spend any more time in such an environment if you can help it. I have nothing against Christian universities or their student bodies, but my top schools, even lower-ranked schools like MI State, Wayne State, and Ohio State (my dad lives in OH) have better programs than what the others are offering.\n\nMy dad doesn't want to pay? Cool.\n\nUSC is offering free tuition bro. Lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[edit\\] This feels like one of those celebrity apology tweets: Background: USC is a school that offers free tuition for families with income under 80k. Yes, as many have pointed out, **I am a current junior/rising senior.** The point of this was not to mislead anyone into thinking I have 1.) been accepted into USC or 2.) that I have a full-ride for some reason or another. My stats put me at a high chance of acceptance (yes I know that nothing is certain, but statistically speaking) and *if/when* I get in, I will qualify for free tuition. The point of this post was to rant (hence the flair) about how my dad was essentially withholding tuition money if I don't attend a certain type of university, but how I didn't really care because most schools I'm applying to will apply varying amounts of free aid, so it didn't matter if he paid or not, any amount remaining, if at all (such as with USC), can be taken care of by me personally or smaller loans because I wouldn't be paying full tuition regardless.\n\nI worded some things vaguely and unclearly, that's my bad. Alright, have a blessed day :)\n\n\\[the edit's edit\\] lol I'm not a liar. Just vague in my annoyance. I'm sorry again, but that's all I'll say about this. Thank you all for the encouragement anyway.",

It is not the same as a six year old claiming he got a full ride at harvard. A six year old can claim that he will most likely go to Harvard for free because of financial aid. OP specifically said USC is free. She did not mention ANY full rides anywhere in the post. Also, this is something that ticks me off. 90 percent of the people claiming \u201cfull rides\u201d on this sub do not have actual full rides. Most are from financial aid.\n\nAlso,I think her point was that she has an option to apply to USC because it will be tuition free. She probably pointed this out because the main point of this post was that her dad will not be paying for a non Christian uni.",

You have a full scholarship, and he wants you to throw it away because of his fears. He is trying to hide you from temptation, but instead is throwing you in with the lion's. \n\n* If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.\n\nHe needs to forgive your siblings.\n\nEdit: your father is forcing you to make a choice, an ultimatum. You should, and I assume will, choose against his wishes. You will do this because *it is the best choice for you.* And in him, forcing you to make this decision, will push you further away. He is trying so hard to hold you tight -with threats (it is a threat)- he will have the opposite impact on your life. People who choose to control through fear, does not win loyalty. Demand for obedience, breeds rebellion.\n\nSince it *will be cited,* honouring your parents is about respect, humility, and kindness. Not obedience. Obedience carries with it the idea of absolute submission resulting from absolute trust. But *you* will be taking on debt, not them. And I believe your father's change of stance in schools is a breech of trust. And his breech in trust in you, stemming from a sibling's actions. As if the only thing that would keep you from doing \"bad things\" is the school you go to... What about the \"bad things\" you would have to endure, to calm his mind? \n\nIn fact, by not supporting you in school, is a free pass for you to do what ever you wish. He already expects you to sin.

                  "text": "*not a scholarship, potential full aid if accepted\nSo, I am significantly younger than my other siblings. I have 2 brothers and 2 sisters, the youngest of the four being 6 years older than I am. My two oldest siblings went to UMICH when I was 4 and 5, and then my dad pulled the ultimate d-bag move and moved back to Nigeria. Alone. So nobody paid for their tuition. So they had to take out loans. \nMy sister, around the end of her 4th year, got alcohol poisoning I believe, and my parents had to go pick her up from the hospital. After that, my dad swore of UMICH specifically, but after my other sister became more liberal by the end of her own college journey, he determined that I would never go to a public university. \nNow, that he's been home for about ten years since then, so much money that should have been used for my college fund got wasted or used to fix our house or pay for my high school. The amount of money they've spent on my school could have gone toward college, and the 1k they pay per month of school is the max they can pay without their accounts going into financial overload. Multiply that by five or six if I go to a private uni of his choosing/type. \nI'm convinced the most he can pay would be for expenses aside from tuition that financial aid won't cover. So perhaps he'd still withhold paying for my rent or something if I'm not a student at a Christian uni. But that's a lot better than the thought that I'll be at a Christian uni and get notified by FAFSA that my credit is being ruined because someone can't pay my tuition anymore and I don't have a backup plann.",

That will give you 1 year to enact a plan to apply for independence. \n\nThen talk to your siblings, not about support but about helping you with FAFSA. Assuming that your father refuses to give IRS details after you go against his wishes.\n\nMore information leads me to believe, he will be unreasonable.
