  "title:": "Problems with Applying to Specific UC Schools",
  "text": "So, I'm trying to apply and transfer to UC Schools right now since they're due by the end of the month, but when I get to the \"Choose Campuses\" portion of the application, it won't let me select UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, and UC Santa Barbara.\n\nI applied for the Tap Program and Tagged UCSB, and it says that the next step is to send an application to UCSB through the application site, but it won't let me. I can select any other UC except for the three mentioned. When I go over any of those three, there's a red circle and it's grayed out for me to click on.\n\nCan someone help me out with this problem, and if the Tag program somehow has to do with it?",
