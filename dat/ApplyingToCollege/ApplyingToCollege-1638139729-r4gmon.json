If so, these are a couple things I\u2019ve learned to do:\n\n* Go through your essay and use ctrl + f to look for the following words: \u201cvery\u201d, \u201creally\u201d, \u201ctruly\u201d, and \u201cthat\u201d. Check to see if you actually need them in your essay. There\u2019s a good chance they\u2019re just filler.\n\n* I learned this one based on the 650 word common app prompt so you may have to modify it a bit, but try cutting down your essay like this: remove 10 words in one minute, 20 in two, and 40 in 4. If it\u2019s shorter, you can probably skip the 40 and maybe the 20.",

Example: \u201c, As a future physics major at Dartmouth, I am excited to be part of a community of students interested in dark matter, as well as to take classes that are geared towards my future career plans of studying the forces of the universe.\u201d Then dive a bit more into the specifics: \u201cI hope to take classes such as \u201cWhat binds galaxies together\u201d with professor John Johnson, who has made important breakthroughs in gravitational theory. By working beside him, I hope to learn more about the research being done on dark matter.\u201d Then, talk about another niche interest you might have, and how you can contribute to a community of people with a similar interest: \u201cI am also very interested in joining the cricket cooking community, and I am eager to contribute with my recipes and share my love for cooking with Dartmouth.\u201d As you can see, this goes a bit over 100 words, so you can start by cutting the non-essential. Replace \u201cgravitational theory with gravity, replace be part of with join, etc. I hope this helps you progress with your prompt. Feel free to use this as a template, but remember to let your own interests and passions shine. DM me if you need any more help.",
