  "text": "So I applied to UCLA's film school and I am learning that they are even more selective and harder to get into than UCLA itself. I have perfect grades, all AP and honors, A good set of extracurricular and awards, and am a minority as well as part Native American. I think I have a good shot at getting into UCLA itself, but I am afraid that I've botched myself by deciding to apply to their even more selective film school. So if I got denied for the film program but was eligible to be admissed into the school, would they offer me a spot as undeclared? Or is it an all or nothing situation? Because honestly I would still go if they couldn't give me a spot in the film school but offered me a spot at their general school.",
