  "text": "A kid at my school said he was applying to MIT, so one of my friends jokingly said \"Oh really? What disease have you cured?\" And the kid actually started talking about how he created something that would detect pancreatic cancer and find the best treatments for the person based on the stage of cancer that they had. \n\nWhat has the world come to? I thought curing cancer was just a joke on A2C",

      "text": "While there are sometimes there are excellent guys who do truly groundbreaking research, after participating in my country's national fair 3 times, I've come to realise that almost 80% of these projects are either copied straight from a research paper, done by a parent (who works in that field) or are just a bunch of buzzwords strung together with 2 hours of Internet research.\n\nNow, your friend may be a part of that 10%, but in my experience, almost 30-40 out of the 100 projects selected for the top national fair go something like this \"ML model for early detection of <X disease>\", when in reality its more like \"I found a database that someone spent years creating, downloaded it and slightly modified a popular model (which someone else took 5 years to develop) in a weekend's worth of time and it will probably fail dramatically if you use it in the real world\".\n\nI'm not trying to say he didn't achieve anything, I'm just saying that you shouldn't let it demotivate you.\n\nEdit: I just want to be clear, I'm not in anyway against CS projects. I myself have done exclusively CS and bioinformatics science fair projects for the last 3 years. But I've been very clear that I never want to use someone else's work, make a few modifications and present it as my own.\n\nOn a side note, look what I found today: [Google has developed a new ML model for medical research (specifically cancer research)](https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/googles-ai-model-can-help-improve-neural-networks-in-medical-research-11636706824623.html). Now I'm sure we'll see 100 projects next year that use this exact model. Hopefully science fairs do something about this entire situation, so that we don't see this in the future.",

              "text": "They can 100% tell if you do something cliche like \"ML for early detection\". I myself can tell from just participating in these science fairs. The thing is they just choose to ignore it, (both science fair judges and colleges) because they can never be a 100% sure in the timeframe they have to judge your project / read your application. \n\nLet me give you an example. 4 years ago, a kid from my old school submitted a project that won at the national fair and was selected as one of the 20 teams which qualify for ISEF. He won a grand award there (the top 20 have about an 80% chance of getting an awards because the competition for those 20 seats is so high). Two years later, his younger brother submitted the exact same project. He didn't get into ISEF, but he did win major awards in other science fairs. Again last week when the list of national fair qualifiers were announced, I saw the project again, so I decided to google it. Turns out it was copied from a 2014 paper.\n\nHonestly, I think science fairs don't really test how intelligent you are. They test your ability to stick to project for a long time and be disciplined about conducting your research. And of course your ability to get access to research tools and get in touch with researchers. Most people (in my country atleast) don't have easy access to these resources, so they end up doing a typical computer science project / organic fertiliser kind of project which can be done at home.",

You have absolutely no idea what features it has picked out or if those features are intrinsic to cancer itself, the imaging technique, or the specific dataset. You are basically training it to be horrendously biased in completely unknowable ways, which is an awful thing to do, and is especially awful when you're proposing to use your code to diagnose something as significant as *cancer*.\n\nWhat happens when your code is faced with new data taken using a different machine, and it gets the diagnosis/prognosis wrong? If you have to check every output manually to make sure it's working then you haven't created anything of value, you've only muddied the waters. \n\nAI/ML is exceptionally easy to do but almost impossibly difficult to do well. Even most PhD-holding researchers do a crappy job with it, especially people applying ML outside of CS, e.g. to detect cancer. Just because you *can* do something doesn't mean you *should*, and people view this kind of ML research with a very heavy dose of skepticism for good reason.",

Thousands of papers get published every month with groundbreaking solutions to our biggest problems, but those are proof-of-concepts and it takes a lot of time,  effort, and money to make these new strategies viable for application. Our cutting edge Covid vaccine is based on decades old research where some scientist at a university figured out that you can engineer polymers that self-assemble into nanoparticles which drugs can be loaded into/onto. My 2015 undergraduate research used a similar approach with magnetic nanoparticles so you can magnetically control where the drug goes in the body. All this fundamental research slowly grows, one paper at a time, and trickles into companies that are able to turn it into a real solution. \n\nOn rereading though I\u2019m not sure if OP is referring to his friend getting into undergrad or grad school.

Metals are way too heavy, and so we want to replace them with polymer carbon fiber composites (this is what we did for modern aircraft to improve fuel efficiency). But in orbit, there is this stuff called atomic oxygen which rapidly oxidizes and degrades organic materials. I am developing a super strong and flame resistant organic material that doesn\u2019t degrade in the presence of atomic oxygen.",

Or \"teen finds cancer breakthrough!\" by which they mean a teenager - in collaboration with several tenured professors and grad students in a top lab - played some role assisting in a potentially relevant minor improvement that the lab was pursuing for years.\n\nNo child or teenager will ever \"cure\" any disease or make a significant scientific breakthrough of any kind. Because we are literal children. If the headlines and gossip around \"science fair\" culture reflected actual contribution, these people should skip college entirely and head to grad school, or really even just straight to tenure. I love research, and I think it can be a great thing to participate in, and a exceedingly small number of kids can do interesting (not world changing) research, but it's a sickness we do this false hype around children as funny as the \"cure cancer\" meme is sometimes",

                  "text": "I remember being pretty stressed during college application season as a senior in high school. Due to health issues, I spent most of high school going in and out of the hospital. I missed almost an entire school year and had trouble adjusting. One year I had a cumulative GPA of 2.74. I couldn't travel very far for college so I only had a few options. I applied to a college my mom wanted me to go to. Around that time the average stats were a 3.8 GPA and a 31 ACT. I didn't get in. However, I did get accepted to another university. Not high ranking, but I consider myself lucky to get an education at all even if it wasn't a high ranking place. It ended up being okay though.\n\nI'm a freshman in college right now. And I will transfer in a couple of years. I'm shooting for a few prestigious schools along with a couple of ivies. But I'm also applying to a bunch of regular schools with a higher transfer acceptance rates. Like many people, I want to go to a high ranked college due to the quality of their program for a specific major (I know a lot of people are prestige-whoring, but I'm not referring to them here). My current school doesn't offer any research opportunities or many resources in my chosen field. The schools in my state focus on undergraduate students in astronomy or acoustics.\n\n Although I won't be too upset if I don't get into a T20. You can get a good education at almost anywhere. Not just T20s or even T100s. And if you are determined to go to a top school but get rejected, you can apply as a transfer student after a few semesters at another college. Transfer acceptance rates often differ for transfers. USC has a freshman acceptance rate of 16.1% (2020) and a transfer acceptance rate of 24.57% (2019). MIT has a freshman admit rate of 7.3% and a transfer admit rate of 4.28%. \n\n So the odds will likely be more or less against you if transferring, but there is at least another chance even if small.",

That, and the fact people often don\u2019t have symptoms, are part of what makes it so deadly. Edit: My bad, I might have misunderstood. Developing an algorithm that can read scan results is not likely to be a Nobel prize worthy achievement. If that is what he is claiming he has done, I would agree with other posters saying that he probably copied a lot of PhD level research and database work and modified it slightly or employed it to create his own program. That should not help him get into MIT, they can see right through that. ML at that level, or any level for that matter, is very difficult and well past the average high school student\u2019s ability",
