  "text": "Ok so I was sending in my SAT score reports to a few colleges, I added them all to the list, selected the scores I wanted to send and payed the money- and then the screen just re-routed me back to the main CollegeBoard account. Nowhere is it indicated that those scores were sent - but the money went. 144 USD \ud83d\ude2d. Is it supposed to be indicated somewhere in collegeboard where the scores went, or shud I just send it and pay again :/",

      "text": "Check later today. Typically it takes a few hours for score report orders to show up in your account. (And then a few days to a week to be delivered to the college's account, and more days before the college gets around to downloading score reports waiting in the college's account)\n\nAlso FYI, check each of your colleges' admission websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app or portal, for free, to be followed by an official report only if you later enroll.",
