  "text": "Here\u2019s your usual senior year courseload post. I\u2019m planning out my senior year schedule, and want to give myself enough time for college apps while still trying to keep the rigor. I\u2019ve come up with this. Aiming for a mixed range of schools with some t20s. How does this look? Probably a data science major \n\nAP Physics C\nLinear Algebra\nAp econ\nAp Spanish\nHonors film and literature /honors ancient texts (s1/s2)\nAp gov/metalworking\n\nOnly things I\u2019m worried about are firstly honors english as I took Ap Lang and comp last year. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to handle my school\u2019s workload of lit along with math, Spanish and physics c. The other thing is metalworking. It seems like a fun class second semester but should I switch it out for something more rigorous?\n\nThanks!",

I suggest consulting with your counselor, teachers, and parents, who know your abilities, the workload of these courses at your school, and past student experiences at your school\n\nFwiw, my daughter finished nine EA apps and has already finished the three remaining RD apps while taking 5 APs, with 97+ on all for the just-ended first quarter. So it can be done.\n\nBut others have graduated from college at 18. \u201cIt can be done\u201d doesn\u2019t make it universally applicable. As noted, consult those who understand your situation.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t not worry that it\u2019s not rigorous enough",
