  "text": "I\u2019ve already graduated high school and I\u2019m applying to colleges during my gap year. Does my Early Decision agreement form still need a counselor signature? Or is a parent signature enough? I\u2019ve emailed my old counselor but she isn\u2019t responding so I\u2019m considering just sending the form in with only my parent signature.",
