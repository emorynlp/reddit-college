  "text": "my ed decision comes out tomorrow, i obviously would be over the moon if i got in, but ive always been ok with not getting in, bc 5% is such a small amount of people. but the support and love my friends and family have shown me means so much to me. i know im going to be okay if i get rejected because i have so much already, and you cant lose something you never had! this is so cheesy, but my friends have been so sweet and it makes me want to cry. everyones so optimistic, that i think the only reason why ill cry tomorrow if i get rejected is because they wanted me to get in. so to everyone who didnt get into their ed these past couple of days, i hope you feel better! the future has so much in store for you! pm me if you need to vent! (but like dont just say hi, be like hi im from a2c because i dont randomly accept chat requests lol). and as so many people have said, a rejection is just redirection. ive seen so many posts from this sub, and i know you guys are so full of potential, and a school can only do so much. its you that holds all the power <3",
