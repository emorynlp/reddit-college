  "text": "I want to make the November 8th deadline for all additional materials. Everything is done except the transcript. I sent it monday and still says they haven't gotten it. I know it takes a while to process. But my app is still incomplete so what happens if I don't make the deadline? Can I still be considered for early decision or nah",
