              "text": "Surely you do. A 32 ACT is good enough for all the t20s if the rest of your app is good. The Average for the t20s is 33-35 and your only slightly below. Your GPA is good and the class rigor might hold you back a little, but your ecs can help you just as much a class rigor hurts you. I would honestly say apply to 3-5 colleges within the t30. Schools like NYU fall below the t20 but are better than most above it for business. Plus most t20 & t30 schools are looking for complete students that show they are interested in there major and have ecs to back it up. You are in a good starting position, but Essays & EC\u2019S can either help or hurt your chances at these prestigious colleges.\n\nSuggestions For Business Reaches -\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nNYU\nStanford \nUSC \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThese Are the most wholistic schools from my experiences and ones I think you\u2019d have the best shot at. Make sure to do some research of your own and think about your location, do you want to go far from home? Will you be able to afford some of these schools? Do You want be in a city or rural area?\n\nOverall Make sure to apply strategically and think about your financial and geographic situation just as much as rankings. I believe in you, Good luck!",
