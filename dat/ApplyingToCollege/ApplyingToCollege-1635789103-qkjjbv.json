  "text": "How important are ECs being related to your major? I'm guessing it's pretty school dependent. I want to do public health and I have a few volunteering activities related to it but nothing too crazy. A lot of my other ECs r cashier/babysitting jobs and entrepreneurship program stuff so not very public health related. Would it be worth trying to do something else to add to your activities list before ED2? (assuming ED1 doesn't work out) I'll leave the schools in case it helps.\n\nED1 Tulane and ED2 probably Syracuse if they have it this year (not listed on their website but they had it in previous years so)",
