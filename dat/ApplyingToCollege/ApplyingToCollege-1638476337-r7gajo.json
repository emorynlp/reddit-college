  "title:": "[HS Junior ] QuestBridge Clarification? | Not sure how it works or whether it's worth it",
  "text": "*Title \\^ | Sry for the long post*\n\nI know that QuestBridge matches are binding, and essentially serve as ED for your highest-ranked match. Based on that, I was only planning on selecting my dream school, MIT, as my interest. My safety is UF, which I'm more than okay with, and applying to via Common App.\n\nI was just hoping I could get some clarification on how QB works and whether it'd be worth it in my situation.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* How does the selection process work?\n   * Like how does one become a finalist and where do finalists go from there?\n   * What happens if I don't become a finalist?\n* Assuming I'm a finalist and don't get matched with MIT, what happens then?\n   * From what I've read, I would be deferred to the RA for MIT?\n      * Would that better my chances than just applying normally through MIT's website?\n* In my case, is there any pros of applying with QB?\n   * As you'll see on my stat-sheet, with my family income I believe MIT would cover the entire COA through financial aid already, as our EFC is essentially 0 and MIT covers full-need\n   * I'd also have less time to make my QB app, which is the same one that would be deferred to MIT for RD\n      * Worse-quality essays and less time for last few SATs (not really needed but more chances for a 1540+)\n* Overall, do my chances change if I apply with QB?\n\n**Short Stat-Sheet, for context:**\n\n* First-gen (Half South-Asian, Half Middle-Eastern) | \\~20k family income | Living with divorced parent\n* GPA: 3.97 UW | 4.42 W | 10% Class Rank\n* SAT: Expected 1480-1520 Superscore | Trying for >780 Math Subscore\n* Courses:\n   * Freshman: AP Human Geo | *All other Hon*\n   * Sophomore: AP Bio (3) | AP World His (4) | *All other Hon*\n   * Junior: AP Psych | AP Eng. Lang. | AP Calc. AB | AP USH | *All other Hon*\n   * Senior: AP Comp. Science P | AP Eng. Lit. | AP Calc. BC | AP Gov. | AP Physics | Additional AP (Likely Stats) | *All other Hon*\n* ECs: Officer of Film & Tech club \\*(won state-level awards for short-film and photography)\\*| Officer of Computer Science Club | Environmental Club *(did multiple cleanups and beach cleanups around community)* | Mu Alpha Theta Club Officer | 100+ Service Hours | Duke TIP Program State Recognition | National Merit Scholar Commended | Other misc. things\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I've gotten some information from the QB site and previous posts, just short brief answers would be great :D*",

So it'd be harder to get selected for MIT through QB? Or specifically the match? I sorry, I don't really understand how the two are different, or like how u can to not match as a finalist?  \n\n\n>my suggestion would honestly be to apply for questbridge but forgo the match. you can use the qb application as a finalist to do early action for mit\n\nSo you can like, just apply for QuestBridge, and once/if you become a finalist you can then choose to match? Otherwise I can apply for MIT EA through the QB website itself? As in no involvement with MIT's own website and application?",
