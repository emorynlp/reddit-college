  "title:": "do uc applicants have to study english for 4 years? and do arts for 1 year?",
  "text": "the website says that all applicants have to study english for 4 years. im an int\u2019l applicant, and i didn\u2019t study english during grades 11 and 12 since i didn\u2019t take it as an a-level subject. does that automatically disqualify me for admission? \n\ni\u2019m super confused since ik a ton of (int\u2019l) applicants who haven\u2019t studied english at a-level but have attended UCs, so idk if it\u2019s flexible, or?\n\nand do all applicants also have to do a year of visual and performing arts? i didn\u2019t take any for igcse or a-level, so i\u2019m super confused. cant imagine that every uc student studied the arts during hs either (?)",
