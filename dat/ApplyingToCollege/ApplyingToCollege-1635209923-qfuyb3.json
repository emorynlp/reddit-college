      "text": "To add to what the others said, whether your scores are visible in the pdf doesn't necessarily indicate anything about test optional. If you want to apply test optional, of course check the test optional box in the college's questions, and go to the testing section of the Common App and delete your scores. (You can re-enter them before applying to another college where you'd want them to see your scores.)\n\nWhat your counselor may be confused about, in part, is that you can make changes to the Common App in between submitting to different colleges. Colleges only receive what is entered in your app at the time you submit it.",
