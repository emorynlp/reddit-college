  "text": "A friend and I are both from Georgia and applied to UGA and Georgia Tech early. I really want to go to UGA while she\u2019s more so hoping to get into GT. Well the UGA early decisions were released about a month ago and she got in. I didn\u2019t. I was deferred and while it didn\u2019t devastate me, I was pretty sad when I found out.\n\nFlash forward to today, GT early decisions come out. We both get \u201cconditionals\u201d. And these are things GT gives out to some students that are basically \u201csecured transfers\u201d. So, you take about 30/45 credits at another college, take certain classes, and maintain a 3.3+ GPA, and basically automatically get in if you apply to transfer into GT. That\u2019s a pretty good deal!! \n\nShe got actual conditional while I got something called a \u201cFirst Generation Pathway Option\u201d, something like that.\nWhich means she\u2019s only able to transfer in summer 23 while I\u2019m only able to in fall 23.\n\nEven though I personally think it\u2019s a pretty good deal (especially consider the fact that I don\u2019t know if I got into UGA or not yet), she\u2019s literally so\u2026 I don\u2019t even know. She\u2019s telling me that she\u2019s so depressed even though she got early admission to the school I really I want to go to and also got a better deal to go to the school SHE really wants to got to. I tried to cheer her up, saying that it\u2019s good that they didn\u2019t reject her and that maybe even going to tech in the summer could help her graduate early, but she doesn\u2019t even really care- she\u2019s just sad that they didn\u2019t even defer her.\n\nI don\u2019t even know if this type of post is allowed here but I just wanted somewhere to express my frustrations and rant. I don\u2019t even know if advice will do anything as she\u2019s currently a brick wall.\n\n(On a side note when I was deferred from UGA I actually cried and when I told her this all she said was \u201cAwww it\u2019s okay! I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get in later\u201d, and I always hate the way she is so sure of me getting in- like it\u2019s super easy.)",
