He just completed his graduate dental degree and he's received multiple job offers and residency offers as well. (I forget the terminology but basically he's set.)\n\nI was deferred from UVA ED last Friday and it's not the end of the world. Sometimes a defer or reject can lead you on an even better path. Best of luck to everyone. :)",
