  "title:": "If I have all A\u2019s except one of my classes is a C and it\u2019s an AP, will that ruin my chances of getting into a good school?",
  "text": "By the looks of it, unless I get a 90%+ on my next chapter test and final exam, I\u2019ll be ending with a C (each chapter is like three-four weeks). But the thing is it\u2019s an AP class, AP Physics 2 to be exact and I heard that\u2019s one of the harder AP\u2019s anyway, but it\u2019s still a C. I also took AP Physics 1 last year and ended with an A so maybe that makes up kind of, but idk lol\n\nEdit: I classify a good school as an acceptance rate of 40% and under. Also most of my grades beforehand were straight A\u2019s with one B at most sometimes. I also have a good amount of EC\u2019s and I have two letters of recs from teachers and one from a counselor. I\u2019ve also taken other AP\u2019s, science research, and honors classes throughout high school with A\u2019s in all of them",
