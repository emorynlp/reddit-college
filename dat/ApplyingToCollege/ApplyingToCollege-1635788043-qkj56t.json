  "text": "On the applicant portal it says to have your counselor submit first quarter grades, but it doesn\u2019t say where. It also does not say on their website, and common app does not have a location for it under guidance counselor rec (only optional report and mid year). I tried emailing admissions and got an automated response. My counselor doesn\u2019t know either, but I figured you guys in your all knowingness might. \nSo does anyone know where to submit this?",
