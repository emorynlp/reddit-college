  "text": "Hii, so I\u2019m submitting a few of my singing pieces to showcase my vocal and editing skills\u2026 does anyone know what sort of audio system colleges use to review this? Because my songs sound different when listening from different audio sources, like I don\u2019t know whether my edits should cater to a phone or earphones or a home theatre system or anything else. And I\u2019m not skilled enough to make the editing compatible for all devices, so any advice would be really great\n\nPS: not applying to a music college\n\nTL; DR: what sound system to non-music schools use to listen to songs submitted",
