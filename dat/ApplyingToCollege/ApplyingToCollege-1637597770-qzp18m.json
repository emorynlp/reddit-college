While the first two shootings were realistically out of the university\u2019s control (the first one was a shooter who shot people all over Chicago, including Evanston, while the second was a stray bullet outside of the UCPD patrol zone), this happened right in the heart of Hyde park. It looks like the admin is finally taking this seriously though, because the president has made multiple statements and plans have been outlined to install cameras everywhere and increase police presence/cooperation between the UCPD and CPD. Hopefully it\u2019ll get better.",

It could be because UChicago was already test-optional before that, because it\u2019s a more polarizing college, or because its supplements make it less appealing for test-optional shotgunners (who made up for a lot of the big app increases last year).\n\nEdit: I\u2019ll also add that imo you perceiving many more ppl on a2c to be interested in UChicago this year is likely just you noticing other UChicago applicants more because you\u2019re one yourself. As someone who was on this sub last app cycle and this year, I\u2019m personally not seeing a marked increase in interest, and I personally see many more ppl on this sub interested in HYSM+Penn",
