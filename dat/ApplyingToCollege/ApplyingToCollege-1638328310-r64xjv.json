  "text": "Love that for me \ud83d\ude03\n\nI'm leaning away from opening it before I take my tests, because either way it goes I don't think I'll be in the right frame of mind. Hopefully my mind doesn't wander during tests because I'm wondering about it, though. What do you all suggest? Should I open it after I'm done with all of them, riding high on post-test endorphins? Or, conversely, when I'm so crushed by how badly a test went I don't care about anything? Should I wait until I get home, or do it at school?",
