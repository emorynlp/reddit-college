  "text": "Used the shitpost flair but I'm totally serious LOL\n\nI walked out of sixth period dazed from my Yale deferral. I was standing around where I usually wait for a friend, and out of nowhere group of girls started yelling \"Why are you doing that?\" across the hallway. I thought they weren't talking to me but they yelled it again. I could only respond with an unintelligible \"wha..?\" and they all HURRIED out of there before i can say anything else. Then i realized my phone was pointed towards them and they probably thought I was recording them or something\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nI'm not sure if this is even what occurred but Yale deferring me made me seem like a weirdo and now there's some girls at school actively avoiding me :-)",
