I would suggest going through any of the Engineering rankings and seeing which schools are good fit for you - both academically and financially.",

I know exactly one upperclassman living on campus and it's only because they're graduating early and didn't wanna sign a full-year lease. \n\nI was curious and just checked; I live further from campus by transit than Tandon is from the main campus (I live in Midtown for reference so not even that far, not like the Bronx or anything.) In fact, I'd say most of my friends are about the same distance (in terms of time.) \n\nTandon for reference is like within 5-10 mins of the 4/5, N, F and A. It's very much a fine location to be in. Now if you have issues using the subway... yeah, don't live there.",
