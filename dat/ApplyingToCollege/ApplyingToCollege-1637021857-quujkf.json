  "text": "My fafsa has been processed for a few weeks now and I applied to two schools with November 15 fafsa deadlines in late October. Today I just added another school to my financial aid list and now my fafsa says it\u2019s not processed anymore, but submitted. Will this affect my financial aid at the two schools that I applied to a few weeks ago if my fafsa correction isn\u2019t processed by today?",
