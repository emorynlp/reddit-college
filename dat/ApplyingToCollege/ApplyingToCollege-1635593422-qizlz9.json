  "text": "Is there a particular disadvantage in submitting your application just before the deadline date? Universities like Harvard says that it does not use rolling system- that is there is no disadvantage in applying last? Should we believe this? Or are they tricking us by boasting their idealistic approach?\n\nQuestion to Harvard: I am planning to apply to Harvard this year. Since, the deadline for late action is 1st January , I had, at first, decided to apply just a week before the deadline. But now I have been told that if class is full before my application is read, I will not be admitted or admitted for class a year later. Can you please confirm the extent of truth in these statements.\n\nTheir reply: \nHarvard does not use a rolling system of admissions. After the January 1st deadline, all applications are read together and admissions are decided from there.",

Prior to that, they are reading REA applications and then taking time off for the holidays. There is no rolling admissions",
