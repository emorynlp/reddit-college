  "text": "&#x200B;\n\nI'm really interested in Northeastern - specifically the combined CS/Media Arts program. I found today, though, in this [sample plan of study,](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/undergraduate/computer-information-science/computer-information-science-combined-majors/computer-science-media-arts-bs/#planofstudytext) that in order to graduate:\n\nI'd need to take 20 credit hours in my first semester, 19 in the second, then 16 until I graduate, and I'd have to take classes in the summer almost every year, which really sucks cause home is far away and I kind of need to return for that time...\n\nI absolutely love everything about NEU, especially co-op, but this is a kick in the face. From what I've heard, 20 credit hours is a lot - especially for a freshman. It's obvious now - being gone for two semesters and graduating in four years means more classes - but this is a complete deal-breaker for what used to be my dream university. The summer thing especially sucks.\n\nI can't really compare this to any other uni - I've looked it up but not many colleges have a sample plan of study that I can find. Is there some aspect of this I'm not seeing? If the recommended course load for a college student is 15 course hours, how can Northeastern students be ok with no less than 16, plus eight or nine every summer in place of vacation? Note that the uncombined CS major is almost the same, though slightly less (still 19 first semester).\n\nThanks a lot.",

You\u2019re taking four courses and two one-credit seminars, which is quite normal.\n\nCMU\u2019s first semester is \u201c45\u201d and the second is \u201c50\u201c, so raw numbers can be misleading.\n\nYou\u2019re taking courses in the Summer because you\u2019re working in a Co-op in the Spring. Trying to effectively double major in four years with two co-ops will, unsurprisingly, be  intensive.\n\nThere is an alternate five year plan just below it.",

      "text": "Northeastern CS grad here who would fully recommend the program.\n\nThis is typical and not a crazy workload. \n\nFirst, as mentioned, Northeastern goes on a 4x4 vs a 5x3. You'll actually have one less class per semester compared to many other schools, but more in depth diving into the class. Overall it's the same workload as any other school in terms of time spent.\n\nYou have 4 classes, 3 of which have a lab or recitation (basically like a review of already covered course material) component. Straight art majors have 18 as well. Labs are common in earlier semesters since intro courses actually are offering them to provide more student support to build a base of knowledge, not to increase workload.\n\nAs also mentioned, the first schedule is the 4 year pattern. Doing 5 years (as many do) will help space things out. 4 years, a combined major, and two co-op's will 100% be more work, but you don't have to do that.\n\n>being gone for two semesters and graduating in four years means more classes\n\nI want to make the distinction that there are no \"more\" or less classes. Every degree is designed to be 8 semesters of classes, just like any other college. The key here is *when* those classes are taken. As noted, co-op's move classes into summer. Sometimes AP/IB credit can help lessen the number of those needed, even to 0 in some cases, but a CS major + combined program will make that harder. So will a 4 year program.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'd have to take classes in the summer almost every year, which really sucks cause home is far away and I kind of need to return for that time\n\nWhat's the reason here? \n\nNo matter where you go, you will likely need your summers. Internships will fill them at many other programs. This may be a struggle at any college, or potentially place you at a disadvantage when you graduate.",
