  "text": "Hi, Y'all! I kinda need a reality check! I know Columbia is obviously a big stretch for even extremely qualified people. However, is there even a point for me to ED with a 33 SS (And yes, Columbia is my dream school loll)? (I know recs and Ecs and etc are taken into account but I would say I am above average but not crazy). Any feedback is helpful, I just need a reality check! :)",

I don\u2019t think it would hurt you unless it\u2019s significantly lower than Columbia\u2019s median score. When writing your application, distinguish yourself and personality from grades. And honestly, apply ED if it is your dream. It is better to try and get deferred/rejected than live to regret never trying for your dream. That\u2019s my thought process going into this application process at least for my REA.",
