  "text": "I was considering going to college/university, but have realized it's just not possible to complete my degree in a reasonable time frame.\n\nI'm in my late thirties, with kids and full time work, so I'm looking at 6 years min to get my degree.\n\nQuestion is:\n\nHow can I get the essence of what university teaches you over the course of your degree?  \nI'm not referring to the specific information related to any courses, but rather the unseen benefits you get in the process of doing your degree? ie:\n\nLearning how to learn, teaching how to think a specific way.....not sure what else TBH.\n\nI've been a corporate worker for some time, so deadlines, teamwork etc are......all no problem.\n\nHopefully someone can understand what I'm asking.\n\nThanks.",

              "text": "Ok I understand. \n\nHere\u2019s my opinion - Honestly, I think you have so much life experience and a wealth of knowledge from living that I\u2019m not sure college can really anything worth the time and money. \n\nNow, if you needed to go back school to progress your career then that\u2019s understandable. Nothing comes to my mind that college has taught me that couldn\u2019t be learned through life and work experience. \n\nOthers may have more insight though!",
