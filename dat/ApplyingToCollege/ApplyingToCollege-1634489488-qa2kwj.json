  "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've been working through my college applications, and the score reporting part for ACT is super confusing. I took the ACT twice and got a 34 the first time and a 33 the second time. My superscore is a 35. I'm not quite so sure how to report any of this on Common App, though.\n\nIf I say that I took two ACT scores on Common App, then do I have to send both scores to all of my Common App colleges? I don't know if the lower score would hurt my chances (it's a high 34 vs a low 33 is that helps). I'd feel safer just sending the higher score to colleges that don't superscore, but if I do that, can I still report two scores on Common App? And then just send the superscore for the colleges that actually do superscore?\n\nFeel free to ask any questions since I think I worded this poorly, but any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

What are your highest section scores? How many tests do you need to report to support your superscore?\n\nCommon App is only collecting data; each school will only pull the data that aligns with their ACT scoring policy.\n\nFor sending tests to schools that require official reports, only send your best composite to schools that don\u2019t superscore. To schools that superscore, send all test reports needed to support your best superscore.",

      "text": "Check each of your colleges' websites to see what score reporting methods they accept. Many colleges now accept scores self-reported in the app (or portal), for free, to be followed by an official report *only if you later enroll.* Other colleges still require official score reports sent directly from the testing agency prior to admission.\n\nIf the college accepts ACT scores self-reported in the Common App, you are reporting your highest section scores and highest ACT composite. Common App does not have a place to enter lower section scores.\n\nFor colleges that have accepted your self-reported scores, you will only send an official report to the one college where you have chosen to enroll. This happens after you have been accepted, so there is no need for concern about the college seeing your lower section scores. You would need to send reports that prove all the ACT scores you self-reported in the app.",
