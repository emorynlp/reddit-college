  "text": "I am trying to help my daughter add this as an EC.  Will get her the tutoring needed.\n\nShe has a decent foundation in Piano, about Nyssma level 3-4.  But most likely not enough to get in with the most popular instrument in the world.\n\nLet's say our goal is to make it in 2 years, 10 hours a week practice.  Significantly more in summer time.\n\nWe live in New York if that helps.  If anyone went through the process can share their experience, practice time etc., really appreciated!",
