  "title:": "Elsevier and Springer Open Access Gold: do they review it faster?",
  "text": "Hi folks.\n\nThe open access journals, such as MDPI and Frontiers, are somewhat accepted more in the past few years but still raise some eyebrows in my field. However, they have quick and relatively straightforward review process. I had published in an MDPI journal, and the reviews were tough but fair and greatly improved my paper. \n\nIn contrast, a manuscript I wrote for an Elsevier journal (subscription) has now been under consideration for 9 months now. \n\nNow that Elsevier and Springer have the Open Access Gold option, have anyone tried it? Is it faster while retaining the quality of the review? What's your opinions?\n\nThank you for the answer!",

      "text": "The gold open access route should have no bearing on how long the review process takes.  If a journal offers both (open access & traditional 'closed' options) then they'll go through the same editorial and review process. Open access simply means that the article is freely available to everyone if its accepted and published. Gold open access means that the publisher formatted version is available. In contrast, green open access means that the final version the author submitted is available (usually through their institution).\n\nThe differences you have observed are more likely due to other differences in the journals (e.g. who they invite to review; their expectations on number, length and quality of reviews; the number of submissions they handle).\n\nAlso, I would contact the editorial office for the journal that's had your manuscript for 9 months. It may simply have fallen between the cracks somewhere.",

              "text": "Yeah, \"ghost reviewers\" (those that accept and then disappear) are a pain for editors.  Possibly field/journal specific, but I would consider an extra 3 months to be enough time to warrant a follow up. Systems don't always flag up to editors when papers have been sitting there, or automatic emails get lost in the shuffle.",
