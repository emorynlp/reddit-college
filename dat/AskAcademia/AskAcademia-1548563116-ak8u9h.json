      "text": "There are several aspects of this letter that tell us that this isn't a matter of \"professional courtesy\".\n\n1. Is it expected that every conversation in the student lounge/study area is only about research matters? Anyone who has spent any time in these spaces knows that people talk about all kinds of crap there, related or not to research, and that it's absurd to expect that while people are at work they will only be discussing work matters.\n\"I encourage you to commit to using English 100% of the time.\" When you make a joke with a friend? When you talk about your lunch in the break room? When you vent after a failed test? Why would English be necessary in any of these situations?\n\n2. As also stated by OP /u/misschang - Writing down names \"so they could remember them if the students ever interviewed for an internship or asked to work with them for a master's project.\" Forgive my assumption, but it's difficult to read this as anything other than suggesting these students be blacklisted for having an animated discussion in their first language. Whether or not you think that the students should be allowed to talk in Chinese, this seems like an absurd overreaction.\n\n3. There's no indication that the professors complaining even tried to approach the students directly. Do they even want to solve the supposed problem? Or are there other factors at play?\n\nSure, there's nothing that could be called overtly racist in this letter, but many of the things that it says make absolutely no sense from the \"professional\" perspective it claims to have.",

This in fact might violate laws around discrimination based on country of origin.",

This one? There is no ambiguity, she comes across as xenophobic and retributive. IF the faculty members actually wrote down student's names to blacklist them for speaking a language other than English (this part seems very odd and possibly fabricated), the director putting it in writing leaves Duke wide-open to a discrimination lawsuit.

I have dealt with both being excluded and with people who only ever spoke Chinese spending their whole PhD years in the US and not being able to speak English well enough to get any job. Such students will have no non-Chinese friends because they aren\u2019t willing to step outside their comfort zone; on the other end of the spectrum, you also have students who are very proactive in engaging with non-Chinese students, and having no non-Chinese friends is somewhat rare. I mention Chinese only because they are the only group large enough that they can comfortably avoid using English (in Statistics, the only other comparably large group is Indians, and they speak English more-or-less just as well as natives).\n\nIt\u2019s a common issue, for sure, in Statistics. I remember students being encouraged to only speak English in their office and around the department when I was student, essentially for the reasons above. I\u2019m sure if I pulled up the message and posted it, there wouldn\u2019t be any serious backlash here, because the person who wrote it isn\u2019t an idiot.",

I was friends with most of the Chinese international students at my university as a freshman.\n\nHey, good on you for having diverse friends - that's what I'm trying to promote. I am friends with all of the Chinese faculty (who probably land closer to my side of this argument than you might guess, and are more critical of Chinese students than I could ever be) in my department, and was friends with plenty of Chinese students as a PhD student, and I don't mind if they speak Chinese around me. I don't know if you somehow got the sense that it \"bothers me\" if people around me are speaking a different language - I can't even understand all of the languages my own family speaks. I'll say that, if I dropped you into a few situations I was put into as a student, there are very few people who would not feel excluded and/or inconvenient to be around.\n\nHaving a large group of students who only ever talk among themselves, in a different language, and do not socialize outside of their group, is not ideal for building a community. It isn't even a good thing **for them**. I honestly don't see the issue in trying to improve that. Especially since there are also a half dozen reasons that it is better **for the students themselves** to try to speak English more. Nobody is telling anyone who they have to go to the movies with, or who they have to date, or anything like that. \n\n> & English is one of the official languages of India, so of course the Indian students know how to speak it well even if they usually used their local language or Hindi back home.\n\nRight, that is why Indians are essentially native speakers. I wasn't criticizing the Chinese students for not being like the Indian students, just pointing out why the Chinese are the only ones being picked on :) ",

I'm not denying there are certain...infamous issues with some mainland Chinese students but I'm not going to blindly generalize them. Can't speak for the damn tourists, but that's tourists for you; Americans were the stereotypical rude tourists too. And as for the students, those are the same type of brats you'll see in every race/nationality. If those were Americans they'd act the same way. For every bad stereotype I see with \"mainlanders\", my friends from the mainland have twice the pros. \n\nThe comment above you just reeks of racism. Hongs and ROC? Does this guy go around saying Japs, Charlies and negroes too? And no shit they think Chinese and act Chinese, they're Chinese. To be rude is nurture, not nature or culture, and bad nurture happens regardless of geography.

In large swaths of \"the South\" I still agree with you today.  But there is also a very significant portion of the South that is very progressive and belies the stereotype of racist yokels.  There's a recent map of voting tendencies that shows urban areas (where many universities are located) swings liberal.  I am not a fan of the term the \"New South,\" but there are a lot of changes and simply saying the political climate is less progressive is disingenuous.  \n\nIf you look at NC in particular, it is a battleground state with roughly equal numbers of conservatives and liberals.  Neither side can act with impunity to install their own agenda (and when they do, they get voted out the other undoes their work by stupidly doing the same thing - I won't say the politicians are actually good).  Perhaps you may be mistaking the highly visible competition for a lack of progressivism? As I moved from a state dominated by one political party, seeing two parties battle is illuminating (and often depressing), but it shows that there are differences throughout the populace.  The part of your post that rankled me was the seeming dismissal that the South is just a backwards place; that's a blindness that ignores a lot of progress that has been made (and calls back to past discriminatory practices and the necessity for code-switching).  I'd liken that to another poster here who commented that Germans speaking German wouldn't be discriminated against... except that that was a regular occurrence for a good chunk of American history, until those with German heritage were viewed as sufficiently American.

It seems you wanted to reinforce your own departments prevailing culture and indicate that it might be different from similar expectations at Duke.  The broad \"in the South\" statement caused me to interpret that as a bias against Southerners rather than a declaration of that being outside your experience; I'll admit that I am conditioned  from years of hearing \"in the South\" as a precursor to some negative statement.\n\nThe funny thing, now I am wondering if Dr. Neely's statement might possibly be being interpreted similarly badly.  I commented someplace else about diction and professional language coaching of African-American students (a thing that does happen and addresses the practicalities of students who will face prejudice in the job market), asking if that was similarly racist, or if it mattered if that occurred at HBCUs or predominantly white institutions or if it mattered the race of the coach.  As both that and the \"foreigners speaking foreign languages\" impact me, I am very curious to hear opinions about how the two might be related. Unfortunately, no takers yet, just hit-and-run DVs.  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",

The more recent one, though... I really am not seeing any charitable way of interpreting it. It came across as punitive and xenophobic, particularly what seemed to be a not-so-veiled statement that faculty were blackballing the non-english-speakers from positions in their labs.\n\nIf it is an issue with communication, I would argue that she should not have been in a Director position at all, as that is a position in which effective communication, including cross-cultural communication, is vital.\n\nEdit: I forgot to respond to the diction and language-coaching for AA students. In AA professional circles, it's very widely recognized that code-switching is an important aspect of professionalism. Some people resent and decry it, but my perspective is that it is just as important for white English-speakers as it is for nonwhites and non-English-speakers. Here's why.\n\nAs human beings, we code-switch constantly. I am fluent in three different Academic dialects; Biology, Psychology, and Epidemiology. These are all academic dialects, but they are not the same! I am also fluent in Pop Culture Nerd, AAVE, Urban Indian, Hippie, Science Enthusiast, and Discordian. These are all social circles I belong to, and they all speak a slightly different dialect.\n\nWe are demanding nothing different from someone who was raised speaking AAVE than we are asking of someone who was raised speaking Low Income White Suburbian. \n\nI work at a community college. My students are primarily low-income, first-generation white, Black, and Latinx recent high-school graduates and GED-earners, with a smattering of older adults. Every single one of them has to learn to speak Academic English, and part of my job is teaching them the dialect of the field I teach in. When I talk to them about this, that's how I talk about it. I am not teaching them \"proper\" English, I am teaching them a specialized professional dialect. I also teach them that their background and their perspective is a *strength* they are bringing to their field, and that the academy desperately needs them, if it is to adequately do its job of serving the public good. \n\nThe question of racism -- or, more accurately IMO, Western colonialism -- in academia is an important one. How the colonized, including the white victims of imperialism, can participate in the Academy without being absorbed and thus silenced, is a topic that requires exploration. When I talk about this with my students, I typically recommend a paper called Epistemicide! The tale of a predatory discourse. \n\nhttps://www.academia.edu/1575057/Epistemicide_The_Tale_of_a_Predatory_Discourse",

If you have a grad program that is 100% international by design, then that becomes part of the group identity. Also (as a more practical matter) if the participants' native languages or countries of origin were heavily fragmented, then it would be difficult for cliques to form on that basis alone.",

However, when you speak English well enough to go to take grad studies in said language (and I know there is a controversy around Chinese students and TEOFL), don't organize a study session and exclude people. I'm sure if the Prof wanted to conduct the course in Punjabi, he could have... but he knew not everyone (well, nobody in that room) spoke it.\n\nThis situation seems different, granted.

I think it was split 50/50 that some were struggling with learning English and American customs, the other half only engaged with other Chinese. It can easily be interpreted that they had no intentions of wanting to learn English or engage with us. There was a Chinese postdoc who forced his Chinese mentees to speak only English in the office for professional reasons, outside of the office or when it was break time they could speak however they chose. In any case, a lot of these visitors were/are very nice, some of them are a bit embarrassed by their lack of English mastery, but many want to engage and try.
