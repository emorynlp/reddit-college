  "text": "Hi fellow students and professors.This is my first post.I'm in my first year master, and I have to hand in at the end of summer a draft of 50pages of what my master thesis wil be next year.I am completely lost, and have no idea whatsoever.I love everything I am studying; business, economics, entrepreneurship, marketing, supply chain... and more. But I have 0 interest and I can't even understand the use of that thesis. I don't even find a subject.Do you have any idea to share with me ? How I can easily reach those 50 pages ? If you also lacked motivation but succeed how did you do it ? Guidance ? Your own draft before changing subject ? Really, anything could help.  \n\n\nEDIT: Typo",
