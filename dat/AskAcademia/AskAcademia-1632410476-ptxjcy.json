  "text": "I've been trying to figure out the difference between industry and academia research but the only answers I seem to get is industry is applications and academia is discovery.... but I don't exactly know what that means.\n\nSo is this analogy correct? \n\nIn terms of a hypothetical vaccine: academics discovered that when you present a certain antigen to immune cells, immunity is created. Industry scientists then used that idea to develop and test a vaccine.\n\nI think I'd rather be on the original theory side of developing drugs/vaccines rather than actually finding out how to create them. Does that mean I'll be better suited to academia? Or is anything related to Pharma industry work?",

      "text": "I think the main difference is the approach to publishing. There is a lot of pressure to publish in the academia, which results in diminishing research quality. Everyone is too focused on finding anything publishable, even if it is useless practically. \n\nIndustry, on the other hand, does not force you to constantly produce papers. Consequently, researchers are more focused on achieving the actual goals instead of increasing the paper count. As a result, if a company decides to publish a paper, it is usually a high-quality work.",

          "text": "Publishing is to academia as profitability is to industry.\n\n\nWorking in academia, you can get away with working a lot on a \"useless\" project, as long as it brings in papers and prestige. Because those things matter more to grant proposals (and therefore funding) than direct market impact. \n\nIn industry you are not forced to publish, but your project will end if it's not profitable or it doesn't have a route to profitability.",

      "text": "Even in academia, you are building off of someone else's work. In your hypothetical example, one group probably discovered 1 type of immune cell, another group discovered what it does, another group discovered antigens, another group discovered what antigens do, another group discovered how to present antigens to immune cells in vitro, another group discovered how to present antigens in vivo all while continuously building off each other's work.\n\nWe still do discovery in industry. There is usually a lower threshold for determining whether or not the project is succeeding and whether or not to continue.",

      "text": "There's certainly a lot of applied research going on in academic environments, and also don't forget governmental agencies - which in practical terms can sub-contract to either academic or private sector corporations.\n\nThe answer to your question depends strongly on the field (as well as national culture in how research is supported). Are we talking about power systems engineering or volcanology? In very very general terms, industry research is geared towards developing products that the company can turn into a source of revenue. Academic research, well, it depends. If the research requires money beyond pencil, paper and a personal workstation, the overall paradigms are largely set by big public funders. There are feedback mechanisms that help starting emergent approaches, and larger program teams figuring out which detail questions get funded. They can span the gamut of theoretical, experimental, observational, applied, ...\n\nYour question sounds to me as of you're approaching this from a 10000 feet top-down perspective, and then I'm not sure this is very useful. I'd suggest select the field(s) you're interested in first, figure out what the active questions are and where work on them happens. Also, what it takes to get into a successful career. Academic research can be insanely competitive, and so can industrial. The literature can help as authors normally must disclose from being sources and affiliations.",

I do translational research and work on a lot of projects in conjunction with biotech companies, but I'm an academic.\n\nIt's been my experience that while both academic and industry labs can develop drugs/vaccines, academics get to ask \"why\" more than you do in industry. \n\nThere are a lot of great academic labs that develop vaccines. Look at Paul Offit's career or the Wistar Institute.",
