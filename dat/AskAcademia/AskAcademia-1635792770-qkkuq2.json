This is particularly true, if as you mentioned, the PhD is not sure they will stay in academia. However, it is also not uncommon for a PI to give the first author corresponding. For example, my PI typically lets me take corresponding, but likely wouldn't do the same for an masters or undergraduate student who may not stay in academia or pursue a PhD. I don't think it really undermines the student though, I wouldn't have any issues if my PI wanted to take corresponding on my paper. I feel like it may have been more important in the past, but now if you need to contact any of the authors, it's pretty easy to fine their contact information.",

The number of corresponding author papers definitely counts towards tenure, and will reflect on grant applications. \n\nHowever, my understanding is that for students / post-docs looking for a new professor position (I've not gone that route, I'm staff), first author publications are what will count **most** heavily. Obviously can't necessarily be first on everything, but a majority are expected to be first author publications.
