  "title:": "Survey: When offered multiple postdoc positions, what were your deciding factors?",
  "text": "This is not an inquiry for a 'general guide' in criteria to look for when deciding a postdoc position and choosing between multiple offers. Things I am already aware of and am taking into consideration:\n\n* Expertise (i.e., research niche of PI -- do you like the questions/models)\n* Funding status/success (e.g., R01s in USA)\n* Mentorship style (you and PI getting along on an interpersonal level)\n* Trainee input (i.e., experiences/successes of past/present trainees under the PI)\n* Publication history (e.g., journal impact, frequency of publication)\n* etc...\n\n**What I'm curious about is more personalized reasons why you chose one postdoc offer over another?** \n\n(Basically, I will likely have multiple offers from PIs that meet all the standard check boxes... so what are some nuanced considerations after the obvious is accounted for?)",

      "text": "I think this is about you and not us. Cold rational lists about factors external to you are fine, but you are you. What makes you tick? What do you do to relax? Do you like mentoring students? Do you like being in big busy labs, or smaller intimate groups? Do you want to be at the top of the tree in the group or one among many? Do you need experience writing grants? Would you go crazy living in a tiny college town or would you love having easy access to the outdoors? Did you like any of the PIs more than others?\n\nThere's no definitive answer to which postdoc you should do, and ultimately this is as much an emotional, values-based decision as it is scientific. You need to pick on where you think you would flourish and succeed. We're all different and we do well in different contexts. \n\nI did two 3 yr postdocs. The first was in a very large, collaborative international lab. I had a ball but the science  was rather formulaic. They had a recipe for success and we all followed it. The second was a brand new lab at a good state university. I have zero regrets, learnt a lot, had a great time (more outside work than in), but the university was toxic, the town was tiny and the student and staff population was extremely homogenous, not just white but white and only from that state. It was a culture shock. The science was much more interesting but if I had to do it all over I'd do the first one. Less stress, more success.",
