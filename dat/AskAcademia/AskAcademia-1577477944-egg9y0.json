  "title:": "[UPDATE] How to deal with students coming to me at the end of the semester to tell me they had mental health issues during the semester and would like some leniency in the grading? - Bamboozled edition",
  "text": "A week ago [I asked for some advice](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/ed17at/how_to_deal_with_students_coming_to_me_at_the_end/) about how to handle the students coming to me at the end of the semester asking for help and leniency with their grades because they had \"mental health\" issues during the semester.\n\nThe advice from the sub was clear and sound: sorry, students, unless you have documentation and/or let me know ahead of time that this was an issue, you can't get special treatment retroactively. I felt good about that.\n\nThen one of the students cornered me. They were waiting for me at the end of the final exam. We were alone and they asked to speak to me. They had sent me their final paper over ten days late. Since I take 10% of the grade for every day it's late, it was an automatic zero and they begged me to reconsider and look at the paper and give them some credit. \n\nThey explained they are taking five courses and they need to work because they are from an impoverished background (this much I actually know is true). The student is actually quite talented, but because of many absences and missed assignments, they were just barely passing the class. I knew of this student's background and actually did try to keep an eye out for them, but it didn't help much. I stood my ground and said the paper would not count, they would have to take their D and that was it. It wasn't fair to the other students who also had hard semesters, etc.\n\nHowever, some things lingered in my mind from the conversation. I thought about it constantly all week. The first thing was what felt like a story of pulling themselves out of poverty by getting into this special scholarship program at college. They are a talented student, and I didn't want to feel like I was sabotaging their future. And with all that school work plus a job, I mean, who wouldn't have mental health problems, right?\n\nThe second part was that they kept talking about how hard they worked on that paper. This is what really got me. Their first paper for the class had been very good, but also so late they didn't get much credit for it. There were several students who handed in no final paper at all and got a zero just like this student, and I started to think, why should someone who worked really hard but was held back by other responsibilities and understandable emotional stress be penalized the same way? I thought that might not be fair after all. And it didn't take anything away from the other students, to look at the paper, right?\n\nI guess it was the Christmas spirit because I decided to take the time that day to give the student another chance. I'd already submitted the final grades, but I prepared the change of grade form with all but the new grade and sat down to read their paper. The first odd thing I notice of this paper (that this student had two more weeks than they others to write) was that is was very short - half the length it was supposed to be. Then I started reading. It was bad, but also...familiar. It was almost a carbon copy of a group project paper from earlier in the semester with just one new paragraph added. Plus, this paper included all the mistakes from the first paper that I corrected when I graded it! There I was, on Christmas no less, taking my day to try to save this kid's career and I got completely bamboozled!\n\nNeedless to say, they got their D. And I will be bringing up this paper with the chair of the department as possible academic misconduct. I'm such an idiot!\n\nEDIT (from the first post that goes for this one as well): I should add that I say explicitly in my syllabus, and on the first day of class, that I am open to helping students with any sort of \"special case.\" I say explicitly that anything that has do do with mental or physical health (or any family issues) qualified and they should come to be as soon as they become aware that it is (or even might be) an issue for class. I am happy to work something out that will make things easier for them, but I can't change grades retroactively or move deadlines when they have already passed.",

          "text": "There was another student in my class from the same scholarship program who also had a very rough start to the class. I gave both students warnings in their midterm grades. This other student came to me and asked me for help. We did some extra projects together and the student really blossomed. Their attendance in class was perfect and, over time, they opened up and started to participate very well. That student ended up with an A- and never once brought up his impoverished background as an explanation, excuse, or anything at all. The student wrote me a very nice thank you for letting them do the extra work, and I am really proud of that student.\n\nHelping a student in need does feel good, but don't underestimate how dispiriting it is to have something like this happen. The student waited until two days before grades were due to come to me, which put me in an awkward position. With more time, I could have spoken with their advisor and found out more of the whole story. It also left me with a bad feeling at the end of the semester to have to say no to them that way, which is part of why it niggled at me so long. I helped plenty of students this semester, because they were able to come to me in advance. One student had a full-time job and a kid, one student was the caretaker for her father who had stage-4 cancer and went right from my class every week to take him for chemo. It's not about avoiding help for those who need it, it's about conserving my energies so I don't burn out. I can't just throw myself into everyone's case like this, I don't think.\n\nI always have a bit of a soft spot for the \"mental health\" problem types, because I was one of those, too. I never would have brought it up to my professors because I knew I was bringing most of it on myself - sleep deprivation, chronic procrastination, partying, being overly-involved in the social dramas of college. I always remember the professors who gave me a break anyway, and how thankful I was. Somehow I tend to forget that the reason those professors gave me a break was that, when I wasn't being a total fuck up, I was working hard and showing that I was smart and wanted to do well.",

But when they see their final grade and then want to fix it in the last week it is a no-go.

Enough to fail outright based on poor attendance.\n\nMy professor approached me at the end of the term and offered me a chance to make it up -- one assignment for each class I'd missed. I finished all the assignments and passed the class. I then took four more courses from the same professor. Almost fifteen years later, we're still in touch.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm successful in a field unrelated to my degree, but I doubt I'd be here if I'd failed that course. Leniency may not always be warranted, and in my case it probably wasn't, but it will often be appreciated, and it may be a key point in getting someone back on track. I'm glad I was given that chance.",

          "text": "Thank you for providing this outlook. It\u2019s very refreshing to hear optimism as such, for myself personally. There are undoubtedly students that take advantage of this system, which I understand is why the processes of grade appeals can be rigorous (in my personal appeal experience, almost demeaning). I had a legitimate excuse - without too many details, my family life is rough due to parental alcoholism, and I would sometimes toggle on the edge of being suicidal because of it - I knew of my resources, but because of my personal upbringing, counseling was in fact looked down upon by my family, and I grew up with similar mindsets until I finally went - and learned, that counseling is incredible. imo, sometimes young students don\u2019t have the social skills to reach out for counseling, even though they know the resource is there (maybe especially in situations where family life has never been good?), no matter how bad things get in their academic career. I wish the professor had this outlook of optimism when I attempted to grade appeal. I also understand that professors have to be cautious with these situations. Students taking advantage of the system really make it difficult for people that need it. So I appreciate this post so much for bringing up the discussion.",

I think it is crucial to avoid bias in any direction -- favorable or unfavorable -- and thus it is imperative to follow the syllabus, regardless of a student's situation. It is unethical to treat students differently based on personal knowledge about them or their situations. If this means having a flexible syllabus that allows for late submissions, then I think that should be established in advance. For every student who is struggling with a situation who tells you about it, who we favor, there is another student who is struggling with a situation who has not disclosed this, who we do not offer the same favor to.   \n\n\nAnd so we must write policy and follow it.   \n\n\nMine may not be a popular position, but as an Ethicist, it makes very real sense to me. One can, of course, state in ones' syllabus that students with ongoing issues disclose these, or take occasional in-class surveys to look for this kind of thing if one is concerned that students have issues, ongoing.",

My condition was declining and I had a serious need for some accommodations, but I didn't realize I would qualify for them because I thought accessibility services were for more \"severe\" disabilities. \n\nThat's probably not the best wording, but I didn't think of my chronic illness and subsequent symptoms as a disability or bad enough warrant services. I have an invisible illness and I know that to most people who don't see me every single day, I look completely fine, so a part of it was also feeling guilty, like there are so many people who struggle more than I do. \n\nOne thing I've always wished since going through with getting services is that professors would mention the categories included under disability/accessibility services. I think many students who did not have IEPs in elementary/secondary school and those with more \"invisible\" illnesses may not realize they could qualify for services and don't think it applies to them because they don't think of their condition/illness as a disability. I know I certainly didn't understand that I could and should apply for accommodations until my doctor point blank asked me why I hadn't met with the accessibility office.",

A student that has done well and has good attendance will likely get some allowances even retroactively if there is a dip in performance. A student that has performed poorly or not had good attendance has done little to demonstrate that the professor should trust them.\n\nDepending on the situation, sometimes a student does have to take some responsibility for their poor performance, even when it seems the obstacles are external. Many students cannot handle the strain of college-level academics without the structure of high school or their family. They no longer have someone to tell them when and how to do their homework, or keep track if they are attending classes the same way. This is not to mention how nobody is keeping them on a good sleeping schedule or making sure they eat well either. They are left to their own devices, often living in houses of students in exactly the same situations. Poor eating and sleeping, multiple distractions and little structure can often lead a student to quickly feel like they are falling behind in their work. This then leaves them feeling anxious and depressed and they do even more poorly.\n\nThe issue is that professors are for teaching and assessing academics and advanced academic skills. They are not there for emotional support or to monitor the students to be sure they have basic study skills.",

It's possible to hold your ground regarding your grading decisions while also being respectful and kind towards those who have legitimate issues. \n\nWhen professors are steely regarding these things it's very obvious to the students and that fear of interpersonal judgement may play a role in those students waiting until the last second to communicate. I myself have a clinical anxiety disorder that I'm in professional treatment for. To be honest, based on your comment, I would feel extremely uncomfortable even disclosing that issue to you were I a student in your class, including as a means to obtaining accommodations granted by the school. You only mentioning 'the fakers' makes me wonder if there's anyone who you don't think is faking. \n\nAgain, it's totally possible to stand up for yourself and the other students regarding your grading decisions while still being kind when interacting with or discussing those who ask for help.",

      "text": "I'm seeing this post after the updates, ya that students gets the grade they deserve :/\n\nI struggled with mental health all throughout college. The only reason I passed is because my professors were flexible and helped me out. I always talked to them ahead of time though, asking for extensions prior to the due dates and always putting in my best effort when I could do my work. Sometimes I'd get some points deducted from a late paper but I still put the effort in to fully complete the assignment. I wouldn't have been able to get through college without the professors flexibility but I still feel I earned my degree. I did all the work the other students did; it's just sometimes it took me a bit longer to succeed. \n\nMy department had quite flexible attendance policies. When my depressive episodes hit the worst it was hard for me to get out of bed in the morning and when my anxiety was bad I might be physically in class but not mentally present. I was pretty consistent with communicating with my professors about all this and would talk to them during their office hours. As long as I was showing I was engaging with the material they were teaching and meeting the learning goals they set for the course they typically wouldn't deduct points for attendance. When I was well I'd share thoughtful ideas and ask good questions quite regularly. My professors got to know me pretty well and by the time I was in my junior and senior years some professors were able to read me pretty well and would check in if they noticed something was off. \n\nSometimes I would be doing really poorly. In those times I'd talk to my professors and be honest. What would it take for me to get a B- in their class that semester? I wouldn't expect them to just give me an A just because and I wouldn't ask for that. I'd lower my goals, disengage a big more than normal, and focus on doing what I needed to to get better. My professors would know this and sometimes they'd let me know how to complete an assignment in a way that would take less time but still get me a passing grade. If I had a 90% in the class thus far they might let me know that if i turned in a big assignment that was a page or two short or a week late i could get a 70% on it and still get a B- or better in the class. Other times I'd be doing well, get really excited about a project, and go well above and beyond the expectations. I finished college with a 3.5\n\nThrough all this I developed some serious life and communication skills that help me as a post college adult. I'm better able to assess what commitments I can and can't keep before making them. I'm able to be honest upfront with people. I know my limitations well and know how much I can reasonably take on. I know my cycles and really take advantage of when I'm doing well to set myself up to still be fine when I'm not. I'm about to set boundaries and know how to ask for help in a fair way. \n\nI'm really thankful for the flexibility of my professors. I would have dropped out sophomore or junior year without their support. It was a give and take though. If I wasn't communicating with them and turning in quality work I don't think they would have been able to or should have let me pass their classes. \n\nIt seems you do let students know you'll work with them if they talk to you about it. I'd suggest really emphasizing that at the beginning of the semester. No one is just a student; everyone has many complex sides to them and sometimes that interferes with their course work. Great professors help their students and great students make it easy for their professors to help them",

Most of the arguments I've heard revolved around \"it's too much of a hassle\". Are you really that soulless that you'd fail students because they submitted an assignment 2 weeks late?\n\nMental health issues are not like having a flu. It's like drowning. You swim around and it seems a bit hard but you're fine and you'll make it to the shore no problem. Then you realize that hey, you need help but it's too late and you have a lungs filled with water and you can't get help even if you tried to scream. All you can do is try to paddle and breathe to survive a little  bit longer.\n\nNo, there is no such thing as \"informing your professor that they have mental issues at the start of the semester\". These students will at best try to talk to you at the end of the semester but most of them will simply drop your class or just never show up to the exams even though they almost finished it.\n\nHands down best instructors I've worked with or were taught by had no such restrictions. If you came to them a year later after suddenly disappearing they'd just respond with \"ok email me the tasks when done\".\n\nI've taken up that philosophy myself and any \"deadlines\" are not hard deadlines but mere suggestions for people that need structure in their work. You can always improve your assignments after I've given feedback if you wish to improve your grade and if you submit late, you'll just have to wait for me to get around to grading it (usually takes a few weeks). There are retakes for the exam year round so just show up whenever you feel like it. June and January are very popular because December & May are very exam heavy and people love to offload some of the work after it's all over.",

              "text": "It's simple: Don't have hard deadlines or other nonsense rules and you don't need to negotiate/email about anything since you cover it in the first lecture along with the syllabus.\n\nIf you plan to spend 1 hour to grade each students work and you have 150 students, that's 150 hours of grading. If 50 students decide to return the assignment late, that means 50 hours of work saved now and pushed into the future whenever they decide to return the assignment.\n\nExtra exams do not take much extra time to create. You will have to create extra exams ANYWAY because people get sick, people get jury duty, people have to go to a funeral etc.\n\nStop trying to be the judge of people and \"figure out if they deserve it\" and \"figure out the details\" etc. \n\nJust tell your class that you will have an exam in October and December with retakes January and March, May and July, you and your TA's offer assistance until end of December and you'd prefer if they submitted them then, but they can submit assignments whenever and take as many retakes as they'd like and just hit \"i would like my grade please\" button in Moodle or whatever and you're going to go through them within a month after each retake.\n\nCreating some more similar questions does not add a lot of effort since you're going to want to give mock questions, homework questions etc.\n\nIf everyone gets the opportunity to go to as many retakes as they wish and return assignments whenever they wish, there is no unfairness.\n\nYou can ask the department/faculty to use some of the TA hours over the year instead of all at once in December.\n\nThere is LESS overall work involved by being inclusive and allowing anyone take a retake and return assignments late with no reason specified than having to deal with special cases. Some of those special cases you are legally required to accommodate so it's not like you can be a nazi and deny them all.\n\nYou don't have to meet them, you don't have to help them, you don't have to answer their questions etc. if they are submitting late. Email exists and so do learning management systems, you don't have to do everything manually.\n\nWhenever I taught, I just prepared 3-5 exams instead of 2 (you always have to prepare at least 2 because someone gets called up to jury duty something) which wasn't a lot of work. I had a TA grade the exams and any assignments and submit his hours every few months if the course was big enough. No bullshit emails, no sob stories, no bureaucracy, no stress or sleepless nights because of some surprise. You plan for it and do some minimal time management.",

You at least have to do XYZ.\" True story, sadly. Same with a student whose uncle was strangling her. She came to class with the finger marks on her neck and broken blood vessels in her eyes.",

      "text": "I think students don't realize that teaching and grading papers are not the only things that we do.  Professors have to do research, write and revise papers for publication if we ever hope to get a raise/promotion, and do committee work for the university and our department which often also requires reports.  When we aren't in the office or the classroom we aren't enjoying a bunch of free time.  \n\nBased upon these responsibilities, we organize our semesters so that we have certain weeks for grading, certain weeks for research and writing, etc.  And, yes, we try our best to schedule some vacation/family time for our own mental health.  We deserve free time, too.  As students know, constantly reading, researching, and writing papers is mentally exhausting.  We are not at our own personal best or good for our families when we are stretched too thin. \n\nWhen we are near the end of the semester and are beginning to mentally unwind  as we prepare for our own break, it is so frustrating when emails and office visits begin pouring in from students who never talked to us before but suddenly want to give excuses as to why they should be allowed to submit late work.  It is never just one student asking for these extra considerations, either--students think they are the only one trying to negotiate more time/a better grade--but there are always *at least* two in every class that are haggling with us via email or in person. \n\nDepending upon the assignment/exam, late grading could take up a good chunk of a day.  We have to to get final grades submitted by a specific date or else we have to go the extra layer of doing grade changes, and some departments get in trouble for having too many faculty grade change submissions, so we are hustling to get everything graded by a certain date.  Now all of a sudden we have at least six late papers/exams to grade if we want to meet the deadline for grading, and our \"day off\" or our entire weekend is now spent grading late work even though we did *our* job and had everything grading on time.  \n\nDo I love my students? YES, I do--I love my job, I love seeing students succeed, I love when they are still using me for job or grad school references years later because I had such a positive influence on their lives.  But, I absolutely feel broken down by the haggling process at the end of every semester when I have to tell my own kids no, I can't come to your class party, or no, I can no longer be a chaperone for your field trip, because I still have more grading to do in order to meet university deadlines--grading that would have been done if everything had been submitted when due. \n\nSometimes I wonder if I should explain this to students at the beginning of a semester?  Most of them are too young to understand if I were to try to explain that I need my down time, too, my kids and spouse would like to have the time I promised to them dedicated only to them, etc.  Maybe students will be able to think back and remember what it was like when their mom was the only one who didn't help out at the holiday party, or their dad worked through the weekend and missed a family event he was supposed to participate in?  I don't know.  I don't want them to feel like they are a burden, I just want them to do their work and do it when it is due.",

For example, our accessibility staff really emphasize student self-advocacy. They absolutely vet and support students with these needs, but they expect the students to engage their instructors about anything specific to their courses. Faculty get a notification that says \"Student X is approved for the following accomodations in your course and will speak to you if she wants to take advantage of them.\" But that's it-- the students have to work with their faculty to actually set things up.",

These are the student\u2019s concerns, not the instructor\u2019s.

                  "text": "Easy to say, but remember that undergrad is when many people first discover their disabilities, it's not something you necessarily know about ahead of time. I did mine right at the end of when your mentality was dominant (and likewise held by yours truly), and it did not occur to me, for example, that freezing up for 2h of a 3h exam -- literally incapable of understanding the English in a single question -- was not a 'normal' reaction to stress. I did not understand that being unable to get out of bed all day was something one could (and should) see a doctor for. I was able to half-ass my way through the basic school system with high grades despite those now-obvious disabilities. It takes a few semesters to figure out what is going on. I think it didn't occur to anyone else that I needed help then, and it's sure as hell hard to figure that stuff out when you're under influence of a failing brain. Thankfully, I think public understand of mental health and disabilities in general has gotten a lot better now, but if an instructor could help tip off a student to seek help, they could well save that student's career. I took my F's, all 7 or 8 of them throughout, and the GPA of 2, because in my mind then, I was born \"normal\" and learning disabilities and mental health issues did not apply to me. No one said anything otherwise for a long time...\n\nUltimately, I still ended up where I wanted to be, it just took a lot of extra work on part of people who wanted to recruit me to grad school and research. Life's complicated, and I get that it shouldn't be a lecturer's job to negotiate social and psychological issues, but the reality is that as an instructor (or even TA) you are in a position to seriously help some of your students in ways that go beyond the narrow topic of any given course, and it would be a shame to not at least occasionally take advantage of that. Isn't this 'public good' thing a big part of why we're voluntarily missing out on job security and decent income in the first place?\n\n\nStill, even today, if you were to give me a written test on my own damn research, I'd probably get a C on it ;-)",

We have no idea how you teach so obviously we can't give specific suggestions, but you have been coming across as rather unnecessarily condescending. No, you should not give people extra marks for suffering, but accommodations here and there? Why not?  If someone has to deal with more shit than, say, a mentally healthy kid still living at home with a happy family, maybe give them an extension here and there (if asked for in advance). You're not saving academic standards by refusing to budge, and proving nothing in the end. Even when being firm, as one must be at times, always, always, always treat your students with respect and kindness and concern. The moment you openly judge them, you've lost an avenue of communication, you're now in a combative relationship with them and lose an opportunity to teach them something. \n\n\nBtw I think that's why you're getting downvoted, you might have a point (whether or not I agree with it) but you phrase it in a rather condescending way, and we're trying hard to have less of that in academia. It's the same mentality that drives some (all too many) graduate supervisors to abuse their students, because if they were able to tough it out, why shouldn't you endure the same? Ditto for other kinds of abusive relationships in life in general. I'm lucky to have a supervisor who treats us with respect and cares about our well being, and that has only had positive impacts on our productivity, and we do better work than could ever be beaten out of us, so to speak. To a lesser extent, this applies to undergrad teaching as well, IMO. Tl;dr don't be a dick",
