  "text": "Basically I sent someone an answer to an exam thinking the exam was over and he pasted it (I didnt know exams ended at different times)\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot and I realized this is all my fault. I should have read the instructions and thought about the rules more (cant even send answers after the exam). I truly learned from my actions but I am just wondering about the consequences for this \n\nThe fact I commited academic misconduct is on my transcript and will be removed when I graduate. I am just wondering how this will affect my changes to get into a good grad school, even if I get it removed but I eventually have to tell then.\n\nI'm a computer science student and I did many things to improve myself in that aspects such as attending events and making side projects. \n\nI am just wondering what does this mean for the future. I am definitely going to be much more careful next time and read and follow all the rules. Since they said I committed academic misconduct I know all my grades are in question but I truly did earn them legimarely. Is their anyway I can prove myself that this wont happen again and I'm a good student ? What else did I screw up about my life? How can I come back from this",

      "text": "Good for you, OP, for taking accountability for your actions and recognizing your wrongdoing, and more importantly, wanting to do better. \n\nIf you do end up getting this removed from your transcript, then this is *really* great for you. You may have a bit more difficulty applying to grad school when you're still in undergrad applying with your \"marked\" transcript, but (if I understand correctly) once you graduate it will look like it never happened. \n\nHaving this mark on your transcript, as you probably already know, *could* potentially delay your grad school plans because most institutions take academic integrity very seriously. However, even if your transcript still marked, most grad school applications almost always have essays as part of your application where you can your situation...we all make mistakes and it sounds like you've definitely reformed yourself. \n\nHowever, if you *for sure* know there will be no record of misconduct once you graduate, you may want to think about applying to grad school once your record is clear. Then it's a non-issue.\n\nOverall, I think your perspective is very mature and will help you now and in the future. Remember to read those academic misconduct policies at the start of each semester! Good luck. I think this is just a small bump in a bright future ahead.",

Even if they remove it from my transcript, if they ask me if I had academic conduct I have to tell them even if it's not noted. What I did was bad no matter what, but I still feel what the other person did was worth. It might be fine if they dont ask me but if they do how will that affect my chances. Is the fact my story isnt as bad mean anything?",

This might not be a popular view here, but once you're out in these crazy streets, this kind of stuff just doesn't look like real life--that's my view and I think that's the norm. If your academic career had several cases of stealing the work of others outright, then I'd have major concerns; if you'd falsified research I wouldn't even interview you unless you were very interesting and talented. With this, I wouldn't even care about your intent, I'd be more curious about your decision making process. And I'd care much more about some random stuff you said on Twitter seven years ago. Honestly, if you were a prospective employee and I saw this post without you sending it my way, it would definitely be in your favor.",

Obviously if there is truly no record of an IA at that point, you could likely get away with not reporting it, but you would be lying to the school. I had an IA on my record (non-academic, freshman drinking) that was expunged after I graduated, but I still reported it anyways.\n\nTo be honest, I am not sure how I feel about the ethics of schools requiring you to report institutional actions that were expunged. A given institution decided to take an action according to their policies and judgement, and by those same policies and judgement decided to expunge it or forgive it, not sure why only the first should be considered. Interestingly, for felonies and misdemeanors that have been expunged or pardoned, they do not require to report (I am guessing it is illegal to do so?).",

Sharing answers after an exam happens with literally every exam in existence - people want to discuss/talk about what others got. If it happens after the exam is done and you show your friend your solution to a question, it's mind boggingly stupid to call that academic dishonesty. But universities unfortunately also have an academic dishonesty hard on, and the system is quite against students (at my university you either accept it or you get a 0 in the **course**).

Granted, I don\u2019t think OP deserves a 0 in the course because their actions didn\u2019t impact course performance, but OP acknowledges they engaged in academic misconduct. \n\nI\u2019m a grad student, not a professor (does this excuse me from the circle jerk?), and I absolutely discuss answers after an exam. The difference is that it\u2019s never been prohibited. My best guess is that the rule is in place to prevent exactly what happened here given all the complications of online exams and potential for extenuating circumstances extending the exam past when it should officially end. It\u2019s also possible the professor just has a stick up his butt, but even in that case, OP didn\u2019t confirm the recipient had completed their exam. \n\nI really do feel bad for OP because they broke what seemed to them like a stupid rule, but I don\u2019t know what to call sharing exam answers when expressly prohibited other than \u201cacademic dishonesty\u201d or \u201cacademic misconduct\u201d. If this happened after all exams were finished, it would be a purely academic discussion because they wouldn\u2019t have been caught, but calling it mind-bogglingly stupid seems unnecessarily rude. Unfortunately, OPs actions enabled cheating and the consequences of doing something you aren\u2019t supposed to do usually depends on the outcome you caused.",
