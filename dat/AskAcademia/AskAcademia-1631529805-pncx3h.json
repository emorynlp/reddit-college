It\u2019s a nasty illness but frankly the cause isn\u2019t exactly known, just popped up after months of these long hours so doc thinks that was the trigger.

Lasted for about 4 months, I also \u201crecovered\u201d but realized I never did. I\u2019ve had random mild dysautonomia symptoms and general anxiety for these 2 years, prescribed antidepressants to deal. When I overworked myself is when the POTS emerged so it feels like my nervous system was pushed past stability. Unsurprisingly lots of people develop this and other dysautonomia from mono, just like covid. \n\nWish there was more awareness of that.

I don't have any lasting effects, but during the thick of it I got so stressed out that I didn't eat for 13 days. Frequently went days without food. I got so freakishly skinny before I got fat. It definitely screwed up my metabolism but it has recovered a few years after the stress stopped. My fiance and I have worked like this for about a decade now. Every work day is at least 10 hours for me and 14 hours for her. Weekend work is about 4 hours/day... These types of schedules are totally doable. When studying for medical school admissions tests we worked from waking till sleeping for about 6 months before the exam. While it is indeed exhausting, this is just what it takes to succeed at some things. You either want it bad enough or you don't. Plenty of people do actually carry these schedules without lying and without problem. \n\nAnd for reference I am not bragging about working my life away, I am merely pointing out that succeeding in hyper competitive careers does factually require an intensity and sacrifice that most are not willing to deliver.",

Yes, it's stressful to work a ton despite loving what I do, but the results and mission are more meaningful than anything else I could possibly imagine. I don't know many people who work the way we do whom don't feel the same. This is why I said, and will say again, that succeeding in these competitive careers is all about how bad you want it and how much you're willing to sacrifice.

If any of this is not true, I may suggest delaying and taking the test at a later date.\n\nThe plus side is that I also assume that you have studied this material before if you have taken this exam 3 times so you are not starting from scratch.  It is easier to relearn than to learn for the first time.\n\nYou cannot study 12 hours a day, everyday.  There is no way to sustain your attention for that amount of time.  You need to figure out ways to break things up into manageable chunks and to focus on studying for the exam.  You have practice taking the exam so you know what kind of questions they ask.  There is no reason to re-read every textbook again.  You need to focus on only the material for the exam.  \n\nPurchase study guides, hire a tutor, and/or attend a prep course.  Take practice exams and lots of them often.  Develop the pile of things you have down and things you still need to work on.  Put less effort into the things you know.  Do you have a breakdown from your previous exams so you know what areas you did well on vs those you did not.  This will help you focus your study efforts also.",

Only drink water and make sure your electrolytes are balanced. Copious amounts of coffee, tea or soda will cause dehydration due to your body getting rid of the caffeine. You must be well hydrated for the brain to do it\u2019s best work. Make flash cards of those \u201crules, methods,\u201d or anything else you struggle with. Look at those cards when you are taking a exercise break. The exercise break allows the body to cycle the blood through every part of the body and the oxygen from walking will help keep the body awake and able to focus. Any type of medicine to \u201cjack\u201d you up into hyper study mode will be a detriment to your ability to study longer. I tell my students to go into a test without a rush of caffeine, sugar or anything else so they can think methodically and not all jumpy and shaky. When the caffeine and sugar/Med rush ends about midway through your test the brain will be exhausted. Water and at least 8 hours of rest will be best for those 3+hour tests. I recommend taking a snack with protein and something sweet for the break in a longer test.  Plus a bottle of water. If you are someone who has test anxiety, one or two Tylenol\u2019s will help reduce that. My daughter had to take a mild blood pressure tablet so she could stay calm and focus on her nursing tests.  There are methods to looking at the questions and seeing the wrong two answers, the almost correct two answers and seeing the one correct answer.  I teach ACT prep courses for science.",

      "text": "I studied for 8 hours a day for two months for a professional exam. I ended up renting a small but very quiet office space. I was fairly broke at the time, so the expense wasn\u2019t easy, and it motivated me to actually get what I paid for.\n\nI got ear plugs and was amazed at how much easier it was to study in silence.\n\nBy the end of my schooling I also needed a book stand. It keeps books or your notes at an angle so you don\u2019t have to look straight down. If you have neck or headache issues, I can\u2019t stress this enough! The book stand was key.\n\nI also made audio recordings of the study material I was having the toughest time memorizing and I listened to these recordings over and over again while I worked out. That way I was actually getting exercise, which was important for study retention, and the material REALLY seemed to stick for me.\n\nAnd get good quality sleep. Good sleep is essential for good memory.\n\nGood luck!",

So I'll offer my best studying practice instead.\n\nWrite questions that allow you to revise the content you have to study on little cards (one question per card) and the answers on the back. You can have 20, 50, 100 cards, it doesn't matter.\n\nWhen you go to the toilet, take the cards with you. When you're in public transportation, take the cards with you. When you want to study for 3-4 hours, use the cards. When you're bored, use the cards instead of social media. When you're done eating, use the cards. When you're watching Netflix, again use the cards. Apart from the specific periods you allocate yourself to study, you have to make it so the cards become a part of your everyday life. At some point you'll be able to refine your card pack to focus on your weaknesses.\n\nNot only do the cards help you revise the content you have to study, making them is also helpful. What's good is you can also ask someone to help you study with these and if they're in your class you can help them too, which will also allow you to learn the content. This method has never failed me. In fact I always felt at my best doing this.",
