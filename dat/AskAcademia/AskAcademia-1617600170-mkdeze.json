  "text": "I've been at a crossroads with academia for more than a year now. I'm a post doc right now (courting industry jobs because my current environment has been toxic for my mental health). I love my topic, I love the IDEA of what academia could be for me, but I've seen very little of it materialize for me (I'm also tired of a post doc that looks good on paper but in practice has been unsupportive, and often hostile). I think I'm at a point where I'm tired of the weird facade academia makes everyone put on like they're at peak productivity and continuously improving (when my experience has been that a lot of it is hand waving).\n\nTonight I was thinking about all the things I have to tackle this coming week and I wondered... Is this it forever if I choose to stay? Presentations/teaching, re-hauling analyses / manuscripts, meetings that go no where or at least feel that way, and all the other things that come with academia. Honestly writing it out doesn't make it seem so bad, but then there's the conflict of all the projects and things feel like they are ALL urgent or a priority, juggling deadlines, and unexpected things that come up, PLUS trying to have a life outside of work.\n\nHow do you (honestly) deal with it all? I don't even have courses to teach besides occasional guest lectures and I constantly feel like I'm drowning with just my research commitments. I try not to compare my progress/pace with others but some days it's hard not to. But right now I actually do want to know how others manage to handle all these things successfully.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a postdoc too, and I think the first thing to recognize is there are things you *have* to do and many, many optional ones. Like, my job right now is to crank out papers. Second to that I will only accept jobs I legit *want* to do, like take on a summer student or outreach or a search committee. I\u2019m not afraid to say no when it\u2019s not a job I actually want to do. \n\nSecond, a supportive supervisor who recognizes the above and won\u2019t pile on random things that won\u2019t help you with the primary goal makes all the difference. I\u2019m sorry to hear you don\u2019t have that, that can be overwhelming. :(\n\nThird, people don\u2019t want to say this too loud, but a supportive life partner makes all the difference. My academic life became *way* easier once we met and moved in together because my husband doesn\u2019t mind running laundry while he works from home, is really handy when things need fixing, and can cook dinner on nights when I need to work a little extra. Sure I will fold the laundry, make up by cooking the next night, etc, but the fact of the matter is I\u2019ve outsourced a lot of non work related tasks to someone who doesn\u2019t mind them, and that frees up so much mentally!\n\nI 100% acknowledge that this last point is not fair and our fields should not be set up so one supportive partner is so important to do your job. But I\u2019d be lying if I said that wasn\u2019t a healthy chunk of my postdoc productivity right there.",

                  "text": "Thank you. I think the key is to figure out how to work efficiently. When I went into grad school I did not do that. My experience in industry has taught me how to use time well. There are difficult deadlines and a million things to do in not enough time here as well. But everyone works 8-5, we figure it out. I work in public health, often under a lot of public scrutiny, so deadlines and requirements aren\u2019t flexible. I will occasionally put in extra hours if needed. But I think this is a valuable lesson I will take forward. \nOne of the most productive postdocs in my previous lab worked fixed 9-5 hours, no weekends. Had childcare duties as a single father. He published more papers than the other postdocs, had cool collaborations and his research was excellent and creative. Luckily I was mentored by him when I rotated in the lab and had a great experience. I think he moved to industry eventually but it just goes to show that it\u2019s possible to do good work in academia without the 100 hour work week. I don\u2019t work well when exhausted either. In fact I would make more mistakes I need to fix later. \nI\u2019m looking forward to getting back to working in a good lab and program.\nAlso, this expectation of having no life outside of research seems to be a more US centric thing. My friends in Europe tell me they\u2019re expected to work like it\u2019s a 9-5 job and have good work-life balance.",

You might mainly need to learn how to prioritize - say no to work that has too high a cost-benefit ratio for you.\n\nBut - I'm putting this a bit harshly to make the point, but I really think people can ruin their lives by being naive about it - the former issues remains and might be a root cause of the symptoms. Are you a peasant thinking you can catch up to royalty by ploughing your patch of land hard enough?\n\nIn any case you'll need to have a real strategy if you stay in academia - same is true anywhere to some extent, but I think academics might be especially susceptible to thinking the \"work hard, be smart, get rewarded\" pattern from education will just continue.

                      "text": "I'm going to offer an alternative albeit optimistic take. Certainly, privilege helps. Getting through grad school is tough - there's stress, the pay is low, and the work is hard, and privilege will help if only just with the rent and takeout food. However, there's far more to it than that.\n\nFirst, you want your eye on a good research topic and a good advisor. Be careful - good doesn't just mean famous. This subreddit is full of horror stories of famous PI's who abuse their students, steal their work, or just generally refuse to support them. I've seen it happen, too... and sometimes it's not simply deliberate manipulation, but just a terrible personality mismatch. Picking the right research group matters, and not just for your career but for your success and your sanity. A supportive advisor who wants you to move on up can save you if you hit a rough patch, or at the very least help you get jobs when you graduate if you might otherwise have had difficulty. Step one is checking where your prospective advisor's students have landed, then quietly checking if there are horror stories about them or the department. If they're good and you have lab experience and smarts, they should be happy to have you.\n\nSecond, make sure you enjoy your field and stay involved. Show up for student visit day and make friends with other grads, postdocs, or professors. Go to colloquia and ask questions sometimes. Go to department events or parties. There will be people who read this and think, \"Pshhh, why should I?\" But if you don't want to see talks about your subject or teach students, why would you want to be in academia to begin with? It's bizarre to me how many are in it for the prestige or \"because it's the next step\" when they don't even care. A coworker of mine often said he \"wasn't a slave\" and ditched most of that stuff, along with teaching, and he still graduated, but then he had no plan for after graduation because he didn't really like teaching or research. I know it sounds a bit snobby and I don't mean to - sometimes colloquia really are just a snoozefest, or sometimes you really need a day off (take it!). That said, you should love your research and your work if you want to put this much time and effort into it.  \n\nThird and final - try to improve your institution as you move from one position to the next. Your undergrad school? Doesn't matter that much. Obviously an MIT degree will go miles, but it takes privilege (money, good guidance early on, test scores, supportive parents) to get there. You can go to a fine mid-sized state school, do a little research, and be in a fine position for grad school. Now, apply to a bunch of good grad schools, with a variety of rankings. If you finish grad school and have a supportive advisor, look for jobs connected to good projects or good schools or good, helpful PI's. It sounds like a lot, and it is, but you can do it.\n\nAnd sure, none of this guarantees a professorship, but is that really the end-all be-all? I'm honestly just glad to get to help with cool research for a while.",

Actually the opposite is closer to the truth -- the people who succeed in academic jobs and have happy balanced lives tend to be the ones who place the hardest boundaries around what they will and will not do. \n\nI say this as a person who's been in all kinds of academic situations (adjunct faculty, TT track, and tenured twice) for about 30 years now as well as a former department chair. Especially in the latter role, definitely the faculty I've had to evaluate who have the greatest number of issues are the ones who come into their work without a clear system for deciding what to say \"yes\" to and what to say \"no\" to, and end up overcommitted and constantly working.",

This isn't to say that grants from my current lab aren't well written or good ideas, but having seen both sides of the career trajectory it makes me sad that funding really seems like a crapshoot but simultaneously is biased towards those who already have funding.\n\nThere's also the issue of how time consuming they are and the increasing expectation to apply continuously (for multiple projects/proposals and at multiple times each year).\n\nWould you mind speaking about what it is that you like about industry?",

But as a post doc in my current lab the expectation is way too high/unrealistic. It ends up meaning that tasks that shouldn't normally take so long end up being huge time sucks because of the dynamic of the lab and the PI (who has unrealistic standards for unexpectedly specific/ random things).",

While people usually think of academia as very poetic and beautiful IRL people have to cut corners sometimes to keep on track with all the work , I\u2019m not in your situation currently so I don\u2019t really have enough knowledge to help you there , sorry . Best of luck !",

      "text": "Hey! I may not be positioned to give you advice as some others here are, as I\u2019m no longer in academia (I left as soon as I finished my PhD.) I\u2019m a post-doc in industry. I just want to let you know you\u2019re not alone, and what you wrote gave me some painful flashbacks to grad school. I too worked in a toxic environment, and it took a serious toll on my mental health and even my work ethic. I\u2019m almost 3 years removed now and looking back, even the first month after graduating, I was profoundly happier. Perhaps you will have a new perspective when you leave the toxic environment you are in\u2014whether that\u2019s in academia or otherwise. I guess what I\u2019m saying is, seek out help for your mental health if you can, or if you think it would help. It can really skew a person\u2019s perception. It\u2019s so tough to make important career and life decisions when you\u2019re wading through toxic interactions day in and out. You have my sympathies. Best of luck!",

      "text": "I think a lot of this boils down to the fact that the 'natural' progression for an academic achiever is to move to obtaining a PhD and ending up in academia. However, academia is a vastly different experience from being a student. It seems natural to get a PhD and think \"well, I guess this is my next step. I like research so why not\". Hence, the field is saturated. I think many students would do well to think more carefully about whether or not they are a match for becoming a \"researcher\". Most of academia boils down to (1) how well you can write, (2) how well you can obtain funding, (3) how organized you are, (4) how stress- and toxicity-resilient you are and (5) luck. In my experience, relatively little of it has to do with developing ideas. In fact, those ideas are often just excuses to obtain funding to be able to churn out more papers.",
