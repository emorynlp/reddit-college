  "text": "So, title pretty much says it all. I'm in a cell/molecular bio PhD and my program has people submit a written proposal + oral defense. I just finished the oral part and basically my committee said I'm almost there but they want me to re-write one of my aims because it's not quite fleshed out enough. They were really nice about it too, and I feel like they were just babying me because they think I'm too dumb to handle really harsh criticism. \n\n\nMy program has a reputation for passing everyone, so I feel really embarrassed, and don't want to talk to any of my peers about it. Also my advisor is pretty new, and I'm one of her first students, so this probably looks bad on her. She's been unhappy with my progress in the lab thus far anyway. \n\nI know this probably isn't as big of a deal as I'm making it out to be, but I just feel absolutely worthless and like I should drop out, and like everyone is judging me for being incompetent.\n\nAnyone else want to commiserate, or offer some success stories after going through something similar?",

      "text": "I can't speak for your program's reputation (though for the record, I would be surprised if a program had a reputation for *not* having most people pass their prelim as it is not supposed to be a difficult step). However, what you are describing sounds like a completely normal response to a prelim proposal + defense from a committee - at least in my necessarily limited experience as only one human who has been at only a few institutions and departments.\n\nThe expectation going into a prelim is not that you have everything perfect - you're still a student, so no one expects perfection (except yourself, as usual). It is pretty typical for the committee to give some critical feedback with the aim of helping the candidate adjust their research plan before actually setting out on the last major stretch of work for the PhD - the idea of this criticism is not to assess whether the candidate deserves a PhD (that's coming later), but to help the candidate make sure their research plan is on track and accounts for everything that is needed.\n\nWhen I did my prelim, part of the feedback I got was actually quite similar. The committee was impressed with my background/motivation and work leading up to the proposal, but in my proposal I essentially aimed for one big goal and the committee told me that I should look at smaller goals along the way so that the \"success\" of the work was not contingent on whether or not I could prove a single hypothesis. I still passed, but taking their comments into account led to a series of smaller validation studies and a few sections to fill out my eventual dissertation chapters.\n\nThis is the attitude you want to take towards committee feedback. Do not think of it as an assessment, think of it as ways to improve your proposed research and try to take action accordingly. This is true not just for your prelim but as a general principle for a research career - always treat criticism as a way to improve, and not as a statement of your personal value as a scientist, and you will generally find better success.\n\nAnd... Congratulations on passing your prelim! It's an important step in your career and worth celebrating even if you feel like you made many mistakes along the way. Mistakes will always happen, but cause to celebrate is harder to come by and should always be treasured!  :-)",

It was embarrassing and my peers that took it at the same time or right after me passed so I did feel inadequate for sure. I let myself feel down for a couple of weeks. I put a lot of work to get to that point and it was hard to hear I wasn\u2019t where they wanted. Then I met with my supervisor and she told me to stay on track, and I dusted myself off and refocused. I passed the follow up oral exam without problems and I graduated one semester later than I had hoped. But now I have a PhD and no one knows the difference. In the end, I succeeded.\n\nLet yourself feel the feelings now, but keep your eyes on the prize and keep moving forward. Best of luck!",

They didn't pass you because they felt sorry for you, they passed you because your work was sufficiently well done that it was worthy of a pass. \n\nI actually think it's a pretty poor return to someone who  invested time and energy in providing you with thoughtful and constructive feedback for you to turn around decide they meant something else and then quit before there's any possibility you might fail. \n\nIt's fine to throw yourself a pity party sometimes, we all need them, but don't be the person that fails because they were too scared to succeed and spent their life setting themselves up to fail and sucking the energy out everyone around them by their need for constant reassurance and hand holding. Your examiners just handed you a roadmap to success, don't be an idiot and throw that away.",

      "text": "This isn't a big deal and your advisor has a good share of the blame here and the rest of your committee to a lesser extent. If I'm understanding their criticisms correctly, it sounds like something that should be caught on paper before you get to the defense. Ideally your committee members are all reading and giving feedback on your written proposal before agreeing that you are ready to defend.\n\nHere's a story that will make you feel better: My department requires an \"outside reader\" attend the proposal defense. It's has to be a full professor from the department who is off-committee and not involved in administration of the program. Their role theoretically is to safeguard the department's reputation from committees that are babying unqualified students and usually their presence is somewhere between a formality and a helpful extra set of eyes. Well, the highest achieving person in our cohort, who was also the first to defend, got an outside reader who *forced her to add an entire new aim before letting her pass* and her chair and committee members caved because the outside reader is so revered in the department/the field. Our program director and her committee chair both called my friend mortified after the defense ended, and our department chair called her later today to apologize on behalf of the department that they let that happen to my friend. It's going to add probably an extra semester to her graduation timeline and her funding package isn't extendable, so now the chair is going to use money from her personal research funds to fund this student so she can do the extra aim.",
