  "text": "While this may seem like a cringingly naive question to ask this, however, the consequences of colleges that continue to unquestioningly to give hair-pulling exams aren't. It becomes more costly to the school and to the student to retake a class and postpone their graduation date, and extensive grading of these exams take away research time from professors and graduate students trying to get their foot in the door, and not to mention that even the most well-motivated students can succumb to life-tragedies in their semsters that cause them to bomb the exam entirely, thereby repeating the first sentence.",

When paired with other forms of assessment and designed well, they offer a way to gauge student performance in one of the environments best suited to mitigate cheating.\n\nFor that reason, they are unlikely to ever go away.",

Assuming the alternative is something like \"a midterm, finals, and a paper\" or \"two midterms and a final\" so one exam doesn't determine your grade and you get some level of pre-exam feedback.",

They still can't guarantee high quality lectures but they go a good way towards it.

Givens for us are the length of the course, minimum class lengths, minimum contact hours, senate passed learning outcomes, and requirements to submit a syllabus.  If the syllabus is substantively changed during the semester, we don't need approval, but we must be redistributed to students.  There are a  few other course management issues we must adhere to such as when midterm grades are due, etc.   Beyond these givens, we have academic freedom and our union is very strong about supporting it. So while we must teach to learner outcomes, how we do this to support students in their progress toward reaching them is entirely up to us.  We get to determine how many papers, tests, what sorts of assessment activities, when, what weighting and so forth.  I actually think that for good professors this supports best practices of teaching and learning, for example, it allows a professor do develop the course around inquiry based learning in which a number of predetermined summative tests wouldn't make much sense.   The only consistency we must adhere to across sections is that we're teaching to students meeting learner outcomes.  Sure students complain that their friend in another section is doing something different or doing it on a different schedule, but if we have faith in the instructor and in the power and quality of university agreed upon learner outcomes, then in my view the difference is fine. Students in any section still reach the same outcomes and are ready to progress.  I find it adds a bit of extra confusion for new part time faculty who often want the 'rules.'  But we're all here to assist, if asked.   BTW, we also have a rule that no single assessment activity can be worth more than 50% of a student's grade.",

But until then, I feel a need to assess my students' memorization of basic facts and concepts so that I can rush through them later (same applies even more so in the more math-heavy stem fields).

They're effectively doing paint-by-numbers math. When they get to a test, I get some stuff that I can see they kinda sorta learned something but it's so error-riddled that it's not useful. Online tests with multiple attempts do help them some. \n\nI see other people where it's done faster than I could do it and perfectly and I know they plugged it into Mathway. When they get to a test, I get nothing but jibberish. Online tests do fuck-all because they cheat themselves on those too. \n\nFrom what you're saying, it sounds like you are more likely to be in the first group than the second. If you're using multiple-attempt HW, you really need to go BACK through and make sure that you actually understand the concept and not just \"how to get the answer\" later. This is a good guideline for any HW but especially ones where you try each problem again and again. \n\nThe other issue with not having proctored testing, as others have pointed out, is that it's perfectly possible to have someone else complete the course.

That's not a good system in math because there are lots of places where you can make a very small, insignificant mistake and end up with the wrong answer while having all the right approach. Someone marking that complete working can see the minor mistake and dock maybe one point for it while awarding full marks to the rest. An online system only registers **WRONG** and gives a zero, or seriously reduces the maximum credit available for future attempts, while also failing to see where the student has gone wrong because it doesn't have access to their working out. \n\nWe also need to mark their working out as its own thing to see that they're using solid logic and setting out their work in a way that others could follow. Math is just as much about laying out an argument as it is about the answers. Online homework doesn't let them practice this.\n\nThere are times when my students got nearly all incorrect answers and got A's.

There is no additional training available. You're lucky if your department runs its own training sessions.

Consider Bloom's taxonomy; it's easy to design a test that measures \"knowledge\" but harder to do so for skills at the top of the pyramid (analysis, synthesis, creativity). There are much better alternatives in many cases. I'm a historian primarily, though I teach a lot of interdisciplinary courses and sometimes team-teach with social scientists and/or natural scientists. We never give exams because we're much more interested in those higher-level cognitive tasks...easier to assess them via projects, papers, and other means.\n\nMore importantly, perhaps, is the simple fact that high stakes, time limited exams absolutely privilege neurotypical students no matter what the field. Far too many students suffer from testing anxiety, or are simply unable to read/process at the same speeds as their peers, or face other challenges for me to accept the idea that putting everyone in a room for an hour is the best way to assess their learning. So I don't do it.\n\nBut many of my colleagues in STEM fields in particular insist that testing is critical to forcing students to memorize critical material at the base of the Bloom pyramid. I accept their judgement on that-- obviously if you can't multiply it will be hard to do calculus. Perhaps the testing on such lower-order skills doesn't need to be high stakes though. Surely there are other settings/topics where testing makes sense, as pedagogies reasonably range quite broadly across disciplines. But too many teachers at every level, IMO, simply cling to testing because that's how it's always been done.",

Often, these are cumulative. If I'm going to teach about the evolution of human bipedalism in Unit 2, then my students need to know what a femur and a pelvis are at the end of Unit 1.

But if you want to have informed conversations about *actually* interesting topics, you need to give students a baseline.\n\n> Your job as a teacher is to motivate the unmotivated\n\nIn high school, yes, absolutely.

But grading homework is pretty much unheard of in most countries outside the US.\n\nEven more insane to me is European and other countries that have an exam determining whether you will go to a high school that puts you on university track in middle school.",

It was faster to just guess answers and keep retaking until you got it all right than it was to actually do the work.\n\nOther classes would have facebook groups that just post the answers to the homework/online \"quiz\".\n\nThey do not in any way substitute for a real test.",
