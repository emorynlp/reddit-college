  "title:": "Opportunities after completing physics PhD in your 40s",
  "text": "I think I've read nearly every post about starting towards a PhD later in life, but haven't found my particular questions answered.\n\n**My questions are**:\n\n- What paths are possible to move from a lower ranked school in undergrad to a higher ranked school for a grad program?\n\n- If you finish a PhD in your mid-40s, can you expect to be able to work with interesting research organizations, such as NASA, Fermilab, US Antarctic Program, CERN, JAXA, etc? Especially if you complete your PhD in a non-Top-20 university?\n\n\n**Context (to get a jump on the most common questions asked of OP I see in these types of threads)**:\n\n- I'm 33, planning to go back to undergrad in about 2 years to finish a BS in physics & math (I'll likely take the full 4 years, just to be thorough) and, ideally, move on to a PhD with a goal of working in public research.\n- US citizen living in California (but with residency in New York), but have lived abroad long term and happy (eager is more like it, tbh) to do it again.\n- My wife and I have no children, and will never have children.\n- My wife and I are comfortable with the lifestyle we can expect with me as a 40-something student.\n- The tedium/politics/long-hours/etc of academics doesn't faze me.\n- My current career is virtually non-existent, and has no relation to STEM.\n- I have no interest in using my current skills to go into a field tangential to research, like science journalism, science policy, etc\n- I've checked my math skills and they're the same as always\u2014definitely above average, but not brilliant (and I've worked out a 2 year plan to improve these skills).\n- As for where I'm likely to get accepted for my undergrad, I don't expect to be able to go to a Top-20. Maybe a Top-50?\n\nYes, I have the deep passion to pursue this, but I also don't want to end up >$150k in debt only to discover at the end of things that I won't be able to actually go beyond the degree in a way that's meaningful to me. That said, I have no illusions about working on the next world-changing thing. I just want to at least be some cog in the public science machine.",

      "text": "If you work hard and develop expertise, people will want to work with you, regardless of your age. The path to research is a long one and requires luck. For Fermilab, I have seen people do two to three post docs (2-3 years each) before getting a scientist position. If you want to work at a national lab, do your PhD work at a national lab. Then try to do a postdoc there. You will get to know people, and if you impress them, this will help immensely when trying for jobs. \n\nA few other things:\n\nYou should have a research experience under your belt before applying to grad school. If you go to a large undergraduate institution, try to find a professor to work with over the summer. If not, then apply for NSF REU summer programs. Both of these should pay, not much, but some.\n\nYou should not pay for a physics PhD program. The students in most physics PhD programs are paid a small, but livable stipend. You will be expected to TA for the first couple years. Once you find a group to work in, they will typically pay for your remaining years. Caveat - I\u2019m talking about experimental physics. My theory friends had to TA all through grad school. If the school asks you to straight up pay for your PhD, you don\u2019t want to go there.\n\nYou need thee strong recommendations to apply for grad school. As you finish your undergraduate degree, get to know three profs well (go to office hours, do research with them, read their papers and talk to them about it). \n\nYou should also plan to do well on the general and physics GREs. These tests do not predict your ability to be a good physicist - they just measure how well you take those kinds of test and how much of the testing content you know. You have to practice to get good at anything - including these tests.\n\nThat\u2019s is all I can think of now. Good luck!",

I know some undergrads are good at getting chummy with profs, but I never quite understood how that happens. Particularly early in your degree, when you don't know nearly enough to carry on a meaningful conversation, or offer much of value.\n\n> You need thee strong recommendations to apply for grad school.

Nerve wracking.\n\nI'll need to do something about my test anxiety. Hell, even practice exams shoot my heart rate through the roof. It might sound incredibly stupid, but the unresolved test anxiety is probably the largest contributing factor to why I never finished my physics degree in the first place.\n\n> That\u2019s is all I can think of now.

              "text": "Yea, I made working with a professor sound easy, and it is not. I think there are two good paths to this. The first and best is approach a professor for one of your courses who you like, and do well in the course. You should read their research website, which will give an overview of what types of research they do. Hopefully you find it interesting. Research it more and try to come up with questions about it. They do not have to be revolutionary questions. Professors love talking about their work - they dedicated their lives to their work. At the undergrad level, you will not be expected to understand it, but showing curiosity goes a long way. Go to office hours and ask about it. Also tell them your career plans and ask for advice about participating in undergrad research. \n\nAlternatively look through all faculty research pages at your undergrad institution and find the one that most interests you. Read about it and come up with some questions and go talk to the professor during office hours. Again, talk to them about your career ambitions and ask for their advice. Tell them you want participate in a research project and ask what you should do to make that happen. I once had a prof say to me (while I was in grad school) when a grad student comes in to ask about my research. I think - that student is smart. They are interested in the same things I am, and I am smart. :) I\u2019m not saying feign interest, but you can exaggerate interest. \n\nI should add that some profs are assholes. If you run into one of these, just keep moving on to the next person. I once went to a profs office hours to ask him a question about the class lecture. He first asked if I was interested in theory. When I said no, he just turned his chair back to his computer and ignored me until I left. I decided that was his shortcoming not mine and moved on.\n\nYes, test anxiety is a monster, but practice will decrease it. Honestly, after I walked out of the physics GRE I cried for about an hour before I could drive to leave the testing center. And I should have cried because I bombed it. Things worked out anyway. Just try to get as many things going for you as possible, and it is ok if everything doesn\u2019t work out perfectly. The general GRE is a different story. You should practice until you consistently get perfect in the quantitative (or analytical) part. Practice taking tests in a classroom with the same time constraints, and it will get easier each time. Then just do your best. \n\nGood luck and feel free to dm me questions, if you would like.",

      "text": "Ageism does exist, but honestly several of the postdocs in my lab (or labs, as I was co-advised) in grad school were in their late 30's-40's and two of them did ultimately manage to land research professorships. To be clear, they also also got their PhDs later in life- they weren't postdocing for 10+ years.\n\nTo be honest none of the things you're really worried about are the real barriers you'll face. School ranking isn't all that important at either level (it isn't nothing, but people aren't as hung up on it as you seem to think)- be more concerned about your advisor and publication record.\n\nThe real problems you face is mostly just that getting *any* research position these days is incredibly competitive, regardless of age, and you might have to postdoc for a while after completing a PhD to get where you're hoping to go. While school name doesn't really mean that much, who you've worked with does, but all of that is less important than your publication record. You might be able to directly land a postdoc at one of the places you've mentioned directly out of grad school, but it's extremely competitive.\n\nThough I do have some good news- if you are committed to this there is absolutely no logical reason you would end up >$150k in debt. You're a California resident and your in state public schools are great. Just go to one of them for undergrad (CSU's are fine, UC's admittedly would be preferable but it's not make-or-break). If you get into a physics PhD program they'll pay you to attend, not the other way around. It won't pay *well*, but you will be paid. Unfunded STEM PhDs don't really happen much in the US and if you an offer for one I'd assume it's a scam or an insult.",

              "text": ">Any thoughts on that? NY vs CA?\n\nAs I said, it really doesn't matter that much. If you want to do a PhD, just find a school that has plenty of research activity. R1 would be would probably make that easier, but some PUIs (primarily undergraduate institutions) have decent research activity that by the nature of the school is much easier for undergraduates to take ownership of.\n\n>My record is far from amazing. I graduated with a B.A. in English in 2010. Overall GPA 3.44, major GPA 3.82.\n\nObviously your English major grades don't mean much towards your physics education, but that's:\n\n1) Your GPA from a first bachelor's (presumably years ago)\n2) Not that bad anyway\n\nSo really, I only think it would matter for undergraduate admissions (maybe? I actually have no idea how admissions work a second Bachelor's).  And for graduate admissions after a second undergraduate degree, no one will care.\n\nThough I would point out if those were your grades in a physics BS at a decent school, you'd still be able to get into plenty of doctoral programs with decent letters of rec and especially with research. \n\n>Well, hey, if CalTech wants to insult me they can go for it. I'll call their bluff, haha\n\nAllow me to rephrase: you will not get an offer without support from any place you want to go. It's not that Caltech doesn't have the money to allow more students in. Spots in the program are based on how many students professors are willing to take on (PhDs are much more master and apprentice than normal schooling). If you don't get accepted into a group they'll kick you out regardless of how much debt you're willing to take on. \n\n>How does one begin the process of picking an advisor? I know the need to think about that seriously is a long way out for me, but I'm interested to have a general idea of how you find out who the \"good\" advisors are (at least good to have on your CV).\n\nI'd wait to worry about this until you're actually in your degree program and have a better idea what your interests are. Physics undergraduates are (in)famous for thinking they're going to go do research in the sexiest areas that get lots of news coverage. Physics as a field is much, much more than high energy and astrophysics.\n\nTo actually answer the question though: you should be picking a graduate school based on the professors there and what research they do. This is what everyone here means when we say that the school doesn't matter as much as the group. You can go to the physics department website of whatever schools you're interested in for graduate studies and find blurbs about the research that professors (or really, their groups) do. Apply to graduate schools based on the professors doing research you're interested in and their publication activity (How often do they publish? What is the impact factor of the journals they publish in? What is their H-index?). Then if you get into the program (and you had better write about who you're interested in working with and why in your admissions statement of purpose), you can meet with them when you do your visit before signing on and confirm those people are actually willing to/have the money to take students^1. Or maybe even meet someone you didn't notice before- they'll usually arrange for you to talk to people based on your stated interests.\n\n\n^1 Funding is really at the group level. Your stipend has to come either from department funds (usually the case if you TA) or grant money paying you as a researcher. You're doing research in both cases, but more grant money means less time TAing and more time researching. Good PIs generally won't take on students they can't afford. I mean, shit happens, but taking on students with the knowledge they'll be TAing the entire time is generally bad form and reduces their research productivity anyway.",

It's a factor.

It won't do (1) because of the opportunity cost of spending so long as a student and (2) is so unlikely that it's unwise to plan on.\n\nTo OP, would you feel you wasted your time if you got a PhD and then never got the kind of job you mention in your post? If so, don't do it, because realistically you probably won't. (Not because of anything about you but because that's how it works.)\n\nThe fact that you say you'd be unhappy in a non research career gives me a bad feeling about getting a PhD, at any age.",

It may guide your future grad school decisions.\n\n> The tedium/politics/long-hours/etc of academics doesn't faze me.\n\nOh, it will. Trust us. And in your 40's the ageism will start to creep in.

It never ends. Oh well.\n\n> Red flag. A physics PhD will require stellar math\n\nI need to put in some serious work, for sure. However, I definitely don't feel like I'm at the top of my game. I definitely feel like I have room to improve.  And seeing exactly how much I improve over the next 2 years will heavily dictate if I follow through with going back to UG. For sure, if my math doesn't improve I'll just scrap my plans.\n\n> Don't underestimate yourself. Apply to where you really want to go.\n\nI mean, for UG I really have nothing to offer. I know that sounds negative, but I'm just being honest. I have a 3.44 GPA from my previous BA; a 3.82 if you just look at the major.  And my life since I graduated (in 2010) is hardly anything admissions would find interesting. I've been very privileged to be able to live life on my own terms for the last decade, but that hasn't left me with a lot to show for it.\n\n> Don't go to graduate school in the US unless someone else pays for it. Seriously, you should get a stipend and tuition paid\n\nThe $150k in debt is what I'm estimating from the UG debt I'll accrue. I know that the PhD should be funded.\n\n> You need to figure out what's meaningful to you, and work towards that. Without that end goal, academia at any level becomes a slog. At the PhD level, you'll drop out unless you have sight of the end game.\n\nThank you. Great advice.\n\n> You can do this without a PhD.

Being listed as a co-author (or not at all) when you did most of the work. Reviewer #2 being an ignorant di*khead. Overbearing advisors, endless post-docs for little pay, and the relentless, soul-crushing search for more funding.\n\nI'm lucky that I avoided a lot of that. Even so, I lost so much faith in the contemporary scientific *process* within academia that I returned to the commercial sector. <Insert sad face here>\n\nScience is wonderful! The social structures we've built around it, however, can be distressing.

You'll have a better study/work to life balance than in the US.

This means you get the associated benefits, and you'll be seen as a colleague rather than a student, which may suit you better at this stage of your life.

I will start my (biology) master's in Scandinavia soon, and am finishing up my undergraduate in the Netherlands with a semester of experience in Australia. I get my knowledge from friends and family with European PhD experience, and from my own research as I'm considering where in Europe I want to get a PhD and how to get there) \n\nI can't help you for Asia, but here is what I know about (Continental) Europe, sorry for the length and any errors, this was typed in a hurry.\n\nThere are large differences between countries, but for European UG:   \nUG programs in most European countries are already focused on one subject, so that's differerent than in the US. Also, almost everyone pursues a master's degree and you need one before you do a PhD. Most research masters are selective (get decent grades in UG), and last two years. This means you need 5 years of prep for a PhD. PhDs usually last about 4 years in the Netherlands and most EU countries, but it depends.  \nLook for programs in English. The Netherlands has many, but I'm sure other countries have some too. It's great if you can learn the language of the country you're going to in advance, but I personally think it will be easier if you can study in your native language and use your new language skills to try and order a beer and chat casually with your fellow students and professors. Programs in English also attract local students with English skills and an international outlook, who may be more open to you. In the Netherlands, you can also look at University Colleges which are international Liberal Arts and Sciences programs for \"ambitious\" students, run by our regular universities.  \nIf you don't find an English program, at least in the Netherlands, a lot of assignments and material will be in English anyway, but lectures are usually in Dutch at the beginning of UG. For countries where students, lecturers and people in daily life have English skills: consider the Netherlands or Scandinavia and check this list: [https://www.ef.edu/epi/](https://www.ef.edu/epi/). Be aware that English skills does not always translate to English focused universities. Apart from the ones I've mentioned, most European countries (also Germany/Austria/Switzerland, especially France) are much more focused on their own language, and you'll need very good language skills to pursue a UG in those countries/languages and have some/any social interaction with locals.\n\nFor picking universities/programs:   \nWhile I agree rankings are flawed (maybe extra for European unis), you can use them to get a rough idea of the academic landscape in maths/physics in Europe, if you are starting from scratch. Anything that ranks top 100/top 200 would be a perfectly fine choice for UG, I personally think. It depends on who you ask, but I think it matters more how well you do in your UG program, and which research master's at which uni you get, than from which decent European uni you get your UG. At least in the Netherlands, it doesn't matter much for your chances later on where you get your bachelor (UG). And if you have not extremely excellent background, those UG programs will be more accessible/realistic options too. Once you have refined your search for countries/programs slightly, attend online open days and contact programs/current students to get all the details and find out which program would work best for you.",

(Sorry if you mentioned it and I missed that detail)\n\n- If I were considering Scandinavia as a whole I'd probably aim for Norway. Always had a bit of an affinity for the country, and I've learned some of the language. Do you have any thoughts regarding them? Is it a poor choice? Good?\n\n- While the language requirement would require some intense dedication to study over the next 2 years, it seems doable, and I also am under the impression that, for example, a school in France would have better connections to CERN, making it easier to find work there at some point. Or, for example, a similar situation with Germany and the Max Planck institutions?  Are my impressions wrong? I admit I'm really unfamiliar at the moment with how academics work in Europe, but I'm very willing to learn.\n\n- When looking for rankings, what's the best place to look? I know the websites for US schools, but haven't looked into european school rankings.\n\n- Also, you say Top-100\u2014do you mean Top 100 in Europe, or in a specific country? (I'm assuming Continental Europe)\n\n- What does the post-PhD career-track look like for an American in Europe who did their whole degree track (UG>MS>PhD) in Europe?",

                      "text": "No problem, it helps me avoid an essay I should start writing...\n\n* I'm from the Netherlands and have Dutch citizenship :)\n* I personally think for your undergraduate, it matters most that you're in a decent university in a country you'll enjoy living and studying in, so a good Norwegian university would be fine. I think some options in Sweden or Western/Central Europe might be a bit better connected to European research institutes, but I think that's mostly important during your master's, and in general there's a lot of transnational cooperation going on. I think you could possibly get a PhD from one of the best places by taking a step up after your UG and again after your master's. It might be a good idea to ask some maths/physics folks on Reddit for more specific advice on universities for maths/physics in Europe though, as it's not my field of expertise.Also be aware that finding a research master in English will not be an issue at all, as almost all are in English. The language will only be an issue during UG, and only if you do not find an English taught program.\n* For rankings, you could go to [https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2021/subject-ranking/physical-sciences#!/page/0/length/25/sort\\_by/rank/sort\\_order/asc/cols/stats](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2021/subject-ranking/physical-sciences#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats) , [https://www.topuniversities.com/subject-rankings/2021?utm\\_source=topnav](https://www.topuniversities.com/subject-rankings/2021?utm_source=topnav) or [http://www.shanghairanking.com/Shanghairanking-Subject-Rankings/index.html](http://www.shanghairanking.com/Shanghairanking-Subject-Rankings/index.html) . Be sure to read a little bit about the methodology, as there are significant differences between them. Some place a lot of emphasis on research output, which may not be the most useful metric to consider for your undergraduate experience but could be somewhat useful later on. Universities within 50 or more places of each other can be of very similar quality so these rankings are far from a perfect measure, but you can use them to compare roughly.\n* I meant top 100/top 200 worldwide, but I think for your chances of a PhD it's most important you go to a decent/good university (as seen in rankings, nationally, and by the maths/physics community) as that gives you the perspective of progressing to a master's at a very good university if you perform well. So look at rankings but also try to talk to someone in the field in Europe or the country/region you're considering most, as they can point you to the institutions with a good reputation in the field.\n* If you mean the academic perspective after your PhD, I guess it can be very good or quite tough, like in all of academia. Based on what I've heard in biology, be aware that you might have to shift your scientific career perspective to Europe (including UK though) permanently, unless you actively refocus on the US for your PhD or Postdocs.\n\nedit: spelling",

The odds are really low in general, although others are giving good advice on how to maximize them.\n\nPerhaps others can speak to the length of the degree. My physics PhD friends tell me it is not uncommon to take 7-9 years to finish. I'm not sure if they still do postdocs or if people stay a long time at my school to push out the same number of pubs they would've gotten from a postdoc. A person I knew who got a facility job in physics (not an extremely exciting one, mind, just *a* faculty job) did several postdocs and I think that is not unusual. How much time are you willing to devote to this? Assume 8 years is the minimum (5 yr PhD + 1 postdoc). But it could be more. It sounds like you will finish your BA at 39. Do you want to be applying to jobs when you are almost 50? And although it definitely works for some, ageism is a thing. And what will your retirement plan be if you spend ~12-15 years as a student?\n\nIf I was in your shoes I would at least consider doing some simple 2-year masters in a field you think can get you a solid job (if you need pre-reqs most can be taken at your local community college), and do physics in your spare time.",

I've never had a career, and never really imagined having one either. This all sits fine with me (I know that sounds weird, but it's the truth. Maybe 50 year old me will feel differently, but I doubt it).\n\n> what will your retirement plan be\n\nThat is something I'll definitely need to think more about.\n\n> If I was in your shoes I would at least consider doing some simple 2-year masters in a field you think can get you a solid job (if you need pre-reqs most can be taken at your local community college), and do physics in your spare time.\n\nNot interested. If physics was just going to be a personal hobby for the rest of my life, I'd go a different direction. I'd still get a PhD, but it'd likely be in something completely unrelated. Financial stability, \"good jobs\", etc have never been a part of my life and has never held any interest for me.",

      "text": "I'm not in the age range you requested (graduated around 30, in my mid-thirties now), but my own experience is a bit different to what had been posted so far so maybe you will find it helpful.\n\nI went to a regional state school for undergrad. Got good grades (graduated summa cum laude), good general GRE, poor physics GRE (like 10th percentile). The main thing I had going for me was research experience. I worked with my undergrad advisor for over three years, was a co-I on a dozen papers, and had A LOT of \"lab\" experience (did observational astronomy, which means time at telescopes taking data & doing loads of analysis). The department was small so I was able to have a strong rapport with several professors, so I was able to get good letters of recommendation.\n\nIirc, I applied to 8 PhD programs and got accepted to one, which was another state school that has very low general name recognition but has a well-respected program in my discipline. During my post-acceptance tour I point-blank asked a professor on the selection committee why I got in considering my low physics GRE score, and was told that my research experience is what made me stand out. This was very lucky on my part, as I learned later that many places, especially the big programs, receive so many applications every year that they use the subject GRE as an initial cutoff before looking at the rest of the application. Keep in mind that all this occurred almost 15 years ago, however.\n\nI took 7 years to do my PhD, mostly because my project was a survey and it just took that long to get my data. Got one first-author publication before I graduated and several co-authorships, so I didn't have a very strong publication record upon graduation. In hindsight, that's likely the main reason why my postdoc applications never went anywhere. However, I did have a lot of technical/lab experience from operating large/expensive instruments (usually solo) and writing the software that I used to do a lot of my data analysis. One of the best decisions I ever made in grad school was to take some analysis code a colleague had given me and re-write it in python (which I learned while re-writing said code).\n\nSo after graduation and doing a bit of adjunct teaching I was talking to a colleague who was another former student of my graduate advisor. This person asked if I was interested in supporting a science mission in a technical role, to which I enthusiastically agreed, so they forwarded my CV to some interested parties, which is how I got an offer to be a software dev at NASA with the science support group for an upcoming mission.\n\nI could have stayed in the software dev career track & been quite happy to continue contributing to science in such a role. I could have even done so without the PhD - I work with a few people who started there right out of undergrad with physics bachelor's degrees. However, since I have the PhD I was able to chang roles to missions operations, which makes better use of my skills & education. \n\nAnyway, I hope the condensed version of my life's story helps a little! Mostly I just wanted to point out that one can have a career contributing to science outside of the traditional research track.",

One lesson required us to reach out to a professor in our major to interview about what they do. An upper-classman friend of mine pointed me toward my soon-to-be undergrad advisor, which is how I got on his radar. \n\nA month or two later he reached out to me to see if I was interested in joining his research group. There was federal funding in the department for undergrad researchers, so I was able to get paid while learning to do research (not much pay, mind you; I believe it was at minimum wage and only a handful of hours a week). \n\nI started working with a postdoc of his, basically being a monkey and repeating the data reduction procedure this postdoc taught me without really understanding what I was doing for quite a while. I'd say I wasn't particularly useful to the group until I had been working with them for most of a year, which was expected because I was a student after all.\n\nSo, by my third year I was able to make \"real\" contributions, which in my case meant helping figure out a data analysis procedure for a new type of study my advisor wanted to do, and needing minimal oversight to operate experiment equipment. In my fourth & final year I had enough experience to be trusted with most of the data reduction & analysis without him double-checking the work, and was able to operate our small research telescope without any oversight at all. I was also entrusted with training new group members in these activities.\n\nI admit that much of what I was able to accomplish in those years was due to pure dumb luck on my part. I was extremely fortunate to wind up with a supervisor who was 1) a good, supportive mentor and 2) was a highly productive researcher. Word of mouth would be very useful there, so just talk to upper classmen. They typically love to gossip :)",

So I don't think age matters that much as long as you are not like 60 when you start your degree. One of my cohort mates started her phd at 38 and then got her first tenure track job at around age 49 (she worked in industry for a couple of years though, mostly because we graduated during the great recession).",

              "text": "I started doing research midway through my sophomore year. One way is to look at department websites, you can also email department advisors and ask about department research opportunities as an undergrad. It helps to go to a research focused university (often larger state schools vs. small liberal arts colleges) where the profs publish more. I went to an \"r3\" state school for undergrad (a CUNY school). I got my first RAship by finding a prof in my department doing research on the topic I was interested in and asking if I could be her research assistant in exchange for independent study credit...ended up doing two and we later got a grant to pay me and eventually coauthored 2 papers based on my undergrad work (but most profs won't commit to coauthoring with a random undergrad until you \"prove yourself\" by being a research assistant for a while and doing a great job. Some of the work I did an an undergrad was not in exchange for credit or money, I just wanted the experience so did it for free).",

      "text": "Alright here's some harsh but honest advice:\n\nFirst, say your BA takes 4 years, your PhD might take 7 (average for an experimental physicist), a postdoc might take 3.  Do you really think you can predict what your desires will be in 14 years?  Then you might get a full time job at age 47.\n\nSecond, are you sure you know what kind of job you want?  There are jobs at those places that don't require a PhD.  You could be an engineer, technician, machinist, or manager...\n\nThird, even if everything goes according to plan there's no guarantee that you'll get a job at one of these places.  A lot of these jobs are so competitive that it's not just about who has the best resume.  The best resume will get you on a short list, but then they might end up picking someone who happened to work on the right kind of project that they didn't advertise that they're thinking about working on...  I went to a top physics PhD program, one of the very best in the world, and I think roughly a third of us are still working in physics.  I'd say a third didn't really have a choice in the matter (they either didn't graduate or didn't publish enough to get their next job after graduation), and the remaining third decided at some point that they wouldn't be happy with the life they'd have to live if they stuck with it.  And that's from one of the top programs in the world.\n\nWhat does happiness mean?  Well, a lot of these places are in the middle of nowhere and the jobs are not always high paying.  There are departmental politics and jobs where you're not actually doing what you want to be doing.  You can't always find funding for the things you want to do and end up working endlessly on projects that you don't really care about.\n\nLet's talk about specific jobs in physics:\n\n-Staff scientist jobs at national labs can be awesome, but they also can have major downsides.  A place like Fermilab has scientists who support users, which means you won't really have time for your own research, but helping people can be really fun.  It can also be really difficult to get those jobs, and they run on someone else's schedule (and they require a level of mechanical handiness).  I don't know much about CERN but science jobs in France tend to be very low pay and anything full-time at CERN will be very competitive.  NASA hires a lot of engineers, but very few physicists.  Some staff scientist jobs allow you to work on what you want if you can find the funding, but very few people end up finding their own funding and they end up working on 6-7 projects at once.  It can be hard to get funding for a postdoc and you can't have graduate students directly under you unless you're at a university.\n\n-Faculty positions at R1 universities have the downside that most professors don't do real research themselves.  They apply for grants, give talks, teach classes, manage their trainees, do service for the department, and yeah they think about science sometimes.  But they also have to deal with departmental politics and worry about a lot of things unrelated to science.\n\n-Faculty positions at liberal arts colleges involve much more teaching, smaller research groups with much less funding, and shorter undergraduate-driven research projects.\n\nOverall, if you think you'll enjoy the process, that's great, and it might work out.  Anything is possible.  But more likely than not, things won't work out the way you expected them to, and if things don't work out well at all there's a 50-50 chance it might not even be your fault.\n\nI also don't understand why you want to redo a 4-year bachelors.  What's the point of re-taking those History distribution requirements?",

Just, coming to terms with \"do I still want to do this, even if I end up not exactly where I want to be?\" I think the answer is yes. I at least want to start out on this path.\n\n> Well, a lot of these places are in the middle of nowhere and the jobs are not always high paying.

The third point is the one that I imagine cutting the deepest. \n\n> Let's talk about specific jobs in physics:\n\nSeriously, thank you for all that perspective.\n\n> Overall, if you think you'll enjoy the process, that's great, and it might work out.

What's the point of re-taking those History distribution requirements?\n\nTwo reasons:\n\n- I won't be redoing any of the general classes (e.g. history, English, foreign language). But most of the curriculums I've looked at make it seem that the structure of the physics and math class requirements ends up taking about 4 years.  \n\n- Most importantly, I want as much time in the UG as possible so that I can build relationships and do as much research as possible so I can build the strongest possible grad school application. (Sure, I'm thinking very far ahead, but I don't want to end up precluding myself from one of my likely paths simply because I didn't plan well at the start--especially when the planning is fairly easy).",

                  "text": "Thanks for the really thorough reply. I realized a bit after I replied to you earlier I might have come across as overly glib, which I didn't intend\u2014so I really appreciate you continuing the exchange.\n\nMy wife will probably be working during my UG, and wont begin her grad program until I begin mine. So, in theory, the UG debts could be significantly less than anticipated in my OP.\n\nAs for postdoc age limits, I've heard the complete opposite from many other posters, here and in other threads. Maybe it's a regional thing?\n\nAnd in the US profs can stay on until they wither in their chairs. It's part of the problem here.\n\nTeaching is something I've spent half my 20s doing. I'm decent at it, and it's the sort of thing I *should* like--it's totally in my personality--but for some reason it doesn't give me as much joy as it should. That said, if my plans don't work out and the only thing I can do is teach, I think I'd be happy with that.\n\nAs for overqualification... Well, I guess I'd rather be a 50-something waiter *with* my PhD experiences behind me than without them. But, seriously, I've bootstraped nearly all of my income over the last ten years working mostly for myself. I'm sure I could do it again.\n\nI do have a plan to keep a small monthly income (~1-2k) going that should only take maybe 5 hours a week to maintain. Hopefully less, if I optimize it over the next 2 years.\n\nAs for overseas, I'm actively looking into that. Honestly, I'm aiming at Japan (lived there before, looking to live there permanently). If I can return to my overly-idealistic outlook again for a moment\u2014they've got their ILC coming online sometime in the nearish future, plus the KEK's accelerators which do some interesting work, plus others.  And I'm lucky enough to have a friend who's doing a PhD right now at Tohoku with their research built around the eventual ILC (actually, their academic path eerily matches my exact dream path: UG > fermilab > Japan PhD program w/ a year as a visiting scholar in France). It's definitely idealistic of me to think about, and it's not the be-all-end-all, but it's something that gets my blood going; keeps me motivated.\n\nThat said, Germany and France have been on my short-list of non-US schools to consider. Do you think it'd be possible for someone in my position to do an UG there? Do you think it would be advisable?",

That is good\n* Age: probably regional\n* old professors: you say it yourself. them staying on for so long means they are blocking the place of somebody younger. And the administration in a drive to cut costs replaces the finally dead professor with an adjunct. I think professors should be able to do another 5 years (so retire at 70) and then retire. \n* teaching: well I do only research and permanent research contracts are harder to come by then teaching contracts. Hence teaching at a community college might give you more job security.\n* overqualification: yes, it can be disappointment. What could have been. I understand that.\n* income: the most important. If you can arrange some way to have a small passive income stream (imagine a stock account)  that would be a gamechanger. At that point you are not doing the PhD to get a job but you can really enjoy the research. And 1-2k/month is quite good.\n* overseas: I don't know about Japan. It looks like a high-performance life there with high workloads. \n* Farnce or Germany? Germany: free education, you do need to know german but they have quite a good few schools.",
