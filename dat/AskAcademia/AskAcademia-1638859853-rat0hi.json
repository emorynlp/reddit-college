  "text": "I have taken up a research project at the moment which is very traumatising, and very relevant to contemporary political events around the world (women and race) which makes it all the more worrying. I find myself getting burnt out and exhausted very easily, and I find I am slowly becoming less productive after a very productive start.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you deal with traumatic subjects in research, especially when that work takes up majority of your day?",

      "text": "Secondary trauma is a reasonably common phenomenon among social workers, health care providers and others working with people who have endured trauma ([see for instance this study](https://doi.apa.org/fulltext/2013-15707-001.html)). It can also affect researchers studying trauma-related issues, especially when studies include first-hand accounts. Personally, I work on civilian impacts of war, which is very tough at times. It's good to be aware of secondary trauma being a thing, and to know that this is not a sign of weakness as a researcher, but of empathy as a human.\n\nRegarding how to deal with what you are experiencing - there is no way of knowing what will work for you. As a first step, I would recommend finding a person you feel comfortable talking to. Ideally, academic supervisors should be aware of the risks of secondary trauma, available for open conversations about it and able to point you towards resources offered by your university. It will also help clarify expectations regarding productivity. If you don't feel comfortable talking to your supervisor (or other colleagues) about this, a therapist might be a good choice. You could also reach out to friends and check whether they are fine with you unloading on them (not everyone might be mentally prepared to deal with this).  \nIf you keep experiencing this emotional burn-out / symptoms of secondary trauma, please seriously consider therapy. It's there to help you, so you can continue to help others with your research.\n\nSome smaller coping mechanisms that help me in daily research life are reminding myself of the positive change I want to bring about with my research, i.e. the \"Why on earth am I doing this to myself?\" question, and a copious supply of kitten videos and other r/Eyebleach material.",

          "text": "I second these great suggestions. I do research on sexual violence and transphobia. One thing that helps me when I start to feel overwhelmed is to schedule breaks and/or do bites size chunks of work where that makes sense. Like, an hour of reading, then scroll through kitten pictures. Having collaborators or other colleagues doing similar work can also help you process what you're dealing with.\n\nThank you for doing such important work.",

              "text": "Yes. It can be really painful to write about those things. Besides, the theoretical framework is very intellectually demanding and its methodology is usually highly rigorous. It could be a traumatic experience for academics to endure such pain, but the social relevance and impact of the research in people\u00b4s daily lives makes it worthwhile in the end.\n\nIn this sense, writting yet another paper about intersectionality seems very similar to what neuroscientists do in actual science. But it's not.",
