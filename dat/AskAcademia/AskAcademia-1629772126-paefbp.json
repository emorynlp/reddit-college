  "title:": "Regaining confidence and moving on after not-great PhD experience advice",
  "text": "TLDR: After a experiencing a classic rocky/toxic PhD, what advice or experiences have people used to move on and recover?\n\nMy PhD experience was not ideal. I won\u2019t go into details because it is much the same saga as most post-grads or post-docs probably will go through during their projects at some point. In summary, my supervisors are absolutely lovely people whom I adore and admire, but circumstances (a uni restructure, COVID, a few staff and family member losses along the way etc) were not in our favour. It resulted in a very lonely (solo) and neglected PhD experience coupled with everyone taking mental health leave at some point. We also got what turned out to be toxic academics onboard to \u201chelp\u201d \u2014 more like helping give me trust issues. A complete shambles and everybody was having a bad time and none of us dealt with the situation well.\n\nAt the conclusion of this I feel completely broken, exhausted/burnt out, like a failure, I have no confidence and don\u2019t believe I can do anything ever again. I know objectively these feelings are not a reflection of reality, my feedback was excellent and I had great reviews and reviewers, but my thoughts and opinions of myself are still paralysed by imposter syndrome none-the-less. I haven\u2019t published anything from my PHD because of these fearful feelings, which makes me feel worse because I feel as though I have failed as an academic in training. But if I want to publish, I will have to do it all myself, and I haven\u2019t yet mustered up the courage to deal. \n\nDoes anyone have advice on how they moved through this kind of trauma (for lack of a better term)?\nI am so aware of my current susceptibility to self sabotage rooted in my lack of self confidence, but I don\u2019t know how to work through it and just \u201cbe brave\u201d. I tried going to a psychologist, but didn\u2019t find the box-fitting and Health and PE style worksheets very helpful and I didn\u2019t feel like the psychs really got was I was talking about.  \nI have been thinking about doing a course on project management or similar to give me an arsenal to learn from my mistakes. But I am feeling unsure if this is a waste of time and $$$. I don\u2019t want to go into academia (the feeling of dread is real) but I don\u2019t want to leave research nor my training behind completely. I actually have no idea what to do next but I\u2019m too stuck to even try for something.\n\nI would appreciate stories and experiences from people on how they moved through and beyond the dark space, regained confidence and redirected themselves.",

      "text": "Reading your story sounds a lot like my PhD experience. I left with very similar feelings. In my case, my advisor was awful. I left feeling like a failure with no confidence in my abilities and little perspective on how I would do out in the world. My advisor assured me that I didn\u2019t have what it took to make it in industry or academia. It was rough. I made it out of the fog, though it was certainly a process. \n\nI ended up doing a postdoc. My postdoc advisor was incredibly supportive. That was really what I needed. I left my postdoc with some confidence in myself and a mentor I knew I could call if I ever needed to talk. If you are coming out of a rough PhD experience, I would highly recommend finding a mentor. Ideally, this would be a supervisor that is willing to invest in you. It doesn\u2019t need to be a formal relationship though. If you can, find someone experienced who will support you or at least act as a sounding board and confidante. \n\nSince my postdoc I have worked in a few industry jobs, a startup, and a national lab. My conclusion from my experience there is that impostor syndrome is the norm. That is part of working in any field with an overwhelming amount of information (which is basically all fields now). The best people to work with are those that understand where their knowledge is lacking and readily admit it. \n\nYou aren\u2019t an impostor, you don\u2019t know everything, and what you bring to the table is valuable. All of those statements are true simultaneously. Internalizing this is tough, but it is true.\n\nAs far as suggestions go: find a mentor, believe in yourself even if you need to fake it at first, remember that everyone starts out knowing nothing and grows from there. Try to focus on the growth and not the starting point.",

          "text": "I had an almost identical experience. My advisor was, uh, hell! Very good scholar, but terrible advisor. Almost always ignored me, I was the only PhD student they had for a couple of years, so no cohort. Always threw the busy card at me, never wanted to read my papers. Gave me no feedback before I sent my dissertation to reviewers. Yelled at me for being accepted at a prestigious conference. Aggressively shouted at and offended with slur words in front of MAs students for not 'explaining in simple words' a theoretical concept. After I finished in March last year, they told me they didn't care whether I ended up being a janitor or a postdoc. Just terrible for my self-esteem. I had to learn on my own how to send papers to journals and how to deal with reviews. No job advice, nothing. I finished a couple of months after covid started and I felt completely lost. Then I got an adjunct position without any backing from anyone (which is rare and the competition is incredible). I kinda feel better after one year but I am still healing.",

      "text": "As someone who had a really rough PhD experience (six years of crap culminating with a horrible time almost having to resign a TT job because of my PhD advisor), it takes *time*. It\u2019s been five years for me, and I still get panicky on Thursday\u2019s because of grad school group meeting\u2026 despite being out longer than I was in. \n\nAnd that is fine that it takes this much time. That\u2019s a lot to recover from. It might take you less (for your sake I hope so) but if not, ok. \n\nOne day at a time. \n\nI spent the first two years angry, so I\u2019d at least suggest avoiding that. I\u2019d also agree with another poster, find a new mentor who can help with confidence (and a therapist too, that can help).",

It\u2019s good to hear from others experiences and recovery time and journey. I understand what you mean by feeling panicky. I get those panicky reactions to hearing anything about my project or publishing or whatever. I\u2019m hoping that finishing it all off will let me move on and forget about it forever",

      "text": "The fact you know you don\u2019t want to continue in academia puts you, trust me, a giant step in front of where I was at the end of my PhD. \nMy experience wasn\u2019t terrible. But lack of communication and cooperation within the lab made me spend 4 years (I\u2019m in Europe) working basically alone on my project. Definitely Not a place boosting productivity. Published a couple papers, but nothing that would raise anyone\u2019s hopes about a future in academia. And despite loosing my interest in my research topic and academia in general, there I was doing a short postdoc in the same lab waiting for something (a grant or such) to arrive. I was on a sort of \u2018path of least resistance\u2019 because I thought that 1) was the only thing I could do and 2) because since after high school I designed my life with a future in academia in mind. Moving between countries, putting personal life (family, relationships etc) on hold. And in my head leaving academia meant that all what I did was for nothing. \n\nI learned (am kind of still in the process) to let all this go. To accept that not pursuing an academic career despite the PhD is not a failure and doesn\u2019t define my  or anyone\u2019s worth. All this I realised after more that two years of therapy. I was really lucky with my therapist. I also have the feeling that sometimes he doesn\u2019t know what i am talking about, but I guess that if someone didn\u2019t \u2018endure\u2019 academia then is difficult to relate.\nOnce I realised (and accepted) my place was not in academia there was the problem of deciding what to do. \u2018Nobody would hire a failed academic like me\u2019\u2026. \u2018My research experience is worthless in the real world\u2019\u2026. \u2018I have no company experience\u2026\u2019. All thoughts that persisted in my head. I was completely stuck between knowing I wanted to leave academia but not knowing how. \nWhat saved me was being on unemployment. In the country where I did the PhD, PhD students and postdocs are considered employees. So at the end of my contract (as a European union citizen) I qualified for 12 months of unemployment. One condition for getting the money is that you have to apply for jobs. And if there is one thing that overcame my fear of applying and my impostor syndrome was the fear of legal repercussion and loosing the money. So I started\u2026 put my CV in order and sent it here and there. And after a month or so I got called for an interview in the company where I work now. I\u2019m still doing research in a lab, still do some bioinformatics. Still recovering from my \u2018academic trauma\u2019 but I\u2019m now happier and feel less worthless.\nIn the end I realised I was lucky because something forced me to move. To not remain stuck. I realise everyone\u2019s situation is different, but what is important is not to remain stuck. Updating and sending out cv ( even if the chances are slim\u2026), update your profile and network on LinkedIn\u2026 reach out to people working in roles that interest you\u2026 you said you\u2019d like to keep doing research.. I don\u2019t know your field but maybe you could look into R&D positions? Just don\u2019t let the fear of failure stop you. \n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "I'm so sorry to hear that. I went through something similar and one thing that helped me move past it was to audit my experience. I looked at my experience and listed down my strengths + weaknesses in separate tables. On each side of the table, I added another section about 'How can I improve?' It took me a long time to write these but when I got it done, I managed to look at my situation more objectively than letting it get stuck in my jumble of thoughts.\n\nIt helped exponentially to walk through my PhD experience with more confidence and also to move past the negative things that happened to me. Another important thing that helped me was to be open and always make sure that I am communicating with my supervisors. I always ask for their opinions be it their schedules, thoughts, expectations to see if we are on the same page. Not to the point of micromanaging of course. Over time, you learn how to find the right balance in communication. You also need to ask what are their preferences and also learn to put your thoughts on the table without being condescending or unthoughtful.\n\nA lot of miscommunications happen when one party starts to assume something and the other party also assumes. When there is a lack of communication, things can become sour really fast. So, my motto during PhD has always been to maintain an open communication, to listen more and learn to forgive myself.\n\nI hope it helps.",

      "text": "My advisor/department was abusive to the point I had to file official grievances with the university in order to graduate. My only publication was a review that I submitted without my advisor's approval. I finished, defended, and graduated though. Took an entry level job in industry just for the employment.\n\nIt took six months to recover from the stress and nightmares that my degree would be revoked for some small mistake I made. After that was about of year of coping with frustration of not having the daily challenge of research. I was constantly angry and scared for roughly two years after graduating.\n\nI'm good now. I've figured out how to turn this job into a career if I want to. The other option is to jump ship for better pay in a few years. The PhD is less personally defining and more just a qualification I can use to improve my position in life. Life is filling the need for challenges with marriage and house and everything. So much of my mental energy is just spend managing money, which is easier and less stressful than research.\n\nI'd suggest finding a life coach. They are not psychiatrists and don't try to treat you, but rather talk about your goals and how to achieve them.",

      "text": "Really sorry you're going through this. I do have a few suggestions. Firstly, finding a therapist is like dating. You may have to try a few before you find one that works for you and that relationship may not last forever but that's ok. Secondly, given a lot of your issues are related to work and you didn't love therapy have you thought about getting yourself some professional coaching? Again you may need to shop around a bit but it may feel less fraught and more goal oriented than therapy. Lastly, this isn't a suggestion for help but more general advice. Remember, job interviews are an opportunity for you to interview them as much as they you. Look for somewhere that you think you'd like to work at and know that you deserve to enjoy your career. If someone's being a dick at interview, that's because they're a dick and they'll be a dick as a colleague/boss. It's not because you deserved it. Good luck.",
