      "text": "Ah, the habilitation. A vestigial feature of German academia, and relatively unknown outside of German-speaking countries.\n\nI think you would be better served if you directed these questions to the institution where you are pursuing a habilitation. Better still, you could ask people who have done a habilitation themselves (ideally within your field / department), and they could more directly address your questions.\n\nI've known two people who did their habilitations. One was a group leader at a government research institute, and they did their habilitation at a nearby technical institute. The other did their habilitation while working at a private law firm.\n\nI would be surprised if there are strict positional requirements to do a habilitation, although I would expect that a doctorate and an established body of work (i.e., peer-reviewed papers) that provides the foundation for an overarching thesis is required.\n\nHowever, a \"wissenschaftler\" is a scientist and a \"wissenschaftlicher mitarbeiter\" is a scientific assistant, so your question of how one becomes either one of these is a bit obvious; you get a job as one!",

              "text": "No, a habilitation is a formal procedure with institution-specific requirements and those can even within a university (across faculties and departments). You formally start the habilitation based on a goal definition and some sort of project plan, go through pedagogical courses and courses on legal aspects of higher education, design your own courses and publish along the goal definition. At least when I did it (Bavaria), that was the procedure. Note that - and that is regardless of the institution - the habilitation ends with a specific degree (facultas docendi) testifying your ability to teach and it\u2019s important to understand that this goes beyond research and publishing.",

                      "text": "I\u2019d distinguish paid positions and qualification programs. For postdoctoral positions, in contrast to PhD positions, there is no formal requirement or expectation to pursue the habilitation. You could as well work as a postdoctoral researcher for some years and engage in teaching and academic self-administration, all without doing your habilitation, but still apply successfully for a tenured position. In consequence and in contrast to PhD positions, the habilitation (qualification) is not typically part of postdoc vacancies but should be open to everyone working in such postdoc position. \n\nHow the process is formally started depends on the institution and the underlying statutes. At my example (Computer Science at a technical university in southern Germany), I started discussions with the chair and presented the idea to the Dean. Once I had my goal definition (document), the process was formally started. I know that in the medical field (same university), the process differed. \n\nFinally, in theory, it should be possible to do the habilitation at an institute where you are not formally employed. However, given that the habilitation is also a way for the university to qualify postdoctoral researchers for teaching in higher education and that the qualification program comes along teaching duties at the same institution, I doubt a bit that the university would be dedicated to do this for scholars at other institutions. \n\nSorry if I made this a bit complicated but given that the habilitation is all but standardised I recommend that you check first the statutes at the respective institution.",

In my institution you need 12 papers, of which 6 must be first or last authorship papers. 8 papers should be in general about the same topic, so that you can write a cumulative Habilitation. \nWhether a habilitation is sensible for you depends a lot on the subject. Medicine and I think Maths (not sure about maths) are the most common subjects in which you can do your Habilitation.",

Once you have reached the amount required for the Habilitation, you need a supporting letter and the list of your research AND teaching, and apply to be a \"habilitation candidate\". This process takes roughly 2 years and you probably need to remain at this institution during this time (not necessarily, but it is not likely the committee will approve if you change institution during that time). To remain your status of \"Habilitand\" you need to continue teaching at this institution. It can be transferred to a different institution, but the new institution needs to approve of this and fulfil the requirements. \n\nA habilitation is s stepping stone to a professor usually. The requirements are different based on the county in Germany. In Bavaria it usually takes 6 years. In those 6 years you should publish 6 papers. In Baden-W\u00fcrtenberg it is only 2 years, as far as I know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome universities accept papers that were published before your doctorate or which are from your doctorate, others don't. Hamburg accepts only papers published after your doctorate. My institution does not accept the paper with the same topic as the doctorate.",

As far as I know many universities offer to evaluate your progress  and give an opinion on whether you are on track or not after some time. Also, being a Privatdozent or Professor inludes teaching, so you probably do not only have to provide proof of your scientific merits but also as a teacher. If the requirements include a special \"teach the teacher\" course and you are in a position to take such course - do it. I know of people who had a setback in the process of a couple of months since the only stuff left was the course which turned out had a waiting list.\n\nAlso, requirements can be softer or harder. My Habil-Ordnung for example explicitly has the option that they can just make you Prof if your work is outstanding and you get the Nobel prize or an article in Nature. Meeting the minimum requirements may not be enough on the other hand, when you change universities and have not produced output for the new one, but want to do Habil with the research from the old employer.",

Teaching is relatively unimportant - at my university you get to choose between showing proof of certification (there Hochschullehre Zertifikate that are mutually recognized between the states, takes several years to complete), giving a teaching demonstration, or having taught a total of 12 SWS in the three terms prior to Habilitation.\n\nThe status of Habilitand:in is extremely ill-defined in our Habilitationsordnung. In theory, you are supposed to have a talk with the dean at some point of writing your Habilitationsschrift (which is expected to be completed \"in a timely fashion\") but it never says that/how/when you have to register as a Habilitand:in. My impression is that in reality people get their ducks in order and *then* make their desire formally known.\n\n(Also,  Habilitand:in is a status, not a job - you'll still work as a postdoc, Nachwuchsgruppenleiter:in, etc.)\n\nIn total, the process from PhD to Habilitation tends to take 5-10 years. People going the tenure track route (Jun. Prof.), usually don't write a Habilitationsschrift. Guess the jury is still out on how this affects the entire system.",
