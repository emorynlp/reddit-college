  "text": "My wife and I lived together and got married while doing our PhDs in two universities that were very close to each other. Last year I started a 3 year post doc in England while she had a couple of nearby temporary research and teaching jobs.  This meant her working away during the week and coming home every weekend.  This gave us a taste of living apart but was quite bareable.  \n\nShe has just started a 2 year post doc ... in Norway.  I am really happy for her because she is in a lab where she can follow her interests and it is a group she has worked with before and works well with. \n\nHer first day was today and I've just got back from a weekend of helping her move over there.  Door-to-door the trip is about 8 hours. So I'm feeling a  it down in the dumps and wanted to hear other people's experiences with academic couples working and living apart.",

I know that that can be difficult but making sure to spend time with each other is important.  \nWe also, once we were living together again, started going to counseling ... counseling isn't a dirty word.  Sometimes it helps to have an outside perspective and trusted person to listen! Don't be afraid to do that!",

TBH if we are talking about 2 years, it's doable. I did it for longer.\n2. In a more day-to-day basis try to book your next visit, while you are together. This will always give you something to look forward to.\n3. Also try to be attentive during your skype sessions. It sounds easy but it's not always, mute other tabs, email etc.\n\nYou get used to it, and you won't feel bad on a daily basis. But in my experience, the relationship starts to degrade with distance. Be very conscious about how each of you feel and communicate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven if you make it through it and you move back in together, sometimes people grow apart and they realise only when they reconcile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck! I feel for you. In any case, steer away from drama, life is great!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

We spoke every day on the phone and texted all the time.  And at least one of us (usually me since he lived close to our families so it made finding a place to stay easier) once or twice a month.  We never went longer than 3 weeks without seeing each other.  Then the four years of grad school, he had to move away for awhile for work but we continued the texts and calls all the time.  We finally are living together while I am a postdoc in a larger city with more opportunities for his muggle job.  The biggest thing was the trust we had in each other to be faithful and caring during those times.  And keep communication open.  When it came time for a life change (like where to look for a postdoc), we talked together.  The time apart is hard but knowing it wasn't forever and discussing the areas we were both happy with when a move was coming was critical.",

      "text": "Although I'm yet to be in the position to comment about myself, I can about my parents, who lived with a similar geographic distance apart for ten years when I was growing up (my Dad worked in Finland, my Mum in the UK with me and my brother). He'd come home most weekends, or we'd go to see him, but Monday--Friday minimum he was away and my Mum had us to look after alone. Since embarking on my PhD and hoping for an academic career I've interrogated them how their relationship coped with this set-up, naturally, and I've basically gleaned the following:\n\n- Talk every day. Even if it's just for five minutes. Say goodnight to one another. Say good morning. By all means have something of a social life -- go to the pub, etc -- but make time every day to have an open-ended conversation, and share something whilst doing so. My parents like wine, so they used to have a glass of wine (or two) each whilst talking to one another. This was well before Facetime, etc, although my Mum reckons that would've made it much harder, weirdly (or not, perhaps).\n\n- Know when you're seeing one another next. Don't split without planning when you're seeing one another again. Book the flight together, but not on your last night together. And then stick to it. Don't flake out, easy though it can be.\n\n- Holidays are sacred. As an academic (or wannabe, at least) myself I understand how work can fill every waking moment, and guilt about not working the rest. But you can work when you're apart. Being together, for now, is special. Make it so. Go to museums, go out for dinner, stay in the pub till closing (if you like that sort of thing). Don't waste time.\n\n- Remember that it works. My parents, who got together in 1992, had me in 1993, then spent 1997--2007 in different countries 300 days of the year, celebrated their 23rd wedding anniversary this year and are still disgustingly in love.\n",

      "text": "Thanks for the prompt, OP. I\u2019m sorry your situation is hard right now. I feel that. I wish you so much excellent communication. \n-\nMy husband and I got married while he was applying to grad school. The original plan was for me to apply to programs at the same time, but that fell apart because I ran out of time. He did his PhD for 6 years, and I didn\u2019t get into schools nearby for a PhD the first application cycle, so I got a master\u2019s where he was doing his PhD. It was hard for me to feel like I belonged on campus for the first few years before I started my masters there. When he graduated I applied to PhD programs at the same school and 2 others. He had agreed to compromise for me, but then he got the dream post-doc. It was 2.5 hours away (up to 5 with traffic, as it\u2019s on the other side of a major city) from the school where he did his PhD and thus I decided to do mine there too (where he is doing his post doc doesn\u2019t have a program for me otherwise I would have tried that). So he is there 3-5 days a week and home on weekends. It\u2019s really hard. He works long hours and we don\u2019t always talk during the week very much. \n\nWe have been together almost 15 years, married 8, apart for 1.5. All things considered, we are doing OK, but it makes things really hard when crummy things happen and we still can\u2019t see each other for days.\n\nHis post-doc is 3 years so there\u2019s sort of an end in sight, but we don\u2019t know that he\u2019ll be able to negotiate a position for me anywhere, or if I will be in a position to negotiate at all, and that\u2019s hard.  The other aspect that\u2019s tough is he wants a TT at a small liberal arts college but my specialty is more common in professional/specialized schools so I\u2019d be better poised for a research university. I have to have TT because I would like to become a provost one day. So finding something for both of us might be hard. The looming unknown part is especially tough, even though we see each other almost every weekend, which is a blessing others don\u2019t get. \n\nA few things this situation has taught me:\n1. Time together is sacred and while we love to be with friends together it\u2019s often more comforting for us to be alone. \n2. Being in our apartment alone (with our pets) has showed me I\u2019m neater than I thought (when I\u2019m not super stressed). So that\u2019s nice...\n3. I appreciate him so much in so many ways that I began to take for granted. I miss him making me laugh all the time when he\u2019s not here. He defuses tension so well, and without him around I tend to be a ball of nerves. \n4. I was very clear when we decided to choose his post-doc and my second choice PhD program that I would need his support in a lot of other ways since he won\u2019t be around all the time. This was the best thing I could have done. On the weekends he makes me meals for the week and helps take care of laundry and dishes. I could not be more grateful for this support. I think the second time around he is beginning to see how much I had done to support him that he can\u2019t always do for me, but he\u2019s finding lots of other ways to support me and I\u2019m really grateful. \n5. There\u2019s always someone out there sacrificing more. It inspires me with awe that people can be so good at balancing their commitments and care for each other so consistently from so far away. I\u2019m lucky, and I\u2019m grateful, but I will tell anyone who asks, this is hard, it sucks, and this isn\u2019t what I hoped for or ever expected when I got married. I married a person I wanted to live with my whole life. Not just on weekends. It\u2019s a sacrifice we both had to make for our careers and because we believe we make the world better by doing this work instead of other work that would allow us to be together. We try to stay humble and honest about this sacrifice and what it takes to get through it.\n",

In August, he took a 3-year contract political science lecturer/program administrator position with a large research university in a typical small college town in another state, so we moved almost all our stuff down there and I moved back in with my parents to continue working at my current job in a field that I really love (policy/government).\n\nIt's been difficult because I've been struggling to lock down a full-time (and preferably decent!) job at the university. Naturally, the college town is far away from any major cities and anywhere I'd be able to find other and more suitable employment. Obviously when the department courted him for the position, they assured him that I'd be able to find something within the university and since it's been a couple months, in which I haven't heard ANYTHING, I've started to look at jobs in other major cities like Baltimore and Washington, DC. \n\nNeedless to say, it's incredibly difficult being apart when we lived together for 2 years prior to his new job and we spent pretty much all our free time together before that. We try to go less than 3 weeks without seeing each other, usually on weekends. I'm lucky enough to be able to work remotely one day a week when I need to, but it hasn't allotted me a lot of opportunities to network and meet folks who might be able to help me find a job. My boss has also put immense pressure on me on transitioning out of my position since I told him back in June about my partner's new job. He has asked me to quit multiple times, but I cannot afford to be unemployed and my partner does not make enough to pay both of our expenses. This isn't because we didn't try to be prepared for emergencies, but because he truly didn't think this university would offer him a job at all, so we were both shocked. \n\nI have never had a positive opinion of the academic world because while my partner has had good luck with his advisers and dissertation committee plus other work opportunities, I have seen a lot of other good friends struggle with maintaining sanity and relationships. We've both started doing counseling separately, and that has helped a lot. I think we were both really optimistic about the situation and how nearly everyone around expected that I'd have joined him by now. I would be lying if I wasn't a little resentful - I really love him and I support him, but I'm also career-minded and it's hard to want to be the one who makes the sacrifice just so we simply can be together, so we're figuring things out. It sucks, but I want to believe that we're strong enough to get through it and it isn't forever (3 years is still a long time), so that helps.",

      "text": "It'll inevitably get miles better compared with the 1st day. People get used to things.\n\nI had an issue where I went for a 2-year post-doc in the Baltimore (vs. Edinburgh: how's that for a move), while my partner stayed. The plan was she'd finish her PhD and get a post out there nearby. Before that though, I went 'this is not worth it' and came back, and found a job back here. Skype etc. help, and it's good having the 'next meeting' planned at all times. It's exciting planning their visit, or meeting intermediately. I don't think you can do it for *that long*, personally.",

      "text": "My wife's lab moved states ~3k miles away during the second half of her PhD (and during mine, too, though I've yet to graduate) and she moved with it.\n\nWe managed by: me going to visit her twice for three months each visit (she was there for just under 2y); her visiting me 6x for 2 weeks each visit; us \"hanging out\" for two hours each night, usually consisting of an hour of talking and an hour of fun activity (video games, movies, tv shows, etc.), and then 3-4h on the weekends; lots of little texts throughout the day; weekly-monthly cards, gifts, poems, drawings, etc. that we'd snail mail each other.\n\nWe've resolved to do our best to avoid lengthy (>2 months) separations in the future, which will probably mean compromising on career opportunities. So far, that's meant her weighing cities for eventual residency match according to my employability, and my slowing down my PhD and having to wait a year before knowing where to look to apply, as well as trying to assemble a versatile toolkit that should help with finding a job in the tech (data science) industry of most major cities.",
