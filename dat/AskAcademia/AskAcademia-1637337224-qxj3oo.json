  "text": "I am what someone might call an early-mid carreer scientist. I have a respectable number of publications and I like to believe that my name is known in my community. Despite that, I will be marrying next March and I plan to take on my SO's last name. Should I publish future papers with my new name? (It is tremedously easier to read and pronounce for an international audience). Shall I email everyone I know about my name change? Is it legit (and pratical) to keep my old name for scientific publications? How did people in my situation handle this?",

              "text": "You're correct. The ORCID will help with most things that track your publications but it will not transfer the reputation you have already build up to your new name. Informing collaborators of the name change would help a bit but you'll always lose some of that \"oh, that person is really active in X area\" effect. \n\nMost people I know in this situation just stuck with their maiden name. It's obviously your decision but if you don't have strong feelings either way, I'd strongly recommend sticking with the name under which you started publishing. It's common and not much different than authors or artists being known by names other than their legal names.",

      "text": "It's up to you. I've seen married professors do it many ways.\n\nPersonally, I chose to change my name legally and socially but use my original name professionally. It's totally possible - most of my professional colleagues have no idea that my legal last name is different from the one I use professionally, and many of my close friends have no idea that I go by a different name socially. The few contacts who cross both lives understand the difference. This is so common that people never bat an eye at it.\n\n(However, I will say that also kind of regret changing my name, because it's a little bit of a hassle keeping them separate. Sometimes I forgot which name I gave the hotel or the rewards program or whatever. I made my original name one of my middle names, so this makes things a whole lot easier - they're both on my legal documentation, which usually clears up any confusion, and again, this is so common that people don't seem fazed by it ever.)\n\nI know people who hyphenated; I know people who *didn't* hyphenate but just have two last names; I know people who changed it everywhere and publish under the new name and just list their previous name on their CV and on their website; I know people who kept their name the same. I even have one old mentor who had two names and got divorced and did it again - so she went from being Sally Smith to Sally Smith Jones, then back to Sally Smith and finally to Sally Smith Gordon. It seems to have had zero impact on her career.",
