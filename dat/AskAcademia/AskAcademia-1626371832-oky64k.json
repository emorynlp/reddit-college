  "text": "\n\nHello all! I graduated Spring of 2021 with my M.A in Higher Education Administration and Leadership. My final project for my program was a E-Portfolio. During my time there, studying student affairs, I also worked 9-5 outside of Academia. I have come to the point where my CV is being put together and I find myself with little to no big ticket items to place on my CV. I was not able to participate with grad assistantships/teaching experiences as my program had no opportunities and no thesis research due to my focus on the E-portfolio. I did mention my membership and e-board position in my graduate school association but I feel helpless. As my advisor kinda fell off in the middle of that\u2019s semester, I am feeling loss and little hopeless as I am feeling the weight of not having as colorful as a grad experience to write about in a CV as I begin sending in applications for Student Affairs positions as I want to get my foot in the door. \n\nWhat can I do about my CV? Has anyone been in this position before? Any help and guidance would be appreciated.\n\nSincerely,\nFeeling Lost Post-Grad",

      "text": "I didn\u2019t realize they were asking for CV and resume these days. They used to only ask for resume (I\u2019m in the same field, though now working in Canada). For your CV, you could include your areas of scholarly interest (e.g., topics within higher ed and student affairs), any highlights from your portfolio- e.g., sample paper titles. You could list academic and professional conference presentations if you\u2019ve made any. Or academic or professional organizations you are affiliated with. If you received any scholarships at any point in undergrad or grad school, list those too. Or a conference travel grant. It\u2019s totally understandable to only have so many things to include after completing a masters. You could always reach out to some people in similar positions and ask about how they approached the CV portion.",
