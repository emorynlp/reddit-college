  "title:": "How to say \"thank you\" to my grad student mentor",
  "text": "I'm wrapping up my senior thesis which ended up being a small research project and soon-to-be submitted manuscript. I have had a tremendous amount of help from one of the PhD students in my lab that I somewhat worked with before joining this lab. I've really appreciated all of her help and I don't know how to thank her before I graduate. We have weekly meetings and I've gotten to know her pretty well, but I also feel like I don't know her likes/dislikes. Everything has been over zoom too so I feel like learning little things like \"oh she goes to Dunkin every day\" or something like that has been lost. How would you want to be thanked/appreciated by an undergrad?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards! I'm thinking of getting her a card, socks, and maybe make some cookies. Your ideas were all great! :)",

One of the undergrads I worked with during my MSc got me a few bags of spicy chips before I moved for my PhD since we bonded over our shared love of them. I said goodbye to the rest of my lab that day too and ugly sobbed on the way home, because I felt truly care for there and it felt like I was leaving my family. \n\nIf you just got your mentor a gift card somewhere generic with a sweet card, I think she\u2019d be happy.",

Most people (at least in American culture) don't expect to receive a monetary gift (i.e. gift card) from someone who is less professionally advanced than them. But a card's kind of a keepsake.\n\nEDIT: I had a Chinese student give me a small lucky charm that was also really sweet and appreciated. Something inexpensive and small would be OK, but I don't think you should feel pressure to buy.",

I'm not a fan of monetary gifts because I know how we, as undergrad and grad students, do not necessarily have the means at this point in our careers.",

She literally shaped me into the researcher that I am today. Even at work and when I supervise trainees, I have her voice in my head all the time.\n\nMost of these good folks don't like anything materialistic. A card or something that was close to both of you would be a nice gesture.",

      "text": "Congrats on finishing! Most supervisors aren't fans of grand gestures, but rather enjoy a note or a gift of something small that actually has meaning to both of you.\n\nWhen I finished my masters I wrote a little letter on some card paper (think postcard size) that they really liked (if they weren't faking it...). Include something meaningful to both you and them, and don't forget to thank them (I assume you enjoyed working with them as you're asking how to thank them).\n\nThe most important part is that you show that you actually thought about what you wrote, so don't just leave a generic message behind, but something you bonded over. For example, a shared phrase or something they said that you keep coming back to.",

I haven\u2019t had coffee yet so words are extra hard, but I mean to say some faculty aren\u2019t allowed to accept monetary gifts (even gift cards) over certain amounts because of their university\u2019s policy against bribery. Faculty may not accept them anyway for the same reasons others have stated.\n\nAka a thank you card with a heartfelt message is PERFECT. Am a prof and I line up all the cards I have gotten on the shelf above my computer where I can see them all the time when I\u2019m in my office.\n\nEdit: a word because as I said, I\u2019m pre-coffee and words are hard :)",

Maybe think about what reminds you of them. \n\nEvery time I dropped by to chat with my thesis supervisor about my work she would offer me tea and she only had two varieties from really commercial brands. After finishing my thesis, I bought very nice organic loose-leaf tea from both varieties she liked, along with a cute tea infusion/filter. \n\nA card will definitely be cherised, but it\u2019s the attention to detail that counts most when it comes to a gift. If you happen to spot cup from a place they go to often, or you see that they\u2019re very into tea/coffee, a little more of that human fuel is much appreciated. :-)",
