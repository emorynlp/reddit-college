  "title:": "Should I mention in my Letter of Motivation why I want to change my PhD?",
  "text": "I work at a German university as a \"scientific staff\", which is the standard path to get a PhD here. After almost a year, I realize that this is not the right project for me. In the ten months I have worked here, the professor has not spoken to me once about my project. My \"mentor\" is another PhD student (Not even a post-doc). The project is horribly planned, and I am scrambling just trying to keep up with the milestones. On top of everything, I have discovered that the plan was made with 1.5 full time positions in mind, but they just didn't hire the half time position. Instead, the salary goes to the other PhD student, who takes no active role in the work. Taking all these into account, I think I should my losses. I still want to do a PhD and have already started looking for other positions.\n\nNow my question is, should I mention why I want to change my job in my cover letter? I feel like it reflects badly on my CV that I am changing a position so soon and leaving a project in the middle and would like the opportunity to explain myself. However, I also do not want to sound negative in my letter.",

      "text": "I regularly review student applications for master's studies at my university (also in Germany), so I'm answering from the perspective of someone who is reviewing a cover letter: It does indeed help to know why you want to leave a position and start over; if you don't, you may give an impression that you are simply moving from one place to another without having a clear idea about what you want to do.\n\n**Do not** focus on interpersonal issues in your explanation though; instead, focus on why you think the current project is not for you and why the project you are applying for would be better for your career. That would help the selection committee immensely.",

          "text": "Great advice, thanks! \n\nKinda off topic, but since you also work in Germany, is it normal for German professors to not take any interest in a project in their institute? I honestly feel embarrassed to ask other PhD students this question, somehow I feel like it's my fault that I am unworthy of his attention. But if this is the norm, maybe I should manage my expectations.",

              "text": "I would say it's not as uncommon as one might think. The main reason for this is that a professor likely has multiple projects running in parallel - the more projects they have running, the more money is flowing in the institute and the more people they can hire, which contributes to the growth of the research group in the long run. This, however, means that they will not be equally involved in all of those projects, or they will not be directly involved in some projects at all, but will have PhD students/postdocs who take care of those on their behalf.",

              "text": "I would totally agree with this advice. It's true for any job. If there's anything unusual about your application and the route you're going in your career it really helps to explain it. When you're recruiting you have a lot of applications and when you get one that has some \"mystery\" about it, it's often that one that gets bumped if the shortlist is too long. You don't want to dump a good candidate in favour of one who might not be serious about the job/PhD or may have issues with taking up your offer.",

              "text": "I would say it is pretty normal, yes. I moved from the UK to Germany for my PhD and it took me some time to adjust. Here in Germany a PhD student really does have to manage their own project independently, with the supervisor just giving occasional suggestions. My experience in the UK was that supervisors are much more involved in their students projects on a day to day basis.\n\nI guess the key factor is that German research groups are often much larger, with one professor supervising up to 10 or even more students. In The UK that would be completely unimaginable, 1 or 2 is more the norm, maybe up to 5 on rare occasions.\n\nNow I love my high level of independence, but yeah, the first year was really tough.",
