  "text": "I have an interview for a PhD position soon and I\u2019ve been looking up questions to ask PIs to find out about their lab.\n\nHowever, it seems like a lot of the questions out there assume that the PI has established history working with grad students. And the PI I will be interviewing with is completely new (tenure track asst prof), literally will be starting this year from their post doc. \n\nSo their lab/mentorship style is not established at this point, what questions would be good to sus these out or determine if we would work well together as I can\u2019t rely on prior history?
