  "text": "Okay I spend a lot of energy and time doing a PhD under a student salary. About to start a post-doc in a week. And hopefully a tenure track position after the postdoc. The thought of postdoc life being even more stressful than PhD life is so scary to me. And then the pre-tenure hectic life! How do you compare these stages of your career? Is it going to just get more stressful and stressful and more work for the next 8-10 years until I get tenured (if I am lucky)?",

Less stressful in that I know if things are not working out I can get a good job doing something interesting. This is freeing in a way, at least to me. However, I also find the postdoc to be more stressful than a phd in the following way: if you have a mediocre PhD, you will still be able to get a good postdoc and do good work. If you have a mediocre or subpar postdoc, that likely means you won\u2019t be able to get a tenured position (unless you wanna do a second postdoc).  \n\nOutside of that though I find the postdoc stage to be scientifically more fun, and I have better work life balance now.\n\nAll of this though is with a great postdoc mentor.

Stress due to the expectations/worry of getting papers to be competitive on the TT track one day. Better work/life balance because I was more efficient at the experiments + saved time.  Still had late nights of working, but less frequently. Great colleagues made the work easier + kept up with the stress outlets.  \n\n\nAssistant Professor- More stressful than postdoc, but from different sources. Not too far into the process now, but advice from many senior PIs has been to enjoy it, because more administrative things get piled on after tenure, and you get less time to enjoy the science.   \n\n\nUnsolicited advice? Embrace whatever stage you're at and find the fun in it. There will be stress no matter what, and it escalates at each stage. But you become better at handling it, the pay raises reduce some worries (student pay and levels of debt are obscene). Find good colleagues and good people outside of science.

PhD was way more stressful than pre-tenure, and now that I'm post-tenure my life is pretty chill. Don't get me wrong, I still have to work long hours sometimes but everything feels very low pressure. I could really screw up one or two semesters and probably still get promoted.\n\nBad news is we've had pay freezes four of the last five years and my publication record is probably not competitive enough to get a TT job elsewhere. Good news is I'm set to meet my research requirements for full professor by the end of this year (four years early), I teach the same courses every year and they're all prepped at this point, and I've got a ton of service on my record. Looking forward to being deadwood starting in August. My wife and I are trying for a kiddo and the plan is for me to be the primary caregiver, and I'm stoked about that. \n\nEventually I want to figure out some side gigs to pad my income, but I'm doing okay financially, mostly due to the fact that business professors have higher salaries, and that I've got a rent controlled apartment and a 15-year-old Honda CRV. My wife's income is decent as well.\n\nI'm not the badass researcher I dreamed of being in grad school, but I haven't set a wake-up alarm in about seven years, and since we're doing committee meetings virtually now I only have to be on campus twice a week.

The majority of stress depends on the lab environment - as a grad student, my lab was small (as in, I was the only student for nearly two years) and I had a high-maintenance micro-managing PI who spent all of their time in the lab, which naturally meant I was expected to as well. Now that I'm a postdoc in a larger lab with more reliable funding, I have much more control over my schedule and my work-life balance is actually balanced. I've taken up other hobbies that I simply wouldn't have been able to do before, but I still can get my work done at lab. That's not to say there isn't stress, and some weeks are more stressful than others, but I think that comes with most jobs.",

      "text": ">Is it going to just get more stressful and stressful and more work for the next 8-10 years until I get tenured (if I am lucky)?\n\nMy spouse and I have both found that our PhD and postdocs were roughly equal in terms of time, energy, and stress. That time, energy, and stress are all magnified substantially as pre-tenure STEM faculty at an R1. From what we have observed and heard from post-tenure profs, the stress, effort, and workload **does not** decrease at all after receiving tenure. Sure, you don't have to worry about getting tenure anymore, but there are still stringent research and teaching expectations that you are evaluated on annually (and a university-level post-tenure review every 5 years), your administrative commitments keep increasing, and the number of grants, pubs, grad students, student/staff lab workers, classes, committees, etc. that you have to manage is such that your glass is permanently overflowing. A reasonable work-life balance is very difficult to achieve -- 40 hour work weeks simply do not exist. Most faculty I know have hundreds of hours of leave built up that they are never able to use. Burnout is a very real thing. It seems many people have the idea that academic life will get easier post-tenure but that is not at all true for many faculty. I don't say all this scare you, but it is important to know what you are getting into before jumping into tenure-track academia -- it is not something everyone will be happy with. For all these reasons (and more), I left the tenure track and now work in upper level research admin (where I evaluate faculty productivity as one aspect of my job, so I know what is required for faculty to meet university expectations), where I am very happy. Two TT profs was just too much for our family to handle, and I was not happy. \n\nAll that being said, I wish you the best of luck with your new postdoc! It was the best time for us -- the flexibility, work-life balance, and pay was better than PhD or professor jobs, and it may be the last time you get to focus all your energy on research. Once you're a faculty member, most of your research will be done by grad students while you spend most of your time doing admin stuff...",

          "text": "> From what we have observed and heard from post-tenure profs, the stress, effort, and workload does not decrease at all after receiving tenure.\n\nI'm a senior full professor now (at an SLAC) and I'd say this is mostly true...the existential stress of \"will I lose my job?\" goes away with tenure, which is nice, but the service workload almost always increases. On my campus, at least, it's the tenured associates that do 75% of the major service work since our committee structures usually require tenured members-- and we protect pre-tenure faculty from burdensome service as a general practice. As one climbs the ladder post-tenure there are also more expectations for mentoring junior faculty, perhaps chairing a department or program, involvement in hiring, and with us at least seemingly endless ad hoc committees that end up taking over 1/2 of your professional life for months (or years) at a time...like gen ed curriculum reform.\n\nIf you are content with a career as an associate the pressure to publish drops away at that point, but if you want to even earn promotion to full (which comes with a substantial raise, vs the token one for associates) you have to crank out pubs *and* carry a heavy service load *and* demonstrate \"excellence in teaching\" on my campus. Personally I never worked as hard or as much as I did in the years between promotion to associate and promotion to full. Only after the file was in for full did I finally feel like I could relax a bit, take a summer completely off every few years, and perhaps say \"no\" when the provost asked me to chair some committee.\n\nOnce promoted to full things are a bit different, in that it's a relatively small portion of our faculty (maybe 20% of TT?) and the hurdle is pretty steep. Afterward some folks move into admin or partial-admin lines, earn more money, but give up their free time. Others really buckle down and publish, or take on campus leadership roles, etc. But some also take it as license to relax entirely...those are the least-stressed (and perhaps least-liked) faculty on campus.",

Got a _ton_ of research done, even though I did a lot of teaching (as a TA) as well. At times very stressful. But ultimately a positive experience. Job market woes very stressful for obvious reasons (graduated in 2010, after the market had cratered). Poverty-level income contributed to stress. \n\n* Postdoc \u2014 Much more flexibility, used it to be very productive as a researcher/writer. Not as stressful as the PhD. I was able to take my time to \"grow into myself\" as an independent scholar, separate from my grad program. Relatively relaxing, except for the time limit. Job market a bit stressful but somehow not as bad as when I was just a PhD (probably because I was being paid a decent wage, and that makes life a little easier).\n\n* Pre-tenure: very busy, not as productive, many more responsibilities than as a postdoc or PhD student. Somehow have to fit research into all of those new responsibilities (teaching, service, etc.). Very hectic. Bad work/life balance, and the \"work\" was not always the parts of the work that I enjoyed. Always hustling for new opportunities, and trying to navigate institutional politics. Had to get my book done under the deadline, had to finish up the tenure file, etc. \u2014 stressful. \n\n* Post-tenure: Just entered this phase, so ask me again in a few years. But so far: my service responsibilities have gone up (new committees, program director, mentoring pre-tenure people, etc.), my teaching has gone down (buy-outs and course releases), my research is probably less productive in some senses, but my projects are not focused on short-term, \"get it into the tenure file\" outcomes, but more long-term, \"what I want to do\" sorts of things. Generally less stressful than pre-tenure, even though it's probably harder than ever to get the research work done. I do make more time for the \"life\" side of work/life than I did before, though. I don't worry about institutional politics. Money not a pressing issue anymore, which makes some things a lot easier/less stressful (a lot of stressful problems can be avoided by throwing money at them, like tax prep). (Some of these things, like money, weren't overnight things; you can think of it as a gradual transition from pre-tenure to tenure in that respect.)",

      "text": "Since tenure, being able not to worry about stability is obviously nice. But this also comes with: 1) increased worries about the well-being of other people, and their interactions with each other (much like parenting); 2) increased worries about funding on a larger scale; 3) committees and red tape and general bullshit that I previously could have ignored; 4) I'm not getting any younger, and somehow teaching classes is more strenuous than hiking.",

      "text": "PhD - Constant higher level stress about uncertainty of maybe not getting a position. Feeling like I need to do more to improve my chances of getting a position. Working second job and doing consulting out of need to pay bills and fear that I will have no position. Writing papers, doing data work, meetings, teaching etc. Feeling pressure to do good work on tasks for/with more senior people.\n\nAssistant Prof so far - Lower level consistent stress about winning big grants and placing big important work for myself and the students I work with. Stress dulls more as more work comes out and grants fall in line. Some personal research tasks to do that are much harder, but much less time spent doing research tasks for more senior people so the net time is similar. More meetings about nothing. Doing more consulting because I have more free time and it's pretty fun!\n\nSo far for me, as a new AP, I am finding being a professor substantially less stressful and it is easier to get more papers out. I think it's because I don't have a second job, have a position, and have more autonomy. I didn't do a postdoc, so can't speak to that. But I still made time to watch as many creature features as possible in both stages haha.",

      "text": "I am a postdoc at Harvard Medical School. Compared to my PhD program, I find that it is a lot less stressful. I enjoy that the focus is entirely on the science and there isn\u2019t the distraction of program requirements (i.e., comps, committee meetings, etc.). It also helps that I\u2019m paid a lot more than I was as a grad student! \n\nI recently got a job offer, but up until that point, there was always the creeping anxiety associated with needing to find a job and wondering whether I might not have funding for the next year. I didn\u2019t feel that way in grad school since TAships were always a fallback if there wasn\u2019t money for an RAship. \n\nHope that helps.",

      "text": "Postdoc was some of the best and productive years;  you are no longer being pulled in 20 directions and engaged in the hard task constantly learning.   I was on a T32 and they protected us well and told us our job was to publish and to start learning the grant game.  I still learned a lot but it was much more focused and somewhat more self-directed.  I taught myself some cool statistical approaches. I ended up stayed on after my 2-year postdoc as a junior investigator for another 4 years.  The only hard part was that I was tied to one mentor for better or worse.  At times, it was worse; but you learn to navigate through that. \n\nThen I got a TT job and that was incredible.  Truly my own boss and could pursue whatever I wanted.  That amount of freedom was awesome but I quickly learned I only have so much bandwidth and can only focus on 2-3 at a time.  My tenure process was manageable, but expectations were not sky high either.",

Less security (since it's shorter), higher stakes (need to demonstrate innovation and independence while also applying for jobs) and also less support (paid more, but fewer student resources).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe pros- I get to lead my own research programs, and write my own grants to do a broader range of work than before. Getting paid more is really nice (I even bought a small house, got chickens, a second pup)- but I have far less personal time. When I was doing my PhD it was just the single topic. I'm doing the equivalent of two PhDs and a MS currently. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor reference- I work in biology.",
