  "text": "Hi. I plan on applying for PhD right after my non thesis masters. I feel like I should insert a proper thesis masters in between but I can also pursue PhD already. I feel like I lack most of the lab training necessary to pursue PhD hence my need of another proper masters with thesis. What do you guys think? Is the experience one of the main reasons why people go for masters first before PhD? What are the other reasons?\n\nIf you are wondering why I am taking a non thesis masters first before going for thesis masters, please check my previous [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/rgr85n/i_am_required_by_my_school_to_take_a_masters/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).",

      "text": "In my field (computer science), reasons to get a M.S. before Ph.D. include:\n\n1. changing field (undergrad was not comp sci or comp engineering)\n2. not yet sure if want Ph.D. or go into industry\n3. not sure what area of CS interested in researching in (need more time to explore advanced classes in different areas to determine interest)\n4. undergrad work not strong enough to get into Ph.D. program (or at least not one of the level you're hoping for)...  M.S. studies can give an opportunity to work on research with a faculty advisor, if you didn't get to do so as an undergrad.  (That in turn can also get you a better recommendation letter, etc.)  --  Note that going to an M.S. program and continuing to do nothing but classes will probably not net you much over your nothing-but-classes undergrade -- the point is a chance to do more than just classes.\n5. ...maybe other reasons...?  Not claiming this list is exhaustive!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut, if you're sure you want the Ph.D., have a strong enough application to get admitted to a school you're happy with, and know at least what general area you want to specialize in, then I don't see much reason not to go straight for the Ph.D.  (at least in the field of computer science)",

Usually PhD programs are longer in that case though. Mine is 5 years, so although I don\u2019t have a master\u2019s degree the first 2 years of my PhD were essentially a master\u2019s without a title.",

It is my understanding that university professors are hired first and foremost for their research output and secondarily for their teaching credentials. Unless you are planning to teach at a really small school or a community college (bless you if you are, the world needs more quality community college professors), life as a university professor might not be all you may think it is.",

As I understand, in my field (math) many smaller liberal arts colleges are okay with a Masters rather than a PhD for lecturers. Also worth noting that math education is an entire area of research on its own. I do not know how common it is to have education as a full branch of the field's research, but if you have to do a PhD, you may be able to fit an education theme into the work.\n\nOne thing I can certainly say: If already think you do not want to do a PhD, it is not a good idea to do one unless you can find someway to be excited about it.",

An MA gives you experience with research, fields and methods of study, and allows you to make an informed decision. \n\nThe vast majority of people I knew who didn\u2019t finish their PhDs left for personal reasons like family, losing interest, money, time commitment, etc. A master\u2019s allows you to decide if the PhD is worth sacrificing for or not. Plus, a master\u2019s is often quick and fun. If you hate it, you can be done soon and get out with an advanced degree. Not so much with a PhD\u2026",
