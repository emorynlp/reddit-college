  "text": "I\u2019m a postdoc in STEM in the US and this a throwaway because I expect to catch some slack and quite frankly deserve it.\n\nI feel bad about this, but I\u2019m jealous of one of my colleagues\u2019 situation and can\u2019t help it. She is what is commonly called a \u201ctrailing spouse\u201d. Recently I found out that she and her husband are both starting as assistant professors at an R1 institution. The problem is, she has only one first author paper from both the PhD and 4+ years as postdoc. This is absolutely not a track record that gets anybody in my field assistant professor interviews. Her husband is pretty impressive though and I suspect this was a concession to get him.\n\nThis job is literally a dream of mine. I would go to the ends of the earth just to get a lab, a modest startup and an ability to sole-PI grants (which are all things she got judging by twitter posts). I get that I\u2019m being quite possibly sexist right now, but I am also a woman, I\u2019m just uncommitted. I made a conscious choice not to date in grad school and postdoc because career and geographic mobility came first.\n\nPlease don\u2019t @me with industry job evangelizing. I have transferable skills and could probably do well in the private sector. TT job at an R1 is the dream because of complete intellectual freedom in what I research and how I run my group.",

      "text": "I spent 9 years in postdocs and fixed term teaching contracts before I landed a permanent faculty role in the UK. In that time I saw students *that I had taught while I was a PhD student* go through and get permanent faculty positions. I saw people with worse teaching and research experience than me get positions. I saw people end up on projects that ended up getting unexpected nature papers and immediate hires into permanent roles. I saw skilled, talented, and well published people drag on in postdocs for years before making their escape elsewhere, and I saw outstanding future researchers nope-out of the whole thing immediately on getting their PhDs. \n\nI think half the problem is the people genuinely think this whole process is a meritocracy. It isn't, and it has never been. There is a huge amount of luck; you need to be on projects that turn out to be productive, you need to be on projects that are timed right such that their output is picked up and relevant to the wider field. You need to be hitting the job market at the right time for the right jobs to be coming available. You need the right universities to be looking for the right applicants in just the right niche at just the right time. \n\nGetting bitter about other peoples success in such a luck-based system is a total waste of your time. You may as well get angry that someone rolled a higher number on a pair of dice than you did. Be happy that they succeeded, and carry on plugging away. Or cut your losses. Whatever you feel works best for you.",

          "text": "While I agree with you that much is based on luck, a few other things are not. First, something that if often not spoken about, but which is very significant, is the system of favors along networks in which people with specific advisers or from specific institutions get favored, even if they don't have as good a research record as others who might not be as well connected. And second, policies leading to cuts in education (affecting different countries in different ways) mean that fixed positions become fewer and fewer, making hire processes increasingly problematic and non-transparent when every position is flooded with applications and under this pressure a lot of irregular, random and sometimes unethical stuff goes on. I'm in the social sciences and it really annoys me how people who claim to understand society are governed by elitism and nepotism rather than merit and scientific integrity, apparently without being conscious of it (or at least never mentioning it in public). I agree with you that op might want to keep trying, but perhaps she should also play the connection game and call in any favors she has coming to her. It's unethical, but her competition is going to do it, so she might as well, if she is going to compete on any kind of level field.",

What about kids born to wealthy families and whose parents are \"legacies\" in an Ivy League school, giving them all kinds of entry points for such networks, versus kids who are the first of their family to go to college, don't have any family network or wealth to use to make connections, and go to a state college? I personally don't think it is ethical that we reward moderately competent rich kids more than smart working class kids who have had to work much harder to get where they are. But sure, I don't tell my students to try to change the inertia of the system, I tell them that realistically they are going to need to play the game of connections and networks.",

Academia is very, very obsessed with brand. That Harvard, Yale, Princeton, etc degree in and of itself is considered evidence of having a great track record, and in and of itself is considered a superior qualification. \n\n  \n\n\"The evidence is not only anecdotal. A recent study by Aaron Clauset, Samuel Arbesman, and Daniel B. Larremore shows that \u201ca quarter of all universities account for 71 to 86 percent of all tenure-track faculty in the U.S. and Canada in these three fields.

The number of faculty within an academic unit (number of faculty hired, that is, the unit\u2019s size) is also skewed, with some units being two to three times larger than others. Business schools are especially large, generally containing several internal departments, with a mean size of 70 faculty members who received their doctorates from other within-sample units, whereas computer science and history have mean sizes of 21 and 29, respectively (see Supplementary Materials). The differences in size within a discipline, however, cannot explain the observed differences in placements.\nhttps://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/1/e1400005",

And yet, a small handful of universities are STILL overrepresented: \n\nFor example: \n\"The top 20 percent of institutions account for 86 percent of the articles, while the top ten PhD-granting institutions, which represent less than 3 percent of all institutions in our data set, account for just over half (51.3 percent) of all articles published. As we can see in table 1, authors with PhDs from Yale, Harvard, University of California\u2013Berkeley, Columbia University, University of Chicago, Cornell University, Stanford University, Princeton University, Johns Hopkins University, and Oxford University wrote 2,729 of 5,259 articles.\"\n\nhttps://criticalinquiry.uchicago.edu/publication_power_and_patronage_on_inequality_and_academic_publishing/\n\n\nIn the humanities, you can get an article published without having spent a thin dime on research. (I know I did. Several times.)  So we can't say that money is the variable here.  Rather, I think it is reasonable to conclude that the relevant variable is simply the power of the brand name of one's institutional affiliation. And as someone who has been the managing editor on an academic journal, I have anecdotal evidence to support this as well. \n\nI would argue that a system that continues to place graduates from the same handful of schools in 60-80% of the tenured roles is not one we should support, regardless of how \"diverse\" those graduates are.

The top 20 percent of institutions account for 86 percent of the articles, while the top ten PhD-granting institutions, which represent less than 3 percent of all institutions in our data set, account for just over half (51.3 percent) of all articles published. As we can see in table 1, authors with PhDs from Yale, Harvard, University of California\u2013Berkeley, Columbia University, University of Chicago, Cornell University, Stanford University, Princeton University, Johns Hopkins University, and Oxford University wrote 2,729 of 5,259 articles.\n\n[https://criticalinquiry.uchicago.edu/publication\\_power\\_and\\_patronage\\_on\\_inequality\\_and\\_academic\\_publishing/](https://criticalinquiry.uchicago.edu/publication_power_and_patronage_on_inequality_and_academic_publishing/)\n\nand here is the InsideHigherEd's writeup of this paper:\n\n[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/01/20/study-suggests-top-humanities-journals-favor-research-elite-institutions](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/01/20/study-suggests-top-humanities-journals-favor-research-elite-institutions)\n\nAnd another article from InsideHigherEd:\n\n\"Over coffee last month, a friend described a difference in his reception on the academic job market after he secured an Ivy League postdoc. He told me that, while his middle-tier institutional affiliation cracked a few doors, sending out applications on Ivy League letterhead busted them open.\n\nThat\u2019s when it struck me: he\u2019d laundered his degree. His credentials hadn\u2019t changed, really. (He\u2019d published over a half dozen articles before going on the job market the first time.) But he\u2019d overcome a prestige deficit by switching letterheads.\n\nThis story shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone with a stake in the tenure-track job market. Prestige, after all, is the hemoglobin in the bloodstream of academic value. We\u2019re all familiar with a version of the academic placement truism that \u201cuniversities don\u2019t hire down.\u201d Highly ranked programs hire their own, those aspiring to be highly ranked hire from the ranks of those already on top and so on\"\n\n[https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2017/08/10/conversation-about-class-and-professoriate-essay](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2017/08/10/conversation-about-class-and-professoriate-essay)\n\nAnd here's another one:\n\n[https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/03/how-prestige-shapes-professoriate](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/03/how-prestige-shapes-professoriate)\n\nHere's another one:\n\n[https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-the-Academic-Elite/241374](https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-the-Academic-Elite/241374)\n\nAnd another one about academia's prestige problem:\n\n[https://www.chronicle.com/article/Academe-s-Prestige-Problem/241432](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Academe-s-Prestige-Problem/241432)\n\nI dunno, it's very much an open secret that academia has a prestige problem.

I\u2019m NTT in a dying field and since my market is in the single digits (not exaggerating), I\u2019m very proud of the long-term, well paid NTT position I landed. I\u2019m the last one in my department who landed anything at all\nin academia since graduating 5 years ago, and I got this without any connection or help. It\u2019s not what I trained for nor what I dreamt when I was a grad student, but I\u2019m pretty happy with it. Now, there are at least 3 trailing spouses in my department who got hired on the TT or as VAPs because their wives/husbands, who happen to be in a much more marketable field or in senior roles, basically pulled strings. They had abysmal records compared to mine when they started, but they get to call themselves  \u201cresearch faculty\u201d with the grand total of 2 articles published, or teach 5 seniors in a vanity seminar that our program doesn\u2019t really need, while I carry the load of teaching large courses at the intro level, and the department wants me to do it because I actually do a decent job, take my work seriously, and have kept the enrollments healthy against the odds. I feel like a work horse during the semester, between training  inexperienced TAs and grading hundreds of assignments, and finding the time to craft high quality, rigorous, innovative materials. \nIt would be easy for me to just spend my days pining over the unfairness of this, but I ultimately came to realize I would just be poisoning my own life. Whether or not I stew over this, the \u201cundeserving\u201d trailing spouses will still have their cushy jobs. So I choose to focus on my own career goals instead, and try to make choices that work for me and my family.\nBeing on the academic market was one of the most frustrating and unfair experiences I\u2019ve had In my entire life. I\u2019ve been on it and it nearly killed me. My husband was on it and he eventually gave up and left academia altogether. Such a soul-crushing endeavor can turn even the kindest person  into a jealous, caustic, spiteful jerk. Try to keep your sanity. Stay away from the comparisons--it\u2019s a toxic way of thinking that won\u2019t do anything for your wellbeing or career. Cultivate other thoughts, don\u2019t let the tunnel vision engulf the totality of your days. You will be a better scholar, a better person and a better researcher for this. \nBest of luck in your academic job search, I really hope it works out for you.",

If not, it's maybe not the best place for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone here, those who are in academia as much as those who are trying to get in, have lived through similar situations, and as a woman myself, and as someone who has been in academia for 20 plus years, my advice to you is to not build resentment over it, because if you start like this as a post-doc, what will it be in twenty years?",

Maybe she doesn't have the same quality paper you do but it is possible that she made a good job interview presentation and was liked by the university department. Maybe she had good research ideas and capacity to attract funding. It is easy to feel jealous and I get you. But don't compare yourself to others that much. Cut that lady some slack and cut some tou yourself too. Make sure you are on the competition. And if things come to that, leave academia and do not look behind.",

She started getting amazing grades in several classes he was a TA in and later on she got the award for the best student of the generation despite me having a better track record in both studies, extracurricular activities and research. (Can you guess who was the one dropping off applications from our studies to the committee?) I submitted a complaint to the University committee and we ended up sharing the award. There were other situations in which I could not do anything about the situation of the person who I felt negatively for, and the only solution is to let go and focus on yourself.\n\nWhat I also genuinely can say is that I wish you the best of luck (since that is apparently one magical ingredient) in getting a professorship position with all the freedom and funding you could possibly want.",
