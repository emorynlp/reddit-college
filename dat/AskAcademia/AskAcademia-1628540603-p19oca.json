  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI  have less than 2 months to complete my qualitative dissertation and I'm struggling.  I've completed a first draft of my introduction and have 2 thirds of the lit review done. But the methodology and data collection are just figments of my imagination.\n\nI'm contemplating on using Grad Coach ([https://my.gradcoach.com/pricing/coaching/](https://my.gradcoach.com/pricing/coaching/)) but they are pricey and I don't want to get swindled.\n\nHas anyone used their service or the like and have any guidance?\n\nThanks",
