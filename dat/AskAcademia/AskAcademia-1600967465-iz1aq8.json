      "text": "I would always rather a student come to office hours and get the support they need to succeed in the class than struggle and not come to office hours.\n\nI can guarantee you that every professor would also rather have a student come to office hours and get the passing grade they need rather than never come to office hours and send an email at the end of the semester saying \"I really need a C+ in the class, can you bump me up?\"\n\nYou want a certain grade in a difficult class, and you are putting in the work to get it. You are doing the right things.\n\n(It does sound like this professor has an open door policy and you're using that, as stated. If he has specific office hours, too, you might try to make an effort to stop by at those times, if you're available, rather than at other times on those days. But I wouldn't feel bad about using his policy as advertised.)",

              "text": "Just a thought here, although it might not apply to you at all - so please don't feel like i'm assuming what your situation was/is. \n\nI'm not a professor, but from years of tutoring different subjects but especially math - a lot of students become dependent on the kinds of exchanges we had when i was tutoring them. When that happens, it stops being a good idea for them to get help from me. \n\nIt's not that i'm \"tired of them\" even though some thought that. And in fact, some of these want to pay me really well for my time, so i personally would stand to gain from just doing it. \n\nBut i was never really interested in that. I'm studying medicine and have part time jobs in research and they pay much better. I like seeing people learn and get past their obstacles, that's the reason i do it. For the same reason i stopped taking the students who just had parents who wanted them to do better. Although they also paid better generally, it just doesn't feel great to help someone reach the goals of other people.\n\nIn many subjects, but math especially so, most of the magic happens invisibly, and from the work you do alone. This element of invisibility can make it hard for the student to feel the necessary gratification that \"keeps the train rolling\" getting you to the next station of competency. \n\nOne handle you can use when teaching someone and they lack positive experiences, is to structure the work and interaction in such a way that it becomes more apparent to them how much they learn/progress. BUT this is what gets dangerous, because they might become conditioned to this gratification coming and if they don't \"see\" it when by themselves, they associate the positive forward movements with being in a room with you. That really sucks, because as we know that's not where they really learn math. \n\nI've stopped working with two students for this reason. I liked them both very much and wanted them to succeed very deeply, but i felt like it was no longer working in their favor.\n\n\nJust a slightly different perspective, as i said, may well not be applicable to your situation at all.",

      "text": "I am not faculty, but when I was a student this really annoyed me only if it started eating into other's people time. I remember taking a course when I was a grad student that had about 20 people in it. The professor only had open office hours for 2 days a week for one hour. There was this student that would literally go to it every single time and use up about half an hour or more of the one hour time which was really annoying.\n\nBut tbh I would say keep doing what you're doing if you need help in the class. If you start eating into other people's time or if other students arent able to come to office hours because you are there, I would expect the professor to talk to you about it. But if other students arent getting affected, then I see no good reason the prof should be annoyed.",

I was like WTF? No. Go read the lecture notes or the textbook, try to solve the problems for a while and if you are stuck, I am happy to help then. If I realize the students didn't try to solve -even read ffs- the problems on their own and just came in to get answers, I become extremely unhelpful and they are gone in a few minutes.\n\nI also had students come and ask me to explain 10 lectures worth of material. \"Hey can you explain chapters 2-3-4-5-6...?\" No. Go study on your own and ask me your specific questions.\n\n(I guess my school is not selective at all because I get these kinds of students all the time. I actually know someone who hates office hours because of these questions so he used to hold them at 7am at a coffee house near campus.)\n\nIf a student came to my office literally everyday, I would get annoyed. But I wouldn't have an open office policy with UG students in the first place so I am not sure what he might feel.",

That would be a nice opportunity to gently say something like, well you know, why don't you see how far you can get on your own until Wednesday.",

Come in with your 3 most important questions.  When those questions are answered say thank you and leave.  A productive time is not annoying, an ongoing small talk chat while asking questions is draining.  A student being proactive is good.  A student being co-dependent on the faculty member is not good, it's borderline creepy.",

Most students in the class severely dislike it and don't want to put that much effort into learning, so every semester I get sparse and inconsistent attendance in office hours, even among students that report benefiting greatly from office hours. One summer there were a few students who attended nearly every single office hours every day. I think they each missed maybe two or three days out of about 30 total, asked good questions, and gained a lot of confidence in the course throughout the semester, since they started off fairly rough. \n\nI'm not often impressed by students in this class, but the work ethic of these few students really surprised me. I'm normally very uncomfortable to write a recommendation letter since I'm just a TA, but I ended up happily writing one for one of those students.",
