  "text": "I'm just burned out, tired, and feel like a failure. My mom (suicide), step-father and my cat died during my PhD but I kept pushing forward anyway. Severe burnout, health issues (currently on medication), changing advisors, and a pandemic later and I am losing my TT job at the end of spring 2022.\n\nI don't know what I should do and don't really have people to talk to. I feel worthless and don't know what else I could do. Who would want to hire me? I know I shouldn't think this way but I am just completely at a breaking point.\n\nHas anyone been through this? What did you do? I could use some inspiration and guidance.",

The trauma and emotional distress you have suffered during this period should be dealt with and you need to take time to reset. Your school will no doubt give you the time you need to seek counselling and spend some to adjust. Go to the admin office and seek guidance for taking a break, but don\u2019t give up.",

If you're less than 50% by now and you've spent the last 5 years working on the dissertation (assuming 2 years for the MA, then it's 3 years pre-pandemic and 2 years pandemic and personal issues; US Academic Institutional norms)) you may find that you don't really want to finish and taking a break may end that part of your path in life. But if you are 1, 1 1/2 chapters away from finishing, you really want to consider the break - recovery - return process u/Dark_DoubleD mentions above.\n\nThe fact that you've gotten this far into a ph.d. program means you have value and you will be marketable, it may just take you time, energy, and networking to transition out of academia.\n\nAlso, don't let your advisors or other \"scholars\" at your institution *push you* into trying to finish. At the end of the day, you need to ultimately do what's best for you.\n\nYou're certainly not worthless.\n\nEDIT: to fix math above",

              "text": "Thank you, I really appreciate both you and Dark\\_DoubleD's guidance. To clarify, due to many issues in the program (which has had to change since then) no student while I was there finished comps/courses until the end of their 3rd year. I had mostly been working on topic ideas during my 3rd year and then my advisor left. In my 4th year I started with a new advisor and a different topic. So that was 2 years working with him during the program and 1 year while working in a full-time teaching position (3/3) during a pandemic. I am half done with the dissertation so far.\n\nMy advisor is pretty open to going forward with the dissertation, but I'm just not sure if I can do it. If i do take a break I look at the possibility of retaking classes and possibly comps. Thus for me I don't know if it is something I can do mentally. \n\nThe stories from others mentioning post-doc positions and going into industry and returning to academia make me hopeful. I am just really scared and depressed at the moment, which adds to my mental burden.",

I haven't heard of that before and hope it isn't the case because that would be nutso of your institution. I would ask your advisor/ department chair and figure that out for sure.\n\nIn addition, I would talk with your advisor about how you're feeling. Hopefully they can offer some support and guidance. Afterall, their guidance isn't for research only.\n\nYou've been through hard times and dealt with a lot of loss. You deserve to take some time to rest and grieve.\n\nThat being said, being halfway done with the dissertation ain't nothin! In fact you're very very close. And you're not worthless whether you finish it or whether you leave now and never look back. There is more to life than dissertations and tenure. \n\nI am wishing you the absolute best!",

Her passing was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back and it sent me completely off the deep end.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what options you have through your University but I took a leave of absence and changed my study rate to part time on my return so that I could deal with my dad\u2019s continuing ill health and not have to worry about my research getting left behind. \n\nIf you\u2019re not already seeing a therapist I\u2019d strongly recommend you do. You need to have someone to talk to about what you\u2019ve been through. You are not worthless, in fact you are unbelievably strong to have continued through all of the awful, traumatic events that have happened during the course of your PhD.

      "text": "Okay so we have very similar circumstances by the sound of things. I lost my dad and gran to illness, multiple friends to suicide, was in an abusive relationship, assaulted and had terrible supervision through my PhD (info in previous posts on my page). Similarly to how I imagine you are feeling now, my extenuating circumstances were so intense that I struggled to find solace in anyone around me because I had so much more going on externally that they did (not to invalidate them, just to contextualise). I fought aggressively for 5 years to the detriment of my own well-being to finish, and passed my viva on Tuesday (minor corrections). I can't tell you what is the right thing for you to do, but I will say that you should at least try to remove yourself from the \"whole would want to hire me\" mindset. I have no papers, at all, and was hired for a postdoc role before I'd even submitted my thesis. I will say, being a Dr feels incredible, but if I had my time over again I think I would have quit, at the very least taken a hiatus. I had my first day off in more than 3 years yesterday (and I mean every calendar day, Christmas, weekends, the lot). If you want to talk, I'm more than happy to listen in DMs :)\n\nAlso edit to say: don't forget in all of this that you deserve to be a Dr. 2/3 of my experimental work included in my thesis was from what I have done in the past year. Perhaps you already have the content in front of you, and just need to look at it with a new set of eyes and can put it together as is, modifying the story a bit?\n\nAnother edit: the thing that really has helped my deal with the damage my PhD has done is the circus arts and burlesque community. Honestly cannot recommend either enough, and they seem to end up full of stressed PhD students, they can be a really comforting space.",

                      "text": "Cybersecurity is a very broad field. It's exactly as broad as all of tech, since every part of tech has security risk.\n\nThere are lots of entry points but very few genuine entry level roles. I would categorize security roles in 4 broad categories, though specific roles may span multiple categories: operations (operating stuff), engineering (building stuff), research (studying stuff), and leadership.\n\nSecurity operations, for example, might include network or system security administration, defensive teams, security analysts. They are tasked with the day to day configuration, deployment, testing, operation, and administration of hardware and software assets. Skills required include IT skills, understanding of networking, active directory, use of security tools, and so on.\n\nSecurity engineering might include security engineers, cloud security engineers, or application security engineers. Often they work closely with software or hardware engineering teams to make sure the organization's products are secure. They may do a lot of testing and designing security solutions for vulnerabilities in the products. Deep programming skills and understanding of systems and software/hardware architecture are required.\n\nSecurity research is quite broad. I work in the threat research space. I study what adversaries are doing in cyberspace, think about how to detect and mitigate their attacks, and help build products to do that (so I do a tiny bit of engineering too). I work closely with threat intelligence researchers who attempt to identify and track who the adversaries are, who they target, and what sorts of techniques they like to use. My former team was in the vulnerability research space. Since research is so broad, it's hard to list specific technical skills needed.\n\nSecurity leadership is also very broad.\n\nRoles that clearly span these categories might include SecDevOps, penetration testing, or digital forensics and incident response. It might be some combination of operations and engineering, operations and research, operations and leadership, or whatever.\n\nUnfortunately, like academia, there really aren't any true entry level cybersecurity roles. All the roles are specialized in some way. You'll need to develop general computing skills and knowledge -- programming, networking, operating systems -- to start with and you'll need to figure out what area you want to focus on and develop skills specific to that space. Research roles probably make the most sense for someone who has been through a PhD program, as lots of those soft skills in research transfer over nicely. That seems to have helped me.",

      "text": "Did my dissertation in business almost done 15 years ago.  What is your field?  How long do you anticipate your dissertation being?

I see getting through collection and analysis as the \u201chump\u201d, if you\u2019re past the hump, I suggest taking a short break and pushing forward.  You\u2019ve invested so much and if you\u2019ve gotten this far, I have to believe, despite all your troubles, that you can do it :-) I was really fortunate during my dissertation stage to have some great emotional support.  Do you have a strong support system?",
