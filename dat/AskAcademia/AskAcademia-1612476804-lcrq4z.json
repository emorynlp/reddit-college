  "title:": "Why did I pursue a PhD if it has not led to any opportunities?",
  "text": "I\u2019m feeling pretty down at the moment. I\u2019ve been applying to TT jobs for a few years and have gotten no luck. I received my PhD from an average state school in 2015 and have had two relatively fruitful postdocs the last 5 years. I\u2019ve published 10 papers in mid-tier journals. Yet it\u2019s all been for nothing. I can\u2019t get a job for the life of me.\n\nI\u2019ve applied to probably almost 100 professor jobs with no success whatsoever. 4 year R1 schools, SLACs, and community colleges all have rejected me. I\u2019m willing to relocate anywhere in the country. There\u2019s too few jobs and I just don\u2019t cut.\n\nI\u2019m almost 35 now with a salary that an undergrad straight out of college wouldn\u2019t be thrilled with. And I\u2019ve busting my ass for more than a decade for pretty much nothing. No upside, no new or exciting opportunities, nothing. It sucks. I would have been better off teaching high school instead of trying in to break into higher ed.\n\nI\u2019ve learned the hard way that the PhD pays in prestige, but you can\u2019t eat prestige. Why did I do this to myself? Any one else feel this way?",

      "text": "Sorry to hear this. As someone who nope-d out of academia pretty much after defending, I have mixed feelings about this, but they're mostly positive.\n\nThere's a part of me that wishes that academia was what I dreamt it was, and a part of me that wishes I had succeeded, despite it being not what I had hoped.\n\nBut I don't regret anything. I went to grad school because I loved science - not for the money (lol), or the prestige, but because I loved it as a way of acquiring knowledge and learning about the world. That's still true today, and it will probably be true my whole life. \n\nFor me, that realization helped me overcome what I think a lot of people fear when they think about leaving academia: \"Will I ever be able to love something as much as this?\"\n\nAnd just like the ending of a bad relationship, despite my feelings to the contrary at the time, the answer is yes. But more importantly, it doesn't matter even if the answer is \"no\", because from what you describe, it doesn't matter how much you love academia, academia does not love you back.",

I can really relate to what your saying. My PhD experience was traumatic, and my advisor committed suicide when I was writing. I was almost booted from my program because the other major professor didn't like my topic.

Rejections are part of the game, so you even spend time writing grants that won't pay off and at least need some rewriting. The ability to get funding also greatly influences where your research will go or at least, what you'll claim you'll do. If your interests are outdated you won't get any funding, so you better always know the trending topics and basically bend your actual interests so they seem relevant or suddenly use a trending technique. And once you get funding you won't even do the work yourself in most fields. You did all that work to get your interests funded so someone else can take your idea, put their own spin on it and will do all the work.  \n\nI work in industry now and I must say the jobs my boss and my PI have aren't even that different.

My other co-chair's old advisor called him saying he needed a post-doc and asked if he had anyone to send him (my back up job).",

At the time, I wanted to teach at a SLAC and they thought I was weird. They were totally clueless about any opportunities outside of academia, despite that even then about one-third of graduates went onto non-academic careers. (Now, it's closer to two-thirds.)\n\nBut making connections - at least in academia - that was their strong suit. My advisors and mentors connected me with all kinds of other people, and they taught me how to make connections at conferences and other academic events. That's how I got my postdoc, via connections made. And to be quite honest, that was probably more valuable than any job market advice - I found a lot of the job market advice online, and they would've reviewed my materials had I decided to launch a full TT search, but my professors did not know what SLACs wanted.\n\nI ended up leaving academia, and I found my field and my job on my own with no help from my department.

Don't let them dictate the terms on which you engage - you dictate what you want your future to be like. And find opportunities globally. \n\nArts graduates make good money. If they are willing to learn new skills, work in industry, amalgamate the subject they love into the work people will pay for. They do and have for a long time had a terrible time in academia - so when you got your PhD this was the case. Why did you think you would beat the odds?\n\nTT is not the holy grail anymore. You can make yourself so sick getting there that when you do you are either bitter and twisted or so exhausted you're an empty bitter husk of who you used to be. Thirty, forty years ago Arts professors were raging and bitter. They are worse now. \n\nChanging yourself to find good work that pays doesn't mean giving up your dream or interests. It means redefining what those are. Engaging in constant skills development and understanding that you are the product someone has to pay for - what value do you bring to the table that people want?",

Many people (not only academics) don't want to retire because the pension is lower than the salary, so there is the inevitable diminishing in buying power.  \n\nFurthermore, and I think this plays a lot in academia, is loss of prestige/authority: being a professor gives you authority to speak about many subjects, even out of your area.   \nIn some countries, you have to retire at a specific age (65 is the most common) and you cannot work for the Uni in a paid position, only honorary. In the UK, that restriction does not apply, so an academic from Belgium came here to teach at LSE. While he has lots of knowledge and experience, he is getting paid a decent salary as a senior academic, that is around 60-70K. Because he gets paid that much, he won't leave unless told so and occupies two potential jobs for younger academics. Because he stays longer, those junior academics have to get more and more casual experience before landing the permanent job.",

In the University System of Georgia if you choose Teacher's Retirement when you hire on (PLEASE DO unless you're sure you're going to move out of the system...) we get 2% per year worked of the average of our 5 highest years and we can retire after 30 years (or after vesting and 10 years). And we can use up to 2 years of unused sick time toward retirement. I started to go to retirement seminars at 31 years because my wife had retired with Teacher's Retirement a couple of years before. At 32 years a young person working for Teacher's Retirement told me that I would net more retired that I was working because of deductions and my unused sick time; I had a lot taken out for my 403b as well as the standard deductions. I told him I understood that. He asked why I was still working and I told him I liked what I was doing MUCH more than the idea of retiring. As a 30-something he just didn't get it. I retired after 38 years and with 2 years of unused sick time so I get 80% of my work salary. In our system 80% is the maximum pension possible. My first retirement check was $1700 more than my last work check and I get 12 retirement checks vs. 10 work checks. I was at a SLAC and so our pay scale is substantially less than that of the University of Georgia or Georgia Tech, but it has been interesting having substantially more money in retirement than while working.",

      "text": "What you are describing is the result of the expanding federal granting program in STEM field that support doctoral student tuition and multiple post docs all overseen by a single TT professor. This was a cheap way to get the research done by talented but underpaid people. Since the TT professor is not retiring and universities are not expanding their TT faculty there are no jobs to absorb these talented people. \n\nThe only thing to do is to find another place to use your talents and love of science. Try drug companies, journal editing and science publishing, science publications for the general public, start thinking out of the box. A former doctoral student of mine became a nurse. With your science background you could get your degree in about a year. Certain nursing fields, like nurse anesthetist, can make $200K+. There are Physicians Assistants programs. You may have to go back to school but there will be a job.",

      "text": "Surely you must have some teaching or research skills of some sort? Or did you go down the path in such a way as to avoid teaching at all costs? I know some who did this - one coworker in particular treated his TA work like a joke and his students rated him with 1's and 2's on RateMyProfessor. Regardless, setting aside community college, there's also high school. I know that many people sneer at it, but personally I hate the attitude that \"Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach.\" We've all had good teachers and terrible ones. Being one is the good ones is an accomplishment, whatever the level.\n\nBut of course, a degree isn't just about teaching, and usually trains many skills. Perhaps you learned some coding or technical writing? It may just be that you're looking at the wrong jobs, or that your expectations are too high. \nTechnical writing ability is valued in research and business alike. Coding and numerical skills, whether in python or excel or something else, can also be valuable. I'm sure you have some skills you can market. You may just have to go about it in a different way.\n\nFinally, it's also tough out there right now. The economy is sagging, partly due to covid. People are struggling. Don't go to hard on yourself.",

A teacher teaching the same class in high school would have double the kids, four times the number of lessons to prepare, and no help with grading.\n\nAlso teaching high school sciences sucks. You don\u2019t get to just teach the content, like you do in college lectures. You\u2019re suddenly in charge of labs too, and need to buy all the materials, do all of the setup and cleanup for 80 kids, and work it into whatever schedule the school gives you. Plus, the classroom you get as a science teacher is usually not \u00e9quipped properly for science, so you either do experiments dangerously or don\u2019t do anything cool. I can\u2019t see someone with a chemistry PhD wanting to deal with that bullshit.\n\nThis is on top of coworkers acting like babies and toxic union culture and needing to spend nights, weekends, and breaks working and having to fight to take one of your three personal days off...

I have never ever encountered a department which lists 6-7 years as a program length. Can you maybe give me a link to such programs? The standard program duration is 5 years. Moreover, in some places (e.g. [Princeton Math](https://www.math.princeton.edu/graduate)) students are expected to be done within 4 years but may be granted one additional year as an extension.  \n\n\nAs a personal anecdote, my former advisor graduated with PhD at 25 yo and was hired into a tenure-track right away. No decade long PhDs, no postdocs. This is how the system is supposed to work. This is almost unheard of now, but it doesn't mean you're supposed to stay in school till 30 and get first permanent job at 40. This is not how it designed to work and everyone who is trying to normalize it is just fooling everyone.  \n\n\n\\> *given how many international students there are at US universities*  \n\n\nSome of them would be delighted to do 20 years long PhDs. There are students who use grad school as a way to move out of their countries and are terrified with graduation because they don't know what to do next. It doesn't apply to everyone from overseas, but you shouldn't deny PhD serves just as a ticket to America for some of them.  \n\n\n\\> *I guess we all don't value our time or whatever. shrug.*  \n\n\nI know it was a sarcasm but you got it right there.",

It may not be how the system *used* to work or even how it was originally designed to work, but it *is* how it works *now*.\n\nWho cares what program websites say? Program websites say all sorts of nice things, because they are marketing documents that are intended to entice students to apply and attend their programs. Professors and programs also say all kinds of other things that are out of touch reality, like \"don't worry, all of the old heads will be retiring soon and the job market will open up\".\n\nBut in the United States, the National Science Foundation actually keeps statistics on these things, and the average time to degree exceeds 6 years in *all* fields ([https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17306/report/what-influences-the-path-to-the-doctorate/time-to-degree.cfm](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17306/report/what-influences-the-path-to-the-doctorate/time-to-degree.cfm)). In all of the sciences, including engineering, it's about 6.7 years (so almost 7). My department's website implies that students finish within 5 years, and it has the same bs about \"being granted additional time as needed,\" but the average time to degree is actually 7.5 years (which is *not* information they share on the website). What they don't tell you is that virtually anyone who asks for the additional time gets it. I'd be interested in seeing Princeton math's actual time to degree statistics.\n\nThe travails of your former advisor are irrelevant, as academia has changed so much since he got a job. In most fields, it's very unlikely that a person will get hired right out of a PhD program into TT job. I agree with you that that is how the system was originally designed to work, but we are talking about how the system currently *is*, and it ain't that.",

But soon after the default shifted to having 1-2 years of VAP or full-time adjunct work, as search committees came to expect significant teaching experience and at least some record of publication for TT hires.  That was happening when I was coming out in fact; the only reason I got hired was that I had taught a lot of courses as instructor of record (including at multiple institutions as an adjunct) while still a graduate student.",

      "text": "In the last year of my doctorate, I saw a therapist because I was near my breaking point. I had a tenure track job offer on the table, we had a baby on the way, but my advisor was being iffy about me finishing. While I was hoping for, \"Let's do the best to get you finished,\" their response was usually something like \"We'll see if you finish\" or \"Hopefully you finish.\" My advisor even tried to get me to negotiate to start the job a year later. And I was already in my 8th year. \n\nI was lucky to have a therapist who understood grad school's stress and anxiety -- she had completed a Ph.D. as well. After several meetings around this, she sat back in her chair, didn't have her usual comforting words to share, but instead said, \"Look, this is a horrible position you're in, but you could leave this program and never deal with her again. Yes, it would be horrible to leave after all this work. But it's your choice. , it's important you realize you do have control over this situation. If you choose to stay, then that's your choice too.\" Her reframing the situation for me in that way helped me realize I had more control and agency than I realized. \n\nI know you have some work ahead of you, but I do think it's important you work to regain your agency. Rather than feeling like everything is happening to you, reflect on your choices. Those are yours to make. Sure, it's a horrible situation, and it will sting to leave academia if you decide to, but would it be better to work for less than you're worth? If you choose to stay in academia, you know (we all know), it won't be easy. I would recommend giving yourself a time limit (1 year? 2 years?)\u2014some cutoff. If you stay in academia, simultaneously explore alternate options outside of academia to find other passions you may have and start gaining experience in those areas (training certificates, workshops, talks, reading, classes, boot camps? whatever).",

She had recently lost her mother, and I suspect she was going through other issues impacting her own anxiety (she went through a divorce 2 years before I started). I know that doesn't excuse her missteps toward the end. Still, at the same time, I think part of me working through my anxiety is letting those negative feelings go (as you can tell I'm having issues with that, hah), learning from that experience, and improving as an advisor of my own students.",
