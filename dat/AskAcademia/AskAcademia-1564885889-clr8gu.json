  "text": "I know PhD students work really long hours. Some say they work 80 to 100 hrs a week. I was wondering how do they manage to do the daily activities of living. \n\nPhD students who work long hours, how much time do you spend on activities other than work every day and every week. What does you routine look like? Please include at least the following items with the amount of time spent in each and the time from when to when:\n\n* Sleep: How many hours and from when to when\n\n* Grooming: Showering, brushing teeth, face care, shaving etc. \n\n* Food preparation and cooking\n\n* Laundry, cleaning and maintaining home\n\n* Recreation: social media usage, hangouts/parties/social gatherings, hobbies\n\n* Chores that can only be done during workday: post office, banking when you need to be physically present, doctors appointments, getting a plumber to fix the house and so on. \n\n* Exercise\n\n* Time for significant other, family, dating etc. \n\nBonus questions: Why is your work hour so long anyway? What do you do that needs so much time? How is the pace and volume of your work, how much multitasking and overwhelming is it?",

Im not saying that I am the epitome of scientific output, but the people that typically say this are either 1) lying to themselves or 2) not successful. Every person I have seen hit a high level of success (high IF journals, tenure track jobs) did almost the opposite, work shorter and more tightly focused hours. I am not saying you can do a simple 9 to 5 every day (though I've seen people who had to do it), often your experiments can limit that. But if you hit much more than 50 ish hours per week, it starts getting counterproductive really fast.",

Work hard when at work but balance free time and social life around that: with the exception for preparing for a conference presentation or some other deadline.\n\nGroup 3: These people work late and work weekends but in my experience are getting work done somewhere between group 2 and the first group.",

Work a bit more during a \"crunch time\", but only for like a week or two at most. And go to bank appointments etc during work hours, because you have that flexibility.\n\nIf you're working really long hours, I'd say the best thing is to try to have proper breaks in there where you're away from the desk. Going to the campus gym can help. It's also good to have lunch with actual people rather than eating while watching youtube - it resets your brain and your mind a bit.",

Groceries/laundry/cleaning gets done on the weekends.\nMy experiments gets planned meticulously to avoid staying late or coming on the weekends unless a quick 10-15 min drop in will save me a day on experiments. \n\nDuring the final pushes for my paper it definitely felt like I was working 80 hour weeks but honestly writing does not come naturally to me so I had to spend a lot of time on it.\n\nI try to sleep 7 hours a day (12:30-7:30). I have a 5 step skin care routine every night that I really enjoy. Once a week I will do an hour long grooming/spa routine. I play with my cat for at least 30 min a day because she's really high energy. I go to yoga twice a week. My boyfriend and I play video games together so it's nice that our hobbies overlap. We eat out a lot but I try to prep most lunches with quick items or leftovers.\nI do life chores (mail, banking, doctors etc) during the work day-not excessively and my advisor has never had an issue.\n\nIn a biochemistry lab, experiments do run long and it needs some sacrifices. Sometimes shit fails at every step and things take 3 times as long (I had to stay till 11pm once). Last year I also had to do a lot of overnight data collection (e.g 11pm-5am situation). This comes as great personal cost and I hated it. Also at certain crunch times, I definitely worked ridiculous amounts but it was clear it was not sustainable long term. \n\nI guess I'm lucky that I'm able to multi task fairly well. At peak stress, I have ran 3 different experiments simultaneously to good enough success. I had to plan things down to 5 minute windows and was really laser focused. It was exhausting and I would not be able to do that 2 days in a row. I do agree with other posters about efficiency though. If something will take an hour, I'll spend that reading, writing, making figures, or preparing for future presentations even if they're like a month away. Be hyper aware of time wasting. \n\nI'm also not an overly social though so maybe that helps. I don't normally engage in hour long gossip/hanging out sessions that a lot of people enjoy. I also have zero issues with feeling left out when people go for extended coffee breaks/lunches together. This may be essential for some people but I don't derive much enjoyment out of this.",

If you\u2019re interested in collecting data over a 16-24 hour window and have to be physically present for whatever reason, there\u2019s no way to avoid being in lab super late. \n(2) planning things down to the minute can happen if you\u2019re running one or more experiments simultaneously that are super time sensitive. Recently ran an experiment where I was stimulating cells with a combination of things for 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 ... etc minutes and if that\u2019s the case, then you need to know exactly what you are doing at each minute. Gets even harder if you layer a different experiment on top of that in the downtime\n(3) most experiments are at least somewhat more involved than set up and monitor. If you look up the protocol for an ELISA for example you\u2019ll see that you have to keep returning to it over the course of a full day\n\nHope that helps!",

Like why did I put on pants and drag my ass all the way here so I could browse Reddit in 10 minute intervals? Planning carefully also helps me be as efficient as possible.

              "text": "Basically what u/symbiol and u/JAKSTAT said.\n\nRunning experiments can mean this for me for a morning (I am giving random time estimates and what I would do on a normal day):\n\n1. Plan the experiment (what I need and how much), typically I will do this the night before, and start my day with (2).\n2. Get a bucket of ice\n3. Thaw a bunch of tubes on ice (>15 min). Make coffee, drink coffee during this time.\n4. Mix a bunch of liquid together (\\~10 min).\n5. Wait for the liquids to do something. Set timers. Do desk tasks: answer emails, meet with advisor, data analysis, make figures/powerpoints, write down notes about experiments etc.\n6. Do time points as needed.\n7. The liquids did something, now they go into a machine for 30 minutes. Eat lunch and sit outside for some sunlight.\n\nWhen it's high pressure time, it would look more like this:\n\n1. Plan my experiments the night before.\n2. Start with ice, grab all the stuff I need off the list from (1).\n3. Thaw things + coffee.\n4. Mix a bunch of liquid together for experiment 1 (\\~10 min).\n5. Wait for the liquids to do something. Set timer (label timer experiment 1)\n6. Mix a bunch of liquid together for experiment 2 (\\~10 min).\n7. Wait for the liquids to do something. Set timer (label timer experiment 2)\n8. The liquids for exp 1 did something, now they go into a machine for 30 minutes.\n9. Prepare materials for tomorrow's experiments in this 30 minutes.\n10. Repeat 4-9 as required by the protocol. Do desk work  (listed in (5) above) and eat literally any moment I can.\n\netc.\n\nHope that makes it a little clearer. A lot of the experiments do involve waiting a certain amount of time between steps and so I can stagger them, but if I screw up the time estimate by like 5 minutes it can basically mean the experiment has to be discarded and waste very expensive materials. This requires me to be very experienced with all the steps since it takes time putting on/taking off gloves, making sure equipment are available when I need them (sometimes this means hitting the on button 15 min before), how long it takes to walk back and forth between equipment (sometimes they are on different floors).\n\nHope this makes sense.",

Again, I still don't buy that they actually work that much.\n\nMy guess is they are /in the vicinity of work/ for 80 hours a week. That does not mean they are working 80 hours a week. Sitting at a machine procrastinating from a task, or taking a break, might very well count into their \"work\" time.\n\n4.57 hours a day left over to shower, eat breakfast, eat lunch, eat dinner, and get ready for sleep. That's obviously doable, but say it takes 1 hour to shower/eat breakfast. You have 3.57 hours left. 30 minutes to eat lunch; you're at about 3 hours left. Eating dinner -> 30 minutes if you eat something simple. You're at 2.5 hours.  \nGetting ready to sleep; 30 minutes. 2 hours.\n\nThat's 2 hours a day to socialize, decompress, do chores, etc. Again, that is more feasible, but I really doubt any normal person can sustain that without becoming miserable. I think if they had a stop watch, and clicked it on for when they were truly, diligently working, and off when they were not, they'd be nowhere near 11-12 hours a day. I'm guessing that is true for a lot of jobs, actually.",

Heck, half the time, I'm dozing off when the thing tells me I got 30 minutes before sleep\u2014 that's how prepared my body is.\n\nWhatever things you need to do, just make sure you set aside time. I seem to have been one of the few of my cohort who never seemed to panic about deadlines or lose much sleep because I a) didn't spend my time concerned that anyone really cared about how much work I was necessarily doing b) didn't spend my time obsessed with making friends. I did anyways, of course, but I never found the grad school experience to be one that was necessarily social. \n\nAnother tip: if you're to be on campus...MWF...make sure your Tuesday/Thursday is when you set time aside to do those other things. Don't immediately just jump into working or whatever and forget those workday tasks. \n\nTrying to think of anything else that comes to mind...I'm now year five, mid diss, but am moving into kept man territory: wife got a TT and has been kind enough to let me take the year to write.

I'd say I average 50-55 per week, but up to 65 on the worst week.\n\n> Sleep: How many hours and from when to when\n\nI usually sleep 7-8 hours- from ~12-7 or so.\n\n> Grooming: Showering, brushing teeth, face care, shaving etc.\n\nI guess I'm a guy so this takes maybe 30 minutes per day, usually right after my morning coffee/breakfast so I'd say I finish that stuff up by 8:45 or so.\n\nI live close to campus so I walk, it takes about 15 minutes so arrive by 9.\n\nThe typical workday for me looks like roughtly 9-6, sometimes 9-7 on a long day.  But some days, when things do slow down a bit I go home around 4 or 5, and some days I stay a bit later into the night or if I know I'll be around on Sunday working on experiments, then that happens too.\n\n> Food preparation and cooking\n\nI can't cook for shit so I eat a lot of peanut butter sandwiches or deli meats.  Sometimes I'll make pasta or something simple.  Usually this comes right after I get home, and lunches I usually eat out.  Breakfast, as I mentioned is usually around 7 when I wake up.\n\n> Laundry, cleaning and maintaining home\n\nI just pick an evening each week to do laundry, I live alone so it's usually just 2 loads, maybe a third of sheets and towels.  Takes a few hours but I can do my other tasks/work/relax during.\n\n> Recreation: social media usage, hangouts/parties/social gatherings, hobbies\n\nSocial media is mostly on weekday evenings while watching netflix or sports.  Hanging out with friends almost exclusively happens on the weekends, or we grab lunch together.  I try to leave Saturdays to be non-workdays, but mostly I spend  them with my fiancee, and Friday night I usually spend with friends.\n\n> Chores that can only be done during workday: post office, banking when you need to be physically present, doctors appointments, getting a plumber to fix the house and so on.\n\nHonestly I just pick a day and skip lab in the morning or afternoon to do that shit.  I hate it but those stupid tasks have to be done, no real way to manage it well.  I usually end up making it up by staying late that day or coming in on Sunday.\n\n> Exercise\n\nDefinitely the thing I'm worst at.  For a while, I was trying to go right before my day started at 9 or so, but I  always struggle to make it happen as things get busy.\n\n> Time for significant other, family, dating etc.\n\nAs I mentioned, Saturdays are usually for my fiancee and me.  Sometimes we do something or just sit around and watch netflix and relax.  The rest of my family lives far away, so it's just a matter of finding time to call them.\n\n> Bonus questions: Why is your work hour so long anyway? What do you do that needs so much time? How is the pace and volume of your work, how much multitasking and overwhelming is it?\n\nMostly experiments that are time intensive, which is common in materials research.  But I try to multitask as much as possible- if I'm running a 1 hour experiment I'll start it before going to a 1 hour meeting or right before lunch.  Or I'll aim to write a paragraph while I wait for an experiment to finish.",

I like to work Sundays instead of staying later during the week or arriving earlier- Sundays are quiet and campus has free parking.  I don't go in every Sunday though. \n And I don't even always go to campus, if I'm working on writing sometimes I just go to a coffee shop and knock out a section of a manuscript I've been putting off, or read a paper I've been needing to read.\n\n> Also it seems like your Weekends are not totally for leisure as well given, that you need to get chores done like laundry during that time.\n\nYeah but that applies for pretty much any adult, regardless of their job.\n\n> Also do you have any time for leisure everyday? I mean you need to do something to relax and recharge yourself after a long day.\n\nI would say yes.  There's very seldom a day I don't listen to a podcast, read for pleasure, and watch something on Netflix.\n\n> Why can't you use social media like Reddit, Facebook etc during work? Is your work that strict or is your work that high paced and intense with no breathing room?\n\nThere's no one preventing me from doing it.  I occasionally get sidetracked but for the most part try to avoid those distractions so I can get things done.  The lab is more of a high paced environment anyway, so it doesn't lend itself to sitting around on social media.\n\n> When do you cook breakfast and dinner? Is it the night before, in the morning? That must take a lot of time.\n\nMy meals are simple, breakfast is toast and a couple eggs which doesn't take more than 20 minutes to prepare, and 10 to eat.  I usually do that as part of my morning routine.  Dinner, as I mentioned, could be a sandwich or just pasta, again no more than 30 minutes or so total, which I usually do once I get home.",

When I work more than two 10+ hour days in a row, my personal life become unmanagable. I find my healthiest work life balance is: 8:30-12:30, 1.5 hour lunch/personal time, 2:00-5/6/7pm depending. Having me time at the end of the day is 10000% a must for me. I'm a chronically ill student and I have come to understand that no one gives a shit about you outside of your ability to participate in sweet, sweet slave labor, so unless you make time for your physical/emotional/mental health, you aren't going to get time.

I also think that productivity is more based on luck and research field than how well someone can plan experiments. I've seen people who work half the number of hours that I do be \"as productive\".

If so, then that metric encompasses only a small fraction of what you can achieve in grad school. \n\nI also don't need as much downtime to unwind, because work just isn't that stressful.

      "text": "Just my $0.02 ---\n\nI'm not perfect, still struggle at times, but will offer my thoughts ---\n\nPrioritize your schedule and schedule your priorities.  I learned long ago that my to-do list doesn't get done until it's on my schedule taking up a time slot.  That doesn't necessarily mean that it's rigid -- just that it's there.  That includes making sure that I \"schedule\" time to do life \"stuff\" and socialize.  It also helps to keep my calendar widget on the home screen of my phone - if I don't see it, I won't pay attention to it.\n\nI'm 56, have been married for 35 years and have a grown daughter.  My wife and daughter have been patient and supportive of my academic pursuits over the years.  Now that I'm at the PhD candidate stage, the end of this particular journey is coming to a close and a new chapter is in the planning stages.  Over the years I've learned to be sure family comes first.  That might mean staying up to have serious Hubby/Dad talks (sometimes until 2am), but family still comes first.  Oh, and then there's the \"life stuff\" -- that means school events, coaching sports, helping with homework, a house full of my daughter's friends, the grass still needs to be cut, cars maintained, groceries, etc.\n\nFor the entire journey, I've worked full time (40-50hrs weekly including on-call time after hours).  I've also started teaching a few years ago at two local colleges and all that come with that (one school at a time -- not both).  I'm also on the board of a non-profit international aid agency.  I've also kept up with my studies.  I usually go back to my school work around 8p (Sun-Fri) and work until 1am-2am.  Do I sleep?  Yes.  Not as much as I should, and it's effected my health.  Trust me, sleep deprivation is *not your friend*.  But, my wife has been an amazing support, coach, cheer-leader, and best friend by helping to keep me healthy *and in line*.\n\nSo --\n\n1. Keep your family first.  If you don't have family or they aren't nearby - adopt one.  We all need mentors and people that we truly care for, who care for us, will challenge us personally, and have our backs.\n2. Eat right, get some daylight & air, and get enough sleep.  *No one* will be impressed that you looked up from your keyboard to see 10 pages of the letter \"Z\" because you feel asleep.  My wife certainly wasn't.  (BTW, thank goodness for CTRL-Z when it does happen.)\n3. Others have said it here.  Schedule in blocks of time and stick to it.  Monday is laundry day.  While the laundry is running, use that time to read through journal articles and make notes.  Working on your biblio in chunks will pay off.  When you can, Friday night is no work night - go out with friends & family for pizza or something.  At least one day a week do nothing but spend time with people you care about and that care about you.  That might mean you're spending time volunteering at an event or a soup-kitchen, playing games with your family and friends, or some other social activity.  Believe me - it pays off big time.\n4. When you can't realistically fit a request on your calendar (*and be honest*) - the answer is \"No\".  It's *your* time (unless your loved one is singing a solo at school or something like that).  I've learned the hard way (too many times) that you cannot have too many \"plates-on-sticks\".  And -- sometimes there are people out there that want to keep giving you more plates just to see you drop one.  Also, beware social media.  For me, spending time in this arena is a low priority, but I still drop by occasionally.  Sort of like some foods -- for me it's nice once in a while, but best in small portions.\n5. Remember -- while you're working on your degree (*doesn't matter which one*), the goal here is not to make a good impression on people but to make a serious impact.  You're putting time and energy into something you believe in (or at least I hope so).  *Now more than ever - This world needs people like you that can think critically and with clarity.*  You may influence just your inner-circle of friends and family.  You may wind up influencing whole communities and more.  Don't believe the lies that you don't have what it takes, aren't good enough, or are an ineffective person.  You do, you can, so don't give up.\n\nTime spent doing the above is like money in the bank - trust me I know.  Someone once told me that you reap what you sow, later than you sow, and more than you sow.  Put the time in now, and the doors ***will*** open.\n\nAgain -- just my $0.02 for what works for an old guy like me and what I've learned over the years.  I didn't grow up in a privileged home or environment, so I had to figure out what worked for me.   You'll need to find your rhythm and what works for you.  It all depends on what you value as important and worthy of your time and efforts.\n\nSorry for the long post, but I hope it helps.",

I usually work 8-6 or so M-F and take a break here and there. I only work weekends when I have to. I get 30m of exercise every day (or I at least average that). My partner does the food prep and cooking, so that is a big help. Honestly I shower like every other day and I'm not that social. But after 6pm or so, I quit. Make time for yourself and recharge your batteries or you will run out of steam. Anyone who claims to be working 100 hours a week is on stimulants, lying, or delusional.

Prepping, studying, and research easily brought many workweeks to 120 or more hours. Does anyone actually have any questions about what this lifestyle is? Cause its not good, but I'm happy to entertain specific questions:\n\n* Sleep: How many hours and from when to when: **maybe 5-6 hours, anywhere, anytime**\n\n* Grooming (**sometimes**): Showering (**fast**), brushing teeth (**yes**), face care (**no**), shaving (**no**) etc (**no time for etc**).\n\n* Food preparation and cooking: **relatively healthy, but not cooked: her diet consisted of yogurt, apples, carrots, cheese sticks, free food in the hospital, things her parents or I cooked. She cooked nothing.**\n\n* Laundry, cleaning and maintaining home: **this one one thing she took care of meticulously**\n\n* Recreation: social media usage, hangouts/parties/social gatherings, hobbies: **lol, no**\n\n* Chores that can only be done during workday: post office, banking when you need to be physically present, doctors appointments, getting a plumber to fix the house and so on: **no**\n\n* Exercise: **the efficient one, 30 min run 2x week + 45-60 min on weekend.**\n\n* Time for significant other, family, dating etc. **LOL, you see where im going with this... no**\n\n* Bonus questions: Why is your work hour so long anyway? What do you do that needs so much time? How is the pace and volume of your work, how much multitasking and overwhelming is it? **As a surgical trainee you typically are in many more cases than you could do if you were alone, my wife worked with 5 doctors and went to all their cases, daily and every weekend. The pace is insane and the volume is max. Basically, only people that are ultra ultra type A end up in this profession. It can be overwhelming, she has seen people die. A few times. Not something your average grad student sees at work. But she has also saved lives, so it feels important.**\n\nNow for the elephant in the room:  *Why is your work hour so long anyway?* someone could write (probably has?) a book on how fucked up medical training is. And I hear it used to be worse.\n\nIts not pretty. You get the job then choose sleep or any of the activities you listed. Its completely unsustainable if you don't have one of the following conditions:\n\n1. Someone to take care of all your shit (spouse/parents)\n\n2. An existence so spartan you've eliminated everything but medicine\n\n3. Your shit is literally in shambles.\n\nHaving met a multitude of my wife's friends and coworkers, they ALL fall into one of those three categories.\n\nEdited for bonus question.\n\nOh one more edit: occasionally she had easier rotations (e.g pure clinical ones might be ~50 hr), but they were less common, she also had a research year that was more like 50-70 hr weeks. So 7 years isn't quite accurate, its 6, with occasional slower months.",

Some projects require more fiddling, and are less tolerant of mistakes than other projects. In these cases, you need to put in more hours to get the same result. For example, the number of hours that are required to generate one piece of usable data from mouse work can be 4x what is required for a piece of cell culture data. I spent an average of 1 work day/week on just colony management. I did a lot of CL2 work, and the process of just transferring mice could take up to 3 hours. \n\nAnd what do we count as productivity anyway? What's needed to publish a paper? Finish a thesis? What about mentoring others? TAing? Sitting on committees? Outreach? I'd argue that these things can count as work too, and can easily result in working more than 40h/week.",

If you're working 60 vs 45, in an intellegent fashion, you will get more reactions done. And if they are well designed experiments you will finish projects faster.\n\nThe role of my PhD advisor was to really bring together motivated students, give them resources, and let them play. He stepped in to advise, and try and keep moral up as needed. With good morale many (not everyone) people enjoyed it. In my opinion grad school was fun, and I worked ~70hrs/week (12x5, ~10 Saturday). It was hard, but I learned how to do R&D effectively, then progressed into productivity.\n\nThe most productive people from my lab are now at what most people would consider \"top tier\" institutions and have impressive publication records to support that. Yes they are the exception, but long hours got them there. I went into industry and stopped working so damn hard. \n\nI agree that \"just being in lab\" isn't the same as working effectively, but I do believe you can work ~60 hours a week, exercise, sleep enough, take care of life shit, and have a few select hobbies.\n\nEdit: some typos, on cellphone.",

I couldn't find them quickly, I dug around some ACS surveys but didn't get anywhere.\n\nI found the statistics for my school and wonder how it compares, because, I'd estimate >50% of the students worked ~60+ hour weeks routinely. Unfortunately, there isn't real data on hours worked, that said, I probably interacted with 100 PhDs and postdocs closely enough to understand their hours were closer to 60 than 40.\n\nEdit: I guess the reason I'm asking is because I truly believe there is a direct correlation between (real) hours worked and academic output. I wish I could put some numbers on it, because both of us seem to be justifying this on anecdote.",

During my commute, I usually browse social media for 1h, and work the rest. \n* I average 8-9 hours in the lab per day. I typically don't do work on weekends. \n* I count \"thinking about work\" (e.g. planning, thinking about experiments) as work. If my mind isn't occupied by something else, it defaults to thinking about stuff that's work-related, which adds a lot to the number of hours I work. I also spend quite a bit of time reading papers.\n\nWhy I work so many hours:\n\n* I go through bouts where I'm more interested in doing work than doing other things. \n* I do a mix of tissue culture and animal work, which tend to require more time than other types of experiments. For example, I spend the equivalent of 1 day/week doing mouse colony management (genotyping, setting up breeders, etc.) \n* 25% of my work are/were side projects and collaborations that don't directly contribute to my thesis. \n* I used to find working long hours and multitasking experiments to be extremely overwhelming and stressful, but not anymore. Sometimes I need to be in lab for 10 hours because that's just what the protocol requires. On those days, I'd rather be super busy for all 10 hours, than to have huge breaks where I'm not doing anything, but have to be in lab anyways.",

I do my laundry every Friday night before bed and let the dryer run while I sleep, so I never get overwhelmed with laundry and only have to spend 15 minutes folding it on Saturday. I get drinks with friends every few weeks and we usually spend a fair amount of that time talking about our work (much to my partner\u2019s chagrin), so I consider my social life to be semi-productive in its own right. Since I only teach twice a week, it\u2019s pretty easy to schedule appointments or run work-hour errands, and I try to do those things during off hours (not too early, never at lunch, and before the typical workday ends) so it takes less time. My grooming routine is my ME time and is preciously guarded, I\u2019ve been know to leave social functions early because it\u2019s my wine/bubble bath/skincare night. I\u2019m in bed by 2am every night and wake up at 9:30 every morning. \n\nHaving heard horror stories about overwork and time poverty in grad school (and experiencing it myself my first year, with attendant physical and mental health consequences), I\u2019ve put a priority on developing and sticking to a routine that maximizes my productivity and uses my time as efficiently as possible. You can\u2019t always control everything and some weeks you end up being more or less productive than others, but it makes grad life sooooo much better.",

Social life revolved around people from school and occasional outings with other friends. \n\n80-100 hour weeks are tough but very much manageable if you strip away  nonessential time sinks.  100 hours a week is 14 hours a day. 80 is only about 11. Add 7 hours sleep and you have 3-6 hours left. Plenty of time. Just give up TV and vidya. \n\nBut you'd better love the work, it's not worth it otherwise.",

          "text": "You're getting downvoted, but I think other folks here are missing the point. Nobody here is arguing that you *need* to work 80+ hours a week to \"succeed\" or get an academic job. Yes, there are people who work extremely long hours because they suck at time management. However, I think we all know that many people are attracted to academia because their area of research is something they love and it's a large part of what motivates them on a day-to-day basis. Many academics (yes, including graduate students) work long hours because it provides a sense of personal fulfillment. I'm not saying this should be an expectation or that it results in one being a better academic. But some people just prefer to live their lives this way. If you're not having unreasonable expectations of others, who's to tell you how to spend your 24 hours in a day? To each their own.",

I strictly did not work after I left for the day. Once I was home, that was my time to do whatever I want. I would get up at 5 am and workout in the morning. I would go to bed 8:30-9:30pm usually. During vacations, I would travel home to see my family, but I also kept working though not on such a strict routine.\n\nOf course, there were days when I got up at 3-4am (I am a morning person) bc I had to get a presentation done for the weekly meeting with my advisors and I was behind. On those days, I went home after my meeting and took the rest of the day off. Then there were some days when I got stuck in the lab for ~12 hours because experiments sucked me in, but those were rare.\n\nThat routine was enough for me to tackle everything without exploding. Through that routine, I was able to do my PhD in 4 years and nab a professorship at an R1. For reference, I defended 1 year ago.",

I defended in July of last year and started as an assistant professor in August.\n\nIn the US, lecturers are not on tenure-track, so some people start as a lecturer then move into TT. \n\nTo answer your question, it took a lot of hard work and it absolutely depends on your field. In my field, it is normal to do 2-4 years of post-doc before getting a TT position, so I am the exception to the norm. My college is trying to rise up in rankings and is investing a lot of capital into new professors. As such, they are snatching up really good candidates straight from PhD instead of waiting for them to do a postdoc. Still, it tool a lot of hard work and planning throughout my PhD, and by the time I graduated I had published 10 papers. It helped that my advisors were hardcore researchers and let me work on a bunch of side projects with them.\n\nI also recommend reading the book \u201cThe Professor Is In,\u201d which helped me significantly.",
