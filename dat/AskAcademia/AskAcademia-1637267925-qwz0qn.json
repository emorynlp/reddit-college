  "title:": "Feeling like I am in exile, how did you cope moving to a small city for an academic position?",
  "text": "I know this applies to anyone having to move for jobs, but in academia jobs are especially scarce so I wanted to ask here.\n\nI am in my 30s and I am from the largest, most lively city of my country. Very pretty, always something to do. Then I moved to another country for my PhD, lived in the capital for 7 years. Again, very lively, parks, events everywhere. \n \nAfter searching (and failing) for a permanent job for so long, I finally found one in a smaller city. Its a great job, the university has great reputation in my field, I have decent colleagues. It makes sense to stay here at least a few years and aim for promotion. \n\nBut this city is just so plain. I have visited it before with friends but living here alone is a completely different experience. There is nothing historical or beautiful, its just concrete everywhere. When I look at their best restaurants or new cultural events, its just so pathetic. \n\nI know I should be grateful for finding a permanent academic job but I just feel like I am wasting my life here. \n\nAnyone in a similar position? How did you cope?",

Some jobs here in the U.S. in more \"rural\" areas won't have any of the fancy stuff the \"big cities\" have, but will have some amazing places for a wide variety of outdoor recreation.

If it doesn't match with what you want out of life, go on the market in year 3 and test the waters to see if you can move to an area more your liking.\n\nIf you can't \"get into\" whatever is \"great\" about the place, you'll be miserable in the long term, and, IMHO, life is too short to make that your \"final\" gig.\n\nYMMV.",

      "text": "I\u2019m in grad school and I\u2019ve lived in a rural US town for the last six years. I\u2019m not going to sugar coat it, my experience has been unpleasant. It\u2019s a nice place if you like outdoorsing or hiking. But that\u2019s about it. So for half the year when everything is cold and dead your stuck inside. Then things get warm and you can hike, and I like hiking, or bike, which is like hiking but faster, or boating, which is like hiking but wetter. Or you can go to bars and drink with the undergrads. \n\nMaking matters worse I\u2019m just shy of two hours from the nearest mid-sized city. So there isn\u2019t much opportunity to move save from one small nothing town to the next. The thing I miss the most? Good restaurants. World cuisine. Really lit pizza. Here there is chains, or the local hippy restaurant which would be interesting if they didn\u2019t always give me food poisoning\u2026.\n\nAs I see it, you have three choices. 1) quit and do something else. The nuclear option, but IMO something you have to consider. Your happiness ultimately comes first. 2) move to a better city and commute. I have a prof who does two days on campus and commutes in from the city. It sucks, but it means he can live in a better place and have those experiences. 3) get over and and get used to what you have available to you. There are always nice parts of any place, and maybe you can learn to like those things about your new home. I totally understand where you\u2019re coming from though and it\u2019s sucks. It\u2019s worse when you don\u2019t know anyone, so if you can at least make a few friends. It may make it more tolerable. \n\nUltimately tho this kind of thing is a big shit sandwich, no matter what you gotta take a bite.",

      "text": "I did that for 12 years and it almost cost me my marriage. I was too busy with the tenure track and promotion and dept. chair to hate where I lived as much as my wife, plus I grew up in smallish towns so I just shrugged and figure that's the way she goes. Thankfully banging away at research got us to our 'dream' place (as much as you can have in 2021) a few years ago. My career is amazeballs. I'd trade it for a less fucked up world though but you don't get that choice so you have to do what is best for you.\n\nI don't like it much but there is a saying, \"bloom where you're planted\". I think it's dumb because you can bloom all you want and still be surrounded by shit. You could probably carve out a reasonable social existence with a lot of work. If you stay in academia your only options are really publishing your way out or administration, and both take time.",

I don't know what to tell you other than a) find a community, a group of people who you have something in common, and b) prioritize hanging out with them. What these places usually lack in terms of excitement, they more often than not make up by having awesome people around.",

Some people can though. The only way to find out which you are is to get out and meet people, build up a friend group, and slowly try to discover what\u2019s in the area. Every place has a least something to recommend it.\n\nBut if you\u2019re as unhappy as you\u2019re indicating, it may also be a time to start thinking about your priorities and what you\u2019re really willing to compromise on. Academia demands a lot more sacrifices than most careers, and some people will never flourish within its confines. It took me way too long to realize that I was one of them.",

      "text": "This is why I left academia, although it was a bit of a different situation. I grew up in urban areas, and I went to college and grad school in two of the largest cities in my country. I deliberately chose to do a postdoctoral fellowship at a large university in a small town several hours from the nearest large city. I had never lived in a small town before, yet I knew there was a good chance that one of the few academic offers I got (should I have gotten any) would be in a small town. I wanted to know what it was like before embarking on an academic career.\n\nIt was OK. There were certainly aspects of it I liked. I made friends there, and I lived a nice, quiet life. I tried to find what I liked about the place, what made it beautiful. I acquired some new hobbies, and discovered things I never knew I liked. I went to university events and found that large universities can attract things you never thought you'd see in small towns, often for much lower cost than elsewhere. I saw celebrities speak and went to major concerts in my town. Small town airports are pretty glorious (ours was 5 minutes away from me and I could roll up 30 minutes before my flight left. It was like taking the Greyhound.) Some of my colleagues dealt by traveling often; technically, I did too, as I spent most of my weekends in a very large city a couple hours from me.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it was not the life I wanted to live. And when I thought about it, living the life I wanted to live was more important to me than staying in academia - so I got out.\n\nI'd say this depends entirely on you. Some people have such a burning passion for academia that they cannot imagine doing anything else, and living in a tiny town they dislike or even hate is well worth the sacrifice. (I had a friend like this: she complained incessantly about the place she lived, but she really did love teaching at her tiny LAC. I never could tell whether she was happy.) For others, the small town they started in isn't where they want to stay but they found another job in a different small town that suited them better. Some people give themselves long commutes (like 1+ hours) so they can live in the large city but still have the job. Some people simply make it work - maybe they don't like their area, but they don't hate it, so they can live with the arrangement. Some plot to move somewhere else, with varying results.",
