  "text": "I'm a new postdoc, and my boss has asked me to compile a list of open-source software and present it to my group. I've got the obvious things, like LaTeX, text editors, Zotero/Mendeley, Overleaf, python/Octave, and of course git and Linux. \n\nIs there anything else you guys use, even if it's discipline-specific?\n\nEdit: I'm especially interested in software for making figures. I have to admit, I'm not very good at artistic things and so I rely heavily on software to make the plots nice for me.",

I've used [RDKit](http://www.rdkit.org/) for basic chemistry in relation to training a neural network during undergrad.  Also mol2chemfig is one of my favourite timesavers for importing chemical structures into LaTeX documents with ease and retaining the prettiness one should expect from LaTeX.\n\nFor visualizing data, Matplotlib/Pyplot via Python are definitely my go-tos. I've used Python's probfit for nonlinear regression quite often.\n\nThere's a lot of basic stuff that I don't use exclusively for academic things like Thunderbird, Riot.im (for conference calls and such, though I haven't used it in an academic capacity yet due to the lack of other people who use it), Unison (file syncing between devices), GIMP or Inkscape, krunner/Launchy (I can't ever stop enjoying how convenient having a quick unit conversion tool and drop-down calculator is), ssh, etc.\n\nGenerally, it's easy to make a list of libre software that's great, but it's difficult to not make it too bloated with things that are only tangentially related because they relate to just making your experience with your computer better.",
