  "title:": "Can I continue to do research with a faculty member if I\u2019m not a graduate student but not applying to graduate programs either?",
  "text": "My plan was always to apply to PhD programs after finishing college. That didn\u2019t work out - shortly after graduating in 2020 I discovered I had a large tumor that turned out to be cancer. I was hoping I could continue to work while dealing with this medical crisis, but it became apparent fairly quickly that this wouldn\u2019t be feasible given how unstable my situation has been (two inpatient hospitalizations so far with a third and final one coming up sometime in the next eight weeks - a transplant). My schedule has been very up in the air for almost a year now and I recognize that I\u2019m not an attractive candidate for traditional jobs. \n\nFor the past several months I\u2019ve been doing independent research with a mentor and faculty member I met during undergrad. He\u2019s a prolific scholar at the top of his field and was incredibly generous offering to informally oversee my independent research so I\u2019m able to say I did some work during this gap year. The research has developed into a project of sorts and we even discussed the possibility of \u201cmaking it official\u201d and applying for some grant funding once I\u2019ve recovered from my transplant.\n\nThe problem I\u2019m facing now is this question of whether to even apply to graduate school this cycle. I couldn't apply last cycle because I had surgery, and although this next surgery won\u2019t overlap with application due dates, it\u2019ll be cutting it close. I don\u2019t really know what my recovery will be like. I also feel scatterbrained and have been having a hard time thinking about applications during the lead up to surgery. On the surface, it\u2019s starting to seem like applying this cycle might not be worth the added stress.\n\nPretty much the only thing stopping me from biting the bullet and giving up on applying this cycle is the research I\u2019m doing with this faculty member. When we came up with this informal arrangement, it was at a time when I felt confident I would be applying to graduate programs. When we discussed the possibility of further developing the research/project after my surgery, it was understood that it would be in the context of me being someone who could tell people \u201cI\u2019m an incoming graduate student.\u201d I\u2019m afraid that with no real tether to an academic program or institution, this work will have to come to an end.\n\nEssentially, what I\u2019m trying to figure out is this - what are the optics of pursuing a research project with a faculty member when you aren\u2019t a current graduate student but aren\u2019t applying to graduate programs/waiting to start a graduate program either? I\u2019m assuming the optics of applying for grant funding under these circumstances wouldn't look very good (if it\u2019s even possible to begin with). If I do decide to postpone graduate school applications yet again, will I just need to accept that doing any work associated with a university isn't an option for me at this point in my life? I\u2019ve had another mentor of mine tell me that the kind of project I\u2019m working on is something well-suited for a graduate student, and that trying to snag any administrative/entry level job at a university to maintain some sort of affiliation isn't good enough.",

      "text": "This sounds like a discussion to have with your current mentor. I don't see any problems with someone postponing entering grad school another year, but there may be logistical issues related to volunteering/interning/hiring. \n\nThe only person who can answer those and navigate any such issues that might arise with pursuing one option or another, as well as a willingness to keep you on the project another year, is your current mentor.\n\nFrom the standpoint of admissions committee - a simple personal statement inclusion about delaying due to cancer treatments is sufficient. You can get a strong LoR from your current mentor who can also mention your perseverance for research despite health problems.",

      "text": "First of all, good luck with your illness. Cancer sucks. Kick it's ass.\n\n\"Optics\" depends on who you're concerned is looking at you. There's nothing stopping you from doing independent research on your own time. Universities don't have a monopoly on research. I published my first research paper (with help) as a working stiff, not thinking at the about going back to school. Having that research under your belt will definitely be a plus for PhD applications.\n\nGetting funded, however, is another issue. Most of the grants I'm aware of require the university to officially do the applying. In practice, that means that a faculty member is the PI and the school signs onto the contracts. Sometimes faculty will sign on to be the PI that you write, but that can be hard to swing. \n\nIf you discussed applying to that university, they might be planning on advocating for you in the application process. If that's the case, then you should push yourself to apply. If you can't do that, then they may still be willing to work with you. They may also be willing to hire you on as a researcher, depending on the field and money. But you've got to talk to them.",

Having a grant doesn't \"make it official\" lol, grants have nothing to do with research, they are just a way of paying people and buying equipment if you need it \n\nIf you want to keep working on the project for fun then just keep working on it, I don't understand what the problem is? You probably aren't going to get paid, if thats what youre asking",

However, I have to say not paying people to do research is exploitative and I think you need to consider whether you can afford to work unpaid for another year. Your PI is making vague suggestions about getting funding but while you're willing to work for free they have little incentive to do so and what limited funding there is out there may well take 6+ months to be secured and put in place.",

Assuming its an interesting project that the OP wants to work on (and which may help his CV) , then he is getting the benefit of his advisors time, and expert input into the project.  Academics at good universities will bill $1000+ a day for consulting, easily. Its not obvious who should be paying whom.\n\nIf the OP can get paid then great. If not then he will have to decide whether its interesting enough (and useful enough for his CV) to do for free. But either way, there is no exploitation.",

Of course this doesn\u2019t usually happen immediately, training and learning take time so the PI won\u2019t rake the benefits in the beginning. \n\nI just think it is unfair for people to not get paid for their time, especially when their work can lead to publications or new leads in the project. Not paying for people\u2019s time ultimately leads to creating an environment of people who can AFFORD to not get paid for their time. I\u2019m sure there are other ways to view this, but I\u2019m speaking from my own experience.",

                  "text": "Thank you. This is exactly it. Academia already throws up ridiculous barriers to entry and increasingly now requires people to have substantial research experience at UG level, meaning only those who can afford to spend their spare time working for free get to do it. \n\nThe idea you'd have someone in your lab for a whole year working for you unpaid is totally exploitative. While the rest of the world is slowly moving away from unpaid internships precisely because they are exploitative and make it harder for women and POC, it's disappointing to see academia embracing them and defending the practice.",
