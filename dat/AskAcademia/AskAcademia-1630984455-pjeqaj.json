  "title:": "How would you demonstrate communication skills in an interview?",
  "text": "I was once asked \"how do you prove your communication skills\", \"give some examples\" or so during an interview when I applied for an on-campus assistant job that involves some simple IT works. \n\nAll I could think of are presentations for research or course projects, meetings (?), co-working on research/course projects and things like that. Then I was told that I am too academically focused... and of course, I failed to get that spot :/\n\nI really have no idea how to answer behavioral questions like this one, most of my life experiences are in school. I feel like there're will be similar questions during PhD interviews (I am applying PhD programs for 22' fall). Can anyone give some good examples, or share useful resources to learn how to prepare? Thanks!!",

      "text": "What such questions are asking for is to demonstrate that you have an understanding what the job entails in practice and how you go about similar situations. Clearly they're not just looking for someone who has the technical capability of doing the work, but someone who can take charge of the relationship with your clients, and ask for and provide crucial information autonomously. This is extremely common and is likely to follow you through your career with increased complexity.\n\nHow you answer depends of the specifics of both the job and your pathway. Have you *ever* provided IT support? If needed read up on it and dig in your experiences for parallels. Have you been in a club or had a job? Have you project-managed an event? What *is* your thinking about communication, and us it up to professional norms? These questions can get you started.",

      "text": "To prove your communication skills you need to show that your communication had a desired result. For example- \u201cduring my work experience I taught a school child how to use Scratch and after two lessons they were able to make a code for a game.\u201d  Giving a presentation is only one part of the communication, you need to show that what you presented was understood and actioned by the recipient.  This is particularly important in IT where you might be helping people with minimal IT expertise. You can\u2019t say - reboot the hard drive bla bla bla, you need to say \u201cturn off at the switch on the bottom row of the machine, count to five and turn on again using the same button\u201d.\nEdited to add - a good method is to give answers using STAR - situation, task, action, result.",

      "text": "Presentations aren't really communication and at most are a unidirectional form of communication. What they're asking about is how do you identify what information people need and ensure people get it. So how did you explain an issue to someone to get them to understand an act on it, how did you keep everyone in a project informed with what was going on, how did you make sure that problems could be raised and were heard, how did you engage with stakeholders, did you teach people how to do something - if so, how? It kind of depends on the context of the job but those would be the kinds of examples I'd expect to hear.",
