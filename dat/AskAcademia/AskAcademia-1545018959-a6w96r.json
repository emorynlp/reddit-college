  "text": "I feel like many folks might be able to relate. \n\nI love learning and being in a setting where people are bright, asking important questions about the world, and creating solutions. I like my research. But I cannot stand the elitist culture of academia. \n\nThis has become more irritating to me the longer I've spent in higher ed. In particular, as I'm prepping for grad school apps, I keep reading about basically the culture of academia runs off prestige, seniority, not questioning authority, etc. I've also had really smart friends who left academia because of the culture. To be honest, most of my friends in grad school or academia seem stressed and depressed.\n\nLastly, I feel like all of these problems feel more acute to me because I don't fit into the academic majority/mainstream. I am a first-generation, low-income college student and a queer person of color. \n\nDespite all of this, I understand that no career is perfect and academia still seems like the best possible fit and has amazing smaller communities of students, professors, and others who really share my values. How do other folks reconcile their love/hate of academia? ",

This is all for programs that have you assigned to a particular person when you apply though, so no rotations and choosing after-the-fact. \n\nI rely on in-person and Skype meetings very heavily. Someone might do fantastic research and have a generally good reputation, but I need to physically speak with them myself and gauge their excitement, investment, and overall personality as well. Emails are too hard to read emotion from, so anyone who won't at least chat over Skype/phone is pretty well off the list. If they're too busy to spare 15-20 minutes to chat about a research proposal then I'm obviously not a top-priority applicant and they may be similarly unsupportive later on too. \n\nHaving an advisor you can really work with is most of the challenge. If you can never seem to get on the same page or your personalities just don't mesh, then the entire project will be a struggle. ",

It's OK to wait before jumping into grad school and some of my best colleagues are people who went to the industry and came back from it. Not only are they more financially stable, they are also emotionally more mature and it shows in the way they handle some of the bad things which happen in academia.",

Would they be supportive if you wanted to?\nHow hands-on would you say your advisor is?\nHow collaborative is the department?

This being said, I think finding a good supervisor and getting to know more reasonable professors/researchers in the department may help you out. I don't like the elitism as well, but I actually don't feel it at all. I'm just in my first year of research, but they trust me to revise their work and pull research questions that they may have never thought of, since we work with technology/new media/communication (through psychology) and I'm much younger and more tech driven then they are.

      "text": "This is a part of academia, but it's definitely not all of it. Find an advisor that feels the same way you do. I also get irritated by some of the same aspects of academia, but it's totally possible to build a community that isn't like that. You have to deal with the fact that it still exists (especially when publishing), but like you said, nothing is perfect.",

I'm an atypical academic if you look at my physical person and my idiosyncrasies are a lot like the personality traits of Sheldon and Amy from Big Bang Theory.

My dissertation committee members basically told me during my defense that they knew I was a genius and they were proud of me. You will find that there will be someplace where you can be respected and accepted for who you are, and what you bring to the field and discourse.",

It\u2019s just sanctimonious self-congratulatory back-patting. \n\nIt\u2019s rare to see an /r/iamverysmart worthy comment here. Almost as rare as finding someone here who thinks Big Bang Theory portrays academia or \u201cnerd culture\u201d in a realistic manner. ",
