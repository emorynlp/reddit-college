The PI significantly increased their effort without my knowledge which means I'll have to reduce salary of others, who do more, to make ends meet. The PI also suggested I fudge exclusion criteria to not lose participants (which I won't do). What can I do about this? Do I have have to suck it up? Is it reportable?",

And if the grant funding is contingent on those participants or their selection criteria, it may constitute fraud. The grants office would know more, and they will happily tell your PI to knock it off.\n\nRemember, the grant money isn\u2019t actually \u201cyours.\u201d It\u2019s still the grantor\u2019s money, and it\u2019s managed by your university.

If they submit an amended budget that still meets the grant terms, grants will process it without comment. You can't sanction someone for being a jackass.\n\nBut if the grants office (or the grant manager at the agency) is made aware of deliberate misconduct on the PI's part (fudging exclusion criteria, for example), they're duty-bound to report it if the grant's terms specifically forbid such behavior (and most grants for human subject research do have stipulations on this).\n\nIn the program I manage, even a whiff of misconduct is taken as seriously as someone joking about bombs at the airport. Once we hear about it, we're obligated to investigate and gather statements. Our federal sponsor requires it, as does our VP-R, as does our grants office. And for the remainder of that subaward's lifespan, we watch them like a hawk. But our university recently had several cases of gross misconduct that went uninvestigated because the previous administration waved a hand and said \"Those people can police themselves.\"",

If there is genuinely an ethics concern, take it to the Research Integrity Officer. If it's about an approved student, take it to the IRB. \n\nIf you want to interrupt your funding and piss off everyone in your organization, go straight to the agency program director. They will take it seriously, but as I said, this is a matter to be resolved internally. If it needs to be escalated to agency, it will be, after an appropriate internal process.",

If you think for whatever reason you won't get a fair hearing in the department, which happens, then it is a good idea to talk to the ombuds first. They may be able to help you come up with the right approach or support you in these discussions. \n\nFudging exclusion criteria is potentially both an IRB issue and a research misconduct issue.  Since you didn't actually do it, it's not necessarily the case that misconduct has occurred - but your research integrity officer would want to know an attempt was made.  I act as a deputy RIO at my institution and I would want to know this, and would do my best to advocate for you and ensure this PI sees some consequences.",

They underpay people, or put them in an outdated building, or undercut them anytime there's a conflict with a prominent faculty member. Professor So-and-So brings in lots of grant dollars and headlines, so she's untouchable even if she's an obvious abuser and a crook. Over time, this leads competent RA staff to leave, and maybe not be replaced. Universities care so much about the illusion of productivity/success that they have little time for enforcement or integrity. \n\nEvery department needs a White Hat - someone of unimpeachable integrity, who everyone trusts to tell the truth and make even-handed decisions about conflicts.",

Budgets are projections, there are always cost overruns, your co -pi allocating more hours to the research isn\u2019t worrisome.
