                              "text": "Well, there\u2019s actually more to it. The idea to have an open session at the APS meeting was actually brought about by an incident in the 1950s, [where a disgruntled scientist shot the secretary of the editor who rejected his paper that claimed electrons do not exist](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-22171039). Another part of it is that the APS wants to be inclusive and open to new ideas, because some of the most revolutionary ideas were pretty fringe at one point or another. I mean, who would think that quantizing energy would describe the spectra released by a hot object? Planck did, and his insight which flew in the face of physics at the time was one of the fundamental discoveries that ultimately led to the quantum revolution.\n\nSo the idea behind the \"crackpot\" section is to give a place for the public discussion of wild ideas to members of the APS. Ideally this allows for the public discussion of any wild ideas, and if the idea is good, then it moves forward. Dan Shechtman, who won the 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on quasicrystals, was once regulated to the \"crackpot\" section at APS because quasicrystals were a pretty wild idea at the time and Linus Pauling was an opponent, but Shechtman was right. So that's the ideal.\n\nBut more often than not, the talks are just crackpot talks and are pretty entertaining, if cringe inducing, unprofessional, and not scientifically sound.",

My personal area of expertise happens to be Russian nonconformism of the 60s and 70s, and let me tell you--those CIA shows were really influential--they represented a key counterpoint to Socialist Realism for a whole generation of underground artists, many of whom had no direct access to modern art other than Socialist Realism. \n\nGranted, the influence was odd--e.g. Pollock's show was supposed to surprise the Soviets with abstraction, but anyone in Russia who knew anything about the Russian avant-garde was no stranger to abstraction (even if they never saw the paintings, works like Malevich's Black Square were known via rumors spread among artists). \n\nNo, what really shocked the Soviet underground was the size of Pollock's canvasses--the thinking was--the man must have an unbelievable amount of space at his disposal to work--a painting that big wouldn't fit in the studios of establishment artists in the USSR, and so the condition of the artist in the West couldn't be as bad as Soviet artists have been led to believe.",

She'd asked for book recommendations so she could read more about how Ireland was ruled by women for thousands of years and when I told her I didn't have anything to suggest she got really angry.\n\nBasically everything online about the \"gods\" of pre-Christian Ireland is absolute nonsense. Many of them are never even explicitly referred to as gods or goddesses, we're just inferring from name elements or a relationship to other known gods. Most of the characters are simply supernatural, or have magical powers and thus get labelled as gods but it's hard to know for certain. We have some archaeological evidence of worship, but (as far as I'm aware anyways) nothing that is explicitly linked to the characters we identify as gods. \n\nAnd people don't really like that. They'd like a fleshed-out pantheon in the Roman or Greek style and we don't have that. So people make up their own stories, their own ideas, and these get sold as history and I meet people who believe we know exactly how the ancient Irish worshiped and who exactly they worshiped and that we have this massive pantheon of all these fabulous gods and we just don't. And they don't like to hear that.",

                              "text": "Alright! (Fair warning this might get long)\n\nD\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn's [*Early Medieval Ireland, 400-1200*](https://www.amazon.com/Medieval-Ireland-400-1200-Longman-History/dp/0582015650) is pretty accessible and not too dear. If you've access to an academic library they likely have a copy of the [*A New History of Ireland* series](https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/n/new-history-of-ireland-nhi/?cc=us&lang=en&) which is fairly general and is very well done. They are fairly expensive. Also expensive, but not too hard to obtain through libraries, [*Aspects of the T\u00e1in*](https://www.amazon.com/Aspects-Ta%CC%81in-J-P-Mallory-Patricia-Ruairi/dp/0951706829) is (obviously) primarily about our *T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge* but does provide some really good context to Irish society at the time. \n\nAdmittedly I'm a bit of a sucker for primary source texts so many of my recommendations are in that vein: the UCC CELT database is a good start. The [CELT (Corpus of Electronic Texts)](https://celt.ucc.ie/irllist.html#LDT) database hosts editions of many Old Irish texts. There are some English translations, though they can be difficult to dig up. Nonetheless the database contains a wide variety of material [Historical, Legal and Genealogical](https://celt.ucc.ie/irllist.html#hlg), [Narrative literature](https://celt.ucc.ie/irllist.html#narrl) including mythology, [Grammar, Metrics and Poetry](https://celt.ucc.ie/irllist.html#gram), as well as some later [Legal, Scientific and Medical Texts](https://celt.ucc.ie/irllist.html#leg). [The T\u00e1in](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tain-Translated-Irish-Epic-Cuailnge/dp/0192803735/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1526295253&sr=1-2&keywords=the+t%C3%A1in), early Ireland's great epic is a good one. Personally, Kinsella's version translation is my favourite as he stays pretty true to the text while still being accessible. And by that I mean he manages to capture the feel of the Old Irish (including it's somewhat stilted narrative style) but it is readable. Jeffrey Gantz's [Early Irish Myths and Sagas](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Early-Irish-Myths-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140443975/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=T81F406K59PH2YAXGC9H) is an excellent introduction to some of the myths. He takes a few more liberties with his translation than Kinsella does, which mean the \"flavour\" of Old Irish is a bit lost but it's still very good. On the other end of the spectrum, the [Tales of the Elders of Ireland](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elders-Ireland-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/0199549850/ref=pd_sim_14_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=T81F406K59PH2YAXGC9H) as translated by Ann Dooley and Harry Roe, has stuck pretty close to the source and thus can be a bit of a slog, but the material is interesting and is from a different cycle to the T\u00e1in. \n\nFergus Kelly's [A Guide to Early Irish Law](https://books.dias.ie/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=149) is absolutely invaluable and easily accessible to the general reader. It provides an overview of what we know of early Irish society from the law tracts, and some of the more interesting features of law.  [Early Irish Farming](https://books.dias.ie/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=150) Kelly's companion book is again, focused mainly on laws, but isn't exclusively about farming - though it does focus on the agricultural side and land law. Roisin McLaughlin's [Early Irish Satire](https://books.dias.ie/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=367) is accessible to the general reader, and discusses the place and function of satire in early Ireland. She also provides substantial examples as editions. It's a little bit more niche but I think the bardic tradition and satire are just fabulous so I think it merits a mention.\n\nGoing outside of history and more into language, [*A Guide to Ogham* by Damian McManus](https://www.tcd.ie/Irish/research/publications.php) is the definitive guide on the language of the ogham inscriptions, and is fairly accessible. Some of the linguistics sections may be a tad heavy for the average reader, but it is, overall, understandable. The book is available from the Department of Irish & Celtic Languages at Trinity College Dublin for only \u20ac10, which is far less than you will find it selling for on Amazon and the like. Likewise, [Ogham in 3D](https://ogham.celt.dias.ie/menu.php?lang=en&menuitem=03) is a really great website (despite not really looking it) that catalogues and digitise 3D images of all of the ogham stones around Ireland. You can search by both location and by inscription, and the website also provides a brief overview of the language, and a bibliography. The [Electronic Dictionary of the Irish Language](http://www.dil.ie) is an online version of the Royal Irish Academy's *Dictionary of the Irish Language*. The dictionary has recently become far more searchable and user-friendly, however, it is still a dictionary and is not a learning tool. They have (extremely) recently introduced a \"concise edition\" that edits out all the philological information and just gives straight up definitions, which is intended to be more for a general audience. (If you are interested in Old Irish I can give you more resources about that as well.)\n\nAlso an incredible resource because it's fun and so wonderful: [Irish Script on Screen](https://www.isos.dias.ie/english/index.html) is an ongoing digitisation project of manuscripts of Irish invention. Select an institution, choose a manuscript, and you can peruse at your leisure. Low-res images are freely available, high-res images require [registration](https://www.isos.dias.ie/english/registration.html). Ostensibly the accounts are limited to those working on relevant scholarly research but I honestly can't comment on how strict they are about that. ",

The [CELT (Corpus of Electronic Texts)](https://celt.ucc.ie/irllist.html#LDT) database hosts editions of many Old Irish texts. There are some English translations, though they can be difficult to dig up. Nonetheless the database contains a wide variety of material [Historical, Legal and Genealogical](https://celt.ucc.ie/irllist.html#hlg), [Narrative literature](https://celt.ucc.ie/irllist.html#narrl) including mythology, [Grammar, Metrics and Poetry](https://celt.ucc.ie/irllist.html#gram), as well as some later [Legal, Scientific and Medical Texts](https://celt.ucc.ie/irllist.html#leg). [The T\u00e1in](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tain-Translated-Irish-Epic-Cuailnge/dp/0192803735/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1526295253&sr=1-2&keywords=the+t%C3%A1in), early Ireland's great epic is a good one. Personally, Kinsella's version translation is my favourite as he stays pretty true to the text while still being accessible. And by that I mean he manages to capture the feel of the Old Irish (including it's somewhat stilted narrative style) but it is readable. Jeffrey Gantz's [Early Irish Myths and Sagas](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Early-Irish-Myths-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140443975/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=T81F406K59PH2YAXGC9H) is an excellent introduction to some of the myths. He takes a few more liberties with his translation than Kinsella does, which mean the \"flavour\" of Old Irish is a bit lost but it's still very good. On the other end of the spectrum, the [Tales of the Elders of Ireland](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elders-Ireland-Oxford-Worlds-Classics/dp/0199549850/ref=pd_sim_14_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=T81F406K59PH2YAXGC9H) as translated by Ann Dooley and Harry Roe, has stuck pretty close to the source and thus can be a bit of a slog, but the material is interesting and is from a different cycle to the T\u00e1in. \n\nThe Narrative Literature section from CELT is what you're after, and the three books are a good starting point as well. Also recommended in that comment in *Aspects of the T\u00e1in* which contextualises the myth. Another good one is [*The Celtic Heroic Age*](https://www.amazon.com/Celtic-Heroic-Studies-Publications-Irish/dp/1891271091) which will have some overlap with Gantz, but is primary source translations of some of our most important texts. \n\nI can't think of any secondary source material that really deals with Ireland exclusively, MacCana's [*Celtic Mythology*](https://www.amazon.com/Celtic-Mythology-Proinsias-MacCana/dp/0600006476) is decent, but more generally Celtic and considered by many to be somewhat outdated. Unfortunately, there isn't much extensive introductory secondary literature available - there just isn't much call for it. I don't remember receiving any in my undergrad, we were just given the primary material from the get-out and asked to draw conclusions, and that is how i teach now as well. \n\nHappy to take any questions you may have!",

As far as I'm aware, the Otherworld is never called T\u00edr na n\u00d3g is the early Irish material. It's thus named in the tale of Ois\u00edn, but outside of that I've never heard it used. Despite that, it is the most popular and widespread name of the Otherworld and I can't account for it. My best guess would be that either a) the Ossianic legends were popular folklore and made the rounds more readily than say, tales involving the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann or b) we blame the Gaelic League. During the early 20th century, writers like Yeats and Lady Gregory pushed Irish myth into the mainstream, but neither of them had the ability to access the material themselves - Yeats had no Irish, much less Old Irish and I'm not sure about Gregory, but both of their retellings and discussions of early Irish material betrays either a lack of understanding, or a highly-romanticised, editorial view. I haven't read enough of them to say for certain, but many of the misconceptions about Irish mythology were spread from them.\n\nT\u00edr na n\u00d3g is really interesting, because it's so minor in the written record but has such a widespread notariety. It's sort of like leprechauns, in that way. There's only one leprechaun in early Irish myth, and they're not super popular creatures in the folklore, and yet it's the most recognisable figure. \n\nAnyways here's the other comment: \n\n>Alright well here's the relevant section from the other comment:\n\n>> Admittedly I'm a bit of a sucker for primary source texts so many of my recommendations are in that vein: the UCC CELT database is a good start.

While women do have the ability to instigate divorce, they can own property, rape is illegal etc. they still have less rights than their husbands.\n\nBut I don't think it was laws that she'd read. I have myself encountered a fair number of pop-history books that claim Ireland was a matriarchal society on the basis of characters like Medb who are strong, empowered women, and some various other fictions about how the Three Matrones were the primary goddesses of the society and were what everyone worshiped. So I expect that sort of material is what she'd been reading.",

Where are the applications they promised??\".\n\nIt's very strange.",

We don't really get Flat Earthers harassing my department, but I do have a colleague in another department where they had to ban a man from campus who kept coming to the dept and harassing the astronomy professors for not agreeing with Flat Earth (and, it turned out once notes were compared, sexually harassing the students).\n\nI am moving to Harvard this fall for a postdoc and highly suspect the crackpot emails will increase the moment I have that email address!",

I have no idea why, this puzzles me to this day.\n\nOther than that, not much, at least in real life. I think this could be because of a focus on moderation and realism inherent in the field. Also, the intricacies of chemical engineering aren't exactly in the public spotlight. Weird space theories? Everyone and their dog has one. Weird theories about Non-Random Two-Liquid model applicability to vapor-liquid equilibria in highly nonideal systems? Now we're in a much more exclusive club.\n\nI get a lot of jokes about moonshine distillation though. My experience with that is that real distillation column designers already do it for a living and don't need it as a hobby.\n\nPlenty of weird characters, but I guess that's a given.",
