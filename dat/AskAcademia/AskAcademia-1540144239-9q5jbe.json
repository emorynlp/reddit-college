  "text": "I hope this is okay to post here. I\u2019m a female grad student in a class with a male professor who is also on my thesis committee. This is my second class with this professor and he has always been extremely nice, professional, and encouraging. However, recently I\u2019ve picked up on certain behaviors that give me some pause. \n\nA few weeks ago he began to text me on my cellphone on the weekends. I did not give him my number - he presumably got it from my email signature. He has kept it mostly school related but did call my cellphone and ended the conversation with random personal questions. He has also recently added me on Facebook. Additionally a male classmate and I had to have similar one-on-one meetings to discuss our final projects and I told the male classmate to expect to field lots of personal questions from this professor (since that was my experience in our meeting). My classmate came back saying that did not happen at all. However a female classmate of mine also experienced the same treatment as I did with lots of questions and compliments in the second half of the meeting that were off topic from the project. \n\nThe attention does not feel sexual in anyway but does feel excessive and gender specific. Should I say something to someone in the hopes that it doesn\u2019t progress or should I just stay observant and not make a big deal? Has anyone experienced this? \n\nI received another text from him today asking why I wasn\u2019t at an on campus event I had registered for. It all seems fairly innocuous but I feel sensitive to it. \n\nUPDATE: Thank you all for your feedback, it\u2019s very helpful. I am removing my cellphone from my email signature, I completely agree that if I don\u2019t want people to contact me I shouldn\u2019t provide it. I\u2019ve had my cellphone on my email signature for years without issue so this is new territory. \n\nI also want to clarify that personal questions varied from, \u201cDo you have siblings? What do your parents do?\u201d to \u201cHow did you pay for your undergraduate degree?\u201d to \u201cWhy are you wanting to live in that city after graduation, do you have family or a boyfriend there?\u201d What made them more unnerving is that they came out of nowhere with no prompting. We would be talking about something related to work and then he would jump to asking me a fairly specific question about my personal life. When we talked on the phone he asked me if I was going to a music festival and if I knew how he could get tickets. It seemed more like a question for Google than for me. The conversation also had no urgency at all and I was going to see him in class the next day. Like I said, they are fairly innocuous but I do not have a strong personal relationship with him and this strikes me as a strange way to build one. I have had good friendships with colleagues and professionals before but this is not how I experienced forming those relationships. \n\nAs for the small sample size, I understand that not a lot can be gleaned from the experience of three people. However, I can say that the other female independently arrived at a feeling of discomfort in her interactions with him as well. I would say the three of us are equally engaged and ambitious, so there\u2019s no reason I can see that the professor would have to not offer the same treatment to my male classmate. ",

Although his questions per se do not seem to be overly creepy (yet), the timing (weekends) and excessive personal nature of his texts and calls seem to be way off. In any case, **whether his intentions are good or bad, the biggest issue is that it makes you feel uncomfortable**. \n\nTo protect yourself in case his behavior persists, document all your interactions, reduce 'personal' contact time (ignore his calls, respond to work-related questions only), and state your work boundaries (no contact during weekends, unless urgent). For the latter, sometimes a more subtle approach works better to get your point across (in a joking or witty manner) without your relationship turning sour. In any case, trust your gut and tell someone you trust (from the department).",
