  "text": "Hey y'all\\~ \n\nNeedless to say it's been a very rough year for quite a few people. I've felt tremendous pressure navigating studying abroad during the pandemic. I'm thankful that I'm vaccinated, and that I've actually made it to the destination country (it took me 6 months to get my visa). I've suffered academically due to being mentally and physically exhausted due to time differences- I was waking up at 3-4AM to attend online classes prior to moving down here two months ago. I'm doing my honors year in Anthropology (I want to make a career out of specializing in Visual Anthropology). I came up with a great topic for my honors research proposal, but have needed a rework to redefine and narrow the field of study. I'm half way through the course but I'm struggling with reformatting the rework. I've been exhausted and completely consumed with getting acclimated in the space and moving into accommodation (I've been airbnb hopping). I've redefined the scope in my head and I 'know' exactly what needs to be reformatted. Every time I sit down to begin writing I'm met with an overwhelming sense of panic I've never had before. I'm beating myself up about my academic capabilities. I know I can complete this project and do it well, I've just lost motivation while feeling suffocated by my programme. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI need to take an extra module next semester, which seems okay in isolation, but coupled with fieldwork, my license test, furnishing the house I've moved into while trying to make sense of being a graduate in a pandemic has made for an interesting cocktail of panic, confusion, apathy, and distress. I feel like I'm the one holding myself back, but at the same time I've been genuinely burnt out. I generally find motivation within what projects I tend to be working on. I feel like as soon as I start working on projects I initially love, I grow really bored of, even repulsed by, what I'm studying even though I have a genuine passion and interest for the subject. I don't know why this self sabotage is occurring. It's like the stress is completely clouding the positive, favorable aspects of why I'm choosing to study further in the first place. I need this project to be good, and I can't let myself continue to punish myself and the project any further (still in the conceptualization phases). I want to do well, and I know I can. I'm so- so jealous of others doing fieldwork that are able to respect and admire the project they've come up with. I do still have intrigue in mine, I just feel like I'm not in a space to promote my work because I don't feel like it's perfect. I want to be able to experience joy while doing this project. I felt this way during my undergraduate years as well. Till the end, I invested my soul into work I didn't love.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with loosing/regaining motivation? I really do need help and I'm open to suggestions and advice. \n\nThank you kindly\\~",

      "text": "I realise this feels like the last thing you could do and the opposite of what you think you need to do, but you need a break. You need to take a few days to recharge, clear the mind and get the creative juices flowing again. It's the law if diminishing returns, you're expending more and more mental energy for less and less return. Take some time out where you're not trying to achieve anything other than having a nice time.",

          "text": "Thanks for the insight :) I've spent some time away (house got fumigated so I had to move out), and it helped me with reorienting myself. I'm still not done with my rework and this 'break' has actually made me feel worse because I feel like I've been procrastinating. The tension is getting worse. I don't know if I'll ever have a break because classes begin again a week from now and it's full speed ahead from there. I genuinely feel like I'm at my breaking point but I really want to get everything done. I feel sad because I think I'm in desperate need of complete nothingness but it's a luxury I can't afford at the moment.",
