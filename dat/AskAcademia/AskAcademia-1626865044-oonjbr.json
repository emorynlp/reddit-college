  "title:": "Taken a leave of absence (LOA) from my PhD and I think I\u2019ve made a mistake..",
  "text": "(Very Long post, sorry!) I\u2019ll start by saying I\u2019m from the UK, and this is in the UK. \nBack in October 2020, I started a PhD in synthetic chemistry at one of the top universities in the UK, and pretty much from the get go, it\u2019s been turbulent. I joined during a pandemic, so I couldn\u2019t get out much, or meet anyone, so I already felt quite alone. In regards to the PhD, it became very apparent to me that my laboratory skills were lacking. I did achieve a first class honours MChem at my last university, but it was a rather rubbish department with an awful syllabus, so my practical skills were not up to the same standard as anyone else, so I had no confidence and I felt clueless. I would feel quite crappy every day when I got home, and this meant that I did no literature reading, or general theory reading outside of the lab. My supervisor is good, he\u2019s supportive and approachable, but there were times he would get a little exasperated if I didn\u2019t understand something/had a list of failed reactions. In February 2021, I had to take two months off on sick for an unrelated  issue, and when I came back in April, everything has gotten worse. I\u2019m mentally better, but I am physically exhausted all day every day, despite not overworking myself at all. I barely did a 5 day week, and no amount of sleep or rest made me feel refreshed.. on top of this, i was falling behind with a big report I had to write for my progression meeting, and almost a year in, I still haven\u2019t read any relevant literature or general organic chemistry. So I decided to take a LOA for 6 months to figure out if there is something medically wrong with me, await my ADHD assessment (that\u2019s another whole big thing that may explain it all), and generally catch up. Although this sounds like a good plan, I\u2019m panicking now I\u2019ve done this because a) I have to move hundreds of miles home due to LOA stopping your finances, so I lose the room I\u2019m renting, b) with all the interruptions, I feel like my first year is an absolute dogs dinner, so if I return, how do I fix this? c) I\u2019m not entirely happy with the project or city I\u2019m in (think it\u2019s under stimulating and boring), but I really DO want a PhD and I would be a fool to drop out/make a mess of this\u2026 I have no idea what to do, and maybe this LOA isn\u2019t a good idea.",

      "text": "PhD experiences vary heavily across disciplines, countries, research topics and workload. Regardless, starting a PhD during the pandemic is an immense challenge. Full stop. Doesn't matter who you are or what your ailments you may be experiencing. In addition to all the challenges, if you aren't entirely happy with the project or city, then consider this your free pass to walk away. This is your life. You can walk away and start again whenever you feel ready. Anyone who criticizes you for quitting during a pandemic or for any and all of those reasons you stated above is a heartless prick. Find the lessons you learned during this tumultuous time, take a break from agonizing over it, and if you find that you still want to continue with a PhD, your supervisor will understand. If they don't, find a new one with a more exciting project. You'll be that much further ahead with what you've learned in the last year. Chin up, you got this!",

      "text": "Don't worry too much about not having results within one year. Most PhDs I know in chemistry (in the UK), generated good results/papers during the 3rd and 4th year. Years 1 and 2 are mostly there to allow you to learn new techniques, see what works and what doesn't, etc.\n\nEven if you spend 3/4 years in the lab, there are still no guarantees that you will have any significant results. That is one of the realities of doing research. But even if that occurs, you will still be able to get your PhD, as long as you show in your thesis what you tried, what failed, etc (record everything!)\n\nIf you have ADHD things will be harder, but having a diagnosis & treatment will definitely help.",

      "text": "I took a relatively long LOA (+ some additional time part-time afterwards) from my PhD, and it was the best thing I had ever done for my research. My mental health was terrible. My stipend was finishing and my finances were terrible and coming from a poor family it was a real problem. I was doing my PhD abroad so it was even more of a problem because nobody could help me. I took a leave, found a job, and put everything else on the backburner. Here is what it did to me:\n\n* During that time, I actually earned some money. I purchased a new laptop which made my life a lot easier (there is something to say about having the right tool for the job). I also filled my bank account which means that I could afford a social life, a good gym, going to the movies, etc. Those small things add up, and they make life a lot more tolerable when you are stressed out\n\n* I focused on my health (joined a gym again!) and my mental health which means that I was revigorated\n\n* I took a step back from my research, which let me appreciate it even better. I had the time to read interesting textbooks and papers that were not directly related to my field. It actually let me develop an interest which turned into one of my new areas of interest\n\n* Taking a step back from my research, it \"unclogged\" my brain and let me see the big picture. When I joined the university back, I had so many ideas in my pipeline that I wrote 2 conference papers and 1 workshop paper in a few months\n\n\nIn the end your LOA will be what you make of it. It can be wasted time if you come back the way you left, or it can be a transformative experience if you use it as a springboard.",

      "text": "OP, though there are ofcourse many intricacies about your situation that only you know, this slaps me in the face as a broad mental health issue. I too did a PhD in the UK (native and still work in academia here) and had similar big doubts in my first year, almost left myself. At the time, I was constantly debating what to do, whether to take a LOA, quit altogether, change topics, all that. \n\nSince my PhD was the main thing in my life at that point (new city, few friends etc. Sound familiar?) I naturally assumed the reason why I felt shitty all the time was because the PhD wasn't right for me (I too felt physical symptoms, and thought I had an array of physical issues, which I did not). In hindsight, it was just deflection. My mental health was a pile of shit and I just couldn't deal with the new level of independence and relative solitude I found myself in. \n\nThe PhD was never the problem, my doing poorly at it was a symptom of my lacking a philosophy for life, an error which had caught up with me. I found myself bouncing back and forth between extremes and doubting everything. \n\nIn the end, I stayed on, didn't take a significant LOA (had the odd extra week off here or there, supervisor was understanding). As time went on I worked on myself, took up meditation and stoicism. It was a long road, it's been some 8 years and I'm still not obtained God like mental health, but I'm pretty fucking solid. \n\nPoint is, if I'd of left, permanently or a LOA, I don't believe I would of ever confronted the real issues and I'd still be stumbling through life being unassured and unsatisfied. I'm not saying this is right for you, but perhaps some of my story rings a bell.",

Whether you \"pass\" the test or not, it doesn't change your situation at all. Everyone has their own vices and you have to learn to deal with them irrespective of what a certificate may say.

      "text": "Hi. I think I can relate to what you're saying. I started my PhD in the US in the June of 2020. I'd just moved halfway across the world to an understimulating place (no social life of any sort) and no friends/family. The last six months have possibly been the most challenging period of my life. I developed a pretty serious drinking problem (which I think is under control now) and I couldn't get out of bed almost everyday. I've recovered pretty quickly over the last few weeks though. Although there are remnants from that shitty last year, I think it'll be gone in another few weeks. \n\nI still have trouble getting excited about my work. It's not what I hoped to be working on, but I'm trying to stay optimistic about it. My way of convincing myself that the work I'm doing now is relevant is to try and tie it to things that do excite me. \n\nYour leave of absence hopefully has helped you. I considered leaving for a few weeks as well, but I decided not to for various reasons. The best thing for me was getting a roommate who is passionate about his work. So bouncing ideas off of each other makes me excited about my work again and this has played a vital role in improving my life. \n\nI made a few penpals too and that has been amazing. Just to talk about stuff and decompress. \n\nI hope you'll be doing better soon, OP. If you think you could use a penpal, I'd be happy to exchange emails. \n\nHave a wonderful day :)",

Make the list something workable and just start tackling them. Any progress forward is better than progress backward. You have to be patient with yourself and allow for a moment to collect yourself.\n\nI think most programs allow for the idea that the work affects people differently and we all have our careers and lives started (to some extent or another) while trying to complete high level coursework. Set realistic goals and maybe some check-in appointments to follow up with those that you worked with in the program to find a way to possibly ease your way back into the everyday workings or a definitive date to bring you back. Don't forget, in your absence, other arrangements may have to be made, and life goes on without you there. Allow for them to meet their needs while you work through your LOA.\n\nI hope that things get back on track with you. Best of luck.",

Mainly cause I was interacting and meeting a bunch of new and interesting people during my first year. Then the pandemic hit with the lockdowns and I joined my thesis lab. Being so isolated and having only my research felt\u2026 off.\n\nThis is when I realized I actually don\u2019t \u201cenjoy\u201d research that much. I find it fascinating but that\u2019s it\u2019s not enough to make me feel fulfilled. Until I realized that recently I couldn\u2019t figure out why I felt so down since I\u2019m finally doing what I always wanted to do (or at least that\u2019s what I was lead to believe). Anyway, i decided to do some local volunteer work to at least bring back that social aspect I\u2019m really missing with my research. Plus it\u2019s a nice way to get your mind of the million things you have to do in the lab :) do you think something like that is possible for you? You mentioned some health issues but perhaps even virtual volunteer work?",

I spent months feeling exhausted and tired and put it down to the pandemic and the fact I was being bullied by another member of staff. Turned out I was anemic and I'm amazed by the difference iron tables have made to both my energy but also my mood and sense of resilience. \n\nI think you're being quite tough on yourself, but I would say now you've taken the LOA (which I think was smart btw) use the time to get yourself sorted. If you can get some therapy, I think building confidence and developing some skills to help you handle the slings and arrows of PhD life would do you good.",

I haven't started a PhD although have been building towards one for a while. I've worked on and off in research but don't have a Masters, which has made my imposter syndrome worse (and beyond that, my skills are definitely lacking in a number of ways, not only perceived). I have a great supervisor who I also think feels exasperated when I don't meet deadlines or need time off for poor mental health, which unfortunately has been often. I'm about to drop out of a project because I've taken too much on, and I'm absolutely terrified it's the wrong decision, though I'm sure if it were anyone else the decision would be clear to me. Reading your post made me think the same thing - a LOA sounds like the right decision given the issues you mentioned, and you will be able to go back with a clearer head, if that's what you decide to do. Good luck, I really hope things work out for you!",

There\u2019s only one way out of this and it\u2019s to grind. Not reading literature, patiently and slowly, writing your proposal, carefully and continently, are signals to me that apathy management may need to be addressed. \n\nGetting first class honours is no joke. But translating that to a PhD requires extensive discipline. You simply need to read and exhaust your fields literature on the topic you are researching. It does take a long time but phds are long things. \n\nI also get a sense of imposter syndrome? I can\u2019t help here are I don\u2019t agree with measuring yourself with others, but I understand this is a real phenomena that can disrupt wellbeing. \n\nIf anything the benchmark is high (because it\u2019s a PhD) and to become a peer with the leaders on the field, to contribute to their discussions, you need to be well versed. Nows your time to do that. Four years in the scale of things is not long, that is, if you want knowledge more than finance and social life style.",
