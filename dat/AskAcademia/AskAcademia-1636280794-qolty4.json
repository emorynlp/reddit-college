  "title:": "Publication- issues with order of citations in references with Mendeley !",
  "text": "Hi all. I\u2019ve been using Mendeley to cite references while writing my paper which has been accepted for publication.  \nIt requires some revision and adding/ deleting some references.\nThe numbers are not syncing correcting. Say I deleted reference no. 20; references no. 21 still stays as reference no. 21 and not 20. How do I fix this ? This is very frustrating and I am finding Mendeley Cite extremely slow.\nI am not keen to remove formatting to change this manually in case I need to do more revisions.\nI am using word 365 on MacOS Big Sur if that helps. \nPlease help! It is with switching to Zotero ?!",
