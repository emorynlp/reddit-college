  "text": "The number of questions that are obvious homework/quiz questions from undergrads always seems to go up this time of year (and the end of April).  Is it a social science problem (cause we write in text;  I can't imagine what trying to type a complex formula (double integrations anyone?) is like here) or do all subs for academic disciplines have this problem?",

However the second most common genre is probably \"look what happened when I mixed some shit together at home\", with it mostly being pretty harmless and sometimes being dangerous. Then with third place being \"how does this common home/workshop chemistry thing work\" or \"it isn't working please tell me what I'm doing wrong\", with 80% of the answers being wrong and sometimes hilariously so.\n\nI don't spend much time there and I don't think that many PhDs do. The last time I tried someone tried to (very incorrectly) tell me that I was wrong about a fairly basic matter in electrochemistry (I'm an electrochemist). They had no evidence and could verify what I was saying with a simple google search, but repeatedly refused even when I very patiently tried to walk them through it/suggest they might be misremembering.  \n\n\nEDIT: For whatever reason the sub looks like it has more interesting professional discussion going on right now, but I'm not going to buy that it's changed bunch  unless it stays that way for a while.",
