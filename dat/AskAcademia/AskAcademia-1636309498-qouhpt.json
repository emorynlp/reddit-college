      "text": "I did my PhD in the UK where the norm is 3 year (sometimes 4 years depending on the sponsor). One of the best things about a UK PhD is that because you have no classes you can focus on research more in-depth, so have potentially more opportunity to publish work from your PhD as a first author. Because you also do not have classes it's more flexible without set deadlines. I think fundamentally it's up to you, and more likely, up to the funding for your PhD, as to if you'd like to do more classes or if you want to focus on your area. In terms of graduates I've not seen a substantial difference in being an academic base on years, more commonly it's more closely related to the individual institutions and how independent a PhD student is during their degree.",

Level 6 research projects are usually small if you have them at all, and you\u2019d rarely have exposure to methods required for big projects at Level 8, especially if you want to be funded and not take A LOAN for the PhD (yikes). \nIt\u2019s not just about grades and how good your uni is like someone said below (trust me i went to one of the top russel group ones once and it was RUBBISH at research teachinf and riding on its own prestige) it\u2019s about level of skill and insight that can be applied for a PhD project without hand holding.

The formal requirement is that students can submit at least one year *after* their confirmation/transfer viva but before 4 years from the starting date.\n\nInternal funding tends to be for 3 years, but external is 3.5 (a more recent change) to account for the writing up. Depending on the field and department, there are usually norms of how long it takes. There is pressure for the students to finish by their 4th year. Otherwise, they need to apply for an extension or they simply get kicked out. Obviously, part-time PhDs are given\u2014and expected to take\u2014twice as much time as full-time PhDs \u2014though, they are rarely funded students.\n\nDoctoral Training Centres, set by UKRI quite recently, are structured for 4 years, as most (that I know of at least) of them require the student to take an embedded MSc in their first year and then go into the industry or another secondment for a year or two.\n\nNote, unlike the US, students are expected to work over the summer instead of going to internships. Most often than not, teaching is also optional and paid separately at an hourly rate with a limit of how much a student can do.",

Even with the most charitable assumption that you take a full 2 years of classes and teach in the remainder, they're equivalent. In reality nobody pulls less than ~20 hours a week of research during their class years and getting out in exactly 5 years is uncommon.",

This is assuming that you can find a supervisor willing to take you \u2014unlike the US, in the UK you apply directly to a specific project and supervisor. In STEM, nowadays, there are even Doctoral Colleges meant to help people to skip the MSc and instead do a one-year fully-funded MSc while retaining a doctoral student status. Still, the majority of PhD students have an MSc as funded positions are highly competitive to get.\n\nOnly Oxbridge, to my knowledge, actively requires either a four-year undergraduate degree or a masters to complement a three-year undergraduate degree. The latter is usually the recommended route for people with a 2:1 instead of a four-years undergraduate passed with 1:1 honours. Even this is a far more recent change than one would think.\n\nBachelors in top UK universities contain highly specialised courses in the third year. Classes for these courses are often shared with the master's students. The only difference is that the passing grade is 40 for BSc students and 50 for MSc students. However, I disagree about the 'lack of grad. coursework' being a long-term disadvantage.  You write a doctoral dissertation and publications.

After all, a paper is a contribution to the field and passed peer review before publication. It implies that the researcher had a sufficient understanding of the background needed to conduct said research. Unlike an assignment that needs, at best, impress whoever is marking it. In fact, in my time at a Public Ivy in the States, I was happy being a visiting grad. student who could focus only on my research instead of having to switch hats between a 'taught student' and a 'research one'. Same with in further visits and collaborations during and after my PhD with private-Ivy universities.\n\nConsidering that dissertations can be written either as publication portfolios (normal in some fields and institutions) or as monograms that capture prior work, I do not understand why you separate work done for a paper for work done for the dissertation research.\n\nIndeed, we have summer schools. Having taught in a few, I can state that they do not offer 'coursework' but rather hands-on state-of-the-art workshops.\n\nPS: In some places of continental Europe, e.g. Sweden, doctoral-level education does, unfortunately, require the student to take taught courses.",

Even with UK bachelors that may share courses in the last year with graduate students, which is common in the US anyway, these classes do not touch on research level subjects. Such topics classes also tend to be graded on projects that become an entry to research. Look, I\u2019m not saying the very best students need such structure, but all but the best tend to benefit from it, and it affects the quality of research they end up doing, at least in fields that rely on a lot of technical knowledge before students are truly able to make an independent contribution. Put another way, there\u2019s a reason why the EPSRC started introducing Doctoral Training Programs.\n\nMy strongest PhD students are generally the ones who have come in with substantial graduate level coursework, either with a formal Master's degree, or because they took a long of graduate coursework while an undergraduate. Otherwise, they spend more time working though our foundational graduate courses before they start delving into the special topics courses, and they take longer to graduate as a consequence, or they produce less deep and impressive research.",

                                      "text": "I think, our disagreement boils down to the different systems of admission and funding of a doctoral degree, which affects the selection process, and the strongman argument on having a 'long-term disadvantage'. \n\nIn Europe, including the UK, we admit students directly to specific projects as most of our funding comes externally. This is particularly true in STEM fields. We focus our ads, any prior pre-interview assignments, and interviews to figure out if the student has the skills relevant to the project in addition to more general field-related knowledge. We need to make sure that the student can produce the relevant deliverables agreed with our funding agencies. If it is an open call (usually departmental scholarships), then the applicant *needs to* send a research proposal that demonstrates scientific writing and an idea of a research plan.\n\nA good bachelor's degree can help you even with the latter. We had BSc students who ended up getting papers out of their final-year projects (which require a large research component if you want a first-class honours degree) or even from some advanced assignments. The students who will skip the MSc are also ones who have produced research plans to claim internships or otherwise engaged in prior research.\n\nIn the end, during the degree there is the question: should that person get a PhD? This is why the British and others in Europe have a 'go or no-go' viva early on. If the student has failed to demonstrate a clear research plan and understanding of the necessary background, then they may get kicked out \u2014sometimes with an MPhil and sometimes with nothing.  The point is that there are checks in place. \n\nPS: The DTCs were actually a political decision more than anything. They were introduced by UKRI through EPSRC and the other councils as a means of training homegrown talent. The UK realised the need to fill its major gaps in the industry, particularly due to their so-called 'hostile environment and, later on, Brexit. This is also why DTCs usually have very restricting quotas on how many scholarships they can hand out to non-British citizens.",

That may mean that a student has to pivot to archival data, simulations, or different but related observations, if the original plan doesn't work out or is rejected by the telescope's observing time allocation committee. This is really quite common; I have a few colleagues who were supposed to work with JWST observations and who obviously did something else. Usually there's a committee meeting with the supervisor and student at several points of the PhD where a student (or an ambitious supervisor) gets warned about how to manage their schedule.",

      "text": "I think it's worth distinguishing between three systems: US, UK and then the rest of Europe (or at least many other European countries).\n\nIn the US & UK you're a PhD student who gets a stipend. This stipend might be for the length of the PhD or you might have to apply for various bits of funding throughout the PhD (more common in the US I believe). In contrast, in most of Europe you're an employee. This generally means a better pay compared to the US/UK, as well as holiday pay, health insurance (if applicable), pension contributions, parental leave etc etc. Much of these concerns sound boring, but believe me when you reach your 30s and you realise you've never paid into a pension, these things suddely begin to feel like they matter. \n\nIf you're only concerned about the length of the PhD, then there are certain benefits to the 3-year PhD if you're sick of taking classes. The downside is that if you actually want to finish within 3 years you might have less time for teaching, side projects, etc. My experience at my 2 most recent UK university departments was that they seemed to hire more US and EU PhD grads because they often had more extensive teaching experience and sometimes more varied research experience than comparable UK PhD grads.",

          "text": "Correcting some misinformation in your post referring to US PhD students:\n\n1. **The amount you earn as a student in Europe vs. the US is too variable to compare; you need to narrow it down to individual departments**. For example, [ETH Zurich could pay up to USD 80K per annum](https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/working-teaching-and-research/welcome-center/employment-contract-and-salary/salary.html), while the [Max Planck Institutes could pay up to USD 40K per annum](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/wage-rise-for-max-planck-phd-candidates-approved/4013241.article). The [Stanford GSB pays USD 47K per annum](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/programs/phd/financial-aid), while [Carnegie Mellon University pays between USD 12K to USD 36K per annum](https://www.cmu.edu/stugov/gsa/Campus-Advocacy/Stipend-Report-2018-2019.html). Some of these stipends are for 9 months with the expectation that you will be away interning over the summer, and some are for 12 months.\n2. **Health insurance is mandatory by law for PhD students, and I do not know of any department that does not cover health insurance for its students.** Many departments also have paid parental leave, etc.. PhD students can also contribute towards pension funds, but contribution is not mandatory. Overall, the practical differences in benefits as a PhD student in the US and Europe can be negligible. Again, this is so variable, you need to compare specific departments.\n3. **The legal distinction between an employee \"salary\" and a student \"stipend\" does not exist in the US.** At the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in Germany (for example), a \"stipend\" is a special type of earning that is not taxed, and that is lower than an employee \"salary\". In the US, money you earn as a PhD student is as an employee of the university; you always have to pay taxes on it. In many departments, your pay comes from a combination of teaching assistantships (TAs) and research assistantships (RAs). In a few (well funded) departments, your pay comes without needing to do any work.\n\nMy bottom line is, you will struggle to find general differences between the US, UK, and Europe along the three dimensions above; you will have to narrow down to specific departments. You will find much bigger general differences along dimensions like graduate career outcomes and admission requirements.",

      "text": "Yes, between the US and Europe, PhD requirements are very different. Assuming that you already have a MS degree, European PhD's require very few, or at times no classes. Meanwhile, US PhD requires plenty of classes. If you don't have a MS degree already, that number of classes requires is even higher. Mainly this \"class requirement\" causes a great difference in the number of estimated years. What would be the consequence of getting a short PhD from Europe then? Some countries may cause trouble when accrediting your PhD, because their requirements are more fitting to that of US - involving many classes to be taken. So, you might want to consider where you'd like to go in the future - academia vs another direction, also which country etc.",

Therefore even though you don't need to take classes you often need more substantial research work.\n\nObviously there are vast differences between universities and fields in both US and EU.",

Classes at a PhD level are pretty much exclusively a North American phenomenon.\n\nThe single benefit I see from people applying for postdocs in our lab from USA is that because they\u2019ve been on the same project for seven years they tend to have a lot more publications and therefore experience on that particular subject matter.\n\nIf I had the qualifications and experience to get into a 3 year PhD program I would 100% go for the shorter option. \n\nIn terms of research output you are going to be more productive as a postdoc getting paid a generous salary sooner with a supportive team than struggling for those extra 2-4 years as a PhD student. So in the hypothetical 10 year picture at the same starting point: US graduate started PhD spent seven years got four or five publications on one project then started a postdoc in a new lab, three years, got one, maybe two publications in a new project. \nNon-US PhD graduate: three years, generated data for three publications, got one publication for graduation. Found postdocs, generated evidence they have a particular expertise in their own project design after seven years of postdoc, generated two more publications writing up their PhD data, got maybe one or two publications from their first three year postdoc, went on to one or two more postdocs with a lot of postdoc experience, and a research theme and probably funding of their own by now, a publication pipeline established and are churning out two or three publications of their own a year, for another four years.\n\nThe non-US option, if you qualify without having to include two years going a masters, is going to put you in a more competitive spot for tenure in the same window from commencement.",

You also generally get to avoid some of the problems the US has, like the clusterfuck that is our healthcare system. \n\nThe 5 year is nice because it (typically) includes a master's that is paid for with a stipend and the classes are often just things like keeping up with current lit, training in grant writing, etc that you'll need in an academic career rather than a \"real\" master's that will be more structured. You also can potentially take on a longer term project or more new methods with the extra time -- in some fields, it's really hard to get a meaningful project with an unfamiliar method done in under 3 years. You're more likely to get TA experience and if you're american, there will be more opportunities to apply for your own funding at US institutions. \n\nHonestly I would focus more on what sort of research you want to do/who you want to work with and where you want to live long term first. You aren't tied to a location, but will likely have a stronger network in whatever continent you go with so if you want to end up in the US, it can be easier to do your degree in the US and vice versa.

Though getting TA experience is a bit tougher to come by since it's not a baseline requirement for my funding, its by no means impossible to find opportunities to do so. In the end, I'm very happy to be going down this route as opposed to a 5-year PhD back home.\n\nThe peace of mind that comes with a real working contract, universal healthcare, 5 weeks paid vacation, and various other labor rights and social benefits accorded to employees in my country are also pretty incredible when you're coming at it from an American background. These are incredibly important factors for choosing a place to study, work, and live - you'd think r/AskAcademia of all places wouldn't get so riled up by legitimate criticism of the US healthcare system.",

Yeah I get downvoted every time I say this, come at me. 3 years is less than 5 years and they aren't even taking classes. They are doing what an American post bac does for free. That's hardly a doctorate. If you want to be an expert and know as much as possible, take the time to study under all the professors you can with peers who are in the same field and push yourself. Also American phds regularly work 70-100 hours a week between teaching, classes and research. Not the same.",

I don't see how class is necessary to earn the knowledge. But again, this might not be the case in other fields. Also, there's the teaching experience which is valuable and I wouldn't have it if I go to a European university.",

      "text": "So, as others have noted already, the \"3 year PhD\" comes with caveats, notably that in order to actually finish in three years with a strong academic record, you need a very good foundation either via an advanced masters degree or working as an RA under proper supervision. Ideally, for at least two years in either case. It seems difficult to get away from the fact that - bar extraordinary talent - at least five years of postgraduate work is required to mature into an independent researcher. So it all depends on your background.\n\nIf you have a masters and some serious research experience already (ideally even a publication) the 3-year option makes sense. You keep working on the research agenda you've already begun carving out for yourself, and you get to start working for a more respectable salary, sooner.\n\nIf you're straight out of undergrad, don't think a 3-year PhD is a shortcut, even if you're admitted, which is increasingly difficult these days with ever-stronger competition. You're young! Take your time, and a US PhD may be preferable since the stipend covers the coursework as well, while in Europe you may have to pay for a taught masters, especially if you're not an EU citizen.",

So, the three-year option makes more sense to me. But still, I feel like I can publish more in the 5-year one, unless the coursework is so intense that I wouldn't have the time, which I don't think is the case. \n\nThis is all speculation tho. It's much more probable that I will get into the three-year one, because I've spoken with the supervisors and we're working on an idea right now, it's *almost* guaranteed, but they told me to apply to other universities in case this doesn't work. And I'm applying to three other universities, two in US and one in Canada, and I have no idea if I'll get admitted or not.",
