  "title:": "Advice for a Postdoc Interview (junior PI standpoint)",
  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI am a postdoc in a small lab (3-5 people) of translational medicine, with the two main PIs being clinicians. I am in charge of the basic science (cell biology, biophysics) section of the lab, so even if the roles are not very defined, I should be somehow a junior PI. Finally, after the group got some grants, my PIs agreed that it's now time to hire someone new for basic science and I am in charge of the interviews for postdocs.\n\nI've done these interviews in diferent contexts, for example as a normal lab member or a PhD student, but it is my first time I will actually be evaluated by the postdoc candidate as his/her PI or supervisor. \n\nThe lab was launched in 2018 (no starting package), and COVID-19 slowed a lot of things down in the past couple of years, so I am afraid the candidate will be discouraged by such a small lab and will eventually go somewhere else to boost the publication records with much less effort.\n\nWhat are the most relevant points to consider in these interviews? How can I avoid to discourage a postdoc since our lab recently launched and it is quite small?",

It's something that tends to make postdocs (especially newer ones) very nervous.",
