That's something that I didn't understand initially but as I progressed through my PhD, the whole thing felt like a giant mistake especially when I saw my peers had already gotten married, bought houses, and doing other 'adult' stuff while I was sitting miserably in the lab late at night wondering why my data didn't make sense. People say don't compare yourself to others because it's unhealthy (which I agree) but it's almost impossible when you feel like everyone around you is moving forward while you're stationary. I always joke that many people thinking about getting a PhD at some point, but only a few of us are actually dumb enough to actually go through with it. \n\n>If I could do it all over again, I'd go back and get a BS in computer science--take a programming job and call it good.\n\nBro, are you me?

I wish I had a CS degree, so that I could get a programmers job at a tech company, then call it.\n\nWarning: rant and possible /r/iamverysmart material ahead. tl;dr Sounds like grass is greener syndrome.\n\nJust for some perspective, I'm a graduating CS undergrad getting a masters degree (and eventually/hopefully a PhD) to pivot into biomedical research. I used to be all enamored with big tech and getting paid a shit ton of money for working probably not even 40 hours a week (if you're efficient) at a company people oggle over, but I realized this past year that I HATE software development. I don't care if you pay me $300k in total comp, I don't want to be the guy whose job it is at Facebook to make a tiny subsection of their the website just a little more blue because my boss told me that some HCI study shows that it increases traction by 5%. And you couldn't pay me enough to work at Amazon. And that's just for \"cool\" companies. I can't imagine a worse job than having to drudge through UML and ERD diagrams for like a health insurance company or something all the while being beaten over the head with agile or six sigma or whatever trendy project management style the company middle management thinks they need to shove down developer's throats. Obviously I'm being hyperbolic but I feel like the same sentiment applies anywhere I go - even if I'm working for a cool biomedtech startup, I'm just a cog in a machine building something that someone else told me to make. \n\nI had a professor in the CS department at my school who realized the same thing. He used to work at IBM on Watson prior to academia, and as a sophomore I used to ask him \"dude, you could so easily get a job at DeepMind or Google Brain, why the heck are you here at a middle-tier university far outside of any big tech hub\". He said that he couldn't stand the banality and bureaucracy of working for a company and much prefers the freedom of directoring his own research (grant-writing, student advising, college-administration-dealings aside). He's a pretty smart guy and has obviously worked hard to be in the position he is now, but this past year I had a major epiphany and realized \"wow, he's right. He's not that crazy for wanting to stay in academia and not big tech after all.\"\n\nAnyways, I fully realize that in 10 or however many years I'll lose my naivete and truly realize how soul-crushing the work can be to stay in academia, but for now I'm following what I truly want to do. I don't want to sell myself short.",

There is intense work and competition involved in getting drafted and then working your way through your rookie contract. Then you land a life-time contract. After that, how hard you work at your craft is up to you and your goals. Most people like what they are doing, want to stand out, and work hard. Some people are Tom Brady's, others coast...\n\nThe most important thing for me is that I am reaching my 60's and there are still things I really want to do at work while my friends, no matter how much money they make, can't wait to retire.",

I didn't have enough time or energy to even get all of the work-related things done that I wanted - including spending extra time helping students, improving course materials, or working on research projects. And that's not even counting administrative responsibilities that I didn't have as a junior lecturer, but most of my colleagues had to do also. Hobbies? Exercise? Forget it!\n\nI'm really glad I went through grad school (computer science) and got the research training experience because that has proven extremely valuable. Now I work in industry and, at least at my current job, have a _much_ better work life balance (not all industry jobs are like this of course).",

Even the happy professors who try to sell an academic life to grad students were sending emails at 2am on a regular basis, drank 5 cups of coffee a day, and never actually got to be in the lab doing the work that motivated them to pursue that career in the first place because of all the administrative responsibilities. If a professor did have a hobby it was very low maintenance, such as collecting whiskey, or growing indoor plants.",

There is a stronger focus on work-life balance here compared to the US. But if I wanted to, I have more than enough lab and manuscript writing to do to keep me busy all day everyday. With that said, I have to take efforts to prioritize my non academic interests. So I am getting out cycling 50km 1-2x during the week and usually a 100km ride on the weekend. I\u2019m prioritizing making time outside of work to socialize with people. Unless I have a hard deadline for something, I try not to work after 6 or on the weekends.

I know if I only counted the weeks proposals were due, weeks before major conferences, exam weeks where I have lots of grading responsibility and etc, I'd feel like I worked 80 hours a week, when in reality it is closer to 40.",

Personally, I've had lots of time for hobbies and exercise during both grad school and postdoc -- lifting 1-2h a day maybe 3-4x per week, usually around 5-10 miles of walking per day (during which I'd talk to friends / family / partner or listen to audiobooks / podcasts), maybe an hour, sometimes two of video games / TV / movies a night, usually a few hours of reading random non-work things a day, lotsa cooking, and every weekend at least one full-day hiking trip.\n\nMy advisors throughout were also all very into life-work balance, being married with kid(s), clocking in and out on a strict 9-4 schedule with little-to-no work on the weekends barring unusual circumstances (usually a fast approaching deadline every few months). With some caveats though -- e.g. they both had tenure. In the US, fwiw, w/ PhD in Anthropology and now a postdoc in Computational Biology.",

I have a great deal of flexibility in my job, and think many people overinflate how busy/hardworking they are because that's what we're taught to do in academia. In reality, the people responding to this thread have time to browse reddit and if you click through their profiles, many of them are very active, so they have more free time then they describe (or at least count procrastinating to their work hours). \ud83d\ude09  I try to be more honest with myself about \"actual hours worked\" and I'd say on a typical day it can be anywhere from 2-5 hours of actual work, with a few more hours in meetings/talks etc.... \n\nThat said, when a paper or project deadline is approaching or something appears on my desk with little warning (which happens a lot more in academia than in industry, given how siloed everyone is) I can spend a solid week getting up early, shoveling some oatmeal, hoping on the computer and working till 11/12 pm then doing it all again the next day. \n\nThis never happened to me in my previous government and private sector jobs. In those, I pretty much worked consistent days and was done when I clocked out.\n\nAcademia gives you a lot more flexibility depending on the job you choose. I am a specialist in an extension center at a university, but I am mostly on local grant projects and working on curriculum development for the grad program. I'm not tenure track, nor do I want to be. While non TT jobs don't come with as much respect, they tend to fly a bit more under the radar, allowing you to craft your own job and schedule a bit more. That's what I've done here, and my only complaint is sometimes having too little guidance.\n\nSo yes, I think I have decent balance normally. Covid has messed it up some since I work from home. \n\nI am not incredibly happy in this job, but that has less to do with the job and more to do with my boss not being a great manager (also very common in academia unfortunately)\n\nI think I am underpaid from a competitive market standpoint, but not underpaid for the hours I actually put in (I would work harder if I was paid more, but have learned in previous jobs that killing yourself really doesn't gain you much). Being grant funded is also somewhat stressful, as my % appt can fluctuate year to year, but I'm working on managing that more closely.",

Term faculty earn the same salaries as TT with equivalent experience and receive the same benefits. <5% of our faculty are part-time contingent so most of our non-TT faculty earn full salary/benefits.\n\nSo sure, contingent labor dominates in many types of institutions and is treated poorly more often than not. But those conditions aren't universal...the problem is the places that aren't relying on contingent faculty are usually smaller and are certainly small in number. It's important, though, to recognize that exploiting part-time faculty is a *choice* made by institutional leadership and not any sort of natural order in higher ed because there are ample examples of schools that aren't run that way.",

          "text": "I have a family member who's a recently retired prof, in his early 70s. Career-wise, I get the sense he's very satisfied. He was known as a highly reputed teacher, contributed some well-received scholarship and got to research his obscure pet interests to no end. He's still working on research now. Financially speaking, it was a long ride but he eventually was able to make a pretty nice salary for a while and will get a decent pension. \n\nEverything-else-wise, it doesn't look quite as pretty, from an outside perspective at least. His relationships with family and friends are not so great. He prioritized his work far more than his relationships (and his own health) and he's now reaping the effects of that decision. It's painful to watch. Books might keep you company, but they're no substitutes for well-nurtured relationships with real, live people. I suspect establishing work-life balance early on will make for a much more comfortable death bed (dark, I know).",

I don\u2019t think I make as much as I could in industry, but I do enjoy the work, job security, and benefits.  The flexibility can\u2019t be beat either. Even though I do make enough to live in a large city, it\u2019s tight sometimes. I have to work summers and winter\u2026 but\u2026. It\u2019s not that big of a deal. Tenure track faculty sometimes complain about teaching during the breaks but come on, people work through summer all the time and I still have half the summer left when I teach summer. I\u2019m going through a divorce (not related to how much I work, I swear) and I\u2019m temporarily putting some projects on hold and stepped off some committees. I have so much free time (even with a 5 year old) that I don\u2019t know what to do with it. It turns out a lot of that work was fabricated by me. Well also because I was doing my best to get tenure. The hardest part of academia is landing a tenure track position. The part time faculty/lecturer life is rough in terms of poor pay and workload. If you\u2019re considering academia, simultaneously plan for an industry job (get internships, volunteer, learn relevant skills, network, etc..) so that if academia doesn\u2019t workout you can bail.   \n\n\nI\u2019m glad I did it, I love my job, would I do it all over again? \u2026. That\u2019s a hard one. It\u2019s a risk. Just be prepared with options.  \n\n\nI just noticed the part about you being a teen. I wrote this thinking you were an undergrad or grad student. Hah. Well, you\u2019re looking way ahead. Keep in mind even when you choose a field there are so many options within that field. Like psychology. Students pick this major because they\u2019re interested in therapy, but if you\u2019re interested in tech as a psych major you could go into human factors or industrial organizational psych and work at a tech company.

Or rather put, it depends more on you as a worker than on the team or the heads of lab. The difference being that (in Europe) you are not _really_ pressured by anyone else to do anything, and you are very much left to your own devices. Whereas in a company, the hirearchical links are much stiffer, with orders and results moving upwards and downwards along the chain, and everyone wants everything for yesterday. Also, if your work is not good, you're bound to have to deal with the consequences, because you're putting everybody's ass on the line. Work never disappears. When it's done, there's always more to do. When it's not done in time or is done badly, it becomes one more problem for your supervisor, and even more work for your colleagues.",

      "text": "I just finished my Master's degree, which in all honestly was more akin to a PhD in terms of workload. Here are my ratings from that time:\n\nFree time for hobbies: Almost none. I realized a year in that I could no longer answer the question, \"What do you do for fun?\"\n\nExercise: Same. I used to work out regularly and climb competitively. I was too exhausted to keep up even a light routine at most times.\n\nWork-life Balance: I would say I usually spent 10-12 hours working each day, and most of the rest feeding myself, cleaning, etc. I lost touch with friends who were not in my department because much of my socialization time ended up becoming a roundtables of venting about how horrible grad school is. My adviser was a big proponent of one day off a week though, so I took Sundays off. Sounds nice, but this inevitably caused me to fall behind those students who worked every day.\n\nHappiness: I will admit some of the high points in my life have come from academia. However, they were free and far between and I fell into a regular cycle of depression and eventually became suicidal until I was able to start seeing a therapist. This was a result of over working, financial stress, lack of social support, and imposter syndrome. And majorly, I suffered sexual assault and the suicide of a loved one during this time and was not given adequate leaniency or time to process this traumas. Gotta keep working, through everything.\n\nPay: Atrocious. Tenure track professors live comfortably, yes, but I have spent the last few years scraping to pay rent and nearly lost my home once the pandemic hit. I also could not afford health insurance and most grad positions do not support you over the summer, even if they expect you to work on research during that time.\n\nThe thing I wish had been drilled into me harder was the time frame of when all this would end. I had been told that it would be hard but tenure is worth it. But over my time in grad school it has become abundantly clear that I was not going to gain the respect, time, academic freedom, or personal freedom, to find myself in a happy job situation until I reach tenure. Realizing that I am nearly thirty and have at least another 7-10 years before I get to feel stake and secure, financially and emotionally, is a large reason why I have decided to take my career on a different path. For me, it is not worth sacrificing my emotional stability, personal relationships, hobbies, and physical health for a job that I may or may not get in another decade.\n\nOP, I hope that reading these replies gives you some perspective. Please be aware also that COVID has shaken the University system to its roots-- universities are strained for money and are recovering by:\n\n1. Laying off critical support staff and shifting many of their duties to grad students and professors, shaving off more free time for those positions.\n2. Reducing pay or increasing teaching workloads for grad students. This will also reduce the quality of teaching you receive as an undergraduate.\n3. Downsizing hiring for tenure track professors, which increases competition in an already savagely competitive field.\n4. Reducing funding for undergraduate research opportunities, which may make it difficult to stand out as an academic fighting for one of the above positions.\n\nAlthough the pandemic may be in decline soon, there is no telling how long these changes may last. It could be years, if you think about the money universities have lost from having little to no on-campus housing for nearly two years. That's their major source of income.\n\nThat is not to say all paths to academia are horrible. But if you do go for it, please do your research and be sure that you find mentors who support student/life balance. Be sure to speak with their mentees and confirm that the adviser does not expect you to dedicate the entirety of your life to academia, or you may risk the borderline cruelty and burn out that have turned so many of us away.",

But I guess I have some bits to share. \n\nAfter being engaged in several projects, I eventually \"leveled up\" and was able to get into bigger projects along the way, mostly through the relationships I've built with the professors in my college. They trust me because I get the job done, even if I don't have a master's or PhD yet. \n\nSo my work-life balance is also a little different. I honestly have more time for myself because I try not to overwork even if I'm a freelancer. \n\nBut generally speaking what I notice in the academe (at least in my context) is that administrative responsibilities usually overshadow research work. A lot of professors in my university are preoccupied with administrative work instead of increasing research productivity. So that's one aspect that affects their work-life balance. I think it's a bit different in western countries because research productivity is already part and parcel of the culture. \n\nAnyway, I don't know if this even is useful info. Bottom line is, I honestly have mixed feelings with academia and I can't wait to leave and work in the industry. I have to finish my master's though before I do that.",

But if you feel like you're defined by more (eg. wanting to socialise, into scrapbooking, enjoy playing the theremin, playing baseball just for the hell of it, etc...), maybe figure something else out because you'll be expected to compromise more and more of yourself as time goes on.   \n\n\nYou might be tempted to think \"I don't mind compromising certain things if I get to unravel how a little corner of the universe works\" but that's a trap - there'll be days where your passion for something becomes torture.

My example below is related specifically to my experience in academic libraries -- but it's worth noting our librarians have faculty status and teach in many undergrad courses. \n\n**Why I got into academia and out of public libraries:** public libraries caused major burnout for me due to an incompetent boss and very low pay. I was offered a great management-level position (not faculty) at a local college where I could afford to take lots of vacation time and get my masters in library science. From the day I started, the idea of me becoming/being promoted to a faculty librarian/college archivist was tossed around as we knew our library archivist (faculty) was going to retire. I was under the impression there would be upward mobility in this role to a faculty position. It turns out that is not the case. \n\n**Why I want out of academia and back to public libraries:** Perhaps I'm just disillusioned since I'm not a total newbie anymore, but administration isn't here for us and it's showing. There's an anti-faculty sentiment at my institution (and in academia in general) that has caused a lot of faculty to leave the college in recent years. They are being replaced by adjunct faculty which are positions with no benefits. Our recent librarian's retirement has put a lot of burden on staff-level positions. And now we're being told that it won't be filled -- six months later. I'm tired & feel personally slighted by this. \n\nTo specifically answer your questions, I currently have no free time outside of work and grad school. Whatever free time I do have is spent multitasking between what I *want* to do and what I *have* to do. I don't have kids but am married and own a house. I don't think I could do this at all if I did have kids. \n\nAm I happy with my life? Sure! I love owning a house and gardening and cooking and all that fun stuff. But am I happy with my job? Not so much. I love the idea of academia, but in reality I am too tired to keep fighting to pursue it. I don't want a lifetime of uphill battles against administration who just wants to slash our budgets and staffing even more. It weighs too heavily on me when I'm not at work and that's how I know I have to get out now. \n\nI'm 29 years old and feel lucky that I've come to this conclusion this early in my life. I won't tell you to not pursue academia if you truly want to, but just remember that it's going to be a struggle a lot of the time and it's okay to not be okay with that.",

I have a lot of freedom to pursue things I am passionate about so even when there is a lot of \"work\" there, I am often happy to be doing it.  I do have trouble not working in off hours at home, but a lot of this is often work like grading or making homework solutions and I tend to have on trashy TV while I'm doing that. I get the impression that I make myself available after hours to students more than my colleagues, but this is by choice rather than by demands from anyone above me.\n\nMy stress is any given term mostly depends on how many classes I'm teaching and how much service work has fallen into my lap at a given time. I have a tendency to say \"yes\" to a lot of service work, especially if it directly affects students so there are times during the year when due dates just all seem to hit at once and I feel like I don't have time to relaxation and family. But there are others when my teaching level may be lower and I don't have anything pressing and I feel like I can leave work at work and enjoy life more.\n\nFor compensation, I think that given my institution type I am paid pretty well. I am at a large, public university in a state that funds public education well. Our union is strong and I get super good benefits and a pension. These weren't things I thought to care about when doing my initial job search but now I feel like a real adult because I realize how good my benefits are.\n\nIf you do go into academia you will find that a lot of this depends on the institution type, department culture, country, etc... I did my post-doc at a national lab in Australia and that is a place that takes separation of work and home life pretty seriously. Everyone worked 9 - 5, took nice coffee breaks, and had a lot of vacation.",

      "text": "It comes in cycles: I'm off contract from June-August so have \"total\" free time in summers, though I'm also supposed to be doing my research/writing (without pay) during those months. But I can walk away from my office in May and not go back until fall if I want to. Same thing for ~4 weeks at Christmas break each year. So that's a pretty good deal, call it 12-14 weeks of complete free time as long as you keep up your research productivity.\n\nDuring the academic year it's quite different. Pre-tenure faculty at my school tend to work 60+ hours a week, including a lot of night/weekend hours, as they are under pressure to teach well and publish. After tenure the pressure relents a bit but service demands explode...so much of your work week might be spent in committee meetings, leaving you to do the research and teaching prep at night/weekends. I've been tenured longer than OP has been alive but I still work 40-50 hours a week during the semesters, and occasionally a lot more when grading or a writing deadline comes up.\n\nI think faculty in general are grossly underpaid compared to professionals in other fields. To make myself feel better I am always trying to remember that I have a lot more time off/free than any doctor or lawyer I know. Work/life balance on the whole is outstanding during summer/breaks and often pretty bad during the regular academic year. The flexible schedule is a bonus though, so I can (for example) almost always manage to get to all my kids' school events as it just means I have to work late into the night afterward.\n\nAll that said, the odds of anyone who is now in high school having the opportunity to experience the sort of career path I have (TT job at 30, full professor at 42) are vanishingly slim. The jobs are going away and the pressure on administrators to keep their schools \"nimble\" (meaning easy to fire faculty when they aren't needed) is only going to increase post-COVID as we approach the demographic cliff mid-decade. I would not advise anyone to plan on a traditional academic career at this point as I don't think the odds are good they'd have one.",

Full-time academics find the work-life balance a lot more difficult.\n\nI get paid a decent wage for what I do, but one of the things that annoys me is that the stability of the job is poor as it is casual. I do not get any benefits, despite having worked at the university for the past 5 years. It also makes it difficult for me to get a home loan.Even though I receive a good wage another crappy thing is a lot of unpaid work is expected. For example, if a student contests their mark and wants a reassessment I do not get paid to reassess their work. I run some units but it takes way more than the 30 hours that semester that I get paid for to update the content and deal with difficult cases of students (e.g., plagiarism).\n\nAs for research, the most I have received is a one year contract and the pay was lower. I did get time, and mostly enjoyed what I was doing up until I had a new manager. Again, I went part-time though so it's difficult for me to make that judgment.\n\nMy advice would be to give something like this a go, but have a back-up or another pathway you can do. I know people who are practicing as psychologists but then are also doing research work, and teaching when they want to. You'll have an excellent wage, but you can choose what you want to do, and if things get shit you can leave, and fall back on the other job.",

I live in a place with many schools, so I know maybe a thousand other professional staff. And if you expand your question to include people like us, you're talking about a self-selected bunch who were willing to take good but lower-paying jobs in order to have great work-life balance. You'll find a lot of people who are overqualified in fact, because they were burnt out in the private sector, or needed a job where full-time could, in practice, mean 10-4 because of family needs. Supervisors' attitudes vary of course, but more often than not they have the feeling of \"You and I know what you need to get done. Let me know if it's too much. But don't let me know if it's too little.\"\n\nThis is less the case as you move up the chain or have deadline/revenue-driven roles, like you might in a school's professional education program or a different work culture like a business school.\n\nPay stinks but benefits can be very good. I've got 20 days off (we don't break it out by sick/personal/vacation), every holiday, an unofficial break between Christmas and New Year, a 401(k) _and_ pension, discounts on everything from theater tickets to bus passes, dirt cheap basic and supplemental life insurance, tuition reimbursement for career-related classes...\n\nBut all of us and our schools have to ask ourselves, \"Is this worth, say, $15,000 less income every year and few chances for advancement?\" The staff employment market has mostly sorted out that answer, in part because enough people say no. A problem in the faculty employment market (not individually) is that not enough people knew to say no before they decided they wanted a Ph.D. Schools offer great benefits to professional staff because they wouldn't have qualified applicants otherwise.

To be successful in academia, you have to be highly independently motivated. At the same time, to have work-life balance, you have to know when to pause the work to go have some fun or take care of non-work responsibilities. This seems to be a tough balance for many people to strike. There is always more work to do, and no one will tell you to take a break (and some people love to brag about how much they are working, so you could feel guilty if you don't do the same). When you love what you do, it also doesn't always feel like work, so you can get sucked into more and more projects because you love the topic, want the recognition, enjoy your students and collaborators, etc. I'm still learning how to say no to projects, but it's really nice to have so much flexibility in how I spend my time and in my ability to choose what to work on. I think I lucked out having a family when I started my career, which kind of forced me to get used to prioritizing my life as well as my work.

      "text": "Well. I'm not a Prof and this contradicts most of what the profs are saying BUT\n\nMy mentor is extremely busy but balances her personal and non academic life very well with her work. She has lots of research going on, but she is also very active with her daughters volleyball team, her family, etc. She travels a lot both for her daughter and for research and she is extremely busy near constantly but she seems very satisfied with her balance and it seems she is able to make time for the things she wants to. All my professors seem to be at least somewhat like this. \n\nThat said, I go to a small teaching university so they are not research heavy and I'm sure things are different here. Point is, it is possible I think and my professors are not terribly different from normal people with regards to their work/life balance. I think you just have to make it happen for yourself and choose where to work based off of how well that fits with the balance you would most prefer. I aim to be a researcher one day, hopefully at a more research oriented university, and I plan to have SOME things going on outside of work.\n\nAny actual profs who know for a fact I'm totally wrong, feel free to tear this apart.",

      "text": "Well, during the week I have very few time (go to work around 9 AM and go out around 5/6 PM, back home in around 30 minutes, cook, shower and sleep) and in weekend I prefer to rest or clean the house, although in the last 3 weekends I'm going out with a friend.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that I enjoy playing PC games way less (probably because I work often next to a computer) and I started to read way less when I'm in bed (probably because I read a lot of papers or books in academia or when I was studying in my BsC and MsC, but I want to start to read some mangas and comics).\n\nIn general, my work-life balance is so-so now, but it might also be because I live abroad in a country (Taiwan) with a very different mentality (especially work-wise). from the country I come from (Italy).\n\nI'm moderately happy with what I do; I think the 9-to-5 mentality is present in all the jobs and pressure can vary according to what you want to do, but I think (very personal opinion) there is stress and pressure in any job, no matter what you want to do. It's true tho that in academia people push you a lot to get results (aka papers).\n\nAbout earning enough, well...I'm a PhD student and my scholarship is basically the average Taiwanese salary. If it wasn't for the huge Taipei rent, I guess I would like my salary more. But I'm able to pay for my expense and enjoy good food, so I guess it's alright for now.",

      "text": "I do social science research at a UK university. My work-life balance is good. I don't get paid what I should compared to other industries. I'm generally pretty happy because i like the people I work with day-to-day, and I like having a job where my intellectual ideas are valued and I have a lot of autonomy. I know people in academia who have terrible work-life balance. Some of them are the over-achievers that are clearly going places, while others are people who are very passionate about their research topic but probably aren't ever going to be appropriately rewarded for their commitment.\n\nI'm leaving academia for a public sector research/policy job soon. The pay will be a little better, but the main reason I'm changing sector is for job security. My new job will be permanent, while my current job offers very little security. Academia just isn't structured to provide job security, in my experience. I've been lucky to stay in the same position for a long time, but generally academics move around a lot. It can be exciting, and it makes universities interesting, diverse places to work, but it's difficult if you want to build a family at the same time.",

      "text": "Here\u2019s my untenured academic perspective. I work in academia as an untenured teaching professor and I love my job. I got a PhD in engineering from a great school and luckily landed a teaching job in a cool area. I love teaching but I got burned out by research during my PhD and I\u2019m not interested at all in a tenured research job. Personally I think tenure has broken academia because people that aren\u2019t doing a good job should find other employment for everyone\u2019s benefit, just like it would be in any other industry. I think tenure is a perverse incentive that promotes research above teaching and service, though there are definitely some people that are able to balance all three goals well (hats off to them!). I\u2019ve been on multiple hiring committees for my medium-sized university and can tell you that\u2019s it\u2019s extremely difficult to land a tenured job at a good school - insane competition.\n\nMy job is basically to teach young engineers how to design, analyze, and build things, which I love. I work hard during busy times but have plenty of free time for hobbies, exercising, and have a pretty good work life balance. I love being my own boss and having summers off. I\u2019m really happy overall and want to do this indefinitely. I earn just enough to be satisfied. There are diminishing returns beyond $80k/year (depending on the area), and I can work over summer to make more if needed. I also work on startup ideas and consulting on the side. I don\u2019t miss having to writing grants or writing/reviewing journal papers (a big reason why I didn\u2019t do tenure track). One warning: most universities don\u2019t pay teaching faculty or lectures well since they simply don\u2019t value teaching as much as research (comes down to money). Adjunct salaries are a complete joke. It\u2019s insulting to work hard for a PhD only to have a university offer $50-$60k to teach - less than a typical undergrad makes right out of school. This happened to me and almost made me skip academia entirely before I landed my current job.\n\nI would only get a PhD if you love teaching and/or research. Getting an MS or desire-able BS degree is usually the sweet spot for the vast majority of people.",
