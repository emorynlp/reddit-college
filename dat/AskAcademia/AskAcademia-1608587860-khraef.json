  "text": "I'm about to be a second semester grad student who started out in a complete honeymoon phase. I was absolutely loving everything I was learning and feeling excited to produce writings and projects to reflect my new knowledge. But im a huge perfectionist who puts far too much time into my work. Im also obsessing over having the perfect grad school experience. There is a lot I want to get out of this opportunity...fellowships, certificates in skills to make me more marketable once I graduate, a hella good thesis, etc. I feel proud of this opportunity but I just don't want to burn out too early. \n\nAny advice from those with similar perfectionist tendancies?\n\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your responses and the feelings of solidarity! And thank you for the award! I wish everybody well in their journeys throughout academia.",

I quickly learned that trying to be perfect in everything will burn you out fast especially with the load you\u2019ll have as a grad student. What has turned things around for me (and made me a lot happier) is the realization that my self-worth isn\u2019t tied to...take your pick, whether it be grades, publications, level of internships etc. So you\u2019re just going to have to learn to let go of that with practice or eventually every achievement you may have will feel hollow because it wasn\u2019t \u2018perfect\u2019 or someone has done/achieved more than you. It\u2019s hard work to change your mindset but it\u2019s well worth it.",

That didn\u2019t seem to matter much anymore and part of my slump was that, well if it doesn\u2019t actually mean much, what am I doing any of this for? After that I started to slow down and tried to enjoy the actual process of learning and education instead what it may mean in terms of recognition from others. So I\u2019m much more accepting of myself now if my work isn\u2019t \u2018perfect\u2019 or if I\u2019m not keeping up with peers who are killing themselves as long as that means that I\u2019m able to enjoy my life.",

Particularly in the humanities and social sciences, when grad students obsess about perfection in their written work, they ask for extensions and have difficulties finishing things on time.  \n\nLetters of recommendation for grad students who have a hard time meeting deadlines are not going to be excellent. \n\n(I cannot speak to lab-based work, where perfection might be valued. I hope someone in the lab sciences weighs in here.)",

Some of these reasons aren't really your fault (it was competitive, the reviewer was a bit of a dick, etc.). Rejection can be quite a blow to your confidence.\n\nFor me, it helped to think of these submissions as asking for feedback rather than asking for validation. If I get a \"no\" as the answer I now think of it as \"not yet, but here's some feedback about how it could be accepted next time\". This doesn't always work, I must admit, but when peer review works properly it means that you don't need to submit work that *you* think is complete. Instead you're asking the community for a status check. At some point, if you're a perfectionist, they'll surprise you by saying \"yes\".",

Let's be absolutely clear; the thesis is part of your requirement to complete your PhD, but it is one of the least important resaearch documents you will produce as an academic. It is not properly peer reviewed, if anyone ever cites it you will be in a minority.  \n\nYou are coming in to graduate school to learn how to become a researcher; that means what you produce now will never be as good as the stuff you should be able to produce at the end. And the stuff that you produce in 20 years time should be better still because you will have a lot more experience and understanding. So realise that it is impossible for anything to be \"perfect\". If you pin your hopes on perfect you will either never get anything submitted for publication, or you will be destroyed on the receipt of your first peer review. Both of those outcomes are bad; your role as a researcher is to use research funding to further our understanding, and that is done through publishing your findings.  No paper is perfect. No set of experiements is ever complete. \n\nAnd as /u/IamRick_Deckard mentioned - you might want to explore addressing anxiety issues early. Mental health in grad school is no joke.",

      "text": "Well done for getting to this place in your career. It's not easy.\n\nWhat has helped me with my perfectionism was changing how I interact with my research. Everything I did was tied to my self-worth, so any time anything went wrong, I saw it as me being bad at what I do and even being a bad person who was lying to everyone about my value as a scientist, and I didn't deserve to be there. It got to the point where I'd convinced myself that everyone in my department thought I was a terrible scientist when I don't even talk to most people in my massive department.\n\nThe change came when my father suggested I see my research as a project that needs to be completed and is simply a task required of my job as a grad student. Seeing it as a project for my 'job' that has nothing to do with who I am and everything to do with simply meeting the requirements set out for me really helped with separating my self-worth from the day-to-day fluctuations of my research. I still struggle, but I'm learning to ask for more help (and my supervisor won't hate me for not knowing). The pressure to be perfect as a reflection on who I am has lessened. I'm learning that I can still take pride in doing my research to the best of my ability without spiraling into an anxious self-hate spiral any time something goes wrong.\n\nI hope this helps a bit. Good luck :)",

You can still kill shit while also being aware of your limitations. As a fellow perfectionist, I make my plans with the underlying anticipation that my perfectionism will get in the way. Ultimately, I'd rather do three things perfectly than 10 things with mediocrity. So I have to budget my time in order to produce perfect things.\n\nAnother thing: make sure you are defining what perfect is, and not your advisor, professors, etc. Find a way to align your version of perfect with their version of what is expected. \n\nPerfectionism is only a disadvantage when not properly addressed. When it is addressed and planned for, it's referred to as 'high attention to detail' and 'dedication.' Perfectionism can be an asset.",

I already know I can't make anything perfect and I'm just aiming for vaguely sufficient. The problem is that my bar for that is too high, and apparently fairly close to what more reasonable people might consider perfect (or at least quite good). I'm not saying this to knock the other advice, but mainly to add that you may not just be trying to catch yourself thinking \"I have to make this perfect\", but that it may be the case that even thinking \"I have to make this good enough\" might trigger your perfectionism.`\n\nIf you also have a broken \"good enough\"-detector, I suppose you could try to fix it. For instance, by critically looking at things other people produced that are apparently good enough. This hasn't really worked for me (yet?) because 1) it's hard to accept that some things are good enough, and 2) it's much easier to notice flaws in the work that I'm doing because I know more about it.\n\nIf you accept that your \"good enough\"-detector is broken, you have to avoid relying on it. For me that means not doing tasks (like writing (part of) a paper) until they are (good enough to be) done. Because that will take forever, eat into my free time, and not leave enough time to do other (sub)tasks. \n\nWhen I \"naturally\" write a paper for instance, I would tend to spend 90% of my time on the first few paragraphs, because I never find them acceptable. And then I spend very little time on the rest of the paper (which is obviously very imperfect perfectionism since 95% of my paper will suck due to writing it on the evening before the deadline). So it works better to take an iterative approach. First I separate generation from editing, where in the generation phase I try to force myself to more or less uncritically write down all the information that needs to be in the paper in a sort of stream of consciousness. Then, to avoid spending all my time editing the first part, I just plan to edit each paragraph for X minutes and force myself to move on after that. And then I'll do more rounds of editing if necessary. The perfectionist in me kind of wants to do an infinite number of rounds, but the nice thing about this is that you can pretty much stop the process at any time (e.g. when the deadline is up) and have a complete paper.\n\nSimilar ideas apply to other tasks. Not everything can be or has to be iterated, but I think that generally speaking it helps to make a strict time-boxed planning and try to stick to it. I do find this harder than it sounds, because it involves guessing how much time something will take, and then also sticking to the \"fake\" deadlines I set for myself, but it does work occasionally. \n\nFinally, I'd say to maybe involve your advisor in this so they can help look out for your perfectionist tendencies, and to try to cultivate a good work-life balance. \n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Also a pretty bad perfectionist here.\n\nOne thing that's helped me is to set a deadline for small tasks.  For instance: \"I'm giving myself the next five minutes to format this plot and whatever it looks like after that is what I'm stuck with.\"  It really helps prioritize what matters and trims out unnecessary work spent optimizing every last pixel.\n\nIt's especially important for research where I could spend the rest of my life tuning and exploring every last piece of a subject.  So, if there's an interesting asside, instead of just going down it I will limit myself to 24 hours.\n\nAnother thing I have found useful for reseach, is to spend time planning my paper whenever I feel lost.  It really clarifies what's important and can sometimes remind you that this piece you are obsessing over doesn't matter that much in the grand scheme of things.",

What you'll find is that the first few hours you invest is the most impactful use of your time in many cases. Once you feel 70% on something, if there are any 0%'s sitting on your list it might be better to work on those.\n\nThis itself can be viewed as a perfectionist thing to do. You're maximizing the return on investment of your time.",

      "text": "Good for you for recognizing early on that perfectionism isn\u2019t going to serve you in the long run. Others have mentioned therapy; I want to reiterate this and elaborate a bit on two types of therapy that helped me. For me, perfectionism comes from a messy combination of cognitive distortions about how good my work needs to be (I.e. everything will fall apart if I submit this with errors; I have to know everything about this topic even if I don\u2019t expect that from anyone else). Much of my identity and self-esteem originates from a lifetime of academic achievement, and sharing work that falls below my standard or missing an opportunity is emotionally distressing. \n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) helps with dismantling the cognitive distortions and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) helps me withstand the distress of submitting something at 85% instead of 100%. \u2018The Feeling Good Handbook\u2019 is a solid primer on CBT that your school library might have, and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/j6qt51/emotional_regulation_tools/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) has lots of DBT techniques described in the comments. Connecting with a therapist is the best way to work on this stuff because they can see things from a perspective you can\u2019t see yourself and help you shift your thinking. \n\nI\u2019m also a fan of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which does some of the same things as the other two but through the lens of what you value.",
