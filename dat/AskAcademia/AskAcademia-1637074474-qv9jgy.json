  "text": "I wanted to identify the effect curriculum alignment has had on K-12 student achievement in a large population as measured by state standardized testing, however after the survey was developed and administered, I found that the curriculum was not actually aligned in the majority of schools and therefore I'm unable to correlate that to student achievement. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do I go about reporting my findings since I was unable to answer my problem statement? Do I just label this as a poor research question and walk away?",

You now have a potential publication, you\u2019ve identified a gap for doctoral students, and you\u2019ve set up future research for yourself, potentially as an exploratory mixed methods paper.",

          "text": "As a PhD student, thank you. From what I've found so far, much research like this tends to be shelved until a significant result can be found so I was hoping my mistake might be able to help others. Other faculty here have said the same as you, and not that I don't trust them but I also want to learn where the echo chambers are.",

      "text": "If I've understood you correctly you misunderstood a fundamental aspect of what you were studying and designed a survey based on this mistaken understanding?\n\nI honestly don't think you can write it up unless you're able to show something from the results you got. A write up needs to reveal novel insight, even if the result is negative. But, there is a difference between a negative result and research that didn't work. \n\nThese things happen to the best of us. One of the most important lessons in life is knowing when to give up. Of you can't salvage a result from this, I'd call it a bad job and move on to the next thing. It sucks, but it happens.",

          "text": "You're correct in your understanding that I misunderstood I fundamental aspect. It's a humbling pill to swallow but I'm trying. The one piece that I think is worth note is that alignment of taught curriculum is not pervasive even if it is best practice. I don't believe that to be substantive enough to publish but I might give it a go with the knowledge that I might just put it on the shelf for later. I appreciate your reply.",
