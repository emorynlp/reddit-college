  "text": "Hi,\n\nWe have a relatively high impact forecast that we want to release very quickly. This is in the field of ecology and we just want to submit a \"short communication\" or \"brief report\" style paper. Broad readership would be a plus, and we expect that high impact journals should be no problem. But as it is a forecast (i.e. prediction), publishing it is time-sensitive.....so RAPID turnaround is crucial. Any ideas?\n\nThanks in advance!",
