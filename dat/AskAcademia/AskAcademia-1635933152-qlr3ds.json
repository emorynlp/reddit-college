  "title:": "Will a postdoc increase my hireability for industry research positions? (neuroscience and AI)",
  "text": "I am a graduating Ph.D. student in the US wrapping up my thesis and looking for the next step. I have a CS background and a very long unproductive Ph.D. (9+ years) in neuroscience. Looking at the future I'd probably want to find myself in the long run in industry research positions either in neuroscience (imagine neural interfaces) or AI. Especially since the academic dream seems more distant now. Becoming an academic however used to be my dream. I just feel I have adapted and it feels weird.\n\nApplying for jobs did not go as expected. I thought with my background in CS, industry would be easier to be considered for. My publication output during my PhD was low. My advisor left in the middle of my Ph.D. and then I lost 3 years of work through some bad circumstances completely outside my control. So what I naively thought would happen would be industry would appreciate my technical background and research \"experience\" and academia would dismiss my lack of publication record.\n\nInstead what happened is that I scored some very good postdoc offers in top-tier preference places, while industry I got rejected from all industry research positions. I have open some software engineering opportunities in FAANG, a data science job in an AI company, and a data engineering job in a neural research startup, none of which is an offer yet to be honest. I do not know at this point what will increase my hireability for where I want to go in the future. Will it be jumping to industry in non-research roles or will it be continuing in academia for a little more? There is already a good impact paper in the pipeline and prospect for some quick low hanging fruit after I start my postdoc.\n\nAlso a postdoc leaves the possibility open for an academic career. To be real, I cannot imagine myself just leaving academia and all my research behind after all these years",

      "text": "For industry research positions, yes, it will help. You will still do research and write paper.\n\nHowever, what I think will help you more to get into industry is connection. You can try to build industrial connection while doing your postdoc.\n\nAttend conferences that are open for industries. Visit their booth when they are attending a career fair. Contact those who worked there.",

You rarely know what competition you were up against. Maybe you had a busload of stellar candidates, just as a couple of flukes?",
