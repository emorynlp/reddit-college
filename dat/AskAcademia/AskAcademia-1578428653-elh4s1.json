  "title:": "Is there an unspoken rule that you're not actually supposed to \"email ChairOfTheSearchCommittee@institution.edu for additional information about this position\" when applying for faculty jobs?",
  "text": "I'm hoping someone can shed some light on my experience today, because I'm thoroughly confused.\n\nI found a position I was interested in, but the advertisement and institution website didn't offer course descriptions publicly, and had little information about the curriculum and enrollment numbers.\n\nI was hoping to learn a little more about the program before applying, so I emailed the chair about the position asking if he would have a minute to answer a couple of questions. Now, the advertisement explicitly says **\"Additional information about this position may be obtained by contacting chair[at]institution.edu\"**\n\nI received an email back a couple of hours later saying (paraphrasing) \"Thank you for your interest. I can't answer any of your questions at this time, and all of the information you need to apply is in the job post.\"\n\nThough it wasn't those exact words, it was equally short and dismissive.\n\nSo, my question is: Did I make a mistake by emailing the chair? Are you not actually supposed to inquire for additional info, and if not, then why would that clause be in the job description?",

You should be asking about the search itself (e.g., \"who is on the committee?\" is fair game, as would \"your position advertises for someone with X degree, is there any possibility you might hire someone with Y degree, or is it not worth my time to apply?\"). You should not be asking questions about the job itself (those you should reserve if you get a call-back).",

          "text": "Hear, hear. This is spot on. If you have dealbreaker questions then ask them succinctly. If they\u2019re more curiosities or something you could potentially ask during the time typically allotted at the end of an interview (should you get one), then skip them. Hiring protocol are much more formalized now than in years past due to concerns over inequity so be aware that there are strict limits on what the chair can even respond to. Also be aware that you don\u2019t want to come across as pushy, needy, smarmy, etc., as this will be remembered when it comes time to select candidates to interview or during the interview itself.\n\nAnd this is probably a no-brainer, u/BostonDrivingIsWorse, but as a department chair myself, and one who has chaired numerous hiring committees, avoid any questions better answered by HR, such as those relating to salary, benefits, vacation, term dates, offices, etc. Even during an interview, avoid them. You don\u2019t want the hiring committee to associate you with these types of questions instead of the aspects they\u2019re focused on (teaching, research, publishing, grants, collegial service, etc.). Those types of questions seem to always leave a bad taste in committee members\u2019 mouths, as it makes the candidate come across as more concerned about what they can get rather than what they can contribute to the institution and the department. I\u2019m not saying those questions aren\u2019t important ones, I am just saying to not ask them of committee members, at least not until you\u2019ve got the job! Go directly to HR instead.",

You didn't give any indication that you'd already checked the website and couldn't find the info you were looking for. You didn't even give info about what your questions were about",
