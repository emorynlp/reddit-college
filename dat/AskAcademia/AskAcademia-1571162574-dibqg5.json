They just weren't great at studying and/or turning in all their work.  But I really enjoyed them as people.\n\nThe \"bad\" students I don't like were the ones who did not own their own failures.  The students who come in mid-semester or even late in the semester and somehow manage to blame me and take zero personal responsibility for the situation they are now in.   I actually have respect for students who say \"look, I fucked up and now I'm trying to fix it.\"  Particularly if there is more than two weeks left in the semester to fix it in.",

      "text": ">If someone who had an F or a D came to office hours in the middle of the semester, would this annoy you?\n\nTo the contrary, I would be happy to see a student who is struggling in a class take the initiative to come to office hours. Know that office hours are a professor's time that is set aside for meeting with students. It's literally your professor's job to meet with you or any other student during that time. So while they shouldn't be annoyed by you coming to office hours, on the off chance that they are, they'd be annoyed about the prospect of doing something that is part of their job duties.\n\nIf you're worried about coming to office hours, it may help to think about what you want out of office hours. Do you want to discuss what a pathway to passing the class might look like for you? Are there aspects of the current material in class (or homework sets, etc.) that you're having difficulty understanding and you'd like to get some clarification with? Would you like to get better connected with department or campus resources for academic support? You might find having a clear goal in mind helpful.\n\nMost all of us love to see a student who is initially struggling in a class take steps to grow and improve and ultimately do well in the class (or pass the class, when it may have at one point felt out of reach). I'm rooting for you, and I hope your professor is, too.",

      "text": "It depends. Some poor performers are for blatant lack of trying, while others genuinely don\u2019t understand the material. I would say that it\u2019s not so much anger, more so frustration with trying to understand what I can do to try and spark an interest with the student. The thing is students who are poor performers tend not to come to office hours (even when you pull them aside and suggest that they do), but ones that don\u2019t get the material are more likely to show up and ask for help. At the end of the day as an instructor, you just have to understand that some things are out of your control and a poor performer isn\u2019t always a reflection on your abilities to teach.\n\nEssentially, regardless of why the student isn\u2019t performing well I am never disappointed or angry when a student comes to office hours to ask for help. What becomes angering is when a student comes to office hours, asks a million questions, you give them a step-by-step checklist of what they need to do in order to perform better in the class and then when they turn in the next assignment they completely disregard everything you spoke about and keep doing what they were doing as if the meeting never happened.\n\nEdit: it doesn\u2019t result in my disliking of a student, but I can say when the class is over I am relieved that I don\u2019t have to work with that particular poor work habit and/or attitude any more.",

              "text": "You are correct, some are due to mental or physical health situations and in which case I completely agree and I am more than happy to work with them outside of class to ensure their success in the classroom (which I repeatedly state explicitly in class). However, as an instructor, it is not my place to jump to conclusions as to whether or not that is what they\u2019re experiencing. What I see in the classroom is a lack of trying or a difficulty comprehending. All I can do is reach out to the student and check in and suggest that they visit me in office hours. If they repeatedly don\u2019t show, I can\u2019t force them to come receive additional help or to disclose personal issues that may be causing them to perform poorly. All I can do is continue to send the student(s) emails, messages on Canvas, and speak to them after class. It is not my place to pass judgement about my students, only to give them the necessary tools to obtain a college degree and teach them research and communication skills that they\u2019ll hopefully carry with them into their personal and professional lives, and thus I never pass judgement onto my students. I care for each and every single one of them and wish success and prosperity (whatever that may look like to them) in their life journeys.\n\nAdditionally, I\u2019m very lucky to work at an institution that provides free counseling and psychological services (as well as dentistry and chiropractic services) for all students, as well as a very well run office for students with differing abilities, of which I remind my students to utilize should they need. But regardless of performance, I am here to help my students in whatever they need to obtain their degree.",

      "text": "Honestly I think the few times I've ever seen professors genuinely hare students are under the following categories \n\n1. The students are in a group talking during a lecture and disrupting the class with a side discussion constantly.\n\n2. The students in the class show up late constantly or not at all ( usually okay if the professor knows why if its serious) \n\n3. Student uses fake websites for information instead of peer reviewed work and is confused why their paper is wrong and isnt listening to the professor who tells then they need to use science. \n\n4.students who either talk too much, or too little. You need that variance. Some professors hate people who talk too much but a lot of people just sit on facebook and study later or are to shy to ask. \n\n5. Students who demand extra credit\n\n6. Students who complain they are failing and act like asses but never showed up to class or asked for help.",

      "text": "Empirically: indifference. The typical student with bad marks in my classes is someone who shows up infrequently (or never) to a large 2nd-year class. They don't want to talk to me, so I don't know them and don't have strong feelings.\n\nIn theory: I try to encourage poor students to come talk to me as early as possible, and try to be as welcoming to them as I can be. Occasionally this works, and I've found that these students have typically been able to turn things around if they show up in the first 4 weeks or so of a course.\n\nMy guess is that most of these people are dealing with something and effectively can't show up (either to talk to me, or to class). I don't think there's much I can do for someone who just doesn't have the time or energy to finish a class. I have friends who've been in this situation and try to suggest resources when I can, but it is a bit sensitive...",
