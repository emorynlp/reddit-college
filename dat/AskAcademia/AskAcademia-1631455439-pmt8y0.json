  "text": "I have just started my grad school journey (funded MA in math) after shifting from another discipline (studied econ in college, then taught K-12 for four years, decided I liked teaching older people more). I want to teach college and within mathematics, I have a particular interest both in statistics and math education.\n\nHowever, my professors keep saying the math job market is terrible and not to even bother trying to get a tenure track math position. Is this true in all fields of math? Are you more competitive perhaps doing something like statistics or math education than analysis or algebra? It\u2019s hard to come across modern numbers on the internet, so I was wondering about your general take.\n\nEdit: Or even just non-adjunct, full-time instructor positions. Even like community college or worlds-lowest-ranked-non-profit-uni non-adjunct instructor positions.",

      "text": "I am in CS, but have friends who *were* and friends who are still in maths. The general consensus I hear from them is that the more theoretical you are, then the harder it is to find a job. I actually had that discussion last week with one of them. There are simply fewer postdoc positions than are graduates. If you are applied enough, e.g. statistics, you may ride along the ongoing 'AI hype train' and find a job in CS or go somewhere like bioinformatics, finance, etc. \n\nOn the other hand, if you are ambitious and have a strong publication record then there is still hope for you. There are multiple research institutes in Europe (particularly in France) that offer research-only positions to theoretical mathematicians. If you go down that route, it may be harder for you to move up the academic system as you will lack teaching experience \u2014you can get around that by doing a habilitation thesis and then getting an adjunct position at a nearby university.",

So yes, statistics will provide better job opportunities than math. I know some math PhDs who had to float around the world for several postdoc positions or live in their parents\u2019 basement before landing jobs. Also none of them are in math anymore. They either switched to applied fields or went into industry.",

      "text": "Community college sounds like a good fit for your background and what you want to teach. It's nice work if you can get it, especially if you can get it in a state where unions are strong. \n\nThe full-time CC job market is still really challenging to break into. If you're willing to move for a job, that helps. To give you a sense of how hard it is, in the last 12 years at my college we had two retirements that we replaced with new hires. In both cases we had over 80 applicants, about half of which were well-qualified. At a neighboring college, they have had one opening in the 12 years I have been at my institution. Both have large departments (10+ faculty).\n\nThe masters in mathematics is helpful (we see applications with math Ed, but the masters in pure math is preferred). The fact that you have teaching experience is also good. And, if you like to teach stats and math for teachers, that's actually cool, because we have trouble getting people to teach those courses at my school (others would be different, I'm sure). If you want to make yourself even more attractive as an applicant, start teaching as an adjunct at your local CC for the experience. We prefer to see CC teaching  experience, not just high school teaching, whenever possible. \n\nIt still won't be easy and you might kick around as an adjunct with lousy pay and no benefits working at three colleges just to pay the bills for a few years before scoring the full-time gig. But it is possible.",

But at least on the committees I have been on, CC teaching is still preferred. The community college is a different animal, so if we have someone who already understands it, that's ideal. \n\nWe don't get a lot of applicants with PhD's. In my opinion, for the types of classes we teach, the PhD isn't really necessary. The highest level classes we have are DiffEq and Linear Algebra, and that's one section per year with a tiny number of students. Most of what we do is algebra, calculus, stats, and gen Ed math. Our department of 10 people has only one PhD.",

There are also some math-ed positions, but my opinion is it's about as sparse as any other research area.\n\nI think it's better for you to study what you like - even if faculty positions fall through, you can land in an adjacent industry that uses similar skills. I think that would be more enjoyable long-term than pushing yourself into a specific field for TT-prospects. And if you don't much care about research focus, then most of your focus should be on building up your teaching profile - you just want your research concentration to be a manageable part of your workload.\n\nYou'll also need to move into a PhD program if you want a permanent position anywhere except at a community college.",

However, if you are doing a good job and a good postdoc, then you may have your chances. You may also first accept a professor position somewhere you do not really want to go but this will increase your chances to find a position in a place you prefer later.\n\nAlso it depends on the country, the research market may be simpler in Europe than in the US because universities are structured differently and some pure research positions are also available (in some research centers and not in universities).\n\nFinally, your specialty will not play a too big role in your recruitment. You will only apply to positions for which you fit the keywords. Crowded fields will be more competitive, obviously.",
