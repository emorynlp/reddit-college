  "text": "Hi all,\n\nMy last 24h project was a google scholar crawler searching for connections (paper co-authors) between academics and their connection with universities (i just look at the mail domain), I wrote a crawler and i write all results to a graph database (neo4j). \n\nI use the data in order to find connection between the university in which i did an internship (and i hope soon i'll be research engineer there) and the university in which i would start a PhD.\n\nDo you think that a web service like [connectedpapers.com](https://connectedpapers.com) but with connection between academics and universities is something interesting? Otherwise this project will die alone on my hard disk",

I'll make a new post when i have news :)",
