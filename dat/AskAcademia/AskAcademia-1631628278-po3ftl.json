          "text": "I second this comment, but maybe from a different angle. What draws you to/excites you about the course-based program? Once you reflect on what you desire in the program and need after you earn the degree, I say just tell them. (Others may have better insight on how that conversation should go.) One thing to consider is if you think you\u2019ll ever want to pursue a higher or different degree (like a PhD). If so, it\u2019s generally better to go the thesis route to keep those future research opportunities open.",

(And/Or look at job descriptions of careers you would enjoy and see what they list as requirements. Consider that research experience is quite useful in many industries regardless of if you end up in a research-specific role.) The ambiguity you may see or feel is part of the process of learning to think differently than when you take courses or focus more on career education and training. With that said, many course-based programs have excellent internships that can help you move from A to B. I hope you find what works for you.",
