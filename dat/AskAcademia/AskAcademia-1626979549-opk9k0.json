  "text": "I see myself as a very average STEM postdoc in terms of research output. For publications, I\u2019d say ~50% of other postdocs I come across have \u201cbetter\u201d records, and ~50% have \u201cworse\u201d ones. The publication record from my PhD is equally average (first-author papers in good but not top tier journals, not very well cited).\n\nFor the others in the same boat, how are you feeling? Do you feel that you\u2019ll still have a chance at a faculty position? Do you feel that you\u2019ll have to aim for departments that focus more on teaching than research? Do you think about going into industry?\n\nFor those who are no longer postdocs, what did you end up doing?",

In the first case, you absolutely need to look at industry or teaching-heavy positions if that's what you like and you have some teaching credentials.

Sometimes it really depends on the type of work that was necessary. Some parts of my revision was highly technical in nature and I ended up finding 2 different collaborators (separate groups) to work on it concurrently. One ended up enticing me to dump in more and more money into the project while another had a out-of-the-box idea that addressed all of my reviewer's concerns. Before that, I was under the constant fear of what-if i have to rewrite my entire conclusions which means more experiments etc. But was glad that it was done.\n\nOne of my co-worker who submitted his paper before mine is still in the revision limbo when he got a cranky reviewer 3 who requested for additional revision. But his work is mostly cell-culture based so he can plan out his experiments more efficiently while i kept praying that my mice like their partners enough to mate and generate enough cohorts for the revision.

I talked to my PI about this and they confirmed to me that it might be problematic if i switch from a postdoc (trainee) to a staff-based position since there's still a lot of people out there who somehow stigmatize people who didnt suffer the full 5 year postdoc stint.\n\nI like to do research and academic lab do offer me the flexibility of exploring crazy ideas without needing to worry about grant applications.

      "text": "I do okay. I would even consider myself above average. Postdoc has been slow going but a lot of papers about to pay off/be submitted, and I'm in a few decent proposals. I also serve in a local imate government climate assessment for a very large city, and an equivalent assessment for the UN, but have no Big journal publications. So while productive, I know there's a lot of folks who publish/do more. It's still incredibly discouraging going into the faculty/research scientist market, as departments and universities have the benefit of being extremely picky (or not hire anyone at all!). \n\nI am probably quitting my faculty search after this year. Had two campus visits so my best one yet. One of them was a top R1, and the position was an excellent fit for me, and I absolutely nailed the interview. Faculty voted to extend me offer (which the chair told me), only for the dean to block it in the end after a very long wait. No idea why. Maybe they wanted the money to build a new pool, maybe they wanted someone from an \"elite\" institution. In any case, this completely destroyed my confidence that I could get any position in academia that wasn't temporary/precarious. My second campus visit they sent me an automated system rejection. Just demoralizing after you spend a whole day with these people and prepare for a job talk and all that. \n\nI applied to most positions that had even a bit of an overlap with my work that were in a place I wouldn't hate living in. My research is incredibly interdisciplinary so I could apply to engineering, atmospheric, climate, or even  geography departments. Since I wasn't interested in a \"mostly teaching\" position, I didn't apply to those. I also suspect I wouldn't have done as well, since I didn't have as much teaching experience.",

Maybe a few standard government scholarships/fellowships, but no awards or recognition for their papers, and no invited talks or reviewing for journals.\n\nI could be wrong about the numbers, since there's visibility bias, where people who have higher outputs are more visible, and people who have lower are less visible. However, this profile was exceedingly common in the department I did my PhD, including myself.\n\nAs a postdoc, I've just gotten my first-author IF \\~ 10\u201317 paper out after a couple of years of work, and man am I burnt out while people around me are endlessly producing...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Take these numbers with a grain of salt.
