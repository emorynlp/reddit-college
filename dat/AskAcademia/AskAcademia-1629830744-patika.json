  "text": "I just defended my dissertation last week from an average public state university in the US. I'd like to get an industry job but haven't had any luck, partially because I'm a foreign national, most jobs in my field require green card. So, postdocs are the realistic options for me. What advice would you give me? All industries and perspectives are welcome. I hope this post helps others as well.",

      "text": "So, first of all, congratulations on your defense Doctor! That's an amazing accomplishment! \n\nThough I'm a US citizen, I also came from an average public university, so the first thing I would recommend is to update your CV. Play to your strengths, and make sure you include all of your publications, seminar presentations, and conferences attended. \n\nThe next thing I'd say is to think about what you're interested in researching. Did you really like your graduate school project, and want to stay on a similar field of research? Then think about the prominent researchers in your field, and think about who you could learn the most from. Check out their faculty profiles to see what they're working on now, and if they're looking for postdocs (most will have this information on their page). Even if they don't state it, it never hurts to reach out to them, tell them why you're interested in working for them and what you want to accomplish while asking about any openings in their lab. \n\nIf you want to switch gears in terms of a research focus, think about where you might want to live or move to, and start looking at researchers profiles from universities in that area. Read up on their research and try to think about what some unanswered questions in that field are, so you can ask them questions when it comes to a possible interview. \n\nDo NOT send the same form email to many different professors asking about open positions. They will be able to tell, and will likely not respond. I sent tailored emails to 5 PIs when I was applying for positions, and got an interview with 3 of them (2 of them I had never met before and were in a field very different from my graduate school lab).\n\nGood luck on the job search!",

      "text": "I will be in a similar situation once I graduate, and I have absolutely decided to work in the industry.  If you cannot find a job right away, then I would suggest considering job opportunities in other countries. You will be able to get some work experience, earn good money and, if you still prefer returning to the US, eventually get an industry job there.\n\nIn my opinion, doing postdoc is a waste of time, unless you want a career in academia or doing it to stay in the US while searching for other jobs. Postdocs stay on temporary visas. If I am not mistaken, you would have to reach tenure-track to get a green card, which takes an enormous amount of time and efforts.\n\nIf you prefer to stay, then I don't think there are many options. You can either work as postdoc until you find a job in the industry, or you can apply for an OPT. In either case, you will be at a huge disadvantage, because most companies do not hire foreigners for an entry-level position.",

      "text": "Don't do a postdoc for the sake of staying in the US if you want to go into the industry. You need to accumulate relevant experience. The only advantage of being in the US for your studies is that you can apply for OPT and then have a small chance at winning a crazy visa lottery by charming a company during your extension. Nothing is guaranteed and there is no straight path to US immigration. So leaving the US to go get industrial experience and coming back a few years later wouldn't affect you that much immigration wise when you think of it. No matter what, you will be hit by the H1B visa lottery at some point. So, It is not worth pursuing a postdoc in my opinion if you don't want an academic career. Especially considering further academic studies without industrial experience might hurt you down the road if you aim for industrial positions.\n\nSo without considering a postdoc, there are not many options left to live in the US. The way I see it, you have 2 choices.;\n\n1. Get your OPT and apply to entry-level positions with companies that are known to sponsor H1B visas or non-immigration visas (TN). After your OPT deadline, try to win the H1B visa lottery if the company wants to sponsor you for it. If that doesn't work within the deadline, go to step 2.\n2. Your best bet would be to go back to your country, find an entry-level job in a multinational company that has a US office, work there for a few years, make a good impression and show good performance, ask to be transferred to the US through an L-1A or L-1B visa and try to switch to an H1B visa at some point to remain in the US. \n\nIf you try step 1, you'll need to apply to entry-level positions that do not require a green card. This will be hard because you might have to drift away from your PhD specialization so you might be overqualified or underqualified to some employers. Also, they might prefer to hire citizens for entry-level positions. So your best bet would be step 2. For step 2, you could work in your specialized field even if you are in the US: when a company transfers a foreigner internally to the US, there's a higher chance that they will try to work around any security clearance required to make their position possible (limit what they work on until they get a green card) or they might even petition for security clearance by saying you got special expertise that would benefit the US.",
