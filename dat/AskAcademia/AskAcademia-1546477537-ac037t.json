  "title:": "My advisor submitted data he knew was false for a grant under my name",
  "text": "I based my project off data showing a significant positive correlation from an experiment conducted before I joined the lab. However, when I reran the statistics myself, I found that there was no significant difference. My advisor thought that this was impossible, so we repeated the entire experiment (it took 6 months), but the results were still nonsignificant. I recently wrote a grant, and when my advisor reviewed my proposal he ADDED BACK IN THE INITIAL DATA we know is incorrect. I then pointed out the error, but he did not acknowledge my comment and submitted the grant under my name. Who can I talk to about how to navigate this issue without it being reported the the university, which could put my graduate career in jeopardy? I am speaking with a counselor about this, but he has limited knowledge of the academic research environment. \n\nNote: I am posting this from a friend\u2019s alternate account.\n",

While it sounds scary, you *want* to talk to the university, starting at department level, about this, and create a paper trail quickly. I\u2019d refer you to the case that just ended at UIUC with the firing of a tenure professor when this behavior was found for grants that were submitted and funded. *Not* letting the school know risks that, when found inevitably a few years from now, it\u2019ll be harder to distance yourself from the falsification. Believe it or not, schools have rigorous procedures in place to handle these situations, and they usually prioritize protecting the student. ",

My former PI would regularly ask people to change error bars, add asterisks, change labels for figures on grants. From what I have been told by a post doc, the PI believes that grants are a grey area and it's okay if the results cannot be repeated in subsequent experiments (I strongle DO NOT agree with this). Apart from the obvious problems, it becomes even more problematic when trickles over into co-PI grants and manuscripts for publication. If you say anything, with the repercussions hurt your career?  Will the repercussions hurt the careers of others in the lab just by association? Advice that I followed: make sure your data is solid and get out as soon as possible. No one will likely do anything, even if you report it (they will want very explicit proof), if your PI has a lot of grant money.",

Either he's very desperate or some wires must have gotten crossed somewhere. In either case, I agree with you that OP should distance themselves as far as possible with this with written evidence. I think it's worth writing to the dept head about this issue, but just to be on the safe side in case there's a miscommunication, OP should use neutral/non-accusatory language. Something like \"to my knowledge..\" or \"my understanding is that the data that was submitted was erroneous...\" etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n ",

Simultaneously send the evidence and a letter withdrawing your name from the grant to the funding agency involved.\n\n3: Talk to your counselor and the head of the department saying you have taken these actions and you need to be reassigned a PI. \n\n4: Send the same documents and a letter outlining your actions so far to https://ori.hhs.gov. Be sure to do this! It's very important you are the first to report this because I the first thing your dishonest PI will do is try to pin the blame on you. \n\n5: Find allies. Talk to prominent scientists in the field and in your department that you can trust (if you're a molecular biologist/plant biologist in the US / UK, I can help you with this) and ask for support in case your PI tries to slander you. Also talk to your fellow grad student /postdocs in the same department to create a support base. \n\nDO NOT KEEP SILENT. If this comes out later and you didn't do anything it will have serious ramifications for your career. ",

I imagine your advisor was using some self-deception in the writing thinking something like, \"well, if I wrote this grant a year ago, I would have put this in and believed it was right.\" Sadly, I don't think it's uncommon to write grants based on earlier data that is more promising, people tell themselves they are going to good things with the money the and ends justify the means.\n\nIf it is not detectable, I would just hope that the grant doesn't get funded and I would be very, very careful in the future with your collaborations with your advisor, maybe even consider moving to another group. You don't know the whole story and in a way might even be an honest mistake, you just don't know.\n\nIf you think the granting organization will be able to detect the fraud, then I think you need to have a talk with the department chair in confidence, at first strictly to advise you on how to proceed, not necessarily to punish your advisor. I imagine the best possible thing to do is just withdraw the grant from consideration \"in light of new findings.\" This happens with some frequency, and it's not that big of a deal - other than missing the opportunity for the money.\n\nThere is always a chance it was an honest mistake or some reasoning behind it you don't know. The issue is if this can be detected and if your ass will be on the line. If you are PI on the grant, this will be an issue. If you're just listed as a student, then I wouldn't worry so much, just be sure to have your emails saved where you discussed the issue and have corroborating evidence from discussions with the dean or the head of the department.",
