  "text": "Hey, everyone.\nI'm submitting a paper to a conference sponsored by ACL. The CFP doesn't mention anything about blind reviews. It only says that the paper will be reviewed by 3 committee members. So far, I have submitted an anonymous paper (the author names were entered through the submission system anyway). But the paper itself doesn't have author names printed.\nIs this a major issue and should I include affiliations and names now? Or should I just wait until reviewers' comments come in, if at all?\n\nI have contacted the organiser / point of contact, but have received no response so far.\n\nMy project advisor hasn't made any comments regarding this, either.",
