  "title:": "How to avoid awkward conversations about your poor advising experience?",
  "text": "This May I graduated with my PhD. I had a very negative experience with my advisor, which was underlain by a lot of incompetence by my advisor and indifference/dysfunction in my department. The overall dysfunction got so bad that the dean of research for my university disallowed my advisor from advising any other PhD student, and moreover the department was warned it would be dissolved if it couldn't get its act together.\n\nTomorrow I have a meeting with a fairly influential professor in another department who is interested in me possibly working with him in future projects. I've managed to answer and deflect questions about my advisor over email, but I'm worried about in depth questions over our video call. I'd like to be able to answer diplomatically and neutrally, rather than sound like I'm shit-talking my former department. \n\nDoes anyone have good strategies for answering questions neutrally about these kinds of bad experiences? I would also like to avoid any future collaboration with my advisor, so if anyone has any input about how to say they'd rather not work with someone, that would be really helpful.\n\n(Just for a bit of context, I'm not just trying to be precious about this. The department dean and the grad school chair in my department agreed she was being abusive to me, and I was very, very close to hurting myself seriously during the last few months of my PhD. I really don't think it would be good for my mental health to be in a working relationship with her again.)",

Maybe Dr. Helpful or Dr. Supportive?\n\nIP: Why not Dr. Abusive?\n\nYou: Well, during my Ph.D. work there were problems, and the research dean has actually banned Dr. Abusive from doing any more Ph.D. advising as a result. I'm not trying to bad-mouth anyone, but I think it's best if we don't work together any more.\n\nIP: Oooo, details, I want juicy details!\n\nYou: Maybe you could talk to the research dean about it?\n\nI'd be interested to see what other commenters have to say.",

In my opinion, there is no need to be vague here, i.e. to say it was \"strained.\"   \n\n\nI think if you just give the influential professor in this scenario that bit of information, they can figure out the rest for themselves pretty darn quickly. If this person presses you for details, then I would say it is ok to say (a) I'm not comfortable talking about it, but I'm happy to provide references to those who are up to date or the situation or (b) sharing what did actually happen in an objective, professional manner. If you choose (b), I would consider focusing on particular aspects of the professional relationship that make you not want to collaborate with that person again, i.e. they were always taking credit for my work or unresponsive to email or only gave negative unconstructive feedback.  \n\n\nThe other thing I want to say, is just be honest. I know you want to work with this person, but if you conduct yourself with character, and for some reason they don't appreciate it, then you have dodged another bullet :)..",

If accepted to work with them and later on you form a trusted relationship outside of work, you *might* consider it. Bringing up specifics of your experience is not professional since it can easily be viewed as bad-mouthing/gossip. This is presumably one of your first meetings with influential professor?

Are the projects you would be working on with this new person be different enough for your advisor\u2019s expertise to be irrelevant? If so, the issue of working with her is unlikely to come up. \n\nIf it would be relevant, you could always start by mentioning that their feedback style wasn\u2019t useful to you. Which based on your post is true, just an understatement. And if the situation escalates, you can reveal more background information. If this new professor is a good fit for you to work with, and the context for you revealing the information makes sense, they will understand. If they don\u2019t understand, you can cross that bridge when you come to it.\n\nIf you\u2019d rather be more up front, you could try bringing it up in the context of learning from the experience. Start by describing your relationship with your advisor in the most neutral way possible \u201ctheir communication strategies caused more harm than help.\u201d  If this new person seems interested, you can provide more detail if it feels right.

      "text": "Remember that part of the reason why the professor is asking may be to assess your productivity (which most likely was negatively impacted by issues with your advisor) and to see what working with you might be like -- so you should also be concerned with not making yourself look bad by being too evasive.\n\nI would say upfront that you feel bad having to mention anything negative and then broadly describe the issues you had. Say that you followed department procedure for these situations and that the higher-ups sided with you (definitely mention that your advisor was sanctioned -- otherwise it might sound like you're exaggerating). I would be shocked if they then pressed you for more details but if they do, you can continue to be vague or just refuse to be more specific.\n\nI think the fact you are so concerned about sounding negative means you're very unlikely to sound overly negative or making it seem like you want to badmouth your advisor. You'll be fine.",

      "text": "I asked this question to a lady specializing in getting grad students jobs, and she basically said to have like 5-10 short accurate but vague lines that you practice in front of a mirror. It's bad form to trash your advisor, and it appears classier if you don't. (Like asking people about their ex). I think via talking/writing so it's always a temptation to word vomit to grapple for the right words, so it can be helpful to journal and look for themes, that you can describe succinctly and vaguely but accurately.\n\nAn example conversation:\n\n\"It didn't work out well\"\n\nAnd if pressed: \n\n\"we weren't a good match for each other\" \n\"We had different goals\"\n\"Her advising style didn't match well with my learning style\"\n\nAnd if pressed (in my case)\n\n\"I had a lot of growth that needed to happen and maturing to do\". \n\nAnd if pressed for MORE detail, you repeat \"it just didn't work out\".\n\nAnd maybe even \"I'd really rather not go into it\".\n\nOr perhaps \"my advisor had some issued with the dean and is no longer advising at this time\".",
