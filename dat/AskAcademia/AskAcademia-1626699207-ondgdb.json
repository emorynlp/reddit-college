  "title:": "Switching subjects ENTIRELY for the sake of a professor job (xpost from AskProfessors)",
  "text": "I'm a Canadian student currently looking at applying to grad school to complete my masters (hopefully fast track to PhD) in biology. However, I can't see myself in the future running my own lab in academia as I'm a firm believer in \"working to live, not living to work\" and from what I can tell, 80+ hour (slight hyperbole) weeks are common for STEM professors. Regardless, my main focus if I ever became a professor was teaching anyways and I would love to do research in a field like science communication or education afterwards. I still want to do a PhD in a traditional biology field however as I'm not interested in teaching classes ABOUT education or communication.\n\nHow feasible is this? One my favourite professors at my university did just that, completed a PhD in biology (plant-animal ecology specifically) and then once become a professor, transitioned to researching science communication/education while still teaching biology courses such as animal behaviour, physiology, etc. He's nowhere as busy as a typical STEM prof and has plenty of time with family and even runs a little side business. How feasible is such a large transition in research topics in current day academia? I've had plenty of conversations with this professor and he said even 10 years ago when he started it was a lot of luck and kissing ass to both our science and education faculty to be the first ever cross appointed professor. But that was 10 years ago. How does one go about doing this in the hiring process (I.e letting potential employers know that you want to be hired to do science education research even with a background in traditional biology)?",

      "text": "Have you thought about teaching at a CC? These positions are only teaching, no research. Better life/work balance imo. I teach at a CC and love it. My advisor knew when I started my grad program that this was my goal, and he was totally on board with it. A MS in the field in which you want to teach is the minimum requirement for teaching at most CCs in the US. \n\nOr, University of WA has a STEM education program, specifically for higher Ed teaching. But those are rare, and it's probably be difficult to transfer that research to a traditional university. Unless you come across a lecture only position, in which this would be a good fit.\n\nEdit: sorry, missed that you're in CA. CC = community college or sometimes called junior college. Typically 2-year institutions. Some CC faculty still research and publish, but this is typically focused on pedagogy techniques.",

              "text": "If you are in Canada, many schools have got teaching-track faculty that even get tenure. So, you could pursue a PhD like normal but then specifically look for teaching jobs at such schools. The situation is much better for these people than similar teaching jobs in the US.",

Teaching (and subsequently research in education) seems to be the way I'm leaning towards and I would love to have as much time as possible to focus on teaching instead of having to cram 1 or 2 classes in per semester while running a lab.",

      "text": "There are a lot of teaching-focused jobs at primarily undergraduate institutions. Many of these would welcome research with undergraduates, as well as research that is more focused on pedagogy or outreach. In general, these are not as high pressure as publish-or-perish (and grant getting) research focused campuses. The exception might be the most elite tier of small liberal arts colleges like Amherst or Swarthmore.",
