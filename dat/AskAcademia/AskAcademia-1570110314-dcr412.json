  "title:": "Harvard RAship offer recinded at the last moment. What to do?",
  "text": "I'm a graduate student from an eminent Indian institution. I interned at a lab at Harvard Medical for my thesis and received an offer to continue as an RA after graduation. After the internship I had to return to India to apply for a new J-1 visa.\n\nMy visa application is underway and almost done. I had also looked for accommodation and signed the lease before I left Boston.\nI have paid $1600 for the visa application and a month's rent already ($850). These are non-refundable.\n\nJust received an email saying I will not be able to work at the lab. They cited grant issues. How should I proceed? \n\nAppreciate any help!\n\nEDIT: I have been given an official offer letter. My lab does sponsor all Visas, except for the one category I was eligible for this time. They don't sponsor J-1 Intern visas, the one I'm getting. The conditional aspect due to funding was put only for renewal post the one year appointment, not during or before the RAship.",

How can they rescind after all that. Get in touch with the international office and maybe the ombudsman. You could also try to reach out to their graduate student union. They may not be able to help you directly but are probably clued up on who you should contact.",
