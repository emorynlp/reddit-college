  "title:": "Got my PhD almost a year ago, struggling to find a job.",
  "text": "Hey /r/AskAcademia ,\n\nAustralian PhD graduate here. My doctorate was (broadly) in risk communication and natural hazards research. I started when I was 23 straight after undergrad and was awarded last year at 29. I worked as a sessional/casual academic during that period, mostly teaching management science at my university. I'm 30 now.\n\nAt the start of this year, I took the savings I had and called it quits with the university. I never wanted to be a teacher and I couldn't take the institutional exploitation by the university anymore. It's also a fairly bad time to be a non-STEM academic in Australia.\n\nI've been applying for jobs full time, but I can't even get so much as an interview for a position. \nI applied for a position at the CFA (Country Fire Authority, the main body for fire management in my state) that was almost a natural extension of the work I did in my doctorate. The application was ignored for six weeks until I emailed asking for an update, at which point they updated the application from \"In Progress\" to \"Finished\" and told me they wouldn't be inviting me to interview. I suspect they had an internal candidate in mind and the job posting was just a legal requirement and never actually checked. Still, it hurts to not have even had the opportunity to interview, after all that time building an expertise on the subject. \n\nI've also been applying for any and every researcher or consultant role I can find, but I'm turned down at the first stage every time.\n\nTo be honest, I'm starting to get really scared. It's been almost 12 months since I graduated and I don't feel like I'm any closer to a career. I spent six years in some truly awful conditions, sacrificing a lot to get my doctorate finished. The thing that kept me going the whole time was the idea that a PhD would be valuable, prestigious, and make it easier to find a job. Now I look at my testamur and I just want to burn it. It feels like all the suffering was meaningless and has no context. My self-worth, mental state and finances are rapidly deteriorating and I'm not sure what to do next. \n\nIs anyone able to give me some advice on leaving academia and finding a job?",

      "text": "Can you get someone who's familiar with hiring PhDs into non-academia jobs to review your CV and a sample of your cover letters?  You'll need to include the job ads with the cover letters for review, because each cover letter needs to be tailored specifically to the job, especially if you're applying for things that aren't the 100% obvious next step for your career path.\n\nYou talk about applying but not about networking.  If you haven't already, I'd suggest you put some of this effort into finding out what professional associations or meetings are relevant to the people you want to work for and attend those.  Ask them what they need from candidates in these roles.\n\nLastly, if you haven't already, you should be looking up the people who currently do the kinds of jobs you're applying for.  Check out their educational path and experience and see if you can spot something that you're missing.",

          "text": "I agree with having someone else look at your CV. I applied for hundreds of jobs after my PhD and didn't hear back from more than a handful. Once I finally took some time to learn how to tailor my CV to the position and to focus on my accomplishments rather than just listing everything I'd done, I had much better success. I found the Cheeky Scientist to be helpful, you have to pay for it but I found their CV prep and interview trainings very helpful. The group also helps you network with other PhDs. I think this group or something else similar could help.",

      "text": "I'm just finishing my thesis in international relations and I got an industry job already (after 6 months searching). Allow my two cents in how I did it.\n\n\nI checked what companies valued in my field. Do not rely only on your PhD to get employed, take training courses on what you want to do. E.g., I took courses in project management, risk management, agile and others. If you take live courses in zoom, try to ask a good question at the end. Your name will stand out.\n\n\n\nSecond, network is key. Even with the pandemic, I started to ask my friends about my CV (curated by a specialist) and added things they suggested. They showed my CV to their friends in the industry, so the ball was rolling. I went to LinkedIn vacancies and began to talk to recruiters about my chances. When getting negative feedback, I asked how should I improve myself to be considered for next openings.\n\n\n\nThird, learn to sell yourself. People will always ask why they should hire a PhD reeking of academia. You must have the answer ready - your skills, your projects, the training you're taking. I know it's hard when you're seeking for a year, but honestly I was only selected for interviews after I stated to chat with recruiters about me being awesome.\n\nI really hope things work out for you, OP. Dm me if you want any more help.",

There is still a competition, you won't be showered by job offers just because you have a relevant PhD. \n\nA year seems long, but it probably isn't. There are likely not that many jobs on your level, and if you are geographically constrained it adds. So the numbers game is against you. \nI don't know about your local diffusing, but in particular in local government internal hires are indeed a thing. However, you need to learn to not take that personally - it doesn't mean your expertise is of no value. \n\nKeep going. Those who persist always get a job in the end. Don't give up. It would be harder, or more frustrating, without a PhD. \n\nAlso, you sound depressed. Maybe have a chat with your GP.",

                      "text": "I'm an Australian PhD graduand and found a job through connections and I completely disagree that a PhD is not a job in Australia. A PhD is a job in Australia, it's a job in Europe, and it's a job in USA. Part of my PhD (~40%) was in the UK and it's exactly the same there.\n\nThe problem in Australia is that employers do not care if you have a PhD unless it's government, consulting, research, and a few other jobs. When applying for entry-level jobs (e.g. graduate roles), put your pay expectations down to 55\u201370k (remember, MD interns get paid 69k at RPA, so it's not that bad). You're a PhD and capable of impressing people with the (much higher) quality of work, but you need some industry experience. In fact, it took me just 2\u20133 months to be on upper management's radar as a future candidate for better management roles. It will take you a year or so (because you're relatively new to industry) and you'll be on your way. You'll fine that a decent PhD actually completely shits on any bachelors or masters level employee, so it's not hard to get attention of senior management \u2013 they are *always* looking for talented people (which many PhDs are).\n\nAlso, based on feedback I've received from recruiters, a major concern is that PhDs can talk too much during an interview. *Keep your answers concise.* It might even feel like you're being too brief, but this is a good thing. A lot of questions just need to be 30 seconds (early in the interview) and the longer ones are maybe 2\u20133 minutes (towards the latter half of the interview).\n\n@OP, I can look at your CV, if you want, and offer some feedback. I know how rough it is as a PhD grad looking for work, since few will give you the chance.",

      "text": "Hey, I am a social science Ph.D. as well and had no intention of staying in academia. I basically sold my analytics ability in the market. I did my Ph.D. on a completely unrelated topic as I now work in peace and development research. The think tank I work in has absolutely no connection to my Ph.D. except that the questionnaire uses a lot of subjective indicators. It's kind of ironic because most of the places I used to send manuscripts to turned them down because I used subjective indicators. However, that got me the job! \n\nI don't have a clear-cut solution but this is what I did. I was desperate, just had got married and my wife was also a Ph.D. student in the US then. I cast a really wide net, a really really wide net. I must have applied to close to 600 jobs from December 2019 (kind of semi-desperate) to June 2020 (full-blown desperation) end (my stipend had ended in May) and I started my job in July. So to start with I applied to a lot of places, a lot of them not even directly related to what I do but even if there was a small niche I could make myself relevant in, I would apply. \n\nI didn't network at all. I find academic gatherings fake - I can't stand them, so I went to Linkedin and I kept following pages, organizations, and people whose jobs I liked. I kept adding them, kept following pages, and finally, I started getting a lot of job openings. Not just those that come up on the normal search but general people posting and talking about stuff.  Finally in the middle of the pandemic - I got three calls. \n1. Position for a volunteer in IRC - somewhere in NY/NJ, USA\n2. A really small NGO which was opening up a data team - starting with two people. \n3. A really cool think tank in Europe, where I thought I had no chance. \n\nI got rejected as a volunteer by IRC. In the interview with the NGO, I got a rejection as well. Guess, I didn't quite fit in the mould they were looking for. Eventually, the think tank in Europe gave me a job in July. Pay is not that great but they take care of health and don't make work like indentured labour. They have a good reputation and I hope to stay for 2-3 years and then make a transition to monitoring and evals in NGOs. Maybe IRC can finally stop rejecting me for volunteer positions with a Ph.D. and actually offer me a job. ; )\n\nPoint is that I was lucky, right place and right time but the issue is you have to talk to people, within academia, on LinkedIn, apply to a hundred thousand places. I can't deal with the fake atmosphere of academia, so that option was closed for me but I contacted people on Linkedin, asked them for advice, and kept applying. It would be helpful if you ask help with resumes and cover letters and also make sure that your applications are steered to the job.",

It doesn't have to be formal salaried office experience (although that helps a lot), but even a relatively recent internship or a time you consulted on a project with a non-academic entity. When you're 30, and when you have a PhD, companies are reluctant to hire you for entry-level roles, but at the same time, if you have no work exp, they're going to assume you're not ready for the higher-level roles. So K-PhD people are often in this weird limbo when it comes to industry jobs, unless they are of course the few industry jobs that specifically look for PhDs.\n\nIf you don't have work experience, I'd consider an internship (some of them are paid, and anyway, building experience and getting paid even a low wage is better than sitting at home not getting paid anything), or a temp position, a fellowship, or some other short-term program that lets employers try you out and lets you try out your chosen field.",

You do have to pay, but you get a bunch of useful info on all aspects of the job hunt. If you don't want to spend any money, here are some things I found out. Orient yourself on what job titles are out there and try to cast a big net based on your transferable skills (project management, technical skill, writing, presentation, analysis, experimental design and so on). Some things I didn't know: names of job titles in R&D to look for (R&D project management, user experience research, business development manager, R&D director, quality control, quality assurance, application scientist and so on). Also to start looking for more management roles (and perhaps do a course on Coursera or something to boost your skill). Look at the language people use to present themselves on LinkedIn etc. In the resume, highlight your ability to work in teams, your innovative spirit, your coaching of others, adaptability, experience and comparison of different methods or hardware solutions (product, market knowledge). For your resume, do a simple word comparison between job announcement and your resume and make them match because they use software to scan them. E.g. if the word 'scientific analysis' occurs 3 times in the job announcement, make sure your resume has that exact same word combination at least once. Same with every other word that seems important. The more overlap the better.",

With that said, with my PhD and no experience, I had a 100% success rate in getting interviews for graduate programs \u2013 but these were my first ever interviews and I sucked at them lol. A recruiter eventually told me what I was doing wrong.\n\nAnother problem is that postdocs have the reputation of being \"poorly paid\". This is generally true in Europe and North America, where you'd get paid more in almost any industry job, but this doesn't apply in Australia. Your first non-academic job here will not pay as well as an Australian postdoc. You'll will need to settle for 60\u201370k for a year or two, and you'll likely excel in that role and get noticed \u2013 after that, those >100k roles become more attainable.",

I had graduated from a research-based master's program and was looking for work for 6 months. The thing that helped me was that I focused on any industry related research jobs. Focus on transferrable skills i.e. skills in qualitative, and quantitive data analysis. I focused on applying to positions that were titled, \"data analyst\", \"Research analyst\", and \"Evaluations Lead\" etc. This is when I started to hear back from organizations because they were looking for people with experience with that. Go on indeed and type, \"quantitive or qualitative research\" jobs and apply to 5 jobs every single day. Getting a job is simply a numbers game. You need to apply for A LOT of jobs. This increases your odds of success. I did not focus on networking or sending messages to people. That never worked for me. I simply applied to 5 jobs every single day that were advertised, tailored my cover letter/resume to the needs of the jobs, and did so consistently. This is how I get results. You can do it!",

Consulting may sound like a nebulous concept but all I did was get started on a freelancer website ([Upwork.com](https://Upwork.com) was the one I used) and started to look for jobs and found one that matched my expertise. \n\nI have had others go down the volunteer path, but this was the path I chose because it came with a payslip. \n\nGood luck! \n\n**P.s.** Australian here, and the job + freelance gigs were all overseas.",
