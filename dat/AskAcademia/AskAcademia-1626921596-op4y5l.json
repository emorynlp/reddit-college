  "text": "Posted a few days ago about preparing to break the news to my PIs. I wanted to come back on here and share that my PIs were incredibly supportive. I was completely honest with them about wanting to switch into an acting career, and they told me they\u2019re really happy that I\u2019m following my passion and that they\u2019re rooting for me. \n\nI know every PI will act differently, but I just wanted to share some positivity on this sub in hopes that this will help others in similar boats feel less nervous.\n\nWishing everyone on this sub well!",

It has always been something that I excel in, as well as in science but recently I\u2019ve been more aware of my desire to be in the fashion industry. \n\nI recently thought that maybe I should just consider not getting a PhD all together.m and getting a masters after 2 years and working as a technician. I love research but not as much a fashion. I feel so unappreciative that I even got accepted into the program, but I know it\u2019s a stable career. \n\nI feel so silly any advice for me?! \ud83e\udd74",

Thanks so much and good for you for taking steps to reflect on what you want.\n\nNot sure where you\u2019re at financially, but if you\u2019re in a place where you\u2019re able to transition to a master\u2019s to focus more time on fashion, I\u2019d say go for it if it\u2019s what your passion is!\n\nNot that I totally regret it, but looking back, I realize the fear of not having a \u201cstable\u201d career and the guilt of taking up funding is what stopped me from pursuing my dreams earlier. But the more and more I pushed out of my comfort zone, the more I realized that there\u2019s always a way to carve the path you want. I went through a lot of anxiety and depression staying in my PhD because it\u2019s what my parents/PIs wanted, not what I wanted. Quitting was the best thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life, and being on set recently just solidified that I\u2019m willing to give it my all (and work part time survival jobs) so that I can give my dream a shot before I\u2019m old and regret all my life choices.\n\nSome people will make these decisions out to be very \u201call or nothing\u201d, but remember, you can always change your mind down the road and find creative ways to fulfill secondary routes if necessary. My new philosophy is that you never know what\u2019s going to happen, or your potential for happiness, until you try!\n\nWishing you the best of luck!",
