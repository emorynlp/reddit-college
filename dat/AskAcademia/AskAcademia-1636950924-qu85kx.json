  "text": "I had a research idea that I wanted to pursue but my PI suggested that there wasn't enough funding to try something so experimental on such an early-stage PhD student. Are there grants/funding opportunities I could apply for to get funding for more experimental research work?",

      "text": "Aside from finding grants/funding, you can just add this to your list of research ideas to try later, which you should be building up as soon as possible.  It's quite normal for profs to be a bit risk-averse with a new student wanting to spend time on something time-consuming and high-risk - their job is to make sure you're on a path where you're likely to actually publish and graduate.\n\nGive it some time.  You'll probably get a lot more leeway for self-direction and experimentation after you've actually demonstrated that you can successfully bring a project from beginning to end, and once you've consistently shown good judgement, scientific skills, and time/project management.",

      "text": "Might try looking into an NIH NRSA F30 or F31 if this is something you plan to do your dissertation work in? Otherwise many schools have some internal funding for grad students and many professions/foundations (depending on your discipline) also have funding. Do some research to find some mechanisms and bring those ideas back to your advisor",
