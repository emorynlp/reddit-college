  "title:": "Reviewing the n-th paper about an overdone topic. What should I say?",
  "text": "I'm reviewing for a high impact medical journal. A group submitted a paper where they use artificial intelligence to solve a specific (technical, non-diagnostic) task. This task is perfectly suited for artificial intelligence. Indeed the first papers that tried it and succeeded were from 2016. \n\nIn this paper the authors try the latest fad in neural network design and they conclude that... this one works. Like the 200 previous others with less fancy techniques. \n\nWhat can I say? It's technically correct. But if it were a math journal I'd be asking for many experiments to be performed so that it shows what are the differences between this solution and the state-of-the-art ones. But here it's a medical journal, no one cares about math. Should I recommend acceptance? Then why not another 200 ones that say \"this thing that works also works if I paint my PC green\"? Should I recommend rejection just because they bored me?  Should I ask for further tests? Which ones? They already demonstrated quite well that \"it works\". Just not that it works any different from how it's known to do!  And anyway... I don't want to be the asshole reviewer!",

But you can still ask about relative performance. Did they just say \"We're testing out algorithm Z\" or did they say, \"Current state of the art are algorithms W, X, and Y, we're interested in assessing algorithm Z.\" If not the latter, ask them to do so.\n\nAnother thing that you could ask about is sample sizes (perhaps again compared over the methods, as appropriate). From my limited experience with them, ML methods are somewhat \"data hungry\", so if one is better in small samples, or one really excels when n gets large enough, that could be useful to know.\n\n> Should I recommend rejection just because they bored me?\n\nUnless you think that your interest should be the arbiter of what constitutes publishable science, then no. That doesn't mean you need to favorably review this paper, but recommending rejection because you weren't interested doesn't strike me as a viable rationale.",

The other person who replied to you is entitled to their opinion, but I think there is nothing unethical about a hierarchy of publication venues. The very top journals in mathematics (eg Annals of Mathematics) aim to publish only papers that solve or make substantial progress on problems that are quite fundamental and should be of interest to a wide selection of mathematicians. Below that are the top journals in each particular field. For me that's probably the Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B. As you go down the hierarchy, papers get either more niche or less strong, or a bit of both. This hierarchy helps us sort through the reams and reams of published papers in our (enormous) field. I am unconvinced that there is anything unethical about this - I have reviewed papers for a very wide range of these journals, I doubt that I receive any benefit from doing so. At any rate, impact factor is pretty meaningless for us.",

There is a problem which stems from the deep learning revolution for which many papers don't present any kind of novelty: the authors design a neural network for a specific task, demonstrate that it works (within its boundaries) and that's it. One of my PhD supervisors used to tell me that when we evaluate these kind of papers, we should be aware of the technical **and** the scientific contribution that a piece of work contains. What have we learned on a technical, engineering level from what you are telling us in this paper? Why did things work and why did others not? On a broader point of view, how does this work enhance our scientific understanding of the problem we are trying to frame? Simply telling \"this empirically chosen set of hyperparameters work\" is not enough.\n\nIn my opinion, in a situation such as the one you described, a lack of novelty would be sufficient to not accept a paper in a high-impact journal, unless (as others have already mentioned) the authors are able to argue about how does their work fit in and advance the state-of-the-art of applied ML.
