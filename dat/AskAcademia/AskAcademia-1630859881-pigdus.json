  "text": "So, I've been applying to postdoc and some non-profit positions since last year. No luck so far except for one job where I'm waiting to hear if I will be offered pending first candidate's decision. I've grown increasingly certain that academic research is where my strengths lie and that's where I am most fruitful and fulfilled. \n\nHowever, in the current job market it is no longer conducive or practical for me to hold out for something that may not happen in a reasonable time-frame. So my question is, if I put a pause on future academic path search, which pathway will most get me back to it in the next year or two? \n\nMy paths are - teaching at community colleges or going for a corporate job. I've been told that getting a teaching job will sound the death knell for a TT academic track. What about corporate jobs? Has anyone transitioned from corporate jobs to academia? What strategies did you employ to keep yourself competitive and how did you make the transition? Would like to hear from folks on this.",

      "text": "If you want a TT at a research institution, *do not take a teaching gig at a CC, even if it is TT.* This is exactly what I did, as I graduated from grad school at the beginning of the Great Recession, and my options have been limited since (I\u2019ve been teaching in some capacity, TA or otherwise, going on fifteen years). The only recourse I had was to go back to school for another degree and hope that my hiring committees would see this as being \u201creintroduced\u201d to rigorous academia and absolve me of my sin of going the CC route.",

          "text": "Wow! Thanks for the warning! Point noted. Research is what I want to do. The case with me is I need a job sooner than later and the postdoc positions where I'd be a decent enough fit are few and far between. My publications are still under review and I have more collaborative research in the works which all together would put me in a better position next year. There are a couple postdoc options for next years cycle but it won't be soon enough for me and neither are these permanent options.\n\nSo that puts me in a bit of a difficult situation at the moment. My priority as I've been told by well-wishers should be to get a position that gets me permanent residence even if it is not in academia. Hence the question. A corporate job is actually least desired (been there, done that and decided it wasn't for me). But given all this, I guess I need to take what comes. The same well-wishers were pushing me to take a teaching job at a CC because there's more money in teaching than research. But given what you've told me, I guess a corporate path in the interim is the slightly better option. Thanks!",

Don't bank on that.\n\nIf you take a non-academic job and want to try to move back into academia when you can, then you need to be publishing an article or two each year to stay relevant if you want a research job, especially since you won't have a university affiliation.\n\nYou could also adjunct a class each year or semester, on top of working a non-academic job, maybe a low-work evening class, to build your teaching C.V., but I would strongly recommend against adjuncting as a primary source of income.\n\nGood luck.",

I'm dizzy just reading your post, you leap from I want to do a post doc or work for a not for profit (2 totally different jobs) to should I work for a community college or take a corporate job - 2 more totally unrelated careers and \"corporate\" can mean pretty much anything in the private sector and then ask if you can get a TT post from any if these. \n\nIt shouldn't be that hard to get a postdoc. If you're applying to lots and not getting interviews I'd say your problem isn't the market, it's your applications, which given how scattergun your post is seems a good bet. \n\nIt's fine to be unsure what you want to do, and it's fine to have multiple options open but you do have to research those options and write each application like it's the only job you're applying to. More options means more work not less.",

          "text": "This is the least helpful post I've read so far. It would be EXTREMELY foolish to restrict myself to just one or two postdocs that I fit into. There seem to be two camps of people - those that only talk about targeted search for those postdocs that fit your intended path. And that usually comes from privileged people who have backup options or a spouse who is working and they can take all the time they need.\n\nAlso they are not immigrants. We are hampered also by regulations that restrict us and do not apply to those in privilege. If you think it shouldn't be that hard to get a postdoc you need a reality check. There are plenty of people who are VERY well qualified who are still struggling. It is the market and not the people.\n\nI know the range and extent of my skills and everything I have to offer. It is a very specialized interdisciplinary field and there haven't been that many postdoc positions that are even a 50% fit on what I do. Over the past year I have received interviews from 4-5 positions but out of those 3 out of 5 were not even a remote fit to my research, 1 would have been a bit of a stretch and 1 was a near thing where they have 1 candidate ahead of me. \n\nI am VERY sure I want a TT job and unless you have any suggestions that speak to immigrants who have to kiss a lot of ass to get a permanent residence and a permanent position, I'd rather not deal with the condescension.",
