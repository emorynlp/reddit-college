  "text": "I am a PhD student at the University of Sydney in Australia, in my second year. I'm working on Neuromorphic Neural Networks, a cool new type of A.I. \n\nAs a way of helping others, i've been working on a [website](https://www.findmypathway.com) in my spare (lol) time to help undergrad and grad students find their pathway. \n\nI just wrote a [blog post](https://www.findmypathway.com/blog/should-i-do-a-phd/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=r/askacademia&utm_content=link) on my experience as a PhD student, and what I wish I knew before starting. \n\nThe rest of the website offers example pathways and descriptions of related industry or academic careers in the field. There's a whole page dedicated to Academic Research as well (although it's just been put up so any feedback / contributions would be amazing).\n\nThere's no ads on the site, and it's completely free!\nThank you all and I hope you enjoy!",

Licensed profession pathways are very much determined by  local regulations that vary nonsensically from place to place.",

I'm getting a PhD and I love it, but because I didn't really understand what different kinds of options there were for me with my undergraduate degree. I was a full-scholarship, lower-middle class student at an elite, private undergrad (in the U.S.) and I went to our career counseling center once and was so intimidated by the experience I never went back; they didn't really know how to help you if you had no clue what you wanted to do after graduation. My professors weren't helpful for thinking about career paths because...they all went straight to academia. If someone had  thoughtfully explored all of my different options with me, who knows where I would be!",

Like you're drawing me in with free content but have hidden the good stuff behind a paywall that I'll shortly discover. The pop-up really didn't help with that. If you do intend for it to be 100% free now and forever, consider incorporating that into your banner/splash page loud and clear, near the top (so no scrolling required to see it). \n\n...And maybe start thinking about what you can do to differentiate its graphic design from all those other consulting websites and such. For example, it would change the feel quite a bit if all the fade-in buttons appeared more instantaneously. (come to think of it, I bet most sites do those fade-ins not just because they're cool, but because they get you to spend an extra half-second on each page while the buttons fade in)",

So you should probably weight the opinions of people in the 23-27 demographic a bit higher than mine.\n\nBy buttons fading in, I mean that as I scroll downwards after first loading the page, each element fades in rather than appears. So first it's the squares under \"Looking for guidance\", then it's the text of \"How to make a career decision\", then it's \"Let's talk\", then \"Still undecided\". I didn't realize you'd bought a theme with these features all set up, though, so maybe it's not modifiable! It does look very snazzy and polished -- I at first thought, \"wow, this grad students must be pretty on top of his work to so quickly learn this much front-end web dev!\"",
