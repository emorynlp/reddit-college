  "text": "Hello!\n\nDoes any of you use [CTE](https://cte.oeaw.ac.at/) for critical editions on MacOS Big Sur? I do, but I am having problems with making PDFs.\n\nThe command File->Make PDF never worked fine on my Mac, but I always managed with the procedure File->Print->Print to File.\n\nSince I updated the operative system to Big Sur, I am not allowed to produce PDFs in any of these ways.\n\nHas anyone had the same problem? How did you solve it?\n\nThanks in advance! =)",
