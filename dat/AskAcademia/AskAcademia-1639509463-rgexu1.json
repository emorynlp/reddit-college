  "text": "people how got post doc position in biology in Europe (mostly interested in Germany, Austria and Belgium), how competitive was the process, does it really take more than 3 papers in one's resume (one is first author, all are in Q1, Q1 journals), it seems to me that compared with PhD positions, post doc ones are extremely limited, would appreciate any insight",

      "text": "The availability of academic jobs tapers quickly as you progress up the academic ladder from undergraduate to PhD student to postdoc etc. The required qualifications differ, often based on how many people are applying for a specific postdoc. If the postdoc is in a top lab with a glamorous group leader, then you may need multiple first author papers to be competitive. In contrast, less glamorous labs will have a lower bar, and certainly some people get postdocs with only one or two papers (sometimes even none).",

      "text": "It is not easy to say how competitive it was since applicants are not aware of the details behind the recruitment process. Some universities/groups are more competitive than others and this you should already know about it. You need to apply to groups where you are interested in the research and where you believe you can bring in something. \n\nSince you have not given any details on your field of research (Biology is not precise enough as it comprises a lot of specialized subfields such as molecular biology, plant biology, evolutionary biology, systems biology, genetics, computational biology, theoretical biology, etc. etc. etc.), it is difficult to give a more tailored answered.\n\nAlso, some postdoc positions are not officially advertised and may be created on the spot by professors if they have funding available.",
