  "text": "people how got post doc position in biology in Europe (mostly interested in Germany, Austria and Belgium), how competitive was the process, does it really take more than 3 papers in one's resume (one is first author, all are in Q1, Q1 journals), it seems to me that compared with PhD positions, post doc ones are extremely limited, would appreciate any insight",
