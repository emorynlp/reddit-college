This first is a variation on our weekly Office Hours post as we do most frequently see undergrads in our sub chatroom. Please feel free to try it out in any way that makes sense for you and we'll see what emerges. Thanks!",

I had a really good offer from one of my ugrad professors but was scared of getting my bs and phd from the same university. I talked to all the profs in the dpt who had done it and a few friends in the graduate program at the time who had done it. Ultimately it's the project, environment, and professor that should be what you're looking at, school kind of secondary. I went with my undergrad degree for phd and have absolutely zero regrets. My advisor is amazing, especially at this collaborative as opposed to student/teacher level, and my project is super fun.",

One thought is to begin full time work in the field of GIS to pay back some student loan debt and then find an employer willing to pay for grad school. Another thought is to stay in the student mode and apply for grad programs (Geography, Urban Planning and Design) in the PNW I am passionate about. I do believe my grad school application would be pretty strong due to my intern and club/organizational leadership experiences and GPA but such a consequential decision has left me with more questions than answers.
