  "title:": "Advice and answers for my starting my PhD (UK)",
  "text": "I accepted a studentship at the university of Surrey in materials science and nanotechnology. \n\nGenerally feeling quite excited for the project. I really like my supervisor and he seems to have a style of work and passion for green technology that matches my own. \n\nI guess I'm looking for some general advice before starting, what is something you wish you had been told or knew before you started on your own journey?\n\nSpecifically, I'm quite eager to know what the work load was like if you also went through a UK based STEM PhD. I definitely need a work life balance to remain sane and I'm planning on treating this as a 40hour work week with a reasonable amount of flexibility to account for irregularities. My supervisor assured me I will set my own intensity of work and (for example) if I say I don't work mornings, he'll see me at 11. This sounds perfect for me as I tend to have random bursts of intense focus and productivity.\n\nBasically, will I have time to still pursue hobbies and spend time with my friends and girlfriend etc? Compared to a \"regular\" job what should I expect the work life balance to be?\n\nGrateful for any input. \n\nCheers.",

      "text": "UK based PhD student here. PhD life is a lot more flexible than the 9-5 world. Depending on your supervisor, you can generally set your own hours and tailor your schedule to suit your needs. My funding council gives students 8 weeks' holiday, which is a lot more generous than a \"normal\" job. The workload really does ebb and flow. Some weeks there's not very much work at all and others it's all hands on deck. You may need to be prepared to put in work outside of normal working hours, for instance if you're running an experiment you might need to work in the evenings or over a weekend. Things will get more intense as you get further into the PhD, particularly as you start to work on conference presentations and publications. Ultimately, as long as you manage your time sensibly, you will almost certainly be able to fit in your hobbies and girlfriend alongside your PhD if that's what you want to do. Good luck!",

      "text": "It's certainly possible to have a good balance as a PhD student by focusing on increasing your efficiency and productivity rather than your hours.  You can either spend a *lot* of time being inefficient, or do a 40ish hour week using your time extremely well.  I'd encourage you to regularly step back and observe your own productivity and try to increase it by noticing what does and doesn't work for you.  \n\nSome ways to get there: \n\n* Relying on \"random intense bursts\" isn't a good strategy.  Take advantage of them when they come, by all means, but you'll need to develop the self-discipline to use the rest of your time well, too.  For me, this means having a mix of tasks that need doing - so switching between high- and low-intensity work, and regularly alternating between lab work, reading/writing, or programming/data analysis.  Some people are more efficient if they only focus on one thing for the entire day or week.  Figure out what works for you and proactively plan each day and week around that.  \n\n* Keep a list of (relatively) low-effort but important tasks and do them when you don't have the focus/energy to do the intense work.  Things like creating and polishing figures, documentation, tidying up your reference manager or literature review, looking at other students' PhD theses to see how you should write yours, routine data analysis, etc.  \n\n* Get some books on project management and skim through them.  Think about things like planning, critical paths, and risk analysis.  Learn to recognise the tasks where spending 10 minutes on something now will save you 30 minutes in the future.  \n\n* If you're doing something that isn't working, take a step back and make a plan about how to identify the problem instead of just trying it over and over again and hoping you get lucky, or wasting days/weeks modifying irrelevant variables.  \n\n\n\n\nSource: supervising and observing UK PhD students.",

      "text": "I am not in the UK nor did I do a PhD there but I do have advice for you because I am in a mood. You don't need to work 24/7 but be prepared make it happen when it needs to happen. So many of my students will bail at 17:30pm instead of sticking it out to 18:15 to have the experiment done. They come in the next day and need to redo three days worth of work to get back to where they were. If they would have stuck it out  for 45 minutes, it would be done.  \n\nThis is the number one thing that separates my good students from mediocre ones- an understanding that sometimes you need to get it done, a sense of urgency. This occasionally will mean telling people you are late to the party, or that you have to poke your head in for an hour and a half on the weekend, but this stuff really adds up.  \n\n\nThat and read as much as you possibly can early in your Phd. Its an investment that pays enormous dividends throughout your studies.",
