  "text": "I received a tenure track asst prof offer on Fri in chemical engineering at a mid level R1 institute in the US. I am happy! I do not have other offers and 100% plan to take this because my husband is here and there\u2019s no other option within two hour commute. \n\n(1) I can see salaries online as they are public. I am very happy with the salary offer.  Should I still negotiate? Always? \n\n(2) The start up funding is quite low ($25,000) unexpectedly low, for someone who does wet chemistry. I genuinely expected it to be an order of magnitude higher. I cannot buy any piece of equipment or support even one student with this money. Not sure what to even say. \n\nI thought about asking another professor who just began in the dept last year what he thought I could negotiate for in funding. Unsure what\u2019s appropriate given the large chasm. Almost want to accept and not deal with it, after I waited 3 months for the offer.",

      "text": "First off, congrats!!\n\nBuild yourself a spreadsheet of all the operating costs you anticipate having in the first couple years before you get grants - equipment you need that isn't already at the school, recurring wet lab materials, staff, lab furniture, etc. Get really specific with what everything costs and how much you need. Then color code it with what is *absolutely fundamental,* aka you cannot do the job you were hired for without it (do you need to supervise students in the first couple years to meet tenure requirements?), vs. what would suck to lose but technically could still do some work, and what would be nice to have. Then add up those costs. If it were January, I'd say try to negotiate for the cost of the first two categories, but nowadays it's probably best to only ask for the first and not risk losing the offer. Without the startup you absolutely need to function, you're technically a negative investment for the school, the department, and yourself, so that's what you should ask for and present it along with the spreadsheet justifying why you need that amount. Taking that approach makes it a conversation about \"how can we together make this productive,\" instead of something adversarial where you're trying the get the most boon for yourself. I wouldn't try to negotiate the salary if you're decently happy with it, since you're already unhappy with the start up so that should be the focal point.  \n\nHopefully your new department head will be on your side and help advocate for you to the dean, because they want this position filled before the school might make it disappear. You could also talk to them with your spreadsheet first before going to the school, if you feel like you have a good relationship with them, about what creative solutions might exist already in the department that you aren't currently aware of. For instance, post-interview I found out there is a built in moving fund and conference travel fund for all new faculty at my institution so I didn't have to negotiate for those.\n\nThis is the negotiation process I took to great success. Granted though, that was in January and my field is cognitive neuroscience. Good luck OP!",

      "text": "Congrats op! This is especially great in this market. \n\nI'm a department chair and have a lot of experience in hiring. If your salary offer is fair there's no reason to negotiate, especially in this market. But if your startup isn't sufficient to support your work that needs to be made clear! First, because your new department will want to you succeed, and second because it's usually far easier to boost startup than base salary. When managing a departmental or divisional budget one-time funds are much easier to come by than recurring funds...I'd much rather settle on a $50K startup increase than a $10K base salary increase, because that $50K hits my budget once but the $10K goes on forever. Second, startup is a different pool of money from compensation; often there are startup funds unspent in another department or division that I can tap. And third-- very important to me at least --is that never want to bump a starting salary too high compared to anyone who has been with us a couple of years...salary compression is very bad for morale. That's *especially* going to be true if there are layoff pending at your new school, as there are at mine and most others.\n\nJust for perspective, startup offers in equipment-heavy STEM fields at my SLAC might begin at $10-20K but are often $50-75K when necessary. Surely an R2 would be able to adequately back your research needs, even if they need to phase that in over a couple of years (which we've done with some larger awards). You might also be able to negotiate a multi-year startup from a smaller base number, as everyone is assuming the worst for enrollments and revenues in fall 2020.",

Did you make a list of what you needed/wanted and justified it? If so, time to reiterate with them why you need these things. There might be alternate ways to get things too- shared with other people, institutional grants, teaching release while you get grants to buy these things, students supported by dept/TAships, etc. But make sure you aren't walking into a situation that you cannot be successful in.",

      "text": "First off - congratulations on the job offer! \n\nWhen I took my first job as an Assistant Professor about 10 years ago in the University of California system, I had the same concerns. The very helpful chair at the time told me that the salary was not negotiable, so I ended up not arguing for more salary at the time. Looking back, that was still the right decision, as now, on the other side of hiring, I see how set in stone most salaries are. The main way to negotiate for a higher salary is to have a competing job offer with a higher salary. The university then may have access to additional funds (typically at the dean level) that can be used to counter such other offers with a new salary offer. Most universities keep starting salaries within a very similar range, and checking that you are being offered a salary on par with others in your position is the best approach. If you are satisfied with the salary and don't have a competing offer, I would take the salary offer without negotiation. \n\nIn contrast, **startup funds are typically VERY negotiable**. I was very very hesitant to ask for more when I was negotiating, but my husband at the time (who worked in the computer startup world) pushed me to try negotiating the offer. I thought maybe I would ask for about 10k more, but he convinced me to ask for 100k more. And it WORKED! They expected me to negotiate the startup, and every hire I have seen since then has had the same expectation. I am in neuroimaging (which has larger startups than some fields due to the cost of the research), and was offered $200,000 at first. I asked for $300,000, and received $290,000 with no concerns or push-back from the university . It turns out that the other person hired the same year as I was ended up receiving exactly the same startup. If I had not asked, I would have been left with the $200,000. I can't imagine how much worse off I would have been without the extra $90k. I now share this story with whomever I can, as we receive so little training in this in grad school or postdoc positions. Do NOT be afraid to ask for more. There is pretty much no chance that the school will withdraw the offer if you ask for too much. They already have sunk time and money into choosing you, and they risk losing the faculty line at this point if they do not hire you (and given the coming economic crisis, the loss of the faculty line for the department is very likely). If they can't go higher, they will simply tell you so and then let you decide whether you can accept the position or not with the offered startup. \n\nI am now working on a lot of campus and state budget issues for my university. This same advice will still apply in the current economic situation. Schools in CA are dealing with the crisis with different approaches: worst case scenario is schools withdrawing an offer. Such a case would be totally independent of what you request, as it is a directive that would come from the Chancellor/President/Provost (central administration). Your department would most likely still be fighting to keep you. Your story does NOT sound like this worst case is an issue for you. Most common case right now in CA is that offers already out there will continue to go through, but new hires will be restricted in varying ways that differ by school. That means that normal negotiation will continue in most cases for current offers. As other comments have noted, you need to ask for what will make your research move forward effectively. That may be hard to know, but more is better -- I still have some startup funds left that support new endeavors. Startup funds are unrestricted usually, unlike grants, so they are very important to obtain. \n\nI suggest maybe telling them that you would ideally need more startup funds even just for startup equipment and, if possible, provide them with examples of other packages you may know about. Do you have any friends in similar positions you could ask you are not at your university for a comparison of current startups in your field? In terms of supporting students, will you be required to support students, or is there other departmental support, like tuition remission from TAships? In our department, we have TAships for grad students and also support students using grant money. None of us uses startup funds for student support, as those are better used for research that can be used as pilot data for future grant funding. \n\ntl/dr: **Be sure to negotiate your startup funds!** Good luck, and congrats! :)",

Maybe they'll pull themselves back up or maybe they'll lose their grip and free fall to the bottom. That's where academia (and with it the academic job market) is right now, down and hanging on precariously. Schools are facing significant threats to enrollment, which costs them in both tuition and auxiliary revenue, while having to simultaneously adjust to a new model for their services. Endowments haven taken a hit from the stock market drop.

It is expected that you will (in writing up their offer, they did not assume that you had no others against which to negotiate).\n\nIn your response:\n1. Be enthusiastic, courteous, and grateful,\n2. Ask for a modest raise (I asked for 5k and got 2k),\n3. Ask for more in start-up funds, and justify your request with a couple of representative expenses,\n4. Again, be enthusiastic, courteous, and grateful. \nThese things would help ensure your success and your University wants you to succeed.\n\nRegarding asking other folks at your uni, I think this depends on the vibe you got from them. If you got on well with that other professor, then go ahead and ask. It's awkward, but it's not odd.",

      "text": "Congrats! What has been said above is some great advice so I will go generally. Always negotiate everything . The state of the times doesn\u2019t matter, because no matter how bad things are, you and your future academic success are still worthy of a proper investment. For a look into the reasons why, read Women Don\u2019t Ask, even if you are not a women because it has a great way of breaking down the consequences of not asking for what you need and deserve over the course of a career. So even if you are happy with the salary, it\u2019s worth it to ask for a bit more. Another great book to read if you fear negotiating for fear of damaging relationships is Getting to Yes. It equips you with tools to negotiate as a means to solve problems vs you against them. These two books (along with The Power of a Positive No by the same author) were life changing for me. And start practicing now, even for small things like asking a website free shipping or asking for a 10% discount on stuff you are buying. The worst that can happen is that you get told no and it will hone your skills",

      "text": "Congrats on the offer!\n\n> (1) I can see salaries online as they are public. I am very happy with the salary offer. Should I still negotiate? Always?\n\nIf you only have one offer, plus the fact that they presumably know your husband works there, it'll be nearly impossible to get more.  I know of at least one situation where negotiating unnecessarily started a really toxic relationship with the department head and basically the whole department thinking badly of this Assistant Professor before they even arrived.  The rule of thumb I always heard is you need leverage to negotiate- i.e. you need another offer or they lowballed you to the point that you'd reject without more money.  Besides, save your negotiating power for the second point.\n\n> (2) The start up funding is quite low ($25,000) unexpectedly low, for someone who does wet chemistry. I genuinely expected it to be an order of magnitude higher. I cannot buy any piece of equipment or support even one student with this money. Not sure what to even say.\n\nAbsolutely negotiate on this.  I would ask for a meeting with the Department Head before you're due to accept and openly let him or her know your concerns.  This amount is unheard of in engineering, especially if you do experimental work.  Be very respectful, but let them know that to write proposals and make tenure, you need to start getting work done immediately and you will not be successful with that amount in your research area.  Meanwhile, talk with other professors and see if there's equipment in their labs you can use until you get some funding, etc.\n\nBtw are you a spousal hire?  I can't imagine why they'd lowball that much except that your husband's department is paying your salary and that's all they offered your department in the way of startup.",
