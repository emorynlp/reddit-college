  "title:": "How can I help my new PI as his first PhD student?",
  "text": "Hi all! I'm going to be a first year PhD student admitted as the first PhD student directly to the lab of a new PI (with a K99/R00) in neuroscience at a top-20 American department and I wanted to gain a better understanding of the types of pressures and deliverables that my PI would be under given his position. I know that these are \"discussions to be had with the PI directly\" but he seems to be very kind and inclined to insulate me from some of these questions. Things I want to know are along the lines of the following,\n\n* What are the main priorities of the new PI? Securing preliminary data and applying for R01's? Recruiting and growing the lab? Purchasing equipment and setting it up?\n* Given that the tenure clock has started ticking and is slated to end around the time of my anticipated graduation, what should I focus on the make things more successful for him? Paper productivity? Securing independent funding (NSF-GRFP/NDSEG/F31)?\n* What are the great fears and common problems that new PI's have when taking on their first students? That they drop out? That they require too much supervision? Lack of fulfillment on expectations?\n* Is it a bit impetuous to ask to be treated as a colleague in some regards? To be involved in grant applications and drafting of entire manuscripts? To be able to pick research directions for small projects under the scope of their grant Specific Aims? To independently reach out to other researchers and pursue a collaboration if my PI thinks it is a good idea? Or is this all PI dependent?\n* Is there anything I can do to make his life (and thus mine transitively) easier?\n\nThanks again in advance!\n\nEdit: OMG thanks for the gold \ud83d\ude2d my PI was the sole reason I got into one of my top choices (and he\u2019s a part of the community of researchers I most wanted to network with) so I\u2019m just trying to return the favor",

      "text": "So I did my PhD in a lab with a PI who started his lab the same time.  While buying supplies and equipment was mostly completed by the time I joined, if supplies or equipment was needed, it was bought.  A big thing was getting more funding so preliminary data was important.  But for you, finding a project that can become your thesis is important.  My project was also written into a grant that was funded.  The biggest problem was finding the right people for the lab.  My PI had the problem taking everyone at first and we had some poor members.  He eventually learned better ways to sort through people.   I do recommend if you see some red flags or are able to help screen potential members, let your PI know.  These are people you will spend a lot of time with.",

I intend to offer myself as a \u201ctalent scout/secret agent\u201d among the first years in the main neuro department with rotations.\n\nMy PI has a good amount of data he can work with and also will be able to start data collection once the rigs are set-up which is atypical given our model organism takes a year to train. I have a BS and MS in applied math and have a lot of background analyzing data so presumably he will want me spinning out new findings from \u201cold\u201d data?",

      "text": "Aww, this is such a sweet thread :) Thanks for thinking about them. \n\nReplying to your points:\n\n* Probably all of the above. Plus publishing and any instructional duties, as well as ensuring your success as a student. You may be insulated from a lot of this, but it depends on your PI's personality and belief in the value of these discussions from the perspective of student  mentorship/development.\n\n* You should focus on all things relevant to your development and success, which will include good publications and perhaps securing new funding (absolutely ask to apply to fellowships!), as well as beneficially representing your and your lab's work. Helping with new students is also a tremendous development opportunity for you.\n\n* Personally, as a new advisor, I always worried whether I was keeping my students on track for a timely completion with good results (and papers). Being honest and timely with them about what you are doing, your needs, and your progress will help a lot.\n\n* Your advisor probably will treat you like a colleague, especially if you show interest in these details; but don't get too offended if they want to keep some distance. Expect to draft all of your papers. And, hopefully you'll have a chance to help with a proposal or two. (I happily wrote my advisor's proposal that funded my project, both of us taking some real risk there!). And: Always ask before reaching out and establishing new research collaborations (there was another thread about that recently...).\n\n* Your post suggests that you'll do a great job and probably be an ideal first student.\n\nFinally, there's definitely a \"first born\" effect, where some of the first few students of a PI's group are among their most successful. I'm sure this is in part because they are more closely involved in the lab startup process and attended-to with greater concern. The new PI will also be much more sensitive to your experiences as a student, since they recently were one. You should likely be a beneficiary of this effect. Good luck!",

In fact, checking now, their lab website lists no alumni (yikes!). I know the PI professionally now and like them, and they've gotten quite a bit of money, which I suppose explains tenure...\n\nSo it can go either way - you might get an attentive, involved PI or you might get one that has no idea what they're doing.",

I really wish I knew how to assess what my department's tenure evaluation criteria is or even what the tenure rate is but I think that's opaque even to him? The Faculty Handbook is incredibly vague. He seems to be a very kind PI and has said he wants me to graduate in 5 years and although I don't doubt that he is being genuine, I would not be unhappy (or surprised) if it lasted a bit longer given the nature of the subfield.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I'm working on preparing some proposals but I don't think it's likely that I have a shot at anything before the F31 because I'm ineligible for the GRFP having already gotten an MS and the NDSEG/CSGF are both incredibly competitive being highly reliant on GPA as a filter and my MS GPA is a 3.55. I do hope to help with new students  and I've had previous experience helping train 3 more junior RA's and mentor directly 2 interns at my previous work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I had the good fortune to be able to visit his old lab before agreeing to work with him and got a lot of information about his mentorship and management style so I'm hoping I can communicate well with him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* This is definitely what I was looking for since I've already done a significant amount of research in neuroscience (4 undergrad years and 4 post-bacc years) and I'm ready to get started at a \"higher level\". I definitely need more development in the writing and scientific communication department so it's good to hear that I am likely to have these opportunities. I'm preparing some writing samples using a few grant-writing/science writing books over this summer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Thanks! I really hope so! We are both taking a big risk on each other so I hope it works out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Thats also good to know about the \"first-born\" effect; I thought I saw a similar pattern when looking at prominent PI's on Neurotree but wasn't sure if I was imagining things or not.",

Look at their websites, Google Scholar pages, etc., funding records. The best bet for a new TT faculty member is to try to compete against those who went through the same process. This is more your PI's problem, and if you do well by normal Ph.D. student definitions in your field (a handful of papers, high-impact results, presentations/posters, etc...), that will reflect well on them, too.",

I came as the third member grad student in my lab, and I think we (the initial trio) were an awesome team (supportive, intellectually engaging, complimentary skills, dedicated). Our misshappenings have been mainly associated with poor performing postdocs that at times even made me wonder how the earned their degrees (poor experimental design, flawed basic statistical analysis knowledge, not keeping with literature, and zero mentoring capacity, even undergrads I've mentored have ended up mentoring later on some of our postdocs).\n\nHopefully your PI gets a lab manager or research associate soon, and build a cohesive base. Something cool about such first experiences is that you'll get to see how everything comes together, you will build up protocols from scratch that will be the foundation for several research projects down the line, as well as  earning some managerial and planning skills for your future lab. You'll also learn a bunch of \"what not to do\" things, so even at sour times, remember that all these experiences will serve you well when it comes to lead your own team from scratch.",

I was a research associate in a neuroscience research non-profit for the last 4 years so I have some experience about what to look for and what sorts of teams had chemistry and which did not; I also helped with the hiring of several associates and even scientists. Fortunately, all of our hires have been excellent. I'm hoping that I will be a big help because I'll be starting in the lab but will ostensibly be a first-year and am close with the PhD students that are in the rotation program so maybe I can persuade a few to rotate. I'm also going to be the TA for the intro neuro class which the first semester I get in so that will make for a hectic few months but hopefully I can keep an eye out for exemplary students. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe does have a permanent research manager and a couple of undergrads for the summer but hopefully he can get some that will be \"permanent\". I definitely hope I'll get those skills at starting up a lab because the current goal is an academic position but even if not, I'd like to move to a machine learning research team in industry (he has potential collaborators doing heavy ML research).",

I'm supposed to be getting data any day now that I can begin looking and we had some novel methods from a collaborator in mind. We will also be able to begin data collection immediately (or very nearly) when I get there which is excellent.\n\nI'd like to think that I've gotten to the point where I know when I should be asking a question but this is a new field for me so we'll see! I haven't been told to be asking more questions so maybe I should be asking less haha.  I try to make sure to answer my PI within the hour or so for short requests or the day for ones requiring results. I do need to work on setting reasonable timelines for projects though as I'm always a bit overambitious. I have learned a few tricks after working for four years about how to look busy/productive when in actuality I'm stuck though ;) \n\nThanks for this point as well; I have the perhaps bad habit of reaching out far and wide regarding my research and probably could be reined in a bit until I'm more independent. I think being in a new field will be humbling but I think I mostly just wanted to observe the process of drafting, submission, and revision for grants like an R01. Not necessarily actually doing any writing. \n\nAs far as reaching out about collaborations, the extent of what I've been doing has been talking to my friends at other big Uni's with similar projects what kinds of questions they are asking about what sorts of data sets and in my mind seeing if there's any overlap. Not committing any time or even thought related to collaboration.",

          "text": "Thanks for the tips! Our experiments are indeed high-risk so I intend to be following prescriptive avenues of investigation related to the behavioral paradigm suggested by the PI and will exert some leeway only in the computational approaches which I have some background in and are lower-risk. I will try to be very careful about collaborations and only if they've been vetted by my PI as likely to yield results without out too much extra effort and in a short timeline. He is exceptionally collaborative so I think he has a great handle on how to recognize a productive collaboration.",

      "text": "I was in this exact situation and my advice to you is this: Let your PI write grants, do NOT let them bully you into spending all your time applying for funding or doing experiments simply to strengthen grants.                  \nI allowed my PI to do so, thinking that if I'm a team player and help keep the lab afloat my efforts would be recognized. 3 years and lots of funding later he remembers NONE of the effort i put in solely for the lab at the detriment of my own projects. Now I'm a senior grad student (6th going on 7th yr) with no story and far from publication while my peers are graduating one after the other. I was taken advantage of and if I knew it would be this way...\n                \nI would have switched labs a long time ago.",

I'm sorry to hear about the situation you're in but if it's any consolation you've at least helped me approach this more cautiously now that I know what could happen. Best of luck to you!",
