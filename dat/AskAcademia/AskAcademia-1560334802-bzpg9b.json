  "title:": "An unacceptable paper I rejected was accepted. Might this be a predatory journal?",
  "text": "Recently I got a paper to review from an unknown journal. I researched it and I found out that the editor of this journal is a famous, big, completely legit, publisher of a scientific society.  However the journal was a brand new one, one of the open source ones that claim to focus on rapid publication, provided that the research is sound while not making judgments on future significance on the paper (no IF yet).  Therefore I accepted to review.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tried not to be harsh in the review, as the journal is small and the authors were from a very small non -reasearch focused team, like it was their first paper ever. But the paper was completely wrong, in all aspects. English was terrible, structure was surreal and, anyway, what they tried to do was completely wrong (they misunderstood the basics of what they were doing work). Just to give you an example, the abstract was written like they were telling a story, and it included sentences like \"we used [script.sh](https://script.sh) to generate data file processedData.bin\" (where [script.sh](https://script.sh) , it appears, is a script they developed and nowhere they stated what it was doing and how). I was not very harsh in the review but I was very clear in the \"comments to the editor\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDespite this clear, huge problems, I was informed that the paper was accepted pending a \"major\" revision, but what they asked them was very simple. I'm pretty puzzled by this behavior. Should I start thinking that this reputable editor is behaving like a predatory one?",

Well, maybe fire them an email to make sure that they *know* they are the editor of this journal. Scam journals will just take good people in the field and adhere them to the board without their knowledge. Or, they convincingly construct false personas that do not exist at all but have a very convincing (fake) CV.\n\nPredatory journals (and just garbage journals) are a plague. If you think you're a part of one, you probably are.",

But some are certainly legit, e.g., all the PLoS journals.\n\nStill, $1500 sounds crazy to me. And everything else about this screams predatory. In any event, I wouldn't review for any journal edited by someone I haven't personally met (in large part because I don't get much out of it and I already do enough reviewing as is), which I think is a good way to insulate you from exposing yourself to the associational risk.

      "text": "Some predatory journals claim to have famous and reputable editors, while the people themselves have no idea that their names are being used in this way and are not actually involved with these journals. So it can still be a predatory journal even if it's flaunting big names. If I were you, I'd look at the publishing house, rather than the editor, and check if the publishing house is on this list: https://beallslist.weebly.com/ \n\nIf the journal is legit in principle, it's still possible that a paper can get into \"major revision\" status, even if one of the reviewers rejected it. Just wait for the revision. You'll get to see the other reviewers' comments and that usually helps you understand why the editor made a certain decision. \"Major revision\" doesn't usually mean the paper is accepted yet. It can still be rejected after a revision. And if the authors don't address the comments appropriately, you can still reject it a second time.",

There's a lot of pressure on the editors to publish as many papers as possible so the publisher can get that sweet APC $. \nIf you're unhappy with the review process, consider refusing to review articles for this journal/publisher in the future.",

While I know good legitimate papers, and have good legitimate colleagues, in those journals, overall they are so, so close to a predatory publishing house that I can't support them.\n\nI've had bad reviewing experiences with MDPI as well. Just read some of these articles on MDPI -- I found them eye-opening and difficult to square with the good papers I've seen. I think their ability to get traction on a good reputation for a couple of their journals (on the backs of a small subset of good papers) has allowed them to expand their more ridiculous practices without many people noticing.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDPI#Controversies\n\nhttps://transformativelearning.nl/2018/12/04/publish-and-perish-how-the-commodification-of-scientific-publishing-is-undermining-both-science-and-the-public-good/\n\nBased on that blog post just look at the November 2018 issue *Sustainability* -- no reasonable journal should have this many papers being published per issue. **There are 508 papers in this issue**. One issue! It's insane. And this is just *one* of MDPI's 200+ journals. Seems insanely fishy to me and just way, way too many red flags.",

Pretty much everyone I know at least  skims the journal to see what is going on and it's not that uncommon to see it appear on people's CVs either. Again, some of it is so niche that some articles have very limited broad appeal, but on the same token, they are relevant enough to be published somewhere. \n\nThat being said, I'd be really interested to see how many people actually end up paying 1700 CHF to publish in it. Giving reviewers an APC waiver is a really good way to ensure timely reviews and incentivize them to publish in the same journal.",

If you're a grad student, then either you're publishing with your supervisor or you can just ask your colleagues about the journal you want to publish in, if you're not sure about it.
