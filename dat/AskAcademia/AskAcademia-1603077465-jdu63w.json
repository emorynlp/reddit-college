  "title:": "First year grad student feeling alone in the pandemic... Does it get better? Am I the only one?",
  "text": "I (23F) graduated from undergrad in May and am currently attending grad school at the same institution. I'm getting my MA in Spanish literature & language and pedagogy, expected to graduate Spring 2022. I also hold a TA position. Everything is operated over zoom this semester. I live in an apartment with my boyfriend that's walkable distance from campus. \n\nThe first month and a half of grad school has been pretty tough. I am absolutely swamped with work and have many days where I don't see the sun, spending the entire day inside. I do allow myself breaks, but at the end of the day, the workload is very overwhelming especially since I am both a teacher and a student. I have been seemingly able to handle the workload (had my first breakdown last weekend... more to come), but I feel like my workload has been isolating me. Without my boyfriend, my daily interaction with others in person would be pretty much nothing. \n\nI talk (text in a groupchat) to two other girls from my program everyday because I know them from having the same major in undergrad. I am a little closer with the other one, and while it may seem \"good\" that I talk to other people from my program on a daily basis, it doesn't satisfy the void I've been feeling because I don't see them in person. My main problem is the online thing. I don't go out of my way to go to class or the language proficiency lab where I tutor and see smiling faces in the flesh like I used to before the pandemic. I don't get dressed anymore, a particularly important thing for me since I enjoy picking out an outfit for taking on the day. Especially living in the same area where I attended undergrad, I see undergrads on main street with all their friends hanging out, getting coffee, etc. It makes me sad because most people I know graduated and moved out of town, and I used to be very social. Feeling so alone in a town where I would normally be social and active has a particularly eerie sentiment. \n\nIf you have not already, you must have at some point thought, *Why don't you see who is in town from your program and get together with them?* And this is a very good point indeed. Though counter-productive, I really can't see myself planning some type of social event with people I haven't met before. And yes, that is my fault and I am aware of this. *You're complaining about not being social but wouldn't wanna get those together from your program?* Yes I am, and from me to me: *tough shit*. \n\nI am not depressed. I have a great life. My boyfriend is the best, I am in a fantastic program while getting paid to do it. It's just that I've started to feel like a wind-up toy where I wake up in my apartment, do work on my computer all day, and repeat. As if being inside, doing work feels like my purpose for that day. I am starting to wonder if all of grad school is like this. I am even starting to wonder if I made the right decision.\n\n**So, after all that, to the experienced grad students of this subreddit,** ***does it get better?***  \n\nI assume (and hope) that it does. Because if it doesn't, I am not sure how much longer I would be able to handle it. This is the closest I've ever felt to misery in my short 23 years on earth. Some days I actually accept feeling miserable, though I really try to keep a positive mindset. **I cannot continue through the rest of my program feeling like this.**\n\nAnd to other students who feel the same way as me, you are not alone. And neither am I. Feel free to comment if you are in a similar situation, for that already helps me a little bit. <3 \n\nGood luck to everyone else who has an online semester. We can do this! \n\nNow, time to get back to reading *Don Quijote*...",

      "text": "We're all feeling pressure like this; it's not just grad school. I haven't been in to my office or lab since March. I haven't seen coworkers since March. I haven't been able to travel for work since February (I'd had at least 4 trips including a conference in Barcelona that had to get cancelled, arghhhhhhhhhh). Most of my coworkers aren't even getting on Slack/Jabber/etc anymore because we're old and they're not as good at technology as younger people. Hardly anyone turns on their webcams at meetings anymore. Heck, my wife isn't even willing to eat food from a restaurant. I'm dying for a real piece of pizza, bowl of Pho, or some freaking schwarma.\n\nTimes are brutal right now, but we have to recognize this is the best choice of what we can do right now. Chilling at home with my cats is better than my wife's job, where she's required to report in to her office every day, only to sit on WebEx calls all day because everyone else is still at home.\n\nIf your school offers any sort of psychological counseling or support groups, definitely use it. Grad school, on its own, is really hard, and right now I'm sure it's even worse. I just wanted to let you know things aren't really any better in the \"real world.\"",

Of course not, and I know plenty of people who aren\u2019t willing to go out rn. However, it does help. I see faces, I have conversations, and I get more interaction with peers than I would through group chats/texting.\n\nFor class and work you can still get dressed in something you\u2019d wear if things were normal. It actually helps a lot more than you think it would. It\u2019s small, but it puts me in a work mindset I don\u2019t really get in when I\u2019m in pjs. The workload likely won\u2019t really change much. While I\u2019m doing the same amount of work as last year, I\u2019m more efficient at getting though it so it doesn\u2019t take as long. It\u2019s a lot to deal with, and it\u2019s definitely hard to find a balance especially during the first semester.",

Also, not sure about you, but I\u2019m in a city where bars/restaurants are still closed (Canada :( )so there\u2019s not even somewhere you could casually get together with people (I mean maybe people are hanging out, but obviously I know no one so I\u2019m not invited lol). It sucks cause everyone told me the department I\u2019m in is pretty close, and in normal times they have events every Friday at the grad pub. Honestly I\u2019ve lost hope and accepted that I\u2019m a hermit now, my university has already announced that online continues in the winter.

You might start by emailing the class list \"Would anyone be interested in starting a study group and doing the homework together?\" or reach out to your friends in your major and see if they'd like to do homework/studying together, even just hang out virtually with [online pictionary](http://skribbl.io) or [secret hitler](http://secrethitler.io).\n\nYou can take some of your TAing online by offering your office hours in the form of zoom meetings, and dressing up for those.\n\nAnyway, not the norm, I would wait it out while trying to make friends during the pandemic so you're even better friends when you can actually hang out.

I am even starting to wonder if I made the right decision.\n\nFeeling lonely is fairly normal in academia, especially in humanities subjects as our research is quite individual, so even in a room full of people you can easily be the only person working on your subject (I'm in a niche within a niche so I certainly know how that goes). Besides we often move to brand new cities at ages in life when people don't usually make new friends. COVID has made things worse. I'm feeling similar things to you OP, I moved to a new city for a new job in November, and life has become a fairly monotomous routine, largely because there isn't much else to do, until recently I couldn't even go to the gym!\n\nAs life returns to normal (and god hopefully it will sometime soon) things should improve, I'd also suggest trying to make friends outside of academia, perhaps try to make friends with other couples? Might be less scary to meet 'new people' if you're doing it with your boyfriend?",

I found my grad school experience to be very similar with what you describe the workload to be, and for me, I had to make sacrifices when I would get to the breaking point. The first thing to go was my studies - I stopped reading much at all...what I did was, I relied heavily on my knowledge of literary theory, and I've always been quick enough on my feet to connect the dots during in person class discussions to different theoretical lenses. So, I went a few years in grad school where I didn't learn much of anything new about literature. Instead, I learned about department procedures, academic networking skills, and I read student papers. \n\nWhen Covid became a prevalent issue and campus closed down in March, it seemed like my workload doubled. I knew that I had relied heavily on lectures for my teaching responsibilities, but I underestimated how much I had done so. I didn't know how to teach online, and I am still learning. I completed my comprehensive exam virtually. I've never been the most personable guy, and I didn't really have close friends, but when campus closed down in March, I lost any in-person contact that I had. I became very depressed. I think for the first few months I just escaped into art, and I completed my basic work/school obligations by force. \n\nSorry, I don't have an answer to your questions. I just felt like I experienced something similar to what you describe. The Covid thing is what is the problem factor here for you - as it is for many. We are living through something that is rare, and unique sacrifices are being made. I think what you describe is natural to the circumstances, and I can only hope those circumstances are short lived.

While you aren't going to have the exact same social life as in college, there should be plenty opportunities to meet people and get that face to face interaction once things go back to normal. \n\nThat said, you need to make a point of doing things that aren't work. What do you like doing? I know right after college (without a pandemic) I struggled a lot because I'd traded my hobbies for work and constant hang outs and hadn't figure out how to replace it yet. So I started painting, fun exercise classes, etc. You need to find an equivalent of that for you, something that feels like a fun activity and not \"I don't have a party to go to so I guess I'm watching tv again\". Every day can't just be get up, work, go to bed. \n\nHave you talked to your old friends on facetime? Or even facetimed/met up with the girls you already know from your program? It's not going to fully cure the desire for in person interaction but in my experience it helps a lot more than zoom class.",

One thing you mention caught my attention though. During my masters my university common room had a SAD lamp because we had many days without any sunshine. If you're up for a modest investment, being able to sit and close your eyes under the indoor \"sun\" for 15 mins can really make a huge difference, even if you're not clinically depressed. Best of luck with everything!!",

This is a very difficult time for us, it is almost the end of life as we know it, and it's normal to feel anxious about these things. I would suggest that you focus on yourself and just make yourself feel better, maybe put yourself on a routine? That usually helps me.",

I have a great job I love in neuroscience, and great friends, and hobbies I love too, but I also still have a problem with depression. I believe you are developing symptoms of depression.\n\nConsider reaching out to a therapist, because either they'll confirm or deny that idea. If yes, that's great because then you have a diagnosis and someone working with you to help make things better. If no, well, then maybe it is graduate school that's the problem. But right now you don't know. We academics must continue to seek answers and solve problems, it is our nature.",

Therapy isn\u2019t really that serious of a solution and even mentally healthy people would probably benefit from it. Therapists can help deal with general stress and anxiety even if it short term - you don\u2019t need to be clinically depressed to talk to someone. If you have access to it cheaply, I really really recommend it. Pandemic is a difficult time for everyone, and your work-heavy lifetime does sound really isolating. If anything, you\u2019ll at least have a chance to vent if you talk to a therapist, and that can be cathartic in itself.",
