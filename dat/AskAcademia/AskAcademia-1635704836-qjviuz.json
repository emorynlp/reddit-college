I often freeze up if asked a difficult question and I occasionally blank tbroigh nervousness too :(",

      "text": "Think of questions as an opportunity to show what you know. Generally, you can\u2019t fit everything you know into a single presentation, so questions give you a chance to show your knowledge. As well, as a previous commenter pointed out, people aren\u2019t usually trying to trip you up and may even be quite nervous about asking a question. \n\nGeneral good rules when answering questions: restate their question, briefly, just to make sure you are addressing what they want (people often ramble, so this gives them a chance to clarify); say some version of \u201cthat\u2019s an interesting question,\u201d or \u201cyou bring up a good point,\u201d etc.; then answer as concisely as you can. If someone asks you something you don\u2019t know, it\u2019s okay to say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not familiar with that, but it sounds interesting,\u201d or \u201cWhile I can\u2019t answer that specific point, it is related to this issue, which I can clarify.\u201d No one expects you to have all the answers, and people often ask off topic questions, so just focus on being generous to the questioner. Also: it\u2019s totally okay to scrawl quick notes when people ask you questions, to make sure you address them, and I often pause to take a sip of water when I need to think. Hope this all helps!",

      "text": "Try to approach it with a positive outlook and act like you enjoy it, so make it as fun for yourself as possible.\n\nAs for the questions, try to look past it as a criticism against you or your ability and either treat it as a challenge that you can meet (if you know the answer) or as useful feedback on what to look up at a later date or something to address in the lab (if you're on a STEM PhD). Most of the time, people asking you questions aren't trying to trip you up. They either don't understand, are interested or are trying to get you to think about something in a different way. Also, you're not expected to know everything so if you're really stuck just be honest and say so. \n\nLastly I'd say the person who cares most about what you're talking about is yourself. If you can stop putting pressure on yourself and treat it more casually, it'll really help!",

      "text": "Get practice responding to questions. You might ask a mentor, peer, or just a family member of friend to listen as you give a mock presentation, and maybe even ask you a few follow up questions.\n\nHopefully a lot of things will go right. There is a whole body of psychological research that shows that having done something successfully before can increase your confidence in doing that thing again in the future. So getting practice in a low-stakes setting is a good way to build confidence presenting for the future.\n\nIt's possible that maybe you do stumble over your words somewhere, or freeze up, or something else undesirable happens when you practice. That's OK! You can also identify areas for improvement when you practice and integrate them into your final presentation.",
