  "title:": "Advice on choice of qualitative research method (Physiotherapist and researcher)",
  "text": "Hey there!\n\nI am about to dive into some  qualitative research, where i will be listening in on calls, made to physiotherapists by patients and collect som data. I have earlier worked with the phenomenographic method, but I am having trouble finding a suitable method when it is more geared towards observing and listening in. \n\nThe method needs to be appropriate in a health care setting. Does anyone have any suggestions regarding methods I could look into? Just need references :) \n\nI am a physio and researcher myself, if that makes any difference to the suggestions you might have. \n\nThanks in advance",
