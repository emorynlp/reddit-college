Those are my role models.\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot of information out there. More than there was 100 or 200 years ago. Which means it takes longer to become an expert in a discipline than it once did.\n\nAre there still polymaths in the 21st-century?",

Einstein completed his PhD thesis in April. \n\nSo it's more than a little disingenuous to lean on the whole \"Einstein didn't have his PhD\". He was a PhD candidate, very near to completing his thesis. Given how long the revisions take on these things, he'd probably completed the majority of the work on it a few months prior. He wasn't just some undergrad dabbling in fields he didn't know. For all intents and purposes, he was basically *done* with the PhD. \n\nAnd really, PhD candidates have tended (historically) to publish on more \"risky\" topics. It's really the only time you can get away with looking into a \"stupid\" idea because it'll either be a smash hit (yay), or no one will notice and it won't harm your career (because they don't care by default). For every person who gets a smash hit during their PhD, there are countless others who get a flop. ",

That's proof the system works.

In those cases you can still prove yourself I think... it's just harder. \n\nThat's just my opinion though as someone with a 2 year general studies degree and nothing more.

      "text": "Polymaths are rare. Interdisciplinary scholars are not. In fact there are multi-disciplinary, inter-disciplinary, and trans-disciplinary degree programs all over the place.  Dual-degree programs are one point of concentration; \"studies\" programs are another. Consider environmental studies at the graduate level as an example:  it's typically built around a core of natural and social science courses/methods, with humanities elements (literature, ethics, history) sprinkled in. Or any area studies program: African studies, Asian studies, Latin American studies, etc. Or cultural studies, film studies, American studies and the like. All of these are at *least* multi-disciplinary (i.e. combining coursework and methods from multiple disciplines) and the better programs are truly *inter-disciplinary* (based on courses that internally integrate across disciplinary boundaries).  A good example is the [Energy Resources Group at Berkeley,](https://erg.berkeley.edu/) which was designed to be interdisciplinary from the ground up. Programs like these are intended to *create* interdisciplinary academics from whole cloth and in many cases they do just that. I've worked with graduates from them and a big chunk of my own graduate work comes from similar programs (at quick count I have graduate credits from over a dozen different disciplines).\n\nAre there still [Linus Paulings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling) out there? Or [Athelstan Spilhauses](http://www.seagrant.umn.edu/about/spilhaus)? Perhaps, but I'd wager they are even fewer in number than a generation or two ago due to the hyperspecialization of the academe and the way university structures and incentives have changed since the 1960s. True polymaths in the sense OP is suggesting are rare and there aren't often places to foster them in American academe any longer-- but plain old inter/multi/trans disciplinarians are all over the place now, more so than even 25 years ago when I was in grad school.",

But during Jane Doe's time, they might have been much more similar to each other or even classified together. For example, a lot of the Renaissance artists were also mathematicians since perspective painting was a leading edge math topic at the time. They often used their perspective drawings as part of engineering or city planning goals, so they were engineers by our modern definitions. If they also observed natural scenes in their art then they might get classified as scientists and philosophers today. Yet from their perspective they were doing something very continuous.\n\nYou can't predict how the fields will rearrange themselves in the future, and if what seems like a single discipline today, will look like a vaguely connected bundle of disciplines in a century.",

      "text": "I think it's not only realistic but interdisciplinarity nowadays is pretty much expected. In my discipline (epidemiology), it's pretty common for researchers to draw on anything from genetics, toxicology, pharmacology, psychiatry, cardiology, AI/computer science, to sociology, econometrics, urban planning, and even education. For myself, I've published in medical journals and also quite a few social science journals (close to a 50/50 split). \n\nThere are many top research grants out there that require interdisciplinarity. For example, I just submitted a grant that required the following:\n\n\n\n\"Interdisciplinarity\n\nThe NFRF\u00a0is intended to support meritorious projects that are not currently funded or could not easily be funded through existing agency-specific programs. Therefore, applications will need to clearly demonstrate that they are combining disciplines.\n\n\nHigh-risk\n\nApplications must demonstrate to which degree they are high risk. High risk is defined by elements such as:\n\ndefying current research paradigms;\n\nproposing unique scientific directions; and/or\n\nbringing new disciplines together with different perspectives to use novel approaches for solving existing problems.\n\nHigh-reward\n\nApplications must justify why the project should be considered high reward.\u00a0High reward is defined by elements such as:\n\nthe degree of impact and the size of the community affected;\n\nsignificantly advancing current knowledge, methods and/or technologies;\n\nresolving a longstanding scientific issue; and\n\ntransforming and/or disrupting conventional thinking\"\n\n",

It helps too to choose something that is inherently multidisciplinary and has applicability all over. For me that was cognitive science at first and then game design, which might be the most interdisciplinary area there is.",

I won\u2019t lie, I just wanted to go to grad school and I chose interdisciplinary because it seemed an easier vehicle to get a high gpa and had less intense requirements. I took a few \u201cmath for humanities\u201d classes that had no math at all, but required finding real life examples of the Fibonacci sequence or things like that.  I ended up really enjoying it.",
