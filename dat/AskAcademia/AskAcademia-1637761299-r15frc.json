  "title:": "How do university grades work in the US? Does GPA apply to university?",
  "text": "I have noticed that quite a substantial portion of university students in the US seemingly manage to graduate with a GPA of 4.0, which, in my understanding, translates to them having achieved the highest possible grade in all of their courses. \n\nWhere I am from, achieving a seemingly equivalent feat (highest possible grade in all courses, including thesis, doctoral viva, ...) translates to the President attending your graduation and personally congratulating you. Only about 0.04% of all students manage to achieve this.\n\nSo, my question is how does this make sense? Does this have something to do with the distinction of \"college\" and \"university\" in the US? Is this just a case of Grade inflation being much worse in the US than in Europe? Is it possible to \"fix\" your GPA if you have not achieved the highest possible grade in some exam?",

      "text": "It's been about 10 years since I sat on the admissions committee for a U.S. graduate program, so this may be out of date. There was a lot of heterogeneity across universities. Some universities used a 5.0 scale rather than a 4.0 scale (but students usually neglected to mention this - they just reported their GPA as a 3.9). I've seen others with a 4.5 scale. One university said that they used a 4 point scale, but if you looked at the transcript some classes would list individual class grades as 4.3. A few universities did have grade inflation - for one in particular I don't think I ever saw an applicant without a 4.0 (which was suspect since many of them had very low GRE scores). Even for universities that use a 4.0 scale, how they implemented that could be wildly different. Some universities used a letter grade system where those grades translated to points (an A would be a 4.0, a B would be a 3.0). Other universities gave individual class grades as grade points, where I often saw students with class grades such as 3.7, 3.4, etc. It was much more common to see a 4.0 student from a university that gives points based on letter grades (especially if an A+ is a 4.3 on a 4 point scale). It was very rare to see someone with a 4.0 from a university that gives individual class grades on a point scale (for those universities, a 3.8 would be a very good GPA).",

      "text": "There are \\~4,500 colleges and universities in the US so no answer is going to capture reality at even most of them. That said, grade inflation is a huge problem all over...as  professor for 25+ years now I've seen it happen at every school were I've taught. At the place I've been the last 20 even the grades in my own classes have risen from an average of about 80% (a B- on the American scale) to about 85% over 20 years. That's due in part, though, to evolving teaching practices-- we've adopted new/different pedagogies that include things like multiple drafts of papers, assignments that are scaffolded (done in stages) so the end result is better, more group work, fewer exams/quizzes, etc. Those practices alone are probably responsible for most of the inflation in my classes because even using the same rubrics the final work is now often better than it was 15-20 years ago.\n\nThe other reality, of course, is that with 4,500 schools there are vast differences in missions, the populations served, rigor, and expectations. It's absolutely true that there are some \"elite\" or highly-regarded schools where many programs are taught at an extremely high level of rigor and are so selective that only the best student get in at all...so the results are logically going to skew upward. There are also schools with open admissions policies (anyone can attend) that are pushed to produce degrees, making it very hard to fail. In between there's a massive range as well.\n\nBut the idea that even a majority of US students earn 4.0GPAs is pretty far off the mark. The data isn't easy to find but here's [one example showing the average creeping up to around 3.3](https://www.gradeinflation.com/), which is a solid B. At my own school, which is moderately selective, it's a bit higher than that but still well below 3.5.  Each year we graduate a tiny handful of 4.0 students, usually in the low single digits, and sometimes none at all.",

Part of this is because higher performing students get into better jobs, universities, med school or grad school, etc, so it's kinda unfair to damn someone for life because you want to grade harder than everyone else. \n\nThis is a problem, which makes standardized testing that much more important to separate the good from the great. Except standardized testing is also a load of crap. The best answer, really, is to adopt the European model for grading and just accept that a C = good grade. But that will never actually happen.",

The standard of work needed to simply pass is about the same, but there are vastly different meanings applied to the upper end of the grading scale. My experience was that a top grade (what we'd call an A in the US or a 'first' in the UK, for instance) in Europe is reserved for truly exceptional accomplishments. One instructor told me that to get a first on a research paper in their course, the paper would have to be publication-quality. Another told me they had only given a first to perhaps 10 students in their long career. Whereas in the US, showing up and learning the material decently well will get you an A. In my current position at a large US university, well-respected but not elite, I probably give out 20% of my grades in the A range, and about 40% in the B range, with the rest either withdrawing from the class or not turning in work and earning low or failing grades.",

The US model is also to view a C as a \"bad\" grade (not actually bad, but an average student paying attention to their studies is probably getting A's and B's, so not great either).\n\nIt is also possible to fix your grade at many universities: it's pretty common to see a policy of \"retake this class, and your new grade over-rides the old one\". Which I think is pretty fair: if you did poorly the first time around, but learned enough to do better the second time, you should be rewarded for that.\n\nBut as a final point, I'll just observe that the people getting 4.0's aren't slackers.

In the UK system where I did my undergrad these papers would have averaged 52 or something... it's absurd. In my experience it's a lot easier to get an A in the US than a first in the UK.",

      "text": "Most of it is that students who aren't doing well are not going to mention it. If they are doing really poorly, they probably drop out before graduated. It's tied to money too. A 2.0 is usually required for financial aid for undergrads and a 3.0 for grad. You're not \"supposed to\" put anything under a 3.5 on a resume even though they're really common.  \n\nPart of it is that US undergrad classes aren't based on end of the terms exams in the same way where an off day just destroys you. You might have 2-3 exams per class per semester as well as a project/essay and a final exam. So you can \"save\" a bad grade and chart your progress and where you need to focus more a little easier. \n\nPart of it is professors also get to set whatever grade they want to correspond to an A at a lot of universities. I need a 98% in one class because they grade deflated and a 90% in another, at the same university. \n\nFor grad, doctoral grades are even more meaningless and for the really important things like a doctoral thesis, you aren't even getting a grade.",
