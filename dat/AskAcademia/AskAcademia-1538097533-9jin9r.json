  "text": "With Dr. Ford\u2019s riveting testimony today (regardless of your political affiliation, no one can deny her courage to speak), it left me thinking: Why hasn\u2019t the \u2018#MeToo\u2019 movement caught on with the academic world? In my university there are tons of rumors of \u201cthat professor\u201d swirling and when we had an incident go public last year, admin did their hardest to sweep it under the rug and offered the faculty a retirement package- keeping status, benefits, pension - etc. Whats the deal?

Everyone knew about it (as he was arrested, it was in the paper, and I was told so later). I was well-known and respected on my large campus and within my college. No one spoke one word to me. No one checked on me. No one so much as batted an eye... all of this in a department founded on social justice scholarship. So, yeah, I\u2019m bitter. Activism is very different than philosophy. \n\nNote: This is my first time speaking about this and it feels really therapeutic. ",

      "text": "I hear rumors from other parts of academia, but it hasn't swept through the engineering end of campus for two reasons:\n\n1. We don't have enough women to harass. When you've got 10:1 gender ratios, it's not a particularly appealing field for sexual predators. Predators go where the prey is and that ain't engineering.\n\n2. Students are too empowered. Most of the difficulties with harassment come at the graduate/PhD level, where students are locked into a program and there are severe penalties for leaving/switching. In most engineering fields, this isn't the case. Not only can you get a high-paying job outside academia pretty easily, but you can also switch schools pretty easily due to the demand for the kinds of people who get admitted into graduate/PhD-level engineering programs.\n\nThis latter factor is perhaps the most important. #MeToo is only a significant factor in places where there is an extreme power imbalance between different levels. When you've got thousands of actresses looking for their big break and one Harvey Weinstein able to offer it, you're going to end up with a lot of chicanery. When you can say \"screw this\", walk away and go directly into an equivalent of better opportunity, your superiors need to treat people with respect or they're going to run out of the talented people they need to run their business.\n\nNote: This doesn't mean that women can't feel *uncomfortable* in these sorts of fields. However, there tends not to be a particularly big problem with predators - you're far more likely to hear women complaining about socially dysfunctional men that simply don't have much appreciation for how women like to be treated.",

Perhaps I misunderstood. \n\nSexual assault is a problem wherever it happens. It certainly occurs in academia, so yes it is indeed a problem in academia. If we\u2019re being more thoughtful about the issue though, like perhaps a group of administrators prioritizing limited resources for maximum interventional effectiveness, then there are some additional things we would probably want to think about. For instance, I think sexual assault is much likelier to be a problem within the student population, and would focus efforts on student-student relationships. Sexual assaults involving administrators or faculty as an involved party seem much less likely, and within this population I suspect one would prioritize combating sexual harassment and abuse of power dynamics over any sort of rape-prevention effort.\n\nSo in short, I very much doubt that the rates of sexual assaults are very different in academia than in comparable age-matched cohorts, after accounting for the effect of close-quarters domiciling and some level of reporting bias (higher reporting in universities due to availability of non-police reporting resources, etc). But as I stated, any assault indicates a problem that needs addressed, so it certainly seems incumbent upon universities to be proactive in this regard, especially given the risks inherent to having co-ed dormitories. Of course, when I think of academia, I\u2019m thinking more of inter-faculty and faculty-student relationships. In this case, I very much expect sexual assaults to be less common than the population average, but could see sexual harassment and other untoward behaviors being equally common as in similar workplace scenarios and meriting addressment in similar ways.",
