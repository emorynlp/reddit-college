  "title:": "Be honest, search committee: Do y'all just throw out applications from non-US citizens?",
  "text": "I'm nearing the end of my humanities PhD and applied for a few jobs that I felt really suited me and I would be competitive for even in this terrible job market. But they always ask right at the beginning if I need to be sponsored for work authorization. I've heard that this is a great legal way to just throw out my application and not even bother to look at it because the institution doesn't want to have to deal with and pay for sponsorship for me.\n\nAm I just wasting my time applying for jobs?\n\nThe even more depressing thing is that I recently came across a really great job posting. It was the first job I felt like I might actually be slightly happy at (I don't actually want to work)? But they say outright they won't sponsor me. So many just flat refuse to allow me to apply.\n\nI feel like I was blinded to 2 things that I'm just now realizing: 1) obviously I have known for a while the job market sucks and am trying to look into other non-academic jobs, but 2) even if I do it seems like most do not want me because I'm foreign. I had no idea how hard it was to get a job as an immigrant.\n\nThe final thing that sucks is I'll never truly know if my application just sucked or if it was a strong one but it would be too difficult or costly to sponsor me. And it's just so funny to me that I apply for these jobs that say they really encourage diversity and inclusion and underrepresented groups (and my favorite, \"decolonizing education,\") and yet will not hire a foreigner!\n\nEdit: I should clarify I'm not saying anything against the search committees or departments themselves and when I found out I was not qualified for a job based on my visa status I was told it's something to do with HR. Thus I don't mean to say it's the hiring committees doing this or discriminating in any way. I only found that this was apparently \"common enough practice\" when looking up the specific wording of my apps to understand how I should answer the various questions related to work authorization. I was a bit unclear on how I needed to answer these questions and found a lot of people saying that if you answer that you do need sponsorship that is basically invitation for the company to throw out your application legally so they don't have to bother doing the work to hire you. I've also heard many contradictory and flat out wrong things from my own institution's international student office so I never know my rights or how I'm supposed to approach anything visa-wise going forward. I'm glad to hear if it isn't going to necessarily interfere with my competitiveness. ",

      "text": "I feel like you've presented two different scenarios here. The first where the school asks your current immigration status. The second where the school outright states they won't sponsor people. In the first situation there's no reason to assume they will just throw your application out, especially as they could just do the second situation and avoid having to deal with multiple applications they don't want in the first place. In the second situation, they've made the situation clear so yes they will just throw your application out. \n\nSome people get an idea that there are secret rules to recruitment and that there's code phrases and God knows what else. It's really not that complex. People put out an advert that describes what they want (as best they understand it - this isn't always easy) and then candidates need to describe how they are what's described. Although faculty recruitment is a bit more complicated it's still basically true. No one wants to spend time wading through applications they don't want.",

There is so much that could have been going wrong with that commenter's applications. We *do not* know why no one wanted to interview them. Maybe they write without paragraph breaks, or use over-the-top vocab in academic writing, or one of their letters of rec claims they're a terrible worker.\n\nWe know this person submitted apps for years and never got called, but there are lots of potential explanations for that.\n\nThe commenter's lived experience is totally valid, but they don't have enough info (or haven't provided enough info here) to say if discrimination is why they never got interviews.
