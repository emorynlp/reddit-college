  "text": "Hi everyone! Happy quarantine!!\n\nI have a question about math. I've noticed that lots of mathematicians are talented. They were brilliant as a kid.\n\nThat's not what I want to do, though. I want to do a PhD in Economics with a focus on international trade.\n\nThe thing is, I've never been good at math before. This is why I've decided to give it another go, to see if I can make it. I'm looking for online math courses right now.\n\nWhat I want to know is, if the math is for Economics, not Mathematics, then can I overcome it by working hard? Do you need talent to be good at Economics math?\n\nThank you so much! I would love to hear your experiences! I hope you all have a great day!:D",

          "text": ">Outside of disability (e.g. dyscalculia), I don't believe you can be \"bad at maths\" as a kid. It's a problem of teaching, where someone who probably hated maths in school is standing in front of 30+ different children, trying to force them to learn at the same pace. People inevitably fall through the cracks.\n\nCompletely agree with this statement. For almost all people, hating or \"being bad at\" math isn't something you're born with, it's something you're taught.\n\nI am always absolutely **floored** by the readiness with which college-educated adults will volunteer statements like \"I'm just someone who's bad at math\" or \"I don't have a head for figures, I could never learn to do that kind of math\".  Can you imagine **any** adult in any situation making a statement like \"I've never been able to read\" or \"I'm just one of those people who's illiterate, I could never learn to read those books\"? Of course you can't-- because in the developed world, reading is considered so fundamental to life that it would be shameful to admit to being illiterate. In educated circles it's well understood that you're supposed to at least pretend to enjoy reading. Yet adults readily volunteer their dislike or inability to do math as if it's normal or expected.\n\nAt its most basic, math is a language and understanding it is like being able to read-- being able to do math unlocks an entire world of scientific subjects, much like being able to read unlocks many different domains in the humanities, literature, history, and so on. \n\nSadly, we've trained generations of schoolkids that math is a series of steps that you memorize to get to the correct answer on an algebra test. Can you imagine if the only thing you ever used reading for in school was to answer the analogy questions on the SAT, and you never got to read a great work of literature? You might hate reading too in that situation...",

Those beliefs were instilled into me due to cultural conditioning too.\n\n Few years ago I started teaching myself math and I was surprised how fast I picked it up. I'm now doing my PhD and have recently gotten into bioinformatics and I love it. I realize now I just had horrible teachers who had no experience in dealing with kids who had a different way of learning. Our school system relies heavily on memorizing and not on logical/critical thinking. I'm not someone who is good at memorizing so naturally I had a tough time. Now that I'm teaching myself I realize, I just needed to understand the concept and not parrot it. So yes maths is something you can totally learn and be good at it because it's highly logical. Logical thinking is a skill that needs constant practice.",

On the other, there is a lot of math economists need to know, both to be admitted to grad school and to advance to candidacy, and for some people there aren't enough hours in the day to hard-work their way through it. I don't know if this is due to \"talent\" (whatever that is), or because they had a poor mathematical education in K-12 or whatever else. \n\nThere's not really such a thing as \"economics math\" - it's the same math as, god forgive me, \"math math\". It's why it's so advantageous to get a math undergrad to do econ in grad school (albeit not at all required). I know that in some countries, econ undergrads do \"calculus for economists\" or whatever which is a watered-down version, but in the US at least, to do econ, you need to know pure math.",

It wasn't until tenth grade that I moved to a better area with a WAY better school system. Before the move I was a class clown and did awful in my classes. D's and F's. \n\nBut after, I didn't have any friends in this new place, so I figured \"what the hell, may as well actually do my work for a change\". Turns out I was pretty good. Soon I was turned on to chemistry and physics and decided that is what I would go for at college. \n\nIt took another year and a half for me to realize I loved math above any other subject. So about halfway through my undergrad I switched. Keep in mind there are brilliant people out there who have known since high school that they wanted to do math, so I was pretty late in the game to be starting. \n\nBUT if you love it enough and are willing to put in the work (definitely bust your ass, it's 100% worth it) you can absolutely become \"good\" at math and over come any difficulties. Case in point, I did terribly at real analysis my first go around, but no way in hell was I just going to accept being substandard. After A LOT of effort, analysis is actually my best subject (and favorite). \n\nDecided to never stop giving that much effort. Went on to finish a master's at the same institution before leaving. Now I'm beginning my PhD and definitely feel ready. \n\ntl;dr yes you can definitely become good at math with effort. I did it, so can you. Just don't give up trying.",

I will use a football example too.\n\nYes, Math to the level of doing a PhD in Math and revolutionizing the field, and making brilliant contributions to the world, is something you're born with. A great example of this is  Srinivasa Ramanujan. So yes, there are people who are born with a special talent for math, as there are people who are born with special talent to sing, just like Maradona and Messi were born to play football with an incredible talent\n\nNevertheless, I think that the math level required to do a PhD in Economics is something that you can learn, and if you invest 2000 hours or so to learn the math, you will achieve any goal related to it. You don't need to be born a genius to get a PhD, and you can work your way to it, be sure about that. As long as you don't aspire to be John Nash or something like that, you can work hard and with dedication until you make it. That's what Cristiano Ronaldo did, and see where he is now.",

In general, studying for the math section produces a better return for the population at large because of inadequate preparation and lack of self-efficacy in quantitative skills. \n\nOthers argue that these tests provide opportunity for minorities. Without test scores, applications are heavy influenced by interviews and connections- two things that whites with money have an overwhelming advantage in. What we need is to level the playing field by making sure that a quality education is provided to everyone, regardless of class, and to make the tests cheaper.  The test just reflects societal divides.  Those divides will still be there if you remove the test.",

                              "text": "So, that's a well known and somewhat controversial study.  One problem with evaluating the predictive validity of the GRE based on graduation rates is restriction of range.  Because only those with higher scores are admitted to graduate school, the range of GRE scores in that sample is greatly restricted over the population.  As you likely know, regression under restriction of range will produce an attenuated correlation when compared to the total population.   If you were to admit more broadly, using lower or no GRE cutoff scores, you likely would see a significant correlation. \n\nIn general, you should cite and read the study rather than the pop science article based on it. The article is not an unbiased view of the research.\n\nAlso, it's not \"experimental evidence\".  It's a correlational/observational study.  An experiment is a specific method for testing hypothesis that provides for a greater ability to infer causality.  Correlational studies simply identify relationships that may be important to explore and understand.  You may not have meant it that way, but that's the jargon, and you should use it correctly.  \n\nHere's a counter perspective that you may find useful...

      "text": "I\u2019ve long been interested in the concept of multiple intelligences, while I am also aware that it has its critics and there are hazards that go along with essentializing the idea too much into hardened inborn traits. There is a book that I read long ago called _Seven Kinds of Smart_ that sums it up quite nicely as word smart, number smart, picture smart, body smart, music smart, social smart, and self smart.\n\nA simple example: My ex-husband can add up long strings of numbers in his head. (I can\u2019t. I need pencil and paper). I on the other hand can remember word-stuff, like names, addresses, and very conveniently, academic citations. We called him The Calculator and I was The Rolodex. Good team, haha. He\u2019s more number smart, I\u2019m more word smart, in other words, as compared to the other. This is not even a function of schooling, because I had more years of (equally good) schooling in math than he did.\n\nMore and more learning in math, as many have pointed out, means ability to think on increasingly higher planes of abstraction.\n\nArithmetic is concrete. Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry each require leaps to abstract levels of thinking. Assuming all other things being equal (a huge assumption, that), some kids make the leap quite easily, and some don\u2019t. This difference represents (inborn?, not sure) _talent,_ a.k.a. math smart, in my view. (Inborn _brilliance_ or _genius,_ I am not sure how to define, but most people know it when they see it.) Those kids that don\u2019t make the leap easily, there could be one of at least two reasons that I can think of: a learning disability, or they are simply not number smart (whereas they could certainly be word smart or picture smart or any cluster of the other ones instead). Can those kids make the leap? I think most of them can, even if it\u2019s not easily. They can be taught. And most can get better with practice.\n\nThen we have the leaps to higher and higher levels of abstraction with Calculus, Differential Equations, and goodness knows what comes after, where the abstractions start to do weird things like bend at varying rates and convolute and get turned inside out. This is where a lot more get lost (including me) if they find it too difficult to make the leap. And again, some people make the leap quite easily. They are math smart. Others don\u2019t. Their intelligences lie in other kinds of smart. Most of them, probably, can be taught, and can get very good at it indeed, with hard work and practice.\n\n\u201cMath smart\u201d exists. So does \u201cgenius.\u201d No doubt about it. Whether it comes from inborn hard wiring or sociocultural conditioning is of course a difficult matter to settle. Whether math skills can be taught and practiced and developed, for the most part is yes. I think the key differences lie in whether a person finds it easy or hard \u2014 whether they are math smart or not (or not so much, or to a certain point). I personally found math easy, but for only as long as I could make pictures of it in my head (read: I am much more picture smart than math smart).\n\nTL;DR - \u201cMath smart\u201d is one of several key thinking styles in the schema of \u201cmultiple intelligences,\u201d with some people being a lot more (easily) able to think on abstract planes than others. For  maybe most others, it can be learned and developed, but with effort.",

      "text": "Math skills are definitely not something you're born with!! (I am very passionate about this.) In middle school and high school, math was something I did not understand and I just *got by* due to having peers in my class who knew what they were doing. Struggled *heavily* to get low A's and Bs (not terrible, but I'm a perfectionist lol). It was definitely my least favorite subject, but I want to be a doctor so I needed to get through calculus. I took my first college algebra class and while it kicked my ass, I learned so much and started to actually love math. I was understanding it rather than just getting by, and I realized that all of the subjects I enjoyed were revolving around math! I kept taking college math for 6 more quarters and I finished the entire calculus series with a 4.0 in every college math class I took including calc (not to brag, just trying to prove that you can *become* good at math.) Now I'm actually thinking of doing a minor or double major in math. \n\nI think a lot of it is just developing the problem solving skills you need to be successful in math classes, because they are unlike the skills you need in humanities, or even science classes. It is about going through the specific steps to solve a problem, which is very much a learned skill. I hope you will learn from me that you can be good at math without being born that way. Best of luck, and I hope you will consider to further your math skills!",

That means getting into study groups, working with a tutor, talking to your professors, etc. You may have not been afforded a good math teacher up to this point! So maybe it's not you; it's them! Also, look at textbooks and online resources outside of the texts you're directed to use for class. It's why we have thousands of books on the same topic. Some do a better job of explaining things than others. Took me a long time to realize that, but it was a serious eureka moment. Good luck!",

Simply because if you\u2019re naturally inclined toward something you\u2019ll probably enjoy doing it a little more and actually practicing it, but it really is like 90% practice. I sat down with a GRE book and khan academy and basically retaught myself everything from basic algebra to calculus. Not too bad either just takes a lot of time and determination. And paper. Lots of paper",

You could start at second grade in Khan Academy and build your math skills (back) up from fundamentals, and you can probably blast through the first bits really quick. I'm using the Khan Mastery approach to figure out where my strengths and weaknesses are for each grade level, then doing unit tests for each grade unit until I hit Mastery - and if I struggle with a topic, then I'm watching and re-learning using the Khan videos. \n\nI blasted through second grade in about an hour. Same with third grade (although, somewhat embarrassingly, I struggled with a few of the strategies and learned something new!).\n\nIf I were preparing for econ grad work, I'd do this.",

Doing calculus and linear algebra by age 11.  They instantly understand every topic.  They did not train this ability, they were born with it.\n\nBut I have students of varying different ability levels all improve.
