      "text": "It could depends on the field, but usually they don't ask questions directly, in the application you must include a certain number of letters of recommendation, where your previous employers/supervisor/etc... will  write about their experience in working with you.\n\nIf your future employer has some personal contact with your old ones, they could ask them about you, but I think, in general, this is not something that happens very often (take into account that there could be a lot of candidates for a postdoc position, it would be incredibly time-consuming to reach out personally to each one of their previous employers).",

          "text": "Agree with this and would add that at some organisations it would be considered very inappropriate to contact the previous boss outside of gathering references. There's always a grey area where supervisors know each other, but cold calling a previous boss is pretty unusual and not something I'd particularly support where I am.",
