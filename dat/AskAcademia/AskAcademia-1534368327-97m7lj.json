Macroscopic properties like density, solubility, reaction rate - averages of a huge number of individual elementary reactions - are easy to measure and the most important in practice. For microscopic phenomena, there are many good tools. Even ab initio quantum theory is becoming useful. But for mesoscale, like quaternary and ternary structure and polymer interactions, we're stuck with macroscopic properties, which are unenlightening, and computational molecular dynamics, which is often inaccurate and largely useless.",

On the other hand, it\u2019s an exciting time to be in children\u2019s lit research though, because so little has been done! \n\nAs for quantifiability\u2014we look for the power/agency status of child characters in texts. A typical pattern is the home-away-home, or carnivalesque pattern, in which children temporarily gain the power/agency typically reserved for adults but by the end of the book have returned to the agency level of childhood. Harry Potter is a good example\u2014Harry gains enough agency at Hogwarts to defeat Voldemort multiple times but must always return to the Dursleys\u2019 at the end of each book. The seventh book breaks this pattern, but importantly, it ends depicting Harry and the others as full-blown adults with children of their own. ",

He makes excellent points.\n\nI come at this from a legal point of view (particularly from an EU/UK angle), so what I'm really interested in is what do people need to know about a particular decision to be able to exercise their legal rights, and what do legal reviewers (lawyers, judges, expert witnesses, etc.) need to know about that decision to be able to review it? Looking at it from that angle, I generally feel that the concept of \"explainability\" often misses the point, and often goes in search of something that doesn't actually get to the heart of what people need to know or to have to review machine learning systems. I've written about this, but for obvious reasons I'm not going to post a paper with my name and institution on the front of it to Reddit. So I'll try to summarise a bit. \n\nWhat happens if you look to what a legal reviewer of an ML system might need to know about that system and the decisions it's making if they want to review it? Well, they're going to want to ask some legal and organisational questions first  - what was the legal basis for making the decision (if any was required), was an automated system really necessary for making the decision or could it have been made otherwise. They might need to know about the training data - was it accurate, was it evaluated for biases, etc. They'll need to know about how the system was tested and evaluated once it was trained, and what standards it was held to. They'll certainly need to know what data was fed to the system to make the decision in question - whether it was accurate, whether it was relevant, that kind of thing. They'll also probably need to know what kind of inferences or predictions the system made in making its decision - whether they were accurate or relevant, etc. They'll definitely need to know the actual output of the system. They'll want to know about any human review of that output (if there was any). And they'll probably need to have aggregate level information on the system's other decisions so as they can evaluate them for discrimination on protected characteristics.\n\nDoes a legal reviewer really need the machine learning system itself to be truly explainable in order to be able to review it? No, not really. But what they do need are tools or mechanisms for looking into and evaluating the things that I described above.\n\nedit: typo",

Who is European? Where do migrants/immigrants fit in?\" France -- Paris in particular -- has always had a very intense romanticism (some might say hypersexualization) attached to its identity, and that has been \"challenged\" since the beginning of the century. France doesn't census for race or include race in it's constitution, which has also been contested and questioned in recent years. I've had tons of discussions with colleagues over the Trevor Noah scandal. In recent weeks, it's been incredibly interesting to track the effects of the World Cup win, and how that affects France's treatment of its immigrants.\n\nInterestingly enough, although it aligns with Urban Studies, *Banlieue* translates to \"suburb.\" The colloquial nature of the word itself is interesting in French linguistics/semiotics.\n\nETA: Here's a cool New Yorker article that's been going around in these circles that highlight some of these issues. Also, the film *Les Bleues* on Netflix centers around this discourse and is a great watch!\n\n[https://www.newyorker.com/sporting-scene/replay/world-cup-2018-the-black-and-white-and-brown-faces-of-les-bleus](https://www.newyorker.com/sporting-scene/replay/world-cup-2018-the-black-and-white-and-brown-faces-of-les-bleus)",

This is especially noticeable at conferences, where papers involving deep learning have dominated the proceedings and garner the biggest audiences. Often, deep learning and linguistics are depicted as two opposing forces, with the former using a \"black box\" approach to generating/understanding language and the latter caring deeply about the how, why, and what. However, there's also been a lot of talks and papers on reconciling the two, and using linguistics to build more informative or stronger deep learning models. \n\nFor example, [this paper](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/COLI_a_00239) is a good example of the ongoing conversations in the field, though it is from 2015.

More generally, the design of robots or robotic components made out of squishy and/or bendy materials, often inspired by the natural world.  Some advantages include cost, maneuverability, resilience (some can be run over by a truck), sensitivity (try programming a hard robot to carefully pick up an egg), and human psychological comfort.\n\n(Like most things, the idea becomes much more apparent in [gif format.](https://giphy.com/explore/soft-robotics))",
