  "title:": "Any advice for preparing for being PI as PhD student?",
  "text": "Hi all, I'm starting my 3rd year of PhD in biomedical sciences in fall. Would you please advise how to prepare for a PI or similar job in the future at this stage?\n\nTime flies. The average graduate duration in our program is about 4.5-4.8 years. My comps will be soon in February. I felt like there is still a huge gap between me and other PIs, for example,  my advisor. Was in pretty much technician mindset, my advisor sort of told me to elevate the thoughts into a higher level, such as mechanism, how a paper/ talk relates to my experiment,... . Training in progress. Maybe it's just my little faith, but I think there are still a lot to prepare for independent scientist in the future. Not quite sure exactly though. Eager to know before it is too late. Would be great if anyone could suggest what to prepare/ prioritize and how at this stage. Thanks a lot!",

      "text": "You may not wish to stress about it that much at this stage. It\u2019s rare to jump from PhD to PI in a wet lab, in biomedical sciences, without a postdoc in between.\n\nInstead, you may wish to focus on mastering your niche, techniques, and area of science. Build into how your work fits into the broader field. What\u2019s already been done, how is yours unique, what could be done next? \n\nIt\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint. The learning/updating never really ends",

Also, it is not only rare to just from PhD to PI without a postdoc inbetween, it is also very rate to jump from PhD to PI at all. The vast majority of PhDs who want academic careers never get that chance.",

      "text": "Unfortunately, unless you are very lucky, have excellent connections or are a child prodigy, it is extremely rare to go from PhD directly into a PI role. You will likely have to go through one or more postdocs to get to a lecturer or research position. And these depend on your success with writing grants and building a network of people with influence within your field of research. \nI would start there. Learn how to present your work and your ideas in a way that attract funding and/or the interest of other researchers to work with you. This is by no means an easy skill to master but it will be important throughout your academic career. Your uni might offer workshops on grant writing, if not, ask senior researchers for advice and if possible give them draft grant applications of yours to read and comment on.",

One thing wet lab PhDs need to learn is that there are more than one way to do something, and often which method you use does not matter.\n\nApart from that, you need to read.  Not only in your own area, but as widely as you can.  Read retraction watch to learn how things can go wrong.  Scan PubPeer to see how problems originate (and how much awful science there is out there).  Read on issue such as authorship, ethics, how to write papers and grants, what is a mentor.  \n\nWhat I have found working with many new PIs is that it is the peripheral matters that tend to trip them up.",

To get there, you have to master two transitions, from doctoral student to postdoc, and then to the PI stage. Both are tricky, and perhaps it's useful to know what's coming - but I wouldn't worry about this yet...\n\nFrom doctoral student to postdoc: [https://youtu.be/4o-O7\\_3abRg](https://youtu.be/4o-O7_3abRg) \n\nFrom postdoc to PI: [https://youtu.be/rK5stD0HieM](https://youtu.be/rK5stD0HieM)",
