  "text": "I am trying to retake the second half of anatomy and physiology for a better grade at my local community college. I graduated from CU with a bachelors in integrative physiology so obviously my studies were centered around A&P. The head of the bio department at the cc asked for my syllabus on just the lab and said that their course \u201cspends more than just a few days\u201d on the CNS so therefore I have to retake the whole A&P 2-semester course instead of just the latter half. I asked if I could schedule a meeting to discuss this and I was told that the answer was final. How does this make sense and why is it okay? What do I do from here? Ugh.",

      "text": "I had something similar.  The school just thought some of the classes in my area weren't comparable with theirs.  After a very little arguing, I took the classes.  There was new content, and I did well.  If the Dean agrees with the professor, be gracious about it and do great in the class.  Don't complain.",
