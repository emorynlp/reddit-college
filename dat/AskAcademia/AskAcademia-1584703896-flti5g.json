  "text": "Hello, I am a PhD student at the end of its second year. As many PhD students I believe that many have student scholarships over a limited number of years, in my case three in total. My concerns are about how this pandemy will affect us PhD students, but more in general the academic environment. Of course, in such period is possible to focus on writing and reading, however, for a successfull thesis the quality and the presence of good results are fundamental.",

I have had a relatively easy transition as I was simultaneously teaching the same course both face-to-face and online (and so was able to mostly move online content over without much adaptation). I have no kids and my wife and I already both worked from home a lot and don't have kids. Other than postponing some data collection, I have been very productive because it helps keep my mind off all the anxiety and a sense of normalcy. I feel very lucky but also somewhat guilty because I know how much others are struggling.\n\nI still worry about how this will affect my peers. My university has basically said \"We will tell committees and external evaluators to keep this in mind during tenure evaluations\" and \"clock extensions can be requested\" but I think given our very fuzzy tenure guidelines it will not be given equal consideration for everyone. I am in a cohort of about nine junior faculty and comparisons will be inevitable.",

              "text": "It seems unlikely that everything will just quickly go back to normality. \n\nThe peak of the virus could last for several months, enforcing effectively economic shutdown and vastly decreased consumption and productivity.\n\nTo deal with lay-offs, poor sick-pay, and bills and rents many people will clear out savings or even go bankrupt. Many firms will likely shut doors and be unable to reopen or will significantly downsize. The bottom will drop out of the housing market as people will be unable to buy. The younger people in society were already struggling with house prices and this will only make them poorer.\n\n\nThis is essentially a deep recession that is being enforced by nature and may trigger other effects within economies that kick the bottom out of our financial systems.\n\nI think we might be observing events that reshape societies to a relatively significant extent. Priorities will change if this is not over quickly.\n\nLook at America:\n\n>The Dow Jones industrial average suffered a nearly 3,000 point decline Monday, the worst point decline in history. And there are now forecasts that the US economy could lose as many as 1 million jobs in April alone, which would be worse than the steepest job loss during any month of the Great Recession 10 years ago.\n\nI don't think academia will be spared from the impacts of this change.",

Then after the crash, there were way less job openings and positions just weren\u2019t filled when people retired from them (plus more people going back to grad school, so more people out on the job market in the years after but less jobs). My discipline & many others in the social sciences (and liberal arts) never recovered to pre-2008 levels as far as full-time academic jobs (let alone TT jobs) and funding.

If things unfold as they are, the economy hit will be far worse than 2008. We'll still be dealing with the public health crisis at the start of the new job cycle. If you can stay another year in whatever position you are in, prepare to do that. Even if that means remaining as a student.\n\nMy institution is far from destitute, but the second the economic future looks shaky, they'll freeze hiring.\n\nAs others have noted, however, academia's problems will be short lived.",

I just want to finish these three papers so I can finish this year. But, now my partner and I are both working from home with 2 kids home full time. Our place is small - under 1200 square feet. I ordered a sit/stand desk that is super compact that we will put in my son's room since his room is the only one with the floor space for that sort of thing. I'm also still teaching full time, which is now online. In short, this is a total shit show. My old life is gone and now I have this one. I'm here in it, this new situation, and will try to make the best of it. As for the studies, I will need a ton of leniency, which is \\*super\\* annoying because I had everything done early and I really don't like being late. At least my son seems to be getting better.

They make up like 3% of the overall population, but +95% of the population in the westernmost province of the country, Bayan Ulgii. They've been in that region for approximately 100-150 years, meaning that they arrived before or just as the Russians came along and invented Kazakhstan and other Central Asian countries. Fast forward to today: Kazakhstan exists now and is trying to entice Mongolian Kazakhs to \"come back\". Meanwhile, Mongolia is benevolently indifferent to the Kazakh presence.\n\nSo I'm interested in how, in that geopolitical context, Mongolian Kazakh people relate to the landscape (partially steppe, partially alpine) of western Mongolia. I'm looking at how they move through landscape (horseback), how they write songs about their various homelands, and how they talk about their place to tourists in order to make a living.",

Budgets are planned for the fiscal year, and the money is in-hand. In the business world, weeks of no business can exhaust companies' stocks of cash to pay their employees.\n\nEven long-term disaster is unlikely when, at the federal level, we are in a profligate mood (Republicans apparently know that Keynesian econ works, and are only happy to torpedo the economy when the democrats are in charge). Continuity in federal spending means that few research programs get cut, likely. All of this when much of the private sector literally cannot pay their employees.\n\nIf students simply stopped taking classes and paying tuition this might have an impact, but the complete cessation of higher education seems unlikely.\n\nUncertainty has increased, yes, and there will be bad effects within academia. But in much the private sector, many will lose their jobs, and *quickly*. *Companies will cease to exist.* Doctors and nurses will *get ill and die*. Even the less-secure among us are in a haven, because we are not front line responders, and our money pipe, for all its flaws, is relatively stable.\n\nReally take time to consider your position relative to those outside your situation, and I think you should feel lucky.",
