I felt the interview went well and informal feedback I received was very positive. I think the barrier was that 1-this group needs people who can carry a teaching load that my grant won\u2019t permit, and 2-the people they ultimately hired had more close research topic alignment. There are a few other relevant details that I won\u2019t describe here to keep parties involved confidential. I was always advised that getting this grant would open doors so I was honestly shocked at the decision. I am pretty salty about the situation but trying to remain professional and pivot towards the future. Advice and insights welcome.",

It was a quick conversation and I left and cried and realized that despite the fact that my goal had been to work there (it's also my alma mater and I love the culture there), that I needed to stop jumping through hoops for these people and doing free labor to prove that I would do a great job if they made me TT. \n\nI also realized that there wasn't really anything I could do about it. Even if it's pretty unethical, it's also hard to prove. The only thing that was going to happen if I tried to do something about it was that I would lose the only job I have - scary prospect as a single Mom - and I was going to piss off my best recommendations. (I sort of regret this because people get away with this type of thing because people like me feel helpless. I wouldn't have gotten anywhere but some part of me wishes I had been more of a badass ad didn't care if I burned bridges).I wasn't elated to have to kiss their ass a little bit longer for their recommendations but that semester, I branched out and started teaching at a local community college as well to start building relationships there. I'm pretty happy with this choice. They are pretty pumped to have another PhD teaching for them because it's a small town and they don't have a lot. It's nice to be valued. The first time someone asked my opinion on something, I was so confused. \n\nI still teach a few classes for them and they still sort of suck but $$ is $$. That Chair got promoted to an Assistant Dean position (because of course she did) so I only had to work directly with her for another year. Have been building some great relationships at the new school and am hopeful I can find something full time there eventually (looking at student affairs or academic success type things) even if its not a TT position (although I wouldn't say no to that either but nothing has opened up yet). Bummer to be that close to a TT position at a school I love and have it ripped out from underneath me for such a bullshit reason... but on the bright side, I would have had a bitch for a boss for a few years (and would have still had to work closely with her in her new position) so... silver lining I guess.",

Every one has been an open, international search, and while we've had a few internal candidates none of them ever made the shortlist. The one thing I have seen complicate decisions has been a desire for gender balance-- like all-male departments hoping to hire a female (or the opposite, which we've had too). You obviously can't write that into an ad but it happens all the time. That aside, I've had no interference from deans and as a frequent department chair have not interfered myself.\n\nThat said, there have been *plenty* of reasons we've dropped people based on their applications or interview performance.  For example, I've seen dozens of lawyers apply for academic jobs saying they \"would like a change of pace and a lighter workload\" and suggesting that since they have a JD and read a few books they'd be great professors. Those are always good for a laugh.\n\nThen there were the ones who said overtly sexist or even racist things during their on-campus interviews. Or the guy who we took to dinner with several faculty, ordered a nice steak dinner but told them not to bring anything but the meat, and proceeded to talk about comic books for two hours (and only comic books) despite repeated efforts to bring the conversation around to his research and/or teaching interests (neither of which were related to comic books).",

No issues with fit for either one and both were hoping to move to the area for family reasons. \n\nOur chair (who wasn't on the committee but was advising) wrote in that he'd prefer to restart the search before giving it to the postdoc. His reasoning? That the postdoc wouldn't be happy long-term at our R2. We ended up selecting the assistant professor and will have to see how it works out, but the postdoc still doesn't have a job. I assume other interviews/offers may have been pulled due to covid. It's tough out there, even for really qualified candidates.",

Proposing more research than can be done, projects that are heavily about collaborating with other groups rather than involving your own students, etc. can indicate that you\u2019re aiming for something the institution can\u2019t provide. \n\nYou want to convince them that you know the balance and trade offs that come from this position, and that not only are you OK with those but that\u2019s what you want. \n\nIt might help to know where in the process you\u2019re stalled: are you not getting first round interviews, or are you making it to campus and then not getting the job?",

The program director was past retirement age, so she was going to use this chance to retire and then the next year, we can search for a director and hire the first candidate, and the candidate was in on the plan (this person had been an professor, left for industry, and wanted to come back to academics specifically to work with us, so an extra year in industry was not an issue).  \n>  \n>So the next year we ran a sham search knowing who we were going to hire (though this person was still head and shoulders above the other candidates).  I actually started the meeting off saying, so do we even need to discuss any of these other candidates since we know we are going to hire XXX.  Everyone laughed...except the person we just hired because no one had filled her in on the plan.  She was horrified.\n\nI have to say, this absolutely boils my blood.  I understand you got shafted by HR when you originally wanted to hire the associate professor, but that doesn't give you any right whatsoever to run sham searches that waste the time and energy of dozens, if not hundreds, of people who end up applying.  Don't be evil, there's plenty enough of that in academia already.",

At this point my ability to pursue *any* sort of career, especially something that would involve Academia as I want, is going to be seriously hampered. \n\nYes, White people, as a groupo, aren't disadvantaged (With men/gender, it's more complicated, as unlike with race both Men and Women suffer from systemic gender norms/biases in certain areas) but that doesn't mean there aren't examples of white men like me who have managed to pull a lot of short straws in life and *are* very disadvantaged due other facets of their lives,\n\nWhich is why, I would argue at least, it's an issue to approach important decisions like hiring in the way the situations /u/Carpe-Diemer, /u/beimpermissible  and /u/PhD4Hire came across (not blaming these people, obviously it wasn't up to them, just something they obeserved)\n\nI don't have an issue with factoring in potential ways a person could be disadvantaged and as a result had to work harder into hiring decisions, including race or gender, but if it's *only* those and not examining a wider degree of factors such as economic class or various random life events, then it's making assumptions which lead to exceptions and outliers (such as cases where people in X or Y normally privileged group get unlucky in other respects and still end up facing as many challenges and disadvantages as somebody from a less privileged group) getting screwed over.",

They might even know the person they want when posting the job or reviewing applications. People prefer to work with people they know. That\u2019s the reality. \n\nSo if you are without a job right now, I truly sympathize. Please try to not see a rejection as a reflection of you or your work. It NEVER is. Also, a bit more controversially, never see an unsuccessful application as time wasted. It is a further chance to reflect upon you and your work and time to focus on where you are and where you want to be.\n\nIf anyone wants to chat, feel free to DM.",

From that point on, people with qualitative interests were interviewed, but never again was one hired.\n\nNote: a few interdisciplinary positions excluded, in which someone was brought in to be part of more than one department or to serve in a special capacity for new interdisciplinary social science certifications - some social sciences have not become as obsessed with quantitative modelling as political science and economics. \n\nPoint: Know the divisions within the faculty, assuming the full department faculty hold the final hiring vote.\n\n**Edit:** fixed grammar and adding one other point - be aware of your degree's specific relationship with the university you are applying to. I know Canadian PhDs were treated with a bit of disdain in my field, often because they had too many 'philosophical, ethical and qualitative' approaches to the field. They'd never say it, but chances of being hired with a degree from another country wasn't going to happen - thus, I'd *recommend*  researching the faculty and seeing if any have degrees from other countries; also *look at course offerings - if there has been nothing offered on political philosophy, outside of a separate philosophy department, then that might matter to you*.\n\n**Final tip:** Maybe obvious, and likely told to you when preparing for the job market, but if not then **always be able to provide a clear, well-thought out answer to the question 'why does any of this matter' when giving a research talk to faculty, it'll be the first thing they ask and if you can't respond with an insightful answer about how your dissertation/publications/whatever fit into the field and why they matter academically and/or practically, it is game over.**",

If you're interested in pursuing a career in academia and have Aspergers, I would still wholeheartedly advise you to pursue it because honestly people in academia are still much more receptive to autistic people than almost all other professions. However, in specific situations (eg. maybe a department is already pretty socially incapable and the chair really wants to bring social people on board to change the feel of the department, or maybe the department is a very social department and they don't want to bring on a socially inept individual who won't fit in with the ways things are done in that department), being socially inept could be an unspoken reason for their decision. But even if let's say 1/10 decisions are made on socialibility (random fraction for the sake of argument), it would probably be closer to 1/3 decisions in most corporate industries, and so it still makes sense to pursue academia as an individual with autism.",

The average at our school is about 5-6 years, so one of my friends isn't too far off (going into her 6 year) but it's looking likely she'll take 7-8 years based on her current progress. The other one is going into his 8th year, and pretty soon won't be allowed to take TAships anymore. With both of them, I think they struggle to focus and are also afraid of finishing things. I also think they don't actually want to graduate and leave. \n\nFor example, my 8th year friend had plenty of time to finish up his dissertation. Ideally, he would have been applying to jobs throughout this year in addition to working on his dissertation, and wrapped it up in the next few weeks with a job ready. But he said he felt \"frozen\" and couldn't apply to jobs. He admitted he feels his CV probably isn't strong enough for an academic job, but he doesn't want to leave academia. So he more or less just avoided job applications and his dissertation. Then corona happened, and his advisor gave in and is letting him stay a little longer. \n\nI think both of them really enjoy learning and being students, but being a PhD student is less about \"acing your classes\" and more about research and learning skills that you can apply to a future position.",
