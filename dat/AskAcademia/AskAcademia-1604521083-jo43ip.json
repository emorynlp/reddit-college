I\u2019m talking about doing daily phone call check ins with each individual student, providing 3 customized hot meals from the normal dining hall menu that they can order exactly to their liking each day plus a snack order form that allows them to order any snacks they want each day, having ResLife staff drop off deliveries for them that their friends can bring to the front desk to have dropped off, we\u2019re even talking about giving them something special and unique that only students who \u201csurvived\u201d quarantine will get like a branded stress ball or deck of cards or t shirt (were still figuring out what students will like/ what\u2019s doable in the budget).\n\nNow I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re perfect, we\u2019re definitely still learning and tweaking as we go, but I know a lot of schools are basically dropping off a loaf of bread to their quarantined students and telling them to deal with it for 14 days. \n\nBut the general student body is complaining that we don\u2019t have enough transparency about what\u2019s being done for quarantined students. We\u2019re not hiding anything at all, and whenever we get questions, we answer them transparently (other than giving out the names of the students in quarantine obviously). So we\u2019re not really sure what to do because we know if we send an email about quarantine protocols, no one will read it or they\u2019ll respond negatively. The info is all on the website but none of the students check the website. \n\nI genuinely would love recommendations of how to be more transparent without having to send another email or come off as inauthentic.",

If you're communicating it to them, there's really nothing else you can do other then to say \"new information posted here, please review it\" and link to the site, short and sweet. But ultimately you can't make them consume it. \n\nAlso it sounds like you're all doing a great job in the quarantine dorm. My institution failed miserably, and they were giving students cookies and chips and no water. The water was an issue because the students didn't have cups to get water from their bathroom sinks, and the faucets were too low to fit  a regular bottle under. They didn't even give them soap. Students had to go to the media to get any changes made.
