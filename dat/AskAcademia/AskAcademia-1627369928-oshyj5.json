  "title:": "I want to quit my PhD",
  "text": "So I will keep this post as short as possible. \nI am almost at the end of my fourth year of PhD in France (typically takes 3 years). I messed up in my third year due to covid, being away from family and deteriorating mental health and got nothing done. I had a mental breakdown last November and was on sick leave and medications for about 4 months and part-time for 2 months. I contacted my advisor and started working full-time (when officially I was on part-time) to catch up with work. My contract was extended multiple times due to administrative work, and this caused a lot of stress because of repeated visa procedures. \nI always thought I would finish writing up my thesis in September and defend in October/November. In May, my advisor set the deadline to finish up by end of July. This was impossible for me and i told that earlier and kept repeating but my advisor insisted that I would make it. She even suggested that i could send the manuscript with missing chapters and update it later. (In France we need to send the manuscript to reviewers before defending so they can write up a report). I still tried my best to work as much as possible and I now feel that i wont make it.\nI have two chapters left to write and i haven\u2019t done the work ( its my main model and i haven\u2019t implemented it or have any results). My advisor is going on vacation this week and next. And i need to send my thesis draft to reviewers by next week. And send the missing chapters in two weeks. I feel so stressed and tired and I feel like I have had enough and i don\u2019t want to push myself anymore. My body is literally breaking down. I haven\u2019t been paid for months due to paperwork and because its summer, and every department closes up i had to constantly be stressed about getting all the documents ready to defend. Now I feel this timeline is insane and i wont be able to get all the work done on time. I feel cornered and don\u2019t want to get a degree just for the sake of it. \n\nI am in CS and I feel like as long as i have necessary skills (i plan to still finish my model and probably put it up on github and publish a paper eventually) i could manage to get a job in the industry. I don\u2019t see the point of stressing out anymore. Is it okay to quit now?\n\n**!!!Update!!!** I would like to thank everyone for your supportive words. I was under immense pressure and stress and could not reply to anyone, but I will respond in the coming days. Reading your comments helped me a lot and I contacted my advisor. I got a small extension of two weeks which ends today. So I will be submitting my incomplete thesis draft to the reviewers and continue my work and finally update it in 3-4 weeks and submit it to doctoral school. Also, I finally received my pay (of 5 months) at the end of July and I paid up all my dues. I am trying to focus on working and not letting the emotions come to surface though a tiny part of my brain is constantly panicking. I don't know if it will be possible for me to take a break again or extend my thesis deadline because, (i) i don't have any funding left (ends this month), (ii) my defense date is fixed and I don't know if the doctoral school/jury/my advisor would want to reschedule. I feel cornered but don't see any way out other than submitting a mediocre thesis.",

          "text": "I just wanted to say that this was a really great response, even I needed to hear a reminder about taking of myself and not letting outside pressure define anything for me.\n\nI constantly feel under the gun to finish what I have started with academia, but the past path for me has always been to put it off if I feel I need to. I was having a baby during one of my college years, and I was desperately ill with HG (look it up if you need to, hyperemesis gravidarum) and I was completely unable to get my work done. Even when talking to professors that gave me grace or new deadlines, in the end, I had to withdraw from the entire semester without any refund. But it was the best decision for me, because I no longer had that heaviness on me about whatever it was I was supposed to be doing.\n\nJust because people tend to finish a PhD program in 3 years doesn't make it reasonable for everyone. I think I've read that most places in the States have a 10 year limit to complete work, but I don't know what it's like in France (I believe that's where you said you are). If you use the word \"help\" in reference to your situation, people become much more considerate and willing to listen, so consider that when you are emailing or speaking to others.\n\nSince I have been teaching over the past decade, senioritis is a major issue at the end of every school year, the end of any grade level grouping (elementary K-5, middle 6-8, or otherwise), and it can be a huge impact on even a previously high-performing student. This refusal or inability to get the work done is not just happening to you, it is something you can talk to a professional about while it's not hanging over your head like these arbitrary deadlines. Do the deadlines have significance? If not, it might be your advisor just trying to give you something to shoot for. I mean, how many of us procrastinate until the last minute and still turn out amazing product? More than just me, I'll bet. ;)\n\nRegardless of what you choose, stick with the decision you ultimately make until you are ready to move onto the next goal. I think another leave and maybe someone to talk to, whether a life counselor or career counselor, can give you the time you need. You might even be able to get some testing done of your work. Make your research interesting and enjoyable, and you might start feeling better. But at this stage, the deadline is no longer reasonable with the materials and resources (time being a resource too) you currently have.\n\nBest of luck to you.",

Kudos to you.\n\nUnfortunately in France we have only 3 years because we don't have have any course work or teaching obligations. Yeah, I think my problem is that I cant really express how I am feeling and always try to show that I'm fine :/\n\nThank you so much for your kind words. I did decide to not quit but the deadline is too short. But I am trying to make the best of it.",

          "text": "This is great advice. French bureaucracy is frustrating, but generally if you miss a deadline it's not the end of the world (I'm also on my way to being naturalised French...). They like to talk strict in the rules, but they are usually very willing to bend them, and things that look fucked because of important being on holiday often get put back to normal. \n\nGet the sick note OP, and re-register for the next year (otherwise you should technically defend before December, so re-registering gives you breathing space. As far as I know universities have been much more relaxed about re-registering on the back of covid). Take the time you need, if for nothing else to give yourself space to think about whether it's worth you finishing. I think it's not absolutely necessary to get your title in your situation (with the model and aiming for industry), but if you can put it on pause for a few months it might be worth it.",

              "text": "Hey, yeah French bureaucracy is something!!! \n\nInitially I planned to defend around November because I am almost at the last stage of my thesis. When I started working after my break, I had planned to finish up my work in September. But my advisor decided to push it back to July because the doctoral school absolutely wanted me to have some form of financement till the end of my thesis (and they did not accept self financing/ pole emploi). And due to that, my advisor insisted on this hard deadline because she has no more funding. \n\nTherefore, I am stuck in this situation and ever since I got to know that I needed to finish by july it has been pure chaos. I just wish the doctoral school would be a bit more accommodating after the pandemic and stuff. Thank you for the suggestions though! :)",

                  "text": "Ah that's a shame that they won't be more accommodating. I was in a similar situation last year - I had no more lab funding but I was struggling to get a paper required for my defence submitted to a journal in time. I managed to find a few months of funding which the ED accepted (I think only because they would have had a huge number of people abandoning if they had been strict on the financement rules during the pandemic - I don't really know how they worked it out for a lot of people). Technically I should have defended within the period of that extra financement, but the ED turned a blind eye once I was registered at the beginning of the year and I went several months past it taking pole emploi.\n\nI've just read your update - I think you've taken a good way forward. At my uni, if the thesis requires 'major corrections', you get 3 months to write those up. As far as I know, that is outside of registration (so you shouldn't need to worry about official financement), and as long as the jury president approves the corrections you don't need to defend again. Don't panic about a mediocre thesis! As sad as it is to some people, no one will ever read your thesis again after your jury - if you can make progress with the paper and the model, you will have more to show from your PhD than a lot of people, and no one will ever care or even know that you submitted it first in a incomplete form.\n\nIn any case, courage! I hope your thesis is accepted for the defence and you can make the corrections after. In the worst case scenario that you are unable to defend, the paper and model are still tangible things you can use to show your worth when finding a new path in industry or wherever. There are many ways forward!",

Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be possible.\n\nAlso I cant extend beyond this year because it would be my fifth year and my advisor absolutely  wants me to finish before that.",

If you're not paid and don't sit on a pile of money, it's natural that your brain is concerned with survival and not with the Ph.D.  If there is absolutely no way you could push yourself to defend somehow, maybe you could get another deferral/ sick leave, find a job, get financial security and finish and defend it in a year?  It might look better on your advisor if she is open to negotiations.",

Present what had been done, present what should have been done, explain why some thing haven't been done, and most importantly explain how you would do the things that haven't been done (in a prospect part). Talk with your PI about it, she will know better than me and will give you some advice to prepare your defense.\n\nExample : in my case I had to test my method on industrial case, problem: all industry were closed... so I need to explain how I tested my method without industrial case and how it was initially planned.",

Second, we know that Covid-time was particularly hard for PhD students who are already - even in normal times - fragile students. We (at least in my institution) tried to do everything we could to support our (PhD) students during the pandemic and specific instructions were given to the administration and PI to ensure that no PhD student was left behind. Unfortunately, it's very difficult to ensure a 100% follow-up rate. Others have said you should let your PI know of how you feel. That's a good advice. But you should also contact the administration. I can assure you that if you were (maybe you are) in my institution, we would be very open to any solution to (1) protect your health, (2) give you the time you need to complete your PhD once you feel better. Also we (at least in my case) can think of specific financial supports should you need it. So again, you should let your administration know.

You are too far to stop now and throw away those 4 years of work. The easiest to finish as much as you can now, is to take a day off, but really off: no laptop, phone, or anything that could put you in contact with your PhD topic or even jobs in general. Go for a walk in nature. It is a useless activity but will revitalise you when you get back to your desk the next day.",

Then go look where you need to fill in stuff. Don't go too far with your arguments. In my (humanities) degree, I was trying to cram in some French philosophy angle but I took that out because it was just adding extra weight. At this point, see what you can take out so yo don't waste time on expanding that argument Remember, you are just doing a PhD, you do not need to reinvent the world.",

      "text": "So sorry to hear that, it must be incredibly hard. \n\nNow here\u2019s what I would do. Have a honest talk with your supervisor, and do it immediately, before she leaves for vacation. Ask her to help you get one LAST extension. They say, a good PhD thesis is a submitted thesis and trust me, from what you mentioned above, you have come a long way and are short of a few chapters. It would be a pity to quit at this point. It would be completely justified though, please don\u2019t get me wrong. You have gone through a lot and mental health should always come first. All I am saying is, since you have already invested that many years, you might as well get done with your thesis and get that degree and then you are free to look for jobs and live your life however you want. So please earnestly and emphatically request your PI to help you get that one last extension. Tell her upfront that it would be impossible to finish within two weeks. She can definitely try making a case based on your mental health in the past year (and the pandemic). We are living in times of global crises, regulations that apply to normal times shouldn't be enforced in such situations without it being unfair for many. In the end, whatever you decide, please do not blame yourself for what you went through. You do what you have to do to stay sane and accept the rest as it comes. Be good and here\u2019s wishing you all the best with whatever way you go!",

      "text": "First of all, I'm sorry this is getting so bad that you feel you want to drop out. I'm also in my third year of PhD degree in France and, yes, these last few months have sucked, mental health-wise.\n\nOwing to your headline, I think you should either try to find emotional support to power through these last few months, or --unless your livelihood depends on you getting this PhD soon-- try to take a break from it. Shifting focus towards something that feels worthwhile and that ultimately makes you feel good, will help you recover and get back to a place where you know and can tell yourself you can get it done with.\n\nIf you\u2019re up for the first path but can\u2019t afford therapy, I think you should try to talk it out and be honest about how you feel, be it with your supervisor or colleagues and friends in high places at your lab/department. You may find out the university has already put people in place to listen up and give you the emotional support you need to navigate this last stage.\n\nIf you\u2019d rather pause and get better first, I don't know if this is true for all doctoral schools in France, but I know that some of them (like mine) let you request a 6 to 12-month break to attend to matters outside your doctorate, for instance, your health. This is usually called something like \"demande de c\u00e9sure.\" Check with your ED or supervisor for this option; usually, you don\u2019t pay for tuition that year.\n\nBon courage !",

The stress was a lot, I had an unsupportive supervisor, and the job prospects were not threat for phds at the time.   I wrestled with quitting for about six months.   The toughest part was the perceived outside pressure and the loss of identity as a scientist etc.    However, I was able to focus my efforts on a consulting career, then in government as a supervisor of a science team and then eventually as a senior executive.   You are young (I assume) and have a lot of time to identify what your true passions are and where you should apply those passions.    Don\u2019t be afraid of quitting -it will all work out.   \n\nAlso- consider a leave of absence.  Can you take off 6 months to regain some balance and pursue some other avenues?    Good luck!",

That is non trivial and will require concentrated effort to complete. \n\nOn the other hand, if you quit now, you will likely never finish the dissertation and never get your PHD. \n\nIt is not unheard of, lots of people leave programs as \u201call but dissertation\u201d, ABD. \n\nMy recommendation would be to take a day off. Get a massage. Take a walk in the woods. Come back and finish off the hard work you have in front of you, complete your thesis, get your doctorate and be a PHD looking for a position. \n\nCould you not do it? Sure.
