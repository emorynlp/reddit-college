      "text": "Generally, you\u2019re hired as a university employee during your PhD in Germany. The funding is provided by your advisor. Stipends are also possible, but you won\u2019t get pension payments and have to get private health insurance. They might be good for your CV. And it might be easier to find a spot since you\u2019re essentially free to the advisor. They are however by no means necessary.",
