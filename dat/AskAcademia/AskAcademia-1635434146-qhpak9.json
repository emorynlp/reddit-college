IDK, maybe my field (composition/rhetoric) has a different way of thinking about feedback; we largely don't use conference QandA to tear people down.  Criticism should be constructive, not destructive ffs.  On a funny note, my father-in-law runs a small military museum in a college town and was invited to attend an academic history conference at the university. Apparently, he was so horrified by how mean the historians were to each other (hostile questioning and such) that he started to worry that was what I was going through every time I presented at a conference. He was very relieved to hear that my conferences were not like that!",

You can't have sessions overrunning so participants get no coffee breaks, or 15 minutes to eat lunch.\n\nParticipants need to be able to efficiently get food and coffee in breaks. I would much prefer an option for not-great food that is faster than needing to sit for an hour and a half to get a sit-down meal when I really need to catch up on emails, work on my talk or take some personal time in the lunch break.\n\nA good conference dinner and some evening activities are also great for building connections. For example I've been to some good evening poster sessions with freely flowing local beer and nibbles facilitating a well attended poster session with lots of great exchange. Ideally posters should be hanging around in the coffee break area for a couple of days before the session so people get a chance to look around and decide which posters they specifically want to talk to people at.",

The main advantage of going to a conference is to network, form collaborations, and get feedback on your work. It's very hard to do that at some of the big conferences when you have 10,000+ attendees spread out over hundreds of sessions. So if you're organising one I would say make sure there are plenty of opportunities for attendees to interact and ask each other questions, rather than just having an endless blitz of presentations and posters.",

I think the biggest thing I wished was different was giving us more break times in between all the events, and maybe less events overall. I understand the value of having so many talks, but at the same time, conferences are also places to foster networking. I felt like I didn't have the time or energy to do so at the end of each day. Additionally, it wasn't very accessible for people with joint issues, as we would basically have like 5 minutes to run between conference rooms on the other end of the building or up/down 2 flights of stairs, so more time in between would've immensely helped with that.",

      "text": "Probably two experiences (both at virtual conferences) jump out at me as bad so far:\n\n1) I was presenting at a famous international conference in my discipline; our 20-minute talks were pre-recorded, and we would attend a live Q&A session on the day. I went to one of the morning Q&A sessions, and every single chair expected presenters to have a truncated 5-minute version of their talk ready (including slides etc.), which wasn't stipulated in the conference guidelines. Everyone then panicked and many presenters ended up repeating their 20-minute talks as they couldn't ad-lib at such short notice. I think every single session ended up running over by at least half an hour. I was lucky to be in one of the last sessions, so I could cobble something together, but it sucked to have that sudden stress when we thought we were all set.\n\n2) A small postgrad conference I was presenting at had issues with many of their presenters: either they didn't respond to their acceptance emails and never showed up, or had terrible connection issues. I couldn't attend for the whole conference as I was teaching that day, and when I turned up at my timeslot, the screen told me that everyone was on lunch break. I messaged one of the organisers, and they told me that they had been forced to move everyone's slot forward 1.5 hours to fill the vacant times, so I had long since missed mine. They never sent me any warning emails or suggested that this might happen during the organisation process.",

      "text": "I'm actually at a work conference this week. This is also my first conference in my professional career, so forgive me for any ignorance I may have. \n\nI'm so glad we found a venue that fed us so well. We have breakfast and lunch at the hotel where we held the conference and the food was unique in that it went the extra mile, catered for different diets, and all of it was so delicious. There was a coffee bar and snacks throughout the day too.\n\nIf you have a hybrid audience of virtual and in-person attendees, the conference made a good effort to include virtual as part of the discussions and presentations. Note, this is also a smaller group of 36 in-person and about 15 virtual. This may not be feasible for larger conferences.\n\nThis conference also made space for wellness by having a coloring book at every table. We also had a mini workshop that involved Play-Doh and the rest of the conference there were a number of people that used the Play-Doh as a fidget/ sensory tool to stay focused. Of course, you may want to know the maturity level of your crowd ahead of time.\n\nWe also made a strong effort to stick to the schedule, down to the minute, if we could. This was for the virtual participants, but I think both groups appreciated the structure.",

To get back to the nearest village and then on to my hotel I needed to walk down a 1 mile pitch black wood driveway and cut through an abandoned train station before getting to the tram station. I had to leave the socialising early to try and get back before the sun set.\n\nI\u2019m a lone female traveller. A male conference goer offer to walk with me but I decided to take the chances of going alone. I think he was just being thoughtless, but he\u2019d told me how the woods reminded him of how his grandma was raped by soviet soldiers at the end of ww2, possibly in the same woods! \n\nAlso human breaks please and remember to organise regular food and coffee in them.",

      "text": "Best: my first conference presentation \u2014 I felt prepared, arrived at the room early to set up, and prayed someone would show up. To my shock, it was standing room only, well received, and I got several consult invites from it. \n\nWorst: I co-presented at a national conference with colleagues on a topic we\u2019d presented at several smaller conferences, so we felt comfortable and well prepared. During the ending q&a, an attendee (a former instructor of mine with whom I had a contentious relationship) asked a question, then twisted my response, which seemed to negate our central thesis. The more I tried to defend our position, the deeper I sunk into a pit - mortifying! Thankfully one of co-presenters quickly shut him down so we could move on. Lesson learned: be prepared to cut off attention seeking hecklers with a \u201cthat\u2019s outside of the scope of our study\u201d or similar line.",
