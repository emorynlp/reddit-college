  "text": "TW: Mention of war crimes, destruction, mass murder, sexual assault\n\nMy US history class is doing a semester-long project where I can pick whatever topic I\u2019d like to study, so of course I chose a topic that intrigued me at the time: how the US government covered up Imperial Japan\u2019s war crimes. By extension, I also had to research those crimes. While it\u2019s interesting from a history nerd perspective, I find it hard to be unbiased. \n\nMy family on my father\u2019s side is Filipino, and I wasn\u2019t close to them, but I do know my grandparents suffered through Japanese occupation. One article said it pretty well, that their invasion of Manila, the capital city, was less of a battlefield and more of a crime scene. There were mass rapes, murder, arson, bombing, some barely mentionable atrocities against the human race. \n\nI know my family suffered. From what my Papa told me, my Lolo had to hide underground while the bombs destroyed the city overhead. My great Grandfather was kidnapped, but I don\u2019t know how my Lola went through the war. She\u2019s passed away, but from what little I knew of her, she seems like she wouldn\u2019t come forward about being raped. If she was, that secret died with her, and that sickens me to know it. \nI\u2019ve researched atrocities like this before, yet it adds a new layer of distress and bias knowing that my family was hurt by it.\n\nIt\u2019s very late in the year to change my subject, and I want to keep going with it. I just don\u2019t know how I can keep going with it without my studies taking a toll on my mental health.\n\nDoes anyone, especially if you\u2019ve been in a similar situation, have any advice?",

      "text": "These are some great questions. Indeed, research can involve learning and thinking in-depth about very disturbing things. It's great that you recognize the potential toll of this on your mental health and are being proactive. A few thoughts:\n\n1. Recognize what you're feeling when you're working on this project. Be mindful of the fact that you may need to engage in self-care after studying and sitting with some of the more difficult parts of this project. Give yourself the time and space you need to do that.\n\n2. It sounds like you may be a high school student. If so, consider talking with your teacher about what you've told us here: that this project, while very interesting, is bringing up some uncomfortable realizations about what your grandparents experienced. See what advice they have for navigating this, including perhaps the scope of your project (e.g., what you do and do not focus on).\n\n3. Since this is a U.S. history class and your project is on the U.S. covering up Japanese war crimes, you might consider how you focus your efforts (e.g., on the actions of the United States, with enough context to understand the war crimes they covered up, but with the focus on the cover up and not the war crimes). You may want to refer to the specific prompt for this project and consult with your teacher. Ultimately, though, it sounds like you may be interested in the details of Japanese war crimes because those so personally affected your grandparents, but it's possible (again, refer to the prompt) that you may find it helpful to focus your energy on the U.S. history aspect of this rather than specific events your grandparents may have lived through. Considering the focus may help you to direct your energy and efforts to more secondary considerations that might feel a little more removed form the events that are so difficult for you to sit with.",

      "text": "Yes, I work on laws of armed conflict and have studied atrocities and genocide among other things, this has required reading and listening to some very disturbing material\n\nThese guidelines, while for sexual and domestic violence might be useful for you: https://www.svri.org/sites/default/files/attachments/2016-06-02/SVRIVTguidelines.pdf\n\nOn a personal level, I would recommend, deciding what your boundaries are - for example due to personal experience I don't deal with childhood sexual violence, but also make a clear separation between work space and work time, so when I've worked on sensitive topics I've ideally kept work at work (fortunately I haven't been working on anything like this during the pandemic) and I work set hours (so no matter what I finish at x pm). Finally, take care of yourself, take weekends off, use your annual leave, think about media consumption (when I was working on drone strikes I watched a lot of childrens TV) and finally remember you can't do everything, you can't fix the world BUT there is value in bearing 'witness' and giving voice to those who've been through these horrors",
