  "title:": "How commonly do universities lie about test scores and GPA's?",
  "text": "One of the oldest universities in the country claimed a GMAT score of its accepted students to be over 700 on their website. \n\nWhy would students with 700+ GMAT's join a mid-tier pedestrian college in Virginia when they could easily be accepted by schools like MIT and Stanford with scores as high as that? I was curious. \n\nLuckily, the Virginia college was a public college, so I sent them a FOIA request as a Virginia resident myself. I got a response from their General Counsel's Office this morning. Here's what their General Counsel told me under FOIA.\n\nMean GMAT's of accepted students for 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 were 592, 602, 549 and 560. When I checked their website again, they had taken down their 700+ claim.\n\nSo, how common is it for universities to lie about test scores and GPA's? Do they lie only to the public or do they also lie to accreditation agencies?",

Reportedly, the Dean told his staff that it wasn't illegal to lie to US News. Then, at trial, the Dean's defense was that 'he didn't lie', it was his staff that lied...*US News University Rankings are based on self reported statistics that are not checked/audited...*\n\nBeen through multiple accreditation processes both as an administrator and as a faculty. When the accreditation team came to our institution we would hand them a thousand page report... that they have a few days to go through...The accreditation team are not auditors.\n\nUnderstand the hierarchical structure of universities. On the academic side, each faculty member optimizes their annual report that goes to their chair. Each chair optimizes their report that goes to the dean. Each dean optimizes the report that goes to the provost. Each provost optimizes their report that goes to the President/chancellor who optimizes their report that goes to the governing board.\n\nWhile it likely isn't common for a university to overtly lie, it is very common for information to be edited and optimized. \n\nStay safe out there!",
