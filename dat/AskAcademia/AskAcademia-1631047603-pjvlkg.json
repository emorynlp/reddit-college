  "text": "I'm updating my CV for a job search for faculty positions.\n\nLast year my PI was awarded an NIH R01 based on my work, which I co-wrote with them. Is there any way I can include this in the CV?\n\nBonus question, how about grants that included me as key staff?\n\nNeither of these things are critical but it'd be nice to get some credit for the effort.\n\nEdit: I want to be clear that I have a an extremely functional relationship with my boss, I just want my CV to reflect the effort that goes into grant writing, given how little opportunity there is for postdocs to be co-PI or the sole awardee of grants.",

It\u2019s possible they might prefer something like \u201ccontributing author\u201d or something else that indicates a slightly lower status than \u201cco-author\u201d.\n\nThe worst-case scenario here is you list yourself as co-author, your potential employer calls up your PI, and they say they wouldn\u2019t have called you that/that\u2019s an inflated title for the amount of work they think you did. Now your potential employer thinks you\u2019re exaggerating/lying on your CV.\n\nSo check with your PI.",
