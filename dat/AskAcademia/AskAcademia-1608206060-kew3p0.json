  "title:": "I am a PhD candidate, and I have been offered a one year long internship, should I take it?",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am a PhD candidate in computer engineering, I've just finished my 2nd year. I finished all courses and passed the comprehensive exam. Currently working in a nice research project related to 5G in collaboration with a big company but I haven't published yet. I applied and got accepted into a one-year long internship at the same company (20 hours a week) in the very same topic that I am interested in. I see it a a great opportunity because I want to work in the industry after my PhD and the internship fits perfectly with my research and thesis; but my supervisor disagrees with me and doesn't want me to take it. He thinks that it will compromise my PhD and told me if I take it, that will be at my own risk.\n\nI am so undecided, should I take the internship or follow my supervisor and reject it?\n\nThanks",

They may be open to that and if so that\u2019d be better than part time for longer.\n\nAbsent that though, figure out funding (Will they be paying for your degree? Will your supervisor?) If it\u2019s really integrated with your research, talk to them (company and prof) about getting a dissertation chapter out of your work there. If you can make that happen, go for it. If it can\u2019t happen but your advisor is still willing to fund you, tread carefully, make sure to prioritize your PhD work and it sounds like go for it. \n\nA word of caution, I\u2019ve seen companies unintentionally try get more hours out of students than the 20 they signed up for - don\u2019t fall into this trap. It can be easy to do internship work rather than research (eg there are set and often urgent deliverables, it may be more fun than the grunt work of getting your PhD) but you have to make progress on your research as well. The students I\u2019ve seen be most successful in part time internships had specific days they did company work (eg Mon, Tues, Thur) and days to work on their PhD (eg Wed, Fri). That helps enforce some structure that can be hard to come by otherwise.\n\nBest wishes!!",

                  "text": "This is excellent advice, OP. I've just recently crossed over to the other side from PhD/postdoc to supervisor and while this may not be advice, it might help contextualize why your supervisor is apprehensive: if he's paying you out of his grants on an RA only position (i.e no TAing) then you're really putting him in a tough spot. Funding for RA positions are definitely very hard to come by and if you're on one of those you're expected to be full time on your degree, which means your supervisor is essentially wasting valuable, hard fought RA money to pay someone he isn't get full time hours out of. I would take a guess that these thoughts are probably what are fuelling his thinking.\n\nFor advice, u/clemson_throwaway2 is pretty spot on. If you can't get a thesis chapter or two out of this internship then it doesn't sound worth it to me. I had an opportunity in my PhD to apply for an internship at a government agency where I would have essentially been with them for 6 months then back at my Uni for 6 months and I would have alternated this  way until the end of my degree. The arrangement would've been that they paid for their 6 months \"claim\" over me, I could use all research generated with them in my thesis and it was in writing that at the end of the degree, hiring preference would've been given to me for a full time position. I ended up not making the final cut, but this style of arrangement would be the model I would look for in a PhD internship. Good luck with the decision, OP! I wish you the best",

If you can, seek the advice of other ECE profs and students, not randos around here.",

All of this considering that you have decided that academia is not your thing.\n\nWhile I generally do not discourage people from getting a Ph.D., I do think that for some industries, the Ph.D. might not bring the value that applied experience would give you, and in some cases, it might be more of a deterrent than a boost. The internship might give you a different perspective of your project and perhaps let you know what people outside of an academic environment do, allowing you to bring new ideas to your project.\n\nHowever, I understand the perspective of your supervisor, especially if you are the only person working on that project because it would mean a delay in getting the results that he wants which can affect his chances of getting a future grant. However, a Ph.D. is a limited-term contract and has to be seen as a transitional phase towards better opportunities. \n\nIn the end, you need to do what is best for you while trying to maintain professional relationships and sticking to the commitments made. You might find that after you do the internship, perhaps a job offer is made. What would you do in that case? Take it, knowing that you might not end your Ph.D. and damaging the relationship with your supervisor or reject the offer and finish the Ph.D., knowing that the opportunity might not present again in the near future?\n\nNo matter the decision you make, I wish you the best of success.",

A 20-hour internship could easily creep up on time and your supervisor may expect 60-80 hours a week no matter what the actual agreement is.

They know how you work and will be willing to give you certain roles since you now have the credentials for it versus no clue who you are and are taking a risk on seeing if you fit the role and company. Run a cost-benefit analysis of both paths, figure out timelines and the risks associated. Good luck!",

We tend to accept a full-time semester internships if you \"freeze\" your studies, or part-time ones if you have won a grant that's research or technological-transfer oriented (they are called MITACS here in Canada). In the latter case, the supervisors themselves apply for these funds, so there is no conflict.\n\nIf you don't have your supervisor support it might be tricky, as you would probably be expected to produce the same as the rest of your classmates with only half the time. You run the risk of being perceived as \"slow\". If you are confident that won't happen as you would be working in your thesis, then you should be OK.",

      "text": "As a supervisor in Informatics/CS I am inclined to agree with your supervisor. Unless the company/team you want to join are pure R&D it is very unlikely that you will make any progress towards your PhD during the internship. Also many institutions (at least in the UK) do not allow you to include material from research performed during a PhD interruption in your thesis. It is considered dead time.  \n\n\nIt may be a brilliant opportunity for you, but do not underestimate the impact it will have in your research. You will likely need a lot of time to catch up to where you left off once you are back. It might even lead you to drop the PhD completely, either because it's too hard to get back to or because you liked the internship more, or both. It may also be the case that you end up with fresh ideas and even more enthusiasm and passion that will elevate your PhD to new heights, but a year is a long time and that doesn't happen often.   \n\n\nIt's a risk. You may be prepared to take that risk, and your supervisor seems to know that might happen, but he did warn you! Finally, I second the comments suggesting that maybe you don't want/shouldn't be doing a PhD at all (which is not a bad thing).",

Industrial research labs are typically fine with you using the research for your thesis as long as it is published work. I really think you should discuss these formalities with the company and see if your advisor can be part of this collaboration to ease his concerns.\n\nInternship opportunities in our field are extremely valuable and I think you should strongly consider taking it if you can talk this through with your advisor. I don't see why he would strongly oppose to it: you get paid good money to do research related to your Ph.D., you tend to get a lot more computing resources than at your university lab for experiments, you meet tons of new experts in your field with hands-on experience, you typically end up with a publication, *and* you set yourself up for hiring once you graduate. To me, this doesn't compromise a Ph.D. one bit, it only improves it.",

Admittedly I'm in applied math not Computer Engineering  but I don't know anyone who would make the suggestion that your advisor is making. I did two summer internships  (that actually have very little to do with my thesis work)  and it was great for getting more skills and experience. It did set me back a little bit but was absolutely worth it. What is their reasoning? Are they worried about you publishing in a timely manner? Do they not think that this work can be included in your thesis? \n\nEchoing what others have said it's possible that your advisor simply doesn't want to lose your focus on the project that they are giving you funding for. If that's the case I would suggest  taking the internship,. If they really are concerned about your progress and your program has some sort of time requirement that  your advisor is concerned about or if you are worried that your advisor is going to be vindictive about it  then really think about it.    I will say that industry experience will really set you apart later on when looking for jobs and I personally think it's a great idea. I've heard that industry jobs don't really care about your thesis, they are more are interested in your skill set and experience.",

I would say that if you are on your 3rd year and you are likely to finish in a year more or less, you should keep going with the PhD. That being said, it is also important to consider that internship that could give you an extra door after your PhD. What about making a break on your PhD for a year? you could be part time and try industry. \n\nIt is a difficult decision indeed. However, do you have a contract with your supervisor? Any scholarship or are you funding dependent on your boss? That is something to consider. You can always move to industry later, unless the opportunity you have right now is a once-a-life opportunity.",

You can get most industry roles with a Masters or even just a Bachelors. If you want to get into R&D a PhD might give you a leg up but many companies will also hire Master's students for these roles if they have some research background.",

Is the money going directly to you or through the school first? If not, is that an option? (through school). If it doesn't go through the school then you will have to self fund your PhD (and health care) and you probably won't be making that much from the 20hrs/wk. Will they publish? Can you publish what you learn? All these factor into the conversation you need to have with your advisor and maybe you already talked about these things or he already has some answers. \n\nI would focus on getting finished first, which means you need to publish. If the company won't let you publish (which is why I assume your advisor thinks it would be a distraction, and he's right) then maintain the bridge and say that you would love a summer internship but that you want to finish. Be honest and seek to work together for something that meets everyone's needs. This won't burn a bridge and you so you can change your mind later or maybe a new option will arise.",
