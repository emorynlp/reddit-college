  "title:": "PhD in Finland - tips to convince PI (supervisor) to provide funding in the form of salary?",
  "text": "Hi, I'm an international student currently doing my Master's in the University of Helsinki. My field is molecular bioscience / biomedicine. \n\nThere is a PI who has expressed interest in wanting me to join the lab as a PhD student. But during our discussion, it was mentioned that funding will most likely be in the form of grants depending on the duration of those grants, maybe one-two years and get renewed accordingly. \n\nBut as far as I know a salary is more preferable because of paying taxes and hence receiving social benefits, and also having an employment contract would probably help in getting a visa/residence permit with a longer validity? This way I wouldn't have to pay repeatedly and go through the application process again and again, right? And in general having years of official employment is also probably an advantage? (Considering it is common for PhD students in Europe to be considered as employees)\n\nLooking for thoughts on this as well as tips and points to bring up during the discussion about this!",

However, if your salary is paid for through external grants, then you may end up in a situation where you have to quit your PhD due to lack of funding. Usually though they will try to find money somewhere. Don't take my word for it though, try getting more information from the student union or your prospective PI about these matters.\n\nIf you are not an EU citizen, then - to my understanding - you have to renew your residence permit annually. Again, it wouldn't matter for this where your PhD funding comes from.",

Even if your money comes from a grant it would be passed through the university, and the only thing you would see is a salary. \n\nThe main exception to this is if you get a personal grant. In this case the grant money might be paid to you directly. However, doing what you said should still be possible. When I was a PhD student (in Finland) and I received a grant I coordinated with my HR and the foundation so that they would pay the grant to them and I'd just keep receiving my regular salary.",
