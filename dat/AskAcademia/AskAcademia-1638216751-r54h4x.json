      "text": "This is mysterious. In math we have any number high quality free-to-publish, free-to-read journals. But people in the sciences (see other comments here) often talk as if it's impossible to do this. Well, obviously, it's possible.\n\nMy guess: it's all about the money supply. Running a journal can be pretty darned cheap, as long as it's online only. But there are some costs -- small, but they do exist. In math, where lots of people don't have grants, you can't realistically charge authors. So journals find ways to cover the costs. In the sciences, where everyone has a grant, you just charge authors.\n\nThis situation looks like it will perpetuate itself. In math, we are developing a culture of high quality journals that are free for everyone. In the sciences, they don't have even a hint of such a culture, so free-for-everyone journals are regarded with suspicion. So then even journals that can figure out how to cover the costs don't get high quality submissions. So they don't become leading journals. And the cycle continues ....",

Yeah, a lot of stuff gets aggregated in databases and researchers keep their own copies, but it's inherently more possible for ejournal archives to not be around in 20 years.\n\nWhich is not to say that paper journals don't have enormous downsides of their own. But having physical copies distributed around the world on a fairly durable material that doesn't rely on software to read is a bigger factor in longevity than the publisher of a specific journal, I think. (But I also generally think all-volunteer organizations have a strong tendency to burn out or implode and would run screaming if someone asked me to do professional-level publishing work as a volunteer, yikes.)",

But as mentioned by others, high impact journals are tied up with prestige markers in the current system so it's all mixed with issues with funding and career incentives, so it's hard to get out of. One way countries/universities/funders have fought back is by demanding at least the accepted version of papers (i.e., before it's nicely formatted) is made publicly available on university repositories.\n\nThere also exist what I've seen called \"Platinum\" Open Access journals, that are free to read by anyone and also don't have author fees (or really affordable ones, like hundreds of dollars rather than thousands), so no perverse incentives like with the more obviously predatory type of Open Access journals. They get their funding from the state or some kind of society etc, they keep costs low and you can tell to be honest, but for instance I've seen them address concerns with persistence of the record using academic libariries' archiving systems (CLOCKSS), if I recall correctly. Those still have solid peer review like traditional journals ideally have, but since they tend not to be for-profit they're less interested in selecting based ultimately on a business model that asks \"what will boost our impact factor\".",

But people probably aren't going to take you seriously if you're just a rando posting unreviewed papers online. Peer review is required to ensure a minimal academic standard, and that's the main function that journals serve. Also, if editors can maintain a high standard and build a reputation, that helps readers know what papers are more likely to be higher quality. There's a reason authors try to get their work into journals like Nature and there's a reason readers subscribe to journals like Nature, even if it's more expensive for everyone than other publishers. The publishing model in academia can be pretty predatory, and publishing costs and paywalls are a detriment to science, but eliminating the whole idea of journals altogether isn't a solution",

You can even see a number that have been corrected in the final publication with significant extra work based off of peer-review comments. \n\nDo I have anything quantitative comparing it? No, but qualitatively it's been a huge display of both how much peer review increases the quality of the science and how much the availability of bad science publications (vaccines don't work, masks don't work, masks are dangerous) readily and publicly available can be damaging.",

It's a scam.\n\nPublishers take content produced by publicly funded researchers, curate it via unpaid editors and reviewers, do some copy-editing, post the content online, and then charge the public 40.00 per article (or charge the authors 5000.00 to make it open access to the public that funded it). It's an obvious scam that gets obscured by \"prestige\" and \"reputation\". Everyone in science low-key knows that  journal peer review is a dice roll that primarily serves to select for novelty/interest rather than rigor and quality.",
