  "text": "Hello!\n\nThis might seem like a silly question but I am at least trying to determine the reasons why it might be a silly question.\n\nI work full time in a job that I have been with for a few years (white collar sort of gig, the nature of the work means that there are busy months and quiet months). Previously I completed a masters in a humanities field and did a large research project. I considered continuing my research and pursuing a phd, but ended up taking the job offer. However, I am still passionate about the area I focused on and there are definitely still gaps in the literature. \n\nI guess what i'm wondering is - if I intend to return to academia for a phd program as an older candidate in a few years, is there any utility in starting research now in my free time (specifically in downtime at work)? Would any work done over the next few years actually help alleviate the pressure during phd research, or would it just go towards making the initial research proposal more polished? Or, depending on how research in the field progresses, would it end up just being an obsolete word document and waste of time that someone else has done better because I left the ideas for too long?\n\nAlternatively, should I just be putting this interest and energy into working on papers with the goal of publication, and if so, would that be more useful for eventual phd applications?\n\nThank you for reading!",

      "text": "If you\u2019re going to continue working full-time and not pursue a research assistantship, I don\u2019t see the harm in figuring out something you want to do and starting the process of developing the proposal and lit review. Even if you don\u2019t return for a few more years, having that depth and background would likely be helpful to you and give you something interesting to talk about in your personal statement. However, if you plan to do the PhD full-time and get funding as a graduate researcher, I\u2019d wait because your dissertation would probably be linked to that work.\n\nPublications would look good on an application, but unless you\u2019re weak in other areas I don\u2019t think it\u2019d boost your odds of admissions much. A strong work history and already having a graduate degree would be very compelling to me. Throw in a good letter of recommendation and an interesting statement and you\u2019d be set, especially if you\u2019re self-funding.",

      "text": "Another thing to add here is that a lot of research will need ethical approval. Unless requiring work with vulnerable people, this is usually just a tick box exercise, but it still needs to be done in most cases. Look into it before you put a lot of work into doing research. \n\nA better idea is to draft up a good proposal, and start reading the relevant literature. That'll definitely get you a good start with a PhD. \n\nGood luck!",

I suppose really I should have rephrased to 'glorified literature review' rather than 'research - that would be especially true in STEM, but even in humanities that would rule out more empirical research or interviews etc. Really good caveat, appreciate that",

              "text": "So I do think you can definitely do this but I have a bit of a hesitancy about it. I don't think it's a bad idea in itself and if you do it to help you frame a research question that's a good idea. My hesitancy comes from the concern you could go down a rabbit hole and without guidance from a supervisor I worry about a lot of wasted time and having to unpick work done. It's not uncommon for graduate students to get very wedded to an idea even when it's not a good one, I just wouldn't want you to go really far off course. \n\nI guess in summary, preliminary research absolutely but very much keep in mind you may need to significantly change your ideas or re-evaluate some of your work when you start.",
