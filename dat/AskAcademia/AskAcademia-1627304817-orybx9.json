I\u2019m specifically looking to hire someone at an R1 university or someone who has access to a research library so they can check citations and double check quotations. I\u2019m not looking for anything definitive, just an approximate hourly wage for use in a grant application. For the purposes of this project I\u2019m based in the US and Canada and can hire from either country.",
