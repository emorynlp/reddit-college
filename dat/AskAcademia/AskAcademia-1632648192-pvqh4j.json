  "title:": "book that breaks down disciplines and their approach to problemsolving/information seeking",
  "text": "sry if this doesnt belong here but I am curious to read about different disciplines and how their processes look like when it comes to information-seeking and problem-solving as I can imagine that it might differ between disciplines? I am not in academia so I feel a bit vulnerable posting this question here as I am not sure what I might get in response, maybe this is a very stupid question - haha!\n\nI would also be interested in articles/examples of how methods from disciplines been used to solve a problems if there is any book on that.",

It\u2019s probably git something to do with no one correct way to approach science as long as you\u2019re following the scientific method.\n\nThat said, you definitely could make a book about general workflows for various fields. Similar things exist but are usually pretty specific to a given method or protocol",

One single book would be difficult to produce, because even within broad areas (like the social sciences) there are significant differences by discipline. Even within my discipline there are significant differences among subfields.",
