  "title:": "Considering a PhD to move abroad and teach?",
  "text": "I am an American who did an academic exchange in the UK and absolutely fell in love with living there. I was studying journalism and had some amazing work experience with local media. Upon graduation I moved back to the UK to earn my master's with the dream of living there. I also have aspirations to become a professor. I have extensively guest lectured in my old college classes and ran workshops for student newspapers, and really enjoy teaching. \n\nDespite getting more work experience and loving my classes, the pandemic sent me back to the U.S. mere months into the program. I never felt like I got a real shot at networking.\n\nI graduated with my master's by completing it online from home and have been working full-time as a reporter. All I think about is going back to the UK. I found a PhD program where I could work on a topic I am very passionate about. I would also have the opportunity to lecture and my goal would be to find work or use the PhD to teach at a UK university.\n\nIs this a realistic goal? Has anyone earned their PhD abroad in a field that technically does not require postgraduate education and have been able to get sponsorship, especially in the UK? I am just as passionate about teaching as I am writing and would be happy with either job. I am just not sure if this is a realistic dream. I have corresponded with several faculty members in the department who all liked my research idea and encouraged me to apply. I am worried about devoting years of my life and then not being able to find sponsorship.\n\nThank you for any insight.",

If the former - it's hard, the UK in particular has a lot of PhD funding that's only for locals.  You'll need to be an extremely competitive applicant to get funded here.  That said, it's still worth trying: most departments have webpages explaining the various funding routes relevant to them, and if you don't apply you definitely won't get anywhere.  That said, I'd encourage you to also look at options in other countries as well - some European countries have much easier routes for internationals to get funded, better immigration support, better PhD pay than the UK, etc.\n\nIf you're talking about visa sponsorship, then you'll be fine.  If you have an offer for a job that requires a PhD (a professorship certainly does) you'll be able to get a visa.  Even if your job doesn't require a PhD (which is more likely, because the odds of you becoming a professor are very low), a PhD gives you extra points in the [points-based immigration system](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-points-based-immigration-system-employer-information/the-uks-points-based-immigration-system-an-introduction-for-employers) which you should certainly read up on.",

If you don't know whether that is the case, spend some serious time on google or go talk to someone who does.  \n\n> I know the UK is five years until I become a citizen.

Tthe criteria and details are complicated and very dependent on personal circumstances and anyways you obviously can't rely on immigration policy information given by random strangers statements on reddit.",
