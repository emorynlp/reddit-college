  "text": "Hi everyone. \n\nI am in a research-oriented job, essentially it's all about public international law. So basically, one of the criteria in my job is to write and publish articles in peer-reviewed journals. Now, I have tried writing, with help of a colleague and we got one paper published also. I have written few blog posts as well. But somehow, my writing skills are still at a sub-par level. \n\nNow highlighting my issues with writing\n\na. I don't think I have fancy/interesting enough of an issue to write.\n\nb. When I actually do start writing, I get a giant mental block, My body literally revolts at the process. I shut down and I just cannot type anymore.\n\nc. I feel highly incompetent and underconfident.\n\nI have tried the Pomodoro method, I have tried setting word count limit for the day to write. I have literally forced myself to write anything. But I just cannot. Now the thought of it makes me want to vomit. I know to improve my writing skills, I need to write. But I can't write. I procrastinate, sleep, watch movies, etc, Meanwhile, I can write memos for my legal work. But that's it. I know my memos can also be more brilliant if only I can get more writing practice under my belt. For the past two months, I have been toiling with the idea of starting my own blog on a topic I like. But my brain shuts down at the thought of it. \n\nIf anyone can provide pointers or some sort of advice to get out of this funk. I genuinely want to be more disciplined about my writing because it is about career progression. But I just don't know how. At this point, any help is welcomed. Thank you.",

I do enjoy writing, in a love/hate kind of way, and I'm pretty good at it, but it's still hard and my first drafts are still garbage. The two things I have found most helpful to me personally are (1) recognizing that the first draft will be bad, but it's easier to edit words that exist than write perfect words on a blank page, and (2) working with others I can send text back and forth with to get help when I'm stuck (also, other people expecting things from you gives a little accountability push). I suspect learning to outline effectively would also help, but I'm still struggling with that part!\n\nA lot of people who are less into the writing slog through the PhD but end up developing other skills (stats, experimental design, etc. not sure what this would be in law, but there's probably something!) and forming partnerships with researchers who are more comfortable with writing. Many also hire professional editors. It's pretty difficult in many fields for one person to be equally good at all aspects of research!",

      "text": "Look, this is hard, and you\u2019re not alone. But if you are not exaggerating the scale of your reaction to writing, you seem to be experiencing great anxiety, which a therapist may be better able to help you with. Honestly, it sounds like you\u2019re putting a lot of judgement and value statements behind the act of writing, and shooting yourself in the foot before you can start. You might want to explore why that is and how to mitigate it. \n\nAs for my own strategies:\n\n- start with an outline. Every bullet is a point you want to make. Once you have those in order - I find I have to reorder things a lot - you can expand each point into a paragraph. \n\n- talk at someone. Writing is asynchronous communication, but communication nonetheless. It\u2019s easy to get bogged down in words and forget about the audience. Telling someone directly about what you are thinking helps with that. I will sometimes play out giving a talk on a subject because my brain works like that. \n\n- give yourself permission to write a shitty first draft. The first version doesn\u2019t have to be polished, or even good. Just write. DO NOT give into the temptation to stop and edit, or even read what you write. Once you have some terrible text down, you can go and edit it without the blank page problem.",

I just kept dicking around the house or playing on the internet instead of working. I had established habits of \"when I'm in this spot, I play around,\" which made it impossible for me to do work. \n\nSo I found a place I had never been (a public library down the street from me) and went there every day from 9 AM until 2 PM. Being in a place where I had never goofed off really helped me stop procrastinating. I started with about 40 pages written (with months of zero progress) and finished my 180+ page dissertation within 4 weeks.

What also makes it hard is that different journals want different styles of writing. For example, some journals want first person writing, some prefer passive voice etc etc. Not all of these styles come naturally to everyone. \n\nMy process is to find a lacuna in the law, and then start with the solutions I want to propose. So if I am writing on article 9 of the ICESCR, I will identify what I think the problem AND solution is. Then from there, I start with an article outline.\n\nExample:\n1 Introduction\n\n2 Background to Article 9\n\n2.1 Negotiation of content of Article 9\n\n2.2 Interpretation of Article 9\n\n3 Implementation of Article 9 \n\n4 Shortcomings of Article 9\n\n5 Recommendations and conclusions\n\n\nAnd then you can work on each section as and when the mood grabs you. I do not ever hold myself to writing x amount of words, I find it stifling and counterproductive. But remember that doing references, formatting, bibliography etc all counts towards the end product, so do those if you feel like you need to work but don't feel like writing.\n\nGood luck!",

These things don't directly address your writing problems, but there is ample evidence that such changes will increase your focus, clarity of thought, and productivity. It also sounds like you may be actively avoiding due to stress related to the project, so consider confiding in a trusted friend or colleague about it.

Sure, it is very chaotic and I will have to delete lots of stuff but it helps against forgetting things, which happens when you read a lot. Even extensive notetaking or highlighting won't help you a lot. \n\nI have Scrivener for years and only last years I really started to appreciate the application: being able to put something in a sidebar makes it easier to write short passages and still keep an overview of your whole project.

Independent of whether or not you think it's interesting, the idea of your paper \u2014 what you learned in your project \u2014 is of near-universal importance. As a reader/student, it's enough that the idea is conveyed clearly. The lessons learned from one issue can be applied to any other issue. The lessons learned from Nagorno Karabakh can possibly be applied to, say, Israel Palestine. \n\nSo, yeah.

I\u2019m still figuring that part out. \n\nBut other than that, I do an outline and then sketch out the topics that will be covered in each section. I copy and paste the outline into my document, and I start on the first item under the introduction. Then I might add bits and pieces here and there depending on what I feel like delving into that day. The most important thing is to just get your ideas on paper without worrying about sounding smart. As in, your first draft may be something you would be ashamed to even show to your 6th grade English teacher because you\u2019ve apparently learned nothing from them. Then I go through and make everything as \u2018simple English\u2019, coherent, and grammatically correct as I can. Then I share it with a colleague or my sister to get their take - both grammar mistakes and their comments on gaps or parts that need more explanation, or parts that are irrelevant. Then the pruning process starts and I inevitably delete 1/3 of it and rewrite another 1/2.\n\nWriting is messy. But the more I do it, the less mistakes I find on the first draft. It still takes me forever.\n\nAlso - in my opinion, writing about complex topics in a way that a somewhat informed layperson can understand (and not just an expert) is harder than writing papers that  \u201csound smart\u201d. There are multiple studies that show articles written in plain English are much more likely to be cited in papers in that discipline and others, than articles that are very technical or wordy. Don\u2019t worry too much about sounding smart.\n\nYour struggle is real though. I feel it too... almost exactly the same. I can\u2019t procrastinate because I write as my full-time job, but I wish it didn\u2019t take me so long to write.",

And I guess starting from this negative outlook makes the whole process so much so unbearable.",

That\u2019s the case for everyone. And we\u2019re all our own worst critics, so after it\u2019s on paper then you\u2019ll know how to criticize it to make it better.",

      "text": "It's a tough one when you don't want to write, but you want to want. I think everyone ends up with their own personal solution, sometimes it just needs time.\n\nPerhaps try occupying your time with something different that is still writing-adjacent for a little bit. Perhaps read academic papers about other stuff that you find interesting or well written. You mention movies, read some classic film studies stuff perhaps?\n\nIt could help. Getting a vacation from the academic writing of your field. Seeing some variety could create excitement or energy towards writing.\n\nNon-academic writing would also help. Something with a low barrier of entry. Dream journal? Criticism? Popular science? Even if you just write for yourself without intent to publish, it will help with confidence and the fear of the blank page.",

One of the issues you can write about is your struggles with writing. You can write down all the feelings that come up and explore their meaning. This has helped me to also practice my logic skills.",
