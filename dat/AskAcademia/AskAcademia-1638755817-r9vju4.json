  "text": "I\u2019m currently a doctoral student in environmental health and have helped out a few investigators at different institutions with short-term assignments, such as reviewing a paper before submission or helping prepare a grant. I\u2019d like to do more work in that vein (flexible, short-term, remote)... are there any platforms for this sort of work? I also have a Masters of Public Health and experience in psychology, epidemiology and health policy so my scope is pretty broad.\nThanks!",

I have also found some consulting by looking at the \u201cother\u201d job type on LinkedIn. Best of luck to you! Consulting is great, but finding the right gig can be tough.",

Not quite something that I've found a filter for on these sites... \ud83d\ude44 \n(I've also dropped you a line by PM, OP. not sure if it fits, but let's see, if you're interested)",

I am looking specifically to meet/chat with people like yourself about possible remote short term project-based work where I need to bring on someone to help with, say, survey research/analysis. Your background sounds very relevant, plus I often get approached by clients in health-related spaces. Let me know if you\u2019d like to chat. Also happy to answer questions about this type of work.",
