  "title:": "What to expect when quitting a T32-funded postdoc position?",
  "text": "I'm 6 months into a postdoc position and I hate it. I won't go into a lot of detail but this is such a bad fit for me. My PI exhibits really controlling/condescending behavior that contributes to a toxic lab environment. The job description for the position doesn't match what I'm doing at all, and I'm not having an enjoyable or productive time here. I've already made up my mind to leave and started applying for jobs recently. I'm funded on a T32 with a payback obligation, so if I leave before 1 year is up then I'll have to payback the salary I've already made. Does anyone have experience quitting their postdoc in a situation like this? Is it a longer exit process than quitting a regular job that doesn't have a payback obligation? Did you get to pay in installments or was it just one sum?",

      "text": "Is your postdoc advisor also the PI of the T32 program? If not, talk to the PI(s) of the T32. On a training grant like that there should be a pool of advisors. A T32 is meant to support your training, so you are not beholden to a specific lab - that lab is not paying your salary, the NIH is. You could do something else and make the case that it better contributes to your training/career development as a scientist.",

I did have to pay back my moving allowance (\\~$2k) but it was worth it.\n\nDo you have any other positions lined up? Sometimes the contract can be upheld if you just switch PIs instead of quitting entirely. Talk to the HR in your institution to see if they can find you a different advisor. Also, if you are part of a postdoc union you should reach out to them. They will usually have all the knowledge and resources surrounding contracts.\n\nFinally --> your PI might be breaking contract agreements by having unreasonable exceptions and treating you poorly. Talk to your union rep if you have one.",

As long as you stay in a science job for the same number of months you were on the T32 the NIH will consider it as being paid back. They are usually flexible on what a science job is, it doesn't have to be another postdoc. You can contact the NIH institute that awarded the T32 to discuss your options.",

      "text": "I had a very similar situation. I was terrified of owing money and felt very trapped. I wound up taking a position in a different lab to finish up my T32 time. In retrospect, I should have taken a year off. The other lab was not as toxic, but it wasn't a good fit and I wasn't productive while I was there. I just didn't care about the project.\n\nOne suggestion, one bit of info. Talk to the T32 PI. The person running the grant has a vested interest in your success. They only have a couple of slots for a postdoc per year and if one of them flames out, it makes it harder to get renewed.\n\nThe info I got from my T32 PI was that the NIH wants you to stay in science. So you probably won't have to pay back the salary if you still use your degree.\n\nI also agree with the other comment about contacting the NIH program officer. That contact is really helpful. If you are interested in staying in academia, then it is also an opportunity to meet someone important to your future.",

They will contact you once a year to fill out the payback form and will need accurate dates to finalize the contract.",

          "text": "Not quite, although I agree it's twisted. When you accept T32 funding, there's an obligation to work in research for at least as long as you received funding in your first year. If you do the entire first year, you're obligated to do another entire year of research. **If you stop research any time before the second year is done, you're obligated to pay back the amount of salary you received that is the difference between your time spent in research in the second year, and your time spent in research in the first year. If OP takes a non-research job after six months, the T32 then stipulates that they have to pay back their salary for those six months. It's not like the LRP, in that the research doesn't have to be for a nonprofit or government org- it could really be any science-generating position. So while it's perverse to have stipulations requiring people who for the most part have made almost no money across their entire careers to date to pay their salary back if they don't go on to have the career NIH was intending by funding their T32 training, it's not typically that hard for most people to fulfill the requirement and not have to worry about payback. I think a large part of it is to avoid having MDs and people with other clinical degrees take T32 funding and then go on to do clinical work exclusively.\n\nMany people fulfill this requirement by taking the second year of T32 funding and don't really have to think about it.\n\n**ETA",

Often, they'll have a family member guarantee them who is on the hook if they don't.\n\nOf course, there are reasons for this. These scholarships exist to build capacities in the country; not to speed up brain drain by paying for the best and brightest to get an education only to stay abroad for better jobs. Still, it can be really tough on people.",
