  "text": "Hello everyone, I am a PhD student studying molecular biology. So far I love my program and everyone in my small lab. One thing I\u2019m really scared of but afraid to admit it, is in person conferences. I\u2019m fairly shy (although I hide it pretty well) and I have rarely if ever traveled outside of my hometown or college town. The idea of traveling, just me and my advisor, is terrifying. My advisor is a great guy, don\u2019t get me wrong. I just feel like a na\u00efve little girl with no real world experience and no idea what traveling for a conference really entails. Can someone please give me an idea of what this was like for you? Thank you all so much.",

      "text": "Everyone has a first time! Think of it as going to meet folks who are interested in the same things as you and who will become friends you keep long distance. Think of a few questions that are personal but formal to meet new folks with,  like \" what got you interested in this field/ research?\" Let people talk about themselves/research and don't pressure yourself to know everything. If your advisor is any good,  they will connect you with good people. Find an early career group. Mingle and go to the after conference activities, where the fun networking happens. Stay positive and wear good walking shoes, good god. I got bloody heels once. Lastly, pick one or two things you want to do/see each day and make time to rest. Conferences are fun and offer a wonderful way to visit a new place with new people!",

      "text": "Some tips:\n\n1. If you're flying you can usually carry your poster on the plane to put in carry-on. If you don't want to worry about carrying a poster on the plane, you can sometimes have it printed at the conference or from a local copy shop although this might be more expensive than your institution printshop.\n2. Review program and abstracts beforehand, ask your advisor if there are any mixers/events they suggest attending. This is your PI's opportunity to help you network by introducing you to other PIs/researchers in your field. Obviously this is important if you want to do a postdoc in the same field after you finish but also good for collaboration.\n3. I always try to book a hotel with included breakfast because I'm always running late. If it's a large conference, you'll usually see other attendees in the morning and it can be an easy opportunity to meet other people.\n4. I usually traveled on my own to conferences and just met my PI there, but if you feel comfortable traveling together you can ask about booking flights and see if he offers to coordinate. I would also ask if there are hotels your PI can recommend. These may be more expensive, but it's helpful to start a discussion in case there are considerations you should keep in mind when booking - for example, I thought the hotel I booked in Orlando was walking distance from the convention center but because of how streets and highways were laid out this was not the case and it was a bit inconvenient having to use rideshare every day.\n5. When using rideshare apps, message someone you trust when you're leaving and arriving for safety purposes - especially after evening networking events.\n6. Don't be scared to ask questions during the sessions. This is an indirect way of networking, always introduce yourself and what institution you're from before asking the question.\n7. Have contingency plans for weather, etc. At the same conference in Orlando I was the only one in my group to bring an umbrella... guess who got caught in a thunderstorm?\n8. If you have time and are able, volunteer to judge undergrad posters. Great way to learn how to present your poster efficiently and effectively and meet more people.\n9. Have fun!",

Now I'm more senior I realise that the feeling can be mutual about not wanting to travel together. It's not personal but I like being alone when I fly. It's fine if I end up going with someone else but I don't want to be lumbered with having to make small talk or a lot of work talk especially  if it's with someone who is uncomfortable being around \"their boss\".

Whenever I\u2019ve attended conferences I\u2019ve gone on my own or bumped into my advisor when I arrive - it\u2019s their chance to network and let their hair down too so you might not be going together. In my experience a lot of people go on their own so don\u2019t be afraid to go to dinner and sit next to someone new. You\u2019ll have lots to talk about (what presentation did you see, which group are you going to next etc). Look out for social events and make an effort to attend. As you are going to a new place find a quiet time in your schedule to look around the new city (go for a walk, visit the museum etc). No one goes to all the sessions so pace yourself.  I always look for exercise opportunities too - some conferences I go to have an aerobics class or meet for a run which is a fun way to make new contacts. Bring your gym kit if this is something you\u2019d enjoy.",

      "text": "I agree with all the great suggestions here so far. If your conference is more than a couple of days (or if you're able to add a day on either end), don't be afraid to identify a slow day or slow afternoon to do some local sight-seeing, even if it's just exploring a city centre. Even better if you can find one or two other junior academics to travel with you. I went to a conference in Budapest and my best times there were all outside the conference venues.\n\nBuild up the nerve to introduce yourself to someone who's work you're familiar with (this was absolutely terrifying for me the first time I did this). If your PI is also there then they can help a lot with this. Most talks are boring, so don't sweat missing a few (or many) sessions in order to have a coffee (or similar) with another attendee. Almost all of my research collaborations started with a casual chat while skipping a presentation.\n\nOne time I was literally stopped by someone who recognized me while I was sitting in a Subway (restaurant) just outside the main venue. That encounter led to a couple of papers and I got my faculty position at their institution. No pressure though ...",

      "text": "Not really an answer to your question, just a financial comment. If you are financially responsible with credit cards, then get yourself one with a signup bonus. The flight, hotel, and conference fees are easy ways to meet the minimum spending for a credit card and get yourself a paid-for trip so that you can travel outside of your hometown/college town. For example, the chase sapphire preferred has a 100k spending bonus for $4,000 of spending in 3 months. That's equal to at least $1,250 of travel credits. That's plenty of points for a handful of domestic flights and at least one international flight! Of course, you will need to have enough cash to pay it until the school reimburses you back (which can take 1-2 months after the conference is over). I personally did it during grad school, but COVID really destroyed my prime year for conferences. \n\nTo the real question, just enjoy yourself and eat a lot of free food, if they provide it (some do/some don't). Explore the city too. I believe you can get an earlier or later plane ticket to let you stay longer, but you will need to pay for the extra housing. My first conference was in DC and I went sightseeing every single day after the talks were over. Network and add people to LinkedIn to prepare for job search (something I regret not doing). Since you won't have a roommate, try to get a room within the hotel that the conference is in so that you don't have to travel alone at night to another hotel, and always call a family/friend to let them know if you are going out. Hang out with your PI if you want or don't if you don't want to. Some PIs are just there for the science while some party with other conference-goers like they're freshmen in college. This is also because conferences are the only time that collaborators from different universities get to hang out, so they go all out. Make new friends (then add them on Linkedin for the job search lol). \n\nJust enjoy yourself!!",

              "text": "There are a ton of youtube videos and blogs on this. Things to note \n\n1. Don't get into credit card debt. Only spend what you have the cash to pay off. \n2. A lot of travel credit cards or ones with good benefits have an annual fee (AF). Most AFs are worth it during the first year because of the huge signup bonus. If you don't want it after the first year, then downgrade the card to a no AF card rather than cancel it. You can hold no AF cards for as long as you want, without doing anything to do.\n3. Opening a credit card is a tiny factor in your overall credit card. Huge factors are\n   1. credit history \n   2. utilization rate (your monthly spending over your total credit line). The best rate is 1-10%. \n      1. Canceling a card will reduce your overall credit line and increase your utilization rate if you maintain the same monthly spending. This is why it is better to downgrade a card, which maintains the same credit line, rather than to cancel it.  \n   3. late payments  \n\nBecause grad students are paid so little, it is always good to get free things lol! I just did the math and $1,250 worth of points is \\~3.78% of my stipend. This is higher than my annual wage increase of 3% LOL. Good luck!!! Let me know if you have any questions!",

      "text": "As an introvert who is fairly shy, I empathize. The main actual risk with academic conferences is that they're exceedingly boring. Expect to spend hours in some hotel ballroom doing your best to stay awake through a presentation completely unrelated to anything you care about and savoring a glass of cucumber-infused tap water as your primary source of entertainment. No one will be judging you or even notice you. Conferences are primarily social events for people with resources/clout/funding to hobnob with each other. Students who actually do the research are just a mildly unpleasant side effect of the whole thing. Nothing much will be expected of you and, in return, you should expect very little from the experience. The best career move is actually to find some other bored grad students you like and convince them to play hooky and do something fun away from the conference during the morning sessions. That's how you actually build a network at these sort of things - but your supervisor may not be a fan and it can be hard to muster up the energy for such socializing.",

      "text": "A couple of ways to look at the fear: \n\n1: You\u2019ll blend right in. After the pandemic, you\u2019re going to be surrounded by many socially terrified introverts at conferences. Many people didn\u2019t get to leave their homes (\u2026 or studio apartments\u2026) at all until vaccines rolled out. Even those who weren\u2019t socially awkward beforehand have struggled since. \n\n2: Fear only tells you that you\u2019re doing something with the potential to be worthwhile. No risk, no reward. \n\nMy first research conference presentation was a speech. I needed to get on a plane, go stay with some students I\u2019d never met in a city I\u2019d never visited, and go talk to an audience alone about why my findings mattered. I was terrified: did my findings matter? But I rehearsed many times, and spoke with some of my mentors. One, who\u2019d become a scientist at a point when women really weren\u2019t doing it, told me to envision that I was simply putting on a mask. Another told me that I needed to remember that many attendees weren\u2019t actually going to care. \n\nSo I showed up, and I gave my talk. Even survived. Even enjoyed it. Got my first lesson in learning to care less. \n\nThat escalated to a point that came a few years ago. I was helping organize the first iteration of a new conference. One of our speakers came down sick the morning of, leaving us with an awkward schedule block we couldn\u2019t fill on the main stage. What did I do? Threw together a slideshow and 30-minute talk on a subject, quickly ran it by our panel, and after one single rehearsal, delivered it, under floodlights and all. \n\nWas it a great talk? I sure don\u2019t think so, but I never do. The important part was that my audience disagreed. \n\nI credit that performance to taking theatrical improv classes, years back. I strongly recommend them for also teaching me to improvise around life circumstances. \n\nAs for travel, having traveled extensively: \n\n1: Pack enough in your carryon that you won\u2019t be in trouble if checked luggage gets lost. Toothbrush/hairbrush, any medication, a change of conference-appropriate clothing, a phone charger, and hard copies of your itinerary, tickets, and any hotel/rental car receipts. When you\u2019re at the hotel, grab the travel-sized hotel shampoo, etc. Leave the bottles in your carryon for future trips. \n\n2: Allow plenty of extra time to connect to each leg of your trip. \n\n3: Check in with friends or family back home. \n\n4: If you wind up at a bar, it\u2019s fine to grab a drink and hold it, but I don\u2019t recommend actually drinking. Women are judged more harshly than men regardless, and you\u2019re likely enough to be around someone who isn\u2019t looking to spend a night alone. \n\n5: Email all of your materials to yourself before going. That way, if you need to reprint something, you have it in one easy, accessible spot. \n\nMost importantly, talk to anyone and everyone you meet. Listen more than you speak, and trade contact info. Enjoy your trip!",

I'm a natural introvert and while I'm perfectly happy travelling, giving presentations, not shy, I find drinks and nibbles type events absolutely exhausting and not in a good way so I don't do them now, or at least not much. I've played to my strengths to build my network, I follow up with people after meetings, I suggest coffee (I'm much better in small more intimate groups), I give talks and just generally get my name out there.\n\nAs for the conference, pace yourself. Do what you have to - so talks and poster - but don't try and do everything. Take time out if you need to (I watched a lot of NCIS at conference in Idaho because it all got a bit too much). If it's a big multi-stream conference take some time out to figure out the time table and the talks you want to go to. Try and have some fun.\n\nFor traveling, pack relatively light so you can carry your bag if need be. Lots of places now print posters on fabric so look into that because then you can fold them up and put in your suitcase. Don't forget your passport or travel ID! \n\nLastly, if you have a good relationship with your supervisor talk to him. Say you're feeling a little anxious (everyone is feeling a bit anxious right now so you're not alone, even if it's for a different reason) and see what he says.",

I find it's nice to set yourself little goals, like 'I want to meet one new person this morning', or whatever you're comfortable with. The networking, all said and done, is more important than taking notes and frantically running from talk to talk. And: many people will be in the same situation as you. \n\nI hope you enjoy your meeting.

      "text": "As someone who has been \"shy\" in the past, and who has been working for ten years, I would advise you to get over the shyness - *now*. It will only be a big detriment in what you do in the future, including vital networking and communication - either during your PhD and especially after, when you go into your career.\n\nIt can be unlearned, human interactions are all just practice. But shyness is something that *no one* will baby you or coddle you about, and you've got to learn to speak up for yourself and interact with others now, as this will hugely influence how confident, competent, and professional you come across as.",

          "text": "So shyness is not my issue. I am shy by nature but I did spend years learning to fake confidence. At this point I would rarely be described as shy by others. My problem is more to do with anxiety about travel and navigating larger cities then I\u2019m used to. I also appreciate all the advice on strategies for surviving conferences as an introvert (not to be confused with shyness) and general words of wisdom.",
