  "text": " It has come to my attention that some people upload their dissertations, theses and other non-peer reviewed work on Research gate. I've also seen that these get their own DOI number and also appear on google scholar. What is the deal with this? Is there any downside to uploading interesting research findings in this way?",

      "text": "My take is, for academics it's a convenient and widely recognised platform for promoting your work & publications, and sharing pre-print versions of papers.  However, it's also a money-making platform (for the owners) that benefits from your data and sale of advertising.  I use RG to promote work, share unpublished versions of papers etc.  However I also ensure these outputs are also available in my Uni's public repository which anyone can access without having to sign up to a proprietary platform.  \nYou can also check out the [Open Software Foundation](https://osf.io/) to share data, code, docs, project updates etc.  I'm less familiar with this, but you can get DOI codes for anything you upload, and it seems to be esp. popular among people working in STEM.",

I loved tracking my citations as well. But since last month they have hidden this function behind a paid subscription. Turns out  they are using some European countries to test this paywall....",
