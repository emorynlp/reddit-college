  "text": "I hope that this is okay to ask here...\n\nI've been an adjunct in history for the last ten years. Now my debt is about to be paid and I'm ready to stop being a janitor for 38 hours a week and an adjunct for 38 hours a week.\n\nI am moving back to the Old Country. As such, I have to give up some of my academic jobs. \n\nI seem to remember that there was a university, or a college, or something that had a long list of online jobs for academics.\n\nDoes that sound familiar to anyone? Or, even better, does anybody know where that would be?",
