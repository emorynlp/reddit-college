  "title:": "Discussing Stagnant PhD Stipends",
  "text": "I've been talking with my fellow PhD students recently about grad student pay, specifically why its viewed as normal to be so much less than minimum wage. We are at a supposedly top-tier Canadian research university in a city where the official poverty line is now >$28,000, roughly equal to full-time minimum wage, but our program's minimum stipends are $17,000 (which is actually LOWER than it was 5 years ago). Many of us don't get additional pay despite winning fellowships (I get 20k/year from external funds and not an extra cent from my lab), and because we're in a graduate-only program there are no classes to TA for extra money. We are only required to take 16 credits for the entire program so we are very much expected to be spending at least 40 hours / week in the lab. \n\nThere's a common sentiment that we are having to make greater and greater sacrifices to survive on these wages - cutting out meals, moving into seriously sub-standard housing, taking out loans. Part-time jobs are also forbidden by the program (students have been threatened with expulsion for taking jobs), and spending time on things other than our research feels like it will ruin our career chances. The burden also feels worse as the average time to graduate is >5 years, and will certainly be longer for us due to covid, meaning those of us who did [MSc](https://M.Sc)'s beforehand will be 30 with at least half a decade of lab experience, but will still be paid the same as new students almost a decade ago. With the rapidly increasing cost of living, lengthening degree durations, and awful career prospects for graduates, I believe the current stipend is unsustainable and unjustified.\n\nI brought these points up (as well as the fact that I've brought in over $80 000 in fellowships) with my PI and asked for a raise and he tentatively agreed, but he has brushed me off every time I've tried to bring it up the past few weeks and I'm getting increasingly agitated. I absolutely need him as a reference so I feel I have no leverage, as is the case for most students.   \n\n\nI'm curious how this compares with other students' situations as it seems like PhDs are better off in other countries, and the perspective of PIs as to whether low student stipends are still justified. If anyone has examples of successful campaigns to increase stipends, or relevant statistics or other readings, that would also be great. We don't have a student union but are currently recruiting as many students as we can to a Facebook group to share information and grievances, and hopefully organize some action in the future.",

      "text": "$17k--Canadian--No mandatory supplementary fund despite bringing in external money...the beautiful University of Toronto, if I'm guessing right.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nU of T is absolutely abhorrent with this, even when compared to UBC and McGill (where I did my master's). I have no concrete advice besides a lot of empathy and solidarity, but I do have a friend there now in STEM who was in a very similar position as you (brought in multiple external funds with little to no wage increase from his NSERC chair supervisor). He essentially played hard ball: made it clear he is going to stop taking on the countless side projects that only he could get done for his advisor, and also explictly mentioned how ridiculous the base stipend is + the amount of money he's brought in that essentially affords his advisor another grad student. He suggested concrete alternatives: teach his advisor's course for his remaining years and get paid additional lecturer salary; allow summers off for industry partnership positions; or, I want an explicit fund increase from the money that I brought in. He eventually got a mix of request 2 and 3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhether you can do this yourself or not obviously depends on a lot of things: your relationship to your supervisor, your vulnerability (are you an international student? domestic? etc), and the realistic alternatives you can propose (are you capable of teaching a class? do you have a relationship with an industry partner you can leverage?), but just a concrete example for you to work with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd last (this one takes the most work and most likely won't be realized in during your tenure), ORGANIZE!!! If there's no union, start reading, start talking, and get the ball rolling to stop this exploitation from happening, if not to you, for future generations to come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCanadian higher ed is so stingy, partially because of our limited funding sources, but also because I think Canadian academic culture is just lethargic and undriven in general. We moan about brain drain to the US, but do nothing concrete to attract and retain talent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll the best.",

It was disheartening and astounding to hear a postdoc in the department claim that \"postdoc wages aren't meant to be self-sufficient\" and go on about how we're trainees so we deserve to be paid less, the work is it's own reward, and how raising trainee salaries would \"ruin\" labs so we should all be willing to sacrifice for the greater good, etc. \n\nThen you have higher ups chiding us that \"if you're looking for money, you shouldn't be in science.\" Never mind that we're not asking for six figures or anything outrageous, just enough that we're not constantly living paycheck to paycheck and on the verge of crisis when something unexpected happens. \n\nI'm constantly bumping into these attitudes more and more when I bring up things like paying undergraduates, increasing funding for grad students and postdocs, etc and it's infuriating.",

The NIH moved proactively to give postdoc salaries a much needed bump by setting starting salaries (a little) over the proposed minimum so that postdocs could remain overtime exempt. Definitely hit grants hard. At least the NRSA sends extra $ to the institute to cover the increases issued. I think the admin supplements for grants helps *partially* with some of these changes, but it needs some work still.",

      "text": "I can only speak from an American perspective, but I am sure the Canadian academic situation has the same problem. A big obstacle is that NSF/NIH grants haven't really increased over time (in fact, the NIH modular grant has been $250,000 for over 2 decades, [giving you a 2021 purchasing power that is ~50% of your 2001 purchasing power](https://drugmonkey.scientopia.org/2018/05/11/the-purchasing-power-of-the-nih-grant-continues-to-erode/)). As a result, PIs have only a couple of options with respect to trainee salaries:\n\n1. Increase salaries but hire less trainees (decreasing scientific output)\n2. Increase salaries and obtain more grants \n3. Maintain salaries and try to survive while inflation chips away at everything else. \n\nUnfortunately, most PIs (by choice or, more often, by circumstance) choose option #3.\n\nWhat I have noticed is that many of the \"top\" institutions (by whatever metric you want to choose) have been slowly but surely increasing trainee salary (Columbia graduate students in STEM can make well over $40k if you include summer stipends) and providing subsidizing housing for their PhD students. I expect this to continue for those types of institutions while the \"other\" institutions get left behind. I think we can all agree this bifurcation of graduate education is not a good thing but it seems rather inevitable at this point. \n\nThe only options graduate students have is to *not* join institutions that do not pay their trainees a living wage, or to join a union. Unfortunately, I think there are limits to joining a union due to external funding difficulties.",

The NIH payscale sets the standard for postdoc pay, too. \n\nFor research scientists (\"techs\" and lab managers), the pay scales are determined by their title (i.e. research scientist I-IV), which is determined by a combination of degree(s) required and experience. To hire someone for such a position, we have to submit a detailed job description along with the proposed salary to HR to review before the job can be posted. Then we also have to submit information on our desired hire for HR to review and make sure they meet the standards for the position. Once hired, a person's salary increases slightly every year (2%?) independent of the PI's say-so and HR will alert to when someone's title needs to be adjusted (due to experience). Sure a PI can fire someone because they become \"too expensive\" but talented techs can be highly desirable despite that cost due to their skills. Same also applies to staff scientist positions.\n\nBeen dealing a lot with this lately myself at my university. May be different elsewhere, but PIs do not have a whole lot of free reign in setting salaries here.",

Our grad students do not get annual increase in their stipend. \nAnyway, my point is that PIs have no incentive to advocate for increased salaries. If I have 2 graduate students and I get double my funding, I will be looking to hire two more students at the same wage, rather than increase the wage of the existing ones (That's the mentality, correct or not).",

PIs only have as much money as the NIH will award them.\n\nEither: (1) Democrats need to drastically increase science funding in their campaigns for infrastructure, the Green New Deal, healthcare reform, etc. or (2) universities accept other sources of funding for tenure decisions.\n\n(1) is outside the control of individual universities or professors, and (2) will probably politicize science.\n\nUntil then, students should not enter PhD programs that do not pay a living wage. Science isn't worth poverty. I had to take lower ranked PhD and postdoc acceptances with better funding because I wanted to eat. Others should do the same. Doctoral and postdoctoral training are not financial investments! Academia is fun but probably a lifelong financial net negative.

Second, and while this may not apply in your specific case, consider that at many US state-supported universities, faculty and staff salaries have remained stagnant for years (and you can infer from there how graduate student stipend increase requests may be perceived). Finally, along the lines of another commenter, your tuition as a STEM student should be covered and so when you add the cost of tuition to your stipend, that $ amount can be quite substantial. Your stipend also comes with lots of other overhead costs that you or your PI don't see per se, but someone has to pay for it.\n\nI'm not saying any of this is right, but some things to keep in mind. One big way a PI can offset some graduate student expenses is to pay in full for their attendance at conferences, etc. While students should be seeking funding for such opportunities, often these opportunities are limited and only cover some costs. I think it's pretty shitty when PIs expect their graduate students to pay their own way to attend and present at major conferences in their field.",

We have to budget approximately $65,000 per year for that student: $34,200 of that is stipend and the rest is benefits and then \"tuition and fees\" charged by the university. Charging tuition is complete bullshit once a student has completed their coursework. After that it's just the university milking money from labs for as long as they are training a graduate student. Fees I can understand, as in our case that supports the library, public transit passes, gym, and other resources that all students can use and benefit from. \n\n>I think it's pretty shitty when PIs expect their graduate students to pay their own way to attend and present at major conferences in their field.\n\nNah, that's bullshit. I think within reason they need to be supported. Within reason being a major conference in their field, not a niche conference held at an expensive location.",

All of the Canadian PIs I know would love to be able to provide more funding for their students, but it's a very tight budget.\n\nNone of this is acceptable, nor justifies your treatment; but realistically, short of a massive federal funding injection, the only way this changes is for the bubble to pop by grad students refusing to accept the Ponzi scheme that is academia. I hope you're not left holding the bag. Good luck, and defend ASAP.",

Graduate students should, in fact, be classified as workers. They contribute to the university's research output and perform labor for the laboratory. Sure, post docs and PIs should be paid more than a grad student, because they have more training, but a graduate student STILL DESERVES A LIVING STIPEND.\n\nAlso no matter your situation, no matter what career path you choose, no matter where you live, every single individual in this country that produces labor deserves to be paid a living wage. To argue that in some cases, people deserve to be paid less than what is needed to live is harmful to the community and thus harmful to your own interests.",

But that's untaxed and is actually slightly higher than the UK minimum wage (min wage will get you about \u00a317.1k I think with a 40hr/wk job, on the high end, but that's before tax - after tax it's about \u00a315.3k).\n\nIt's liveable, but not easy by any stretch. Thankfully UK universities seem to be okay with allowing part-time work alongside the PhD. I think our university officially allows up to 16hr/wk alongside the PhD, as long as it doesn't detract from it. I'm considering doing something part-time alongside it, but I don't think I/we should have to - we should be paid more. \u00a316k as the supposed peak and gold standard for funding isn't great - it's at the very low end of an entry-level graduate job salary. For instance, a \u00a316k stipend is about equivalent to an \u00a318k job after tax. Entry-level graduate journalist jobs (journalism is a notoriously poorly-paid field) begin anywhere between \u00a318k and \u00a322k, with most starting at about \u00a319-19.5k (if I remember correctly - I was in the industry for a while).\n\nSo, the most prestigious stipend for humanities students in the UK nets you the same take home pay as the worst-paid entry-level graduate job in a notoriously badly-paid industry. Go figure.\n\n\\[edit\\]\n\nThere are probably some scholarships for individual universities that pay better than the \u00a316k from the AHRC. But the AHRC is the one everyone wants, and the \u00a316k is, on average, considered on the higher end of stipends. But, there will be exceptions that pay more at certain universities (especially in expensive places).",

We had dictated salaries at our school and were making $17k. Some of us pointed out that our grants were paying $40k-60k per grad student and the university was keeping like 70% of it, which is borderline fraudulent. So eventually we switched to a hybird and some people's pay went up, while other's stayed the same. :/ \n\nThat said, pushing our department and university to make changes did help. We held a department wide meeting where we compared our salaries to other schools and basically shamed the professors for insisting our pay was OK (it was nearly dead last in our field in the US). We also tried to unionize and hung poster's with the university president's face calling him a union buster. The union failed, but we all got pay bumps. I feel like this was more of an accomplishment than my actual academic work, lol.",

This still amounts to \\~30k \u20ac (\\~45k CAD) per year before tax/social insurance. So, luckily, fairly decent for PhD. In Austria we have very strong unions (in this case, not only for students, but for all university employees), which is why these collective agreements are possible. I don't know the situation in Canada, but I guess that similar agreements via unions (for university of public sector in general) would be ideal.",

In my university (public R1 in the southeast US) the standardized stipend for Microbiology PhD students is $18,000 USD a year minus $2,400 a year in required fees that are not covered under our tuition waiver, so basically $15,600 a year salary. I helped write a $500,000 grant but it still did not change my stipend.\n\n2 years ago the program had a vote for a new graduate program chair. Two finalists gave presentations on how they saw the program moving forward and specifically how they would prioritize future funding. One professor said they would use the money to buy more equipment while the other said they would prioritize increasing grad student stipends both to provide a living wage and to be more competitive for top applicants. The tenured professors voted and guess who won? Professor A who wanted to use money on equipment in a landslide. It was clearly about this one issue as professor B had been in the program longer (25+ years), is loved by the grad students (is on basically ever PhD committee I know of) and about a year later was chosen for a senior administrative role for the grant funding program for the entire college after securing a $8 million grant.\n\nOh yeah and our graduate student association tried to unionize but was blocked by the not just the university but the actual state because we are technically not employees and therefore have no rights to unionize.",

Grants also maybe be available to the grad students themselves.  However, this is not true (or is much rarer) in many non-STEM fields.  When I was a grad student, TAs/RAs were unionized, and our stipends were low.  Why?  The stipends were constant across disciplines as part of the negotiated union contract, which meant my STEM field stipend was the same as that of a non-STEM stipend in disciplines without outside grants.  Unions may cause wage compression, and they may not lead to high STEM grad students stipends if, for example, the university can't afford to subsidize those non-STEM departments that don't get grants.",

So, they would either need to dig into their personal research funds - and faculty typically don't have that kind of free money floating around, so it could even come out of their own pocket (and, let's face it, they won't pay you out of their own pocket) - or else apply for new grant funding, but that process could easily take a year or more even if successful.",

Consider that PIs are managing many students, resources, costs and budgets, income flows, and projects\u2014the research enterprise is very much like running a small to medium-sized business and it is something most PIs are not trained in specifically (most are interested in their field, not management). So, although I agree with you that good performers should get raises (especially after a long period like you describe), also remember that the whole thing (everyone\u2019s job and all the lab resources) are often literally held together by a shoestring and the overall funding structure may be fragile. My perspective is also coming from the US side, where many PIs have to contend with the additional cost of paying for the tuition of our graduate students as well.",

Grad students often make less than half of minimum wage, and they aren't even afforded the protections of normal workers. Drop out (or graduate) and can't find a job? Good luck getting unemployment. Not to mention the schools fraudulently claim they are only 'part time' when we all know it's a lie. Most of the time we're actually forbidden from having external employment.\n\n>If you really want your mind blown look at how much you would make at your first TT track faculty appointment after your PhD and 5 yrs of a post doc\n\nDon't worry, I'm very aware academia is a morally bankrupt institution. I would add though, that even adjunct faculty are paid a wage which while may be low compared to a tenured faculty, are certainly not impoverishing. I've never seen one below the median income for the county (granted, Ive never looked in CA or NY). Also, they get normal benefits, healthcare, 401ks etc.",

My mouse costs alone are about 5K per month.  If you get an F30 this is , say 4-5K per year.  Which most people dont\u2019 have.  And I spend more in 70% ethanol than that per year.  If I have a TA, they either have a higher stipend to account for this or they do it for extra.  And it is also part of the training becasue if you want to teach you have to learn how to do that also and how to run a class.\n\nThe grunt work you do, like writing an animal protocol and ordering stuff and entering stuff into databases is part of how you run a lab.  And part of the training.\n\nBut let me know how you think you bring in an order o magnitude more value than the 70k it costs me just to let you walk in the door.  The 700K student. Lol",

Also, you quote $70k but the grad student is barely seeing 1/3 of that if they\u2019re lucky. The majority goes to other places - the university, overhead, management, etc. - and yet you resent the student laborer. Why?

The whole point of this post was to bring up the fact that minimum stipend have not changed while everything around has. \n\nIt's not about having a \"crappy\" pay it's about having the minimum to live decently to pursue our research without doing a burn out.\n\nI would suggest you to take some perspective on what people live outside of your bubble.",

He often said things like this, and that young students were \"useless,\" but he himself could only code in Fortran and had no idea who was actually effective or working in the lab. Some of his projects were disasters. Shocker, when we improved wages and brought in someone to actually manage his \"useless\" students a ton of stuff got done and things began to work.",

That is completely irrelevant.  If you want to say the faculty should have to meet metrics than wait till you see the number of grants you need to have the number of committees and the number of this and that.  \n\nThe question is ,  is getting a stipend during an education the same thing as a wage (in the US it is not, and also not anywhere else I lived) and should you be getting the equivalent to a wage.  So if you left with a BA and no actual lab experience you are looking at 30-40K a year.  I typically train them to do set things and they do the set hours, with a probationary period.  If they aren\u2019t really up to snuff within that period we often dont keep them.  They don\u2019t get conferences, seminars, or real menotoring typically (although I do, a good lab tech is really enormous value) and they have little autonomy and no choice of tasks projects or direction.\n\nThat is about what a grad student stipend is, or what you see, albeit in my grant you cost me more becasue I am also paying your tuition.  So your stipend is about what you would be making on the open market.  OR roughtly about double",
