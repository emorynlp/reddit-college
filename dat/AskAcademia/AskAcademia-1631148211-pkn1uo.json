  "title:": "What happens if you drop out of PhD while supported by T32?",
  "text": "So I am currently supported on an NIH T32 training grant and am considering dropping out of my program. I'm starting to feel like the PhD is just not for me and I dont want to go through another 3 years. Perhaps this feeling will pass but I am seriously considering mastering out. I've heard that I will need to payback all of the money I was given under the T32 if I drop out. Is this true? I know the answer is probably in whatever I signed when I was taken on but it was an extremely rushed process and I didn't even know half of the details of the training grant until half way through. I also cant find the document that I signed that has this info. Does anyone here happen to know about this? Thank you for your help.\n\nEdit: I was able to confidentially speak with the graduate student advisor about my desire to leave the lab and the situation. He thankfully spoke with the department for me and informed me that predocs are not required to pay anything back and there is no commitment. So I don't have to worry about this at all! \nThank you to everyone for your input and advice! I can now make my decision without worrying about money. :)",

The way I understood it is that during grad school you don't have to pay anything back, just post-grad (although they haven't come for me yet!). I've known people to leave a T32 in grad school and didn't have to do anything outside a survey. \nBut talk to your program, someone should definitely know!",

If anything, it just affects the grad program when they are up for renewal because their retention numbers will decrease.\n\nWhile in grad school, none of the students I have seen drop out while supported by a T32 seem super stressed out about money. I have also not heard about a student delaying their dropout plans because money or payback is involved. \n\nHope you get a definitive answer!",
