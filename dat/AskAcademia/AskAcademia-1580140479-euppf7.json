  "text": "I am a PhD student and about to graduate. I am putting my last remaining efforts to finish it. I am kind of a 'victim' of PhD that end up with disastrous mental and psychological effects. My dream turned out to be a nightmare for the last two years (I was very good during the first years of my PhD). I have decided to take a break like a year to recover by some psychological treatment after PhD. Right now, I quit looking for jobs or anything. Do you think it causes huge difficulty to go back to academia/industry?",

      "text": "I took a year long break from research after my PhD. While I didn\u2019t seek professional help, I did take some seasonal winery manual labor jobs and became friends with a lot of people outside of academia. I traveled a lot, visited family, and towards the second half of the year, took some time to prepare my resume, find good job board sites for my field, and make a list of relevant companies I might want to work for. \n\nWhen I did begin job hunting (industry biotech jobs), I discovered I was still in high demand and I landed my next job after about ~2 months of serious job hunting. \n\nI have no regrets about taking the time off to recover. Some things to consider:\n\n1. Can you afford to not work at all? If you need to work, jobs that have significant distance from academia could be a good break.\n\n2. What will your story be? When I started interviewing for jobs, if it came up (or if I mentioned it in my cover letter), I talked about wanting to take time to travel and work with more robust microbes. I also brought reading papers in my field on a topic that was commonly sought after in my industry. \n\n3. Is your skill set in high demand? You can look around job postings to see what employers in your field are looking for. This will help you estimate how long your job hunt might take.\n\n4. It doesn\u2019t need to be a whole year (unless you are applying to jobs that only come in cycles). You can start with 3 months and see how you feel after that. Tag on another three months of you need more time. Repeat, etc.\n\nTake the time if you want it. All of the PhDs (industry and academia) I have spoken to have understood taking time away from research after finishing. We all understand that it can be a really really difficult time to get through, and it is completely understandable to take recovery time afterwards. \n\nBest of luck!",

              "text": "Generally, synthetic biology (cloning, genome editing) and metabolic engineering in yeast. Many large pharmaceutical and chemical companies have branches working on engineering yeast and other microbes and fungi to produce useful compounds. There are also quite a few smaller biotech companies doing similar work. \n\nI also had a small amount of experience with data analysis in R and Python, which seemed to be a bonus for the companies I was applying for, though that wasn\u2019t my main draw. \n\nI did a three month industrial internship during my PhD which definitely helped my job hunt significantly. Companies like to see that you already have industry experience. \n\nIn my interviews, things I remember them liking about me, in no particular order:\n\n- understanding the different incentives and goals in industry versus academia\n\n-  anticipating challenges and solutions for adapting low throughout lab protocols to higher throughput protocols run by robots\n\n- experience managing undergraduates \n\n- experience teaching myself new skills \n\n- experience with large scale industrial fermentation from my winery work \n\n- clear and concise explanations of my research \n\n\nSkills that I saw in job postings and wished I was better at/had more experience in:\n\n- Bioinformatics and programming \n\n- illumina sequencing. Preparation of samples and analysis of results.\n\n- Assay development.\n\n- Experience with engineering other organisms (other types of yeast, bacteria, filamentous fungi)\n\n- High throughput experimental design and strategies \n\n\n\nWhich of these are most important to you depends on the type of job you want. I would recommend looking at job postings and keep track of the desired skills listed in the ones that you are most interested in. \n\nI also strongly recommend making friends with your cohort and the older student and postdocs and stay in touch! It\u2019s a small world and you can help each other out with recommendations and advertising job openings. \n\nAlso, every interviewer asked why I wanted to go to industry versus academia, so have your answer ready. For me,  I prefer teamwork to the more solitary work of an academic, I like having an actual product to deliver beyond a paper, and I want to feel like my work is making the world better. I\u2019m sure you have your own reasons as well. \n\n\nFinally, I found the AskAManager website incredibly helpful for prepping my resume and cover letter, practicing interview questions, and writing interview thank you notes. \n\nI rambled a bit, so feel free to ask more questions.",

              "text": "For me personally, my parents took me wine tasting to celebrate finishing my PhD (I did my PhD in California, so wine country is never very far away). I ended up chatting with the cellar workers at one of the wineries and it came up that my research involved yeast and I didn\u2019t have a job yet. So they invited me to apply for a harvest position starting the next month. One of my coworkers there connected me with another winery in New Zealand, so I had her recommendation when I got a job there.\n\nHowever, I did glean some advice about applying the more traditional way. If you google winejobs.com, you can find a lot of seasonal postings there, I believe worldwide. The Traveling Winemakers Facebook group also often has job postings. Bigger wineries are usually easier to get without a lot of experience. For example, Indevin in New Zealand, or Yellowtail in Australia. I learned a lot more about wine at the small winery I worked at in California though versus the big winery I worked at in New Zealand. \n\nFor visa, if you are younger than 30 both New Zealand and Australia (and Canada) offer a 12 month working holiday visa. New Zealand has a lot of seasonal jobs for tourism, wineries, etc. Australia pays better I\u2019ve heard, though I haven\u2019t been there. \n\nFor what you are looking for, I would recommend getting a working holiday visa and going there. You can get jobs once you are in the country too, and there will be a lot of other working holiday visa holders that can help you with job leads. It\u2019s still worth applying for jobs before you go, but often it\u2019s easier to get hired once you are local.",

You aren\u2019t graded alone but against others.\n\nThe other reason is that when I hire you to work in my group I am betting my money on you. Just because the stakes are lower than in academia (I.e. if a prof doesn\u2019t make tenure it\u2019s gg. If I underperform I just don\u2019t get promoted but I do keep my current job with no major downgrades) doesn\u2019t mean I am not betting my reputation as PI who can get stuff done well on your work. So we don\u2019t want people who can\u2019t perform. And yes that may be an unfair judgement. And that sucks. But I get like 4 pages and an hour or so to judge if I want to spend 2080 hours per year with someone so snap judgements happen. \n\nThere is one huge caveat and it has to do with length of break. If you take a 3 month break I don\u2019t care. Have fun. We all have family etc and want to spend time with them. 3 months is a job search so whatever. \n\nIf you take 6 months I\u2019ll be curious why. Any reasonable answer will do. Family member had surgery and you took care of them. You tried something new (tutoring, consulting, volunteering, your own business, etc). I just need a good reason that isn\u2019t \u201ci wanted to wear sweatpants and watch Netflix for 180 days\u201d \n\nIf you take a year you need a good reason. One person I interviewed had an 18 month break (with stuff like adjunct prof for a class). It turns out they went through a divorce with a special needs kid and needed to spend time with the kid. After that I didn\u2019t care since the break didn\u2019t reflect on their work ethic or anything. And what it said about their personality was good, not bad. \n\nIf you take more than a year it\u2019s bad. You get like 80 odd years on this planet at most and you needed a whole one to not be productive? You don\u2019t sound like someone I want to work with. You need a damn good reason (e.g. see the example above with the special needs child). And again, you cannot do something unproductive. \n\nSo take 3 months off. Search for jobs as you do so that it doesn\u2019t turn into 6 or 9 months. And enjoy yourself. Just don\u2019t take a year.",
