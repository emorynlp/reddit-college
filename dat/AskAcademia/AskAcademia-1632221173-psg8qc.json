  "text": "** TLDR; grad student working as part of project trying to stay informed when there is currently no structured meetings/updates. Is it reasonable to voice this concern? If so, how? ** \n\nI\u2019m a PhD student in CS in the UK. Last year, several new students and I were admitted to a program for our PI\u2019s fellowship project. For the past year we\u2019ve almost had no joint meetings as a group (ie with the PI and postdocs) except for when presenting to external committees about the project progress. Our cohort tried to keep in touch informally as best as we could remotely.\n\nI understand that for junior researchers like us who are still early in our degrees, it may be best to focus on our own research. Still, given that we\u2019re meant to contribute to the same project, I would appreciate knowing a bit more about the work in the rest of the group, rather than hearing about datasets or experiments without context and just being expected to know about it. It also doesn\u2019t help that we\u2019ve been, and will seem to be, fully remote.\n\nI\u2019ve reached out for 1-to-1 chats with more senior members but can\u2019t help but think it\u2019d be more effective to have everyone on the same page if we had a weekly \u201cstandup\u201d of sorts, even if it\u2019s just for 5 minutes. This seems to be what some other labs in our institute is doing too. \n\nThat said, I know my PI is already very busy and I don\u2019t want to be out of line in suggesting changes like this. \n\nHow would you suggest I deal with this situation? Or is it more realistic for me to stay put and try to fill in the gaps with adhoc meetings etc? \n\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for your advice! I think I\u2019ll try to raise this with my PI positively and offer to organize (only if it seems appropriate of course). Really appreciate your sharing your experience and suggestions in the comments.",

      "text": "When I was working on my PhD, we had a fair amount of collab projects and I was in a similar boat. I just straight up asked for a single, regular meeting where we could update data, make next step plans and ask clarifying questions. It actually ended up saving a bunch of time having all the adultier adults and the research children in one meeting, because stupid choices could be caught early and there where no duplicate meetings :)",

      "text": "I think it's not rude or out of line to ask about it with your PI, especially if you offer to take on the role of organizing (finding times, booking rooms, setting up zoom meetings). I personally found that lab meetings were one of the most valuable parts of my grad school experience because it taught me how to present and defend my ideas and how to think critically about others' research. \n\nIf he's too busy or not receptive, another approach to take is just to set up your own meeting and inviting your cohort and anyone from the lab to join. You may not get everyone to join, but you don't really need everyone to have a productive space to talk about research. And as your cohort becomes more senior in the group, it can help develop a culture.",

      "text": "Postdoc here. I\u2019m thinking about the same thing. Our group used to have a group meeting where ppl share progress regularly. Then in mid-2020 there might be either people complaining about this meeting takes time away or there\u2019s a issue that two people stepped on each other\u2019s toes in research the meeting just got canceled. \n\nThe consequence is that I don\u2019t see other post docs and PhD students for months and months. Then being surprised by \u201cwhat \u2026.you can do this too? I should\u2019ve talked to you half an year ago\u201d. \n\nI talked to my advisers directly about this but they did not give a positive answer. :/  I\u2019m thinking about organizing the younger people together literally last week. Thanks for OP putting a reminder on me :)  \n\nLike someone says earlier, this could be a \u2018culture\u2019. In my previous group this culture exists for years so everyone\u2019s mindset is \u2018group meeting will have lots of discussions from ppl from different backgrounds and be sure to ask a question myself too\u2019.",

Speaking from personal experience, how your PI (aka \"manager\") will react depends entirely on their personality. \n\nA good manager will recognize that this is a valuable suggestion, and will either organize the meetings or give you the green light to do so. An insecure manager will feel that their authority is being threatened and react poorly.\n\n> Is it reasonable to voice this concern?\n\nInstead of voicing it as a \"concern,\" i.e. a negative, come up with a positive framing, e.g. \"opportunity to learn from each other.\"\n\nIndependent of structured meetings, you can and should also get to know other researchers through informal coffee, get togethers, etc.\n\nIn the long run, who you know is more important than what you know.",

My students always asked for it and I always said I'd be happy to if they organised. It never really worked until the pandemic to be honest. There was something about a schedule call on Teams, not seeing people irl, that just got us in the rhythm of meeting every week. If you think this would be useful offer to organise something, and make it effortless for your supervisor.",
