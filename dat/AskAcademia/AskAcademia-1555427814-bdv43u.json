  "title:": "Dressing as a woman in academia",
  "text": "I'm sure this has been discussed a dozen times because I know I've read at least a dozen blog posts and newspaper articles about it. I'm hoping you'll all indulge another discussion on what is expected for women to wear in academia. \n\nI am not feminine. Hetero and cis, but far from feminine. So all the advice that says \"wearing makeup, donning heels, and dressing up will make you feel more confident\" just falls flat. It isn't true for me. I've tried. I am my most confident in jeans and a t-shirt. I'll dress nicer for conferences but only because I know it's expected. Once my talk is over, I'll sneak back to my room to change again. \n\nI typically wear jeans (no rips, appropriate length) and a t-shirt (usually print but nothing inappropriate. Today I'm wearing a black band shirt). Sometimes if I haven't had time to do laundry, or if I have a meeting, I'll wear a blouse. Between my masters and PhD I worked a job that required a suit every day. I was miserable and my productivity tanked.\n\nI've taught undergrads for about 7 years (masters + phd). In that time I've only received one student evaluation that mentioned my clothes. \"I don't like her work-dress attire.\" That was in my first year teaching. I've never struggled to manage my students. They treat me with respect and I carry a level of authority that is appropriate in the classroom. I have excellent course evaluations (~3.9 on 4 pt. scale) while maintaining good averages (mid to upper 70s) and a normal bell curve. If clothing has negatively impacted my teaching, it has not been detected by any reasonable metric.\n\nI see male professors wearing ripped jeans and t-shirts while female professors are usually in nice skirts and blouses. I'm going to have a VAP position next year at my undergrad alma mater. I'm very excited because I really enjoyed it there. I've heard through a few friends that they will be doing a faculty search next year and I plan to apply if it's for my sub-field.\n\nWhile I was there, my (female) mentor was also a jeans and t-shirt kind of person. Most of the women dressed more formally, but she dressed similarly to me. I want to improve my chances for the permanent position, but I also don't plan on dressing up long term in my career. I just can't do it. I will honestly accept the financial consequences of not being feminine because comfort and feeling like myself is more important. But what about this VAP year?  Should I dress up for this year in the hopes it improves my chances? Or would it be better to show them how I would normally dress if I stayed?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the replies! I've just come back from lecture and did not expect so many. I'm reading through them now. Thank you all.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you all for your comments. I mentioned below but should probably include in my post: the main reason formal clothes are uncomfortable is that I have a skin disease that causes boils in my armpits and groin. If formal clothes are loose and baggy, they look awful. Jeans and t-shirts look OK if they're a little bigger. So jeans and t-shirts are less likely to aggravate my skin. That's the main killer of productivity, the pain and anxiety. \n\nI've decided to buy some new t-shirts that are solid color and look more formal. I'm also going to buy some black jeans, see if I can't find some nice shoes, and try out a blazer. I'm also going to keep a nicer jacket in my office for unexpected meetings. I'll test out my new wardrobe with my summer class before I start the new job.  Thanks again everyone!",

          "text": "Seconding this, even if you only wear it in the halls, and then take it off at the beginning of class (I get really sweaty when I teach, so this is what I do when I wear one). It's a good medium. This was my strategy for the first year I was full time at my university, and I actually had multiple students write me little \"p.s.'s\" on their end of term feedback letters saying that I was \"a really cool dresser,\" which I thought was funny, off topic, not the point, etc, but maybe better than the inverse.  \n\n\nI've gotten some good blazers from the local goodwill that have more of a vintage vibe, and which I like more with my semi-grungy-but-clean aesthetic. I've found it's often cheaper to get a men's jacket tailored than to find a women's jacket that I really like.  \n\n\nTHAT BEING SAID--I don't think it's ever worth it to wear what to you feels like a costume to perform for others. If a blazer feels uncomfortable and performative to you, don't do it. Own your self image. Wear what makes you feel the most confident and powerful. If that's more comfort based, I would say that you should assume its not a problem unless you have a very specific reason to think otherwise. I think that *one* student was probably just a pill and looking for things to gripe about.",

Some of my favorite shirts have worn-through holes in the shoulders now, but no one can tell if I leave my blazer on.  \n\n\nIt's amazing how much a tucked in shirt under a blazer can take you from \"I wear this to paint walls\" to \"I own this room\" with minimal effort.  \n\n\nIf you work in a warmer climate, look at thrift stores for a good vest--a vest over an informal tee often has all the fanciness of a blazer without the hot sleeves.",

      "text": "I think there are a lot of different things here to unpack here. \n\n1- Feminine - You don't need to dress feminine. Not today, not ever.\n\n2- Dressing up - I am pretty sure you don't need to do that either. Apart from conferences and important meetings, almost everyone can get away with not dressing formal in academia.\n\n3- How much effort one should put into clothing - I think that's the issue that is more at the center of this. You don't see yourself adopting a formal attire, but you are concerned about the feedback you've gotten, and is willing to compromise to have better chances during your VAP year. \n\nWhat I would say to that is, there are lots of ways in which someone can dress better, while remaining comfortable and informal. If you are willing to change something during this year, go for what you feel comfortable with, but go for it. \n\nUsing clothes that fit you well and that are well taken care of can go a long way! You know what I mean? It is the difference between wearing those old worn sneakers, and having a nice one that is comfortable, clean and looks new. Making sure your clothes are always washed, soft and stain-free. That your jeans fit you well. Wearing a nice cashmere jumper, instead of a hoodie (in this case, the cashmere jumper is even the more comfortable option).\n\nIt sucks that these things matter, but they sometimes do. I think you need some calculation between your level of comfort, the amount of effort you want to put into it, and how important this opportunity is for you.",

I've been told by past employers that I couldn't do what the guys do, or should be more feminine so it's a bit of a sore spot for me and I may be more sensitive to it than is justified (former PI told me I should spend my bonus on a \"makeover\" so I scheduled a meeting with him to make sure there wasn't a problem with the suits I was wearing. He couldn't adequately explain why I should get a makeover and suggested I talk to his wife to get advice for being more feminine. So yeah...\n\n>Using clothes that fit you well and that are well taken care of can go a long way!\n\nThis is a bit of a problematic area for me. Well taken care of isn't an issue, but I can't actually wear clothes that fit me well. I have to wear clothes that are a bit big on me because I have a skin disease that is irritated by close fitting clothes. Anything that isn't 1-2 sizes too big tends to lead to substantial pain. It's honestly part of why I like jeans and t-shirts so much. They're the least likely to aggravate my skin.\n\nThanks again for your feedback.",

I sympathize with your issue and am sorry to hear that you experience pain on a daily basis as a result of a skin condition, that can't be fun for anyone. But I don't think fitting well always has to mean fitting tightly, and I don't think the person you responded to would always equate fitting tightly with fitting well. I think it just means having clothing that suits your body shape. For example a blazer can be loose in general, but if the shoulders are super wide and too many inches beyond your shoulder, then it's going to look odd. Similarly, I think flowy shirts that are loose but that are designed to suit your body type, are better than tight shirts that are tight in the wrong places. What I'm saying in a really convoluted way is that things don't have to be tight to be well-fitting.",

Skater dresses often come in cottony, tshirt-esque fabric which sounds like it wouldn't set off your sensory issues (I've got dyspraxia so I know the struggle!), and they don't cling to your armpits or groin at all which sounds positive for your skin condition.

In my department, there are people who dress at all different levels of formality and it still works (though I think people would react equally strangely if I wore a nice dress or suit as they would if I wore sweat pants).\n\nI am the same way as you and, while I never style my hair or wear a single bit of makeup (even for interviews), I do dress up more than my male peers. I feel inclined to do so because of my age (30 year old lecturer) combined with being a woman in STEM.  However, dressing up for me does not involve skirts or heels. On teaching days, I often wear a pair of ankle pants in black or navy with a button up shirt and a pair of oxfords. For me, this is comfortable, I don't have to think about it as I get dressed, and I am dressed slightly nicer than my students (helping me look less like one of them). Just to throw in there, I often wear hiking pants or jeans with a t-shirt as well, especially when the weather is gross, but I wouldn't wear that for a day with big, important meetings or on teaching days near the beginning of a semester.",

      "text": "Like the other comments, I think staying comfortable and confident is more important than preconceived notions of formality. However, if you want to seem professional and be comfortable, I have a few tips. \n\nI suggest you wear darker tone pants, like black or a dark denim wash and t-shirts without symbols or brands. A clean gray t-shirt with black pants would seem much more formal than a band t-shirt with light colored jeans. Also I think shoes are very important in dressing up an outfit. What shoes do you typically wear? If you can muster wearing something like a loafer flat, you'd immediately look more dressed up. For example, I'll wear a striped black and white t-shirt, black pants, and my black loafers. It looks pretty nice, but truly is comfortable.

I have freakishly wide feet. I wear men's size 7, 4E and that's honestly not even wide enough. I've just never found a 6E in stores to try on. They're expensive so I haven't bought any yet. Anyway, long story short, the only shoes that don't make my feet go numb from tightness is New Balance. I always go with the solid color versions, but they are still tennis shoes. I haven't been able to find large enough dress shoes yet.",

It's possible that not wearing a twin set and earrings is non-conformist in a way that will work against you, but then again, you are gender-non-conforming in ways that transcend clothing to your core so this probably isn't a type of conformity that can be achieved through a cardigan. So, the question is how can you accept yourself and not apologise for it, and concentrate on tangible and quantifiable ways you can accelerate your career? Academic worth is usually judged on publications and grants, and the former is more important as a VAP, so I say dress in whatever way makes you want to write.",

In my day to day that is my \"uniform\" one can say. I wear  rock band tshirts or plain-color ones. I am a phd student and sometimes I am a guest teacher for undergrad students at the university, and because of that I have received some comments about \"may be look a bit more formal\" so I don't look like a student myself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n I have always wondered how I can keep my style without falling into the \"extreme makeover\" side of things. It was until my recent research stay in France that I started noticing how french girls are elegant and feminine without being \"too girly\", in fact I've found their style very simple and functional. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne french friend told me that the key aspect for that style is to know what to shop. Unfortunately for me I am always searching for a good bargain which in the long run affects my style because sometimes clothes are not of a good quality or not form-fitting and so I end up looking weird (this last part affected me mostly when wearing jeans). \n\nI started changing my way of shopping and started asking for help whenever I go to a clothes store. I am a tall girl so all my life I have struggled to find the right sizes, so I was used to just buy the same things in different colors. Now I know that people working at the store may be helpful finding the right sizes or styles that favor you most while going with your style. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I learned that it is better to buy good quality, form-fitting clothes even if they're a little bit over my budget  so I can use it for a long time. Buying things that I can mix and match has also favored me. I have had too many rockband tshirts at one point that it was nearly impossible for me to look like \"serious\" scientist. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now, I feel I have a \"formal\" look that goes very well with my personal style, I mean I haven't changed to the \"legally blonde\" style or anything like that. I have a pinterest inspiration board that I check up before going to shopping for something so I know not to fall in the same old informal habits. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegarding wearing make up, I feel you sista! I don't feel empowered while wearing makeup simply because I am too worried that I my smudge it at some point. It is an extra source of stress so I try to avoid it at all costs. What I do like is to look fresh and healthy so I try to have a nice morning and night routine so my face looks as rested as possible, I wear sunscreen and lipbalm and for my eyelashes a clear nourishing \"gel\" that makes them look pretty but I don't have to worry about ending up looking like a panda by 6pm. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhoping it helps!",

      "text": "So I\u2019m a heterosexual cis male in my senior year of undergrad but do a lot of work with grad students, including some social psychology researchers who look at gender and sexuality. Grad students and professors definitely wear a wide variety of outfits throughout the department; in general the formality varies based on the lab culture and/or the environment that you\u2019re going to. Meeting with a client or working in the lab? More formal. Teaching undergrads? Dress casually and no one will care. \n\nI don\u2019t think you should force yourself to wear stereotypically feminine clothing unless you want to. What\u2019s stopping you from wearing a more professional outfit that\u2019s also more stereotypically masculine? Check out [this Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/sjucareers/gender-neutral-business-casual-attire/) for gender neutral business casual attire. My professor (she\u2019s a fifth year behavioral neuroscience student) wears these types of outfits all the time. Obviously if it\u2019s something that you think may hold you back professionally, that\u2019ll be a something you have to weigh/consider, but I think it\u2019s important to feel comfortable in your own skin (and clothes as an extension of that).\n\n\nCongrats on the VAP and best of luck with the job hunt/future career!",

While this whole issue is of course wrapped up in gender, there are expectations placed on men as well. Jeans and Tshirts aren't professional dress anywhere; they are by definition casual. On some campuses-- mine, for example --casual dress is generally accepted for people like biologists who are going outside for labs or wearing lab coats indoors. But it's not for those in many other fields. Moreover, you never know when you're going to run into the dean, president, or some other VP during the workday (at least on my campus)...who are always wearing full professional dress. If you're a junior faculty member you have limited opportunities to make impressions on those outside of your department, so it's usually good strategy to not to have those rest on what might be perceived as evidence of not taking the position seriously.",

I remember the first year that I was teaching an undergrad course as a PhD student, I dressed up in suits as per the norm, and I was so uncomfortable throughout. My evaluations were not good. From the next semester I switched to wearing what I am comfortable in, and my performance (along with evaluations) improved. Yes, I still do dress up in suits in conferences, and all the campus interviews I went for earlier this year, but I would wear what I am comfortable in for my classes. I haven't received any dress related comments in my evaluations yet, so I guess unless I wear anything outrageous in terms of print or ripped jeans kind, it should be fine!",
