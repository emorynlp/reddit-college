  "text": "Why do people stay in academia?\n\nI got into my field because I loved thinking, I loved doing (some) experiments, and I loved my field. But it seems that maybe I was wrong. I did not actually *love* it in the way my colleagues seem to use this word. \n\nYou see, when I say that I love my job, I do love it... Between 8-5 Monday through Friday. I get in and I do my job as best as I can. Then, I go home, or to the gym, or to the pub, or where-have-you and I do *other things*. In fact, you might argue that I *love* other things as well. Often these are things which make me, through subtle and indirect ways, a better researcher\u2014reading outside my field, learning some technical skill\u2014but often they're just for my enjoyment. On occasion, necessity requires that I work on a weekend or late, and that is fine. On occasion, an exciting ideas grabs me and I spend my off time working on it, because it is pleasurable to me. On occasion. I would be deeply saddened to no longer be in my field. I would (and likely, *will*) mourn not being in it for the rest of my life. But I could live without it. I am not empty without it. I can be very happy without it. Perhaps I'm tooting my own horn too much here, but this seems like a relatively healthy attitude to me.\n\nA colleague of mine\u2014far more successful than I am\u2014recently made a surprising confession to me: He lived in the lab because he really didn't have anything else going on. He didn't have that many friends, no other interests. He went home, watched something soothing on Netflix (he was re-watching \"The Office\" for something like the third time), and he slept. It's surprising because I had never heard it said out loud, but it's actually quite obvious. Another colleague of mine was recently told by their supervisor to work, go home, eat a little something, work, sleep six hours, and repeat. Their supervisor sends the group messages in the wee hours and has trouble sleeping because they \"keep thinking about work.\" My supervisor guiltily confessed to me that he took a \"whole day off\" during a long weekend.\n\nI don't want to pathologize people too much, but I have to ask what is going on here. If you ask academics they will inevitably say they just \"really love what they do.\" They will often add that they \"couldn't do anything else,\" and I think this conflation gives away more than they mean to. Should we believe this \"love\" at face value? Or is there something a little darker happening here? Have we somehow created a cult-like environment, where people are constantly made to felt like they would be worthless if they leave? Do people stay in because they the work brings them joy and pleasure, or is it because they have grown codependent with their job? Because their entire sense of self is based on their job?\n\nBecause I have some trouble buying the \"love\" theory. With very few exceptions academics have never struck me as particularly passionate people. They have the air of bureaucrats. Really: If you are a working academic, stroll through the halls of your department. Avoid the undergraduates and early PhD students who haven't lost their vestigial enthusiasm. Does this feel like a place full of \"passion\"? Does it feel like a place full of \"enthusiasm\"? Does \"love\" suffuse through the halls?\n\nIf I search deeply for the best adjectives to describe the academics I know, with no desire to wound or be cheeky, I come up with: professionally ambitious, intelligent, depressed, overworked, under-slept, anxious, and dull. The time I really see a twinkle in their eye is when they think their paper will get in somewhere big, or they'll get a fat grant. I get it, both those things are great, but I don't see that same twinkle for scientific research.\n\nPerhaps I have just had the misfortune of landing in bad departments? Or perhaps I'm wrong, and there is real love there that I perhaps am not appreciating. I'm not sure.",

      "text": "There's another piece to this worth considering--you offer a very rich and thoughtful description of something real here, but it goes beyond individual temperaments and it goes beyond the specific problems of academic habitus. \n\nIt's true that academics are encouraged to love their work or have a mission or sense of vocation in ways that have always tempted them to lose track of the boundaries between work and life, notoriously so. (Hence the figure of the absent-minded professor, the obsessed literary critic who is always focused with the same interpretative intensity even while reading Goodnight Moon to their year-old child, the scientist who works 15 hours in the lab every day, and so on.) We identify with our scholarship and we are identified by others with our institutions.\n\nThere are other professions that have long been considered to have a sense of mission as well--it's why doctors get asked to do a diagnosis at a dinner party. But professors have historically intermingled self and work in powerful ways, sometimes beneficial, often not.\n\nThe extra dimension I'm thinking of, however, is that something has happened to all professional work in the United States (and to a lesser extent elsewhere, particularly in the UK) in the last thirty years. Namely, the demands that professionals show more and more and more dedication to their job, let their job intrude more and more on their lives, produce more and more value or outputs while working, and so on have happened across all of professional labor, at the same time that professionals have lost most of the autonomy and authority that used to be the hallmark of their working experience. Doctors are expected to work longer hours in more demanding circumstances and are more and more subject to the authority of non-medical management and insurers, and their places of work have been mostly consolidated into large-scale corporate systems, both profit and non-profit. Psychiatrists and psychologists the same. Lawyers are less and less likely to make senior partner in the old sense, their firms are getting bigger and more corporate and significantly more aggressive about enforcing the maximization of paid hours with clients--and if you want to make senior partner you'll not only bring in the money but you'll show that you're the person willing to work the longest hours with the fewest complaints. If you want to make it in Goldman Sachs and other firms, you'll work 18 hours and sleep on a cot and answer emails at 2am. Want to make it as a Congressional aide or be a White House political appointee? Get ready for ridiculous hours, ridiculous demands, and a complete blurring of the boundaries between your life and the job. \n\nSo of course this has happened to many academics too, and for many, it's been as it has elsewhere--not a sudden sharp shock from a hostile takeover but millions of frogs boiling slowly to death. It's happened because of widening income inequality and thus more competition for the shrinking places at the top of the meritocracy, because of how ideologies of austerity and neoliberal management got rid of associate lawyers and tenure-track faculty and so on (while finding a place for more neoliberal managers to practice more austerity), because email and computers made it possible to do more in less time in new ways, and because work became a substitute for lives that were seeming less meaningful or satisfying or stable. \n\nIt's important that we keep this in mind, because what's happening to us is not just happening to us--and that might be the beginnings of an answer beyond \"protect your work-life balance\". There are genuinely reasons why that's not good advice for many people in the current environment even if it would be a good goal for changing the current environment.",

          "text": "I think you've hit the nail on the head here. It seems like since the early 2000s there's been an across-the-board increase in expected productivity, which has impacted people in most, if not all, professions. And the problem is not necessarily this increased productivity per se, but the fact that, as you point out, productivity has become the sole basis by which one is judged for any sort of virtue (i.e. the concept of \"work ethic\" has just morphed into \"how many hours will this person work a week\"). I think this is at least part of what has caused the publish or perish phenomenon to bubble to the surface in academia, even if academia isn't the sole or even the profession most impacted by this shift",

      "text": "I am pretty well known on Reddit for loving what I do, and I'm truly passionate about my field (astronomy).  I had a really tough time during my PhD because of a toxic adviser, and I learned some tough lessons out of that, one of which was escaping from this mentality.  People will always look at the next guy and see that he's pulling regular all-nighters and then, if it's a toxic culture, judge you based off that.  It's a false idea though, that if you work long hours you're passionate enough and can stay- I worked long hours and that adviser kicked me out anyway, because it was toxic and that's what toxic environments do, they'll spit you out once they've used you up and you'll have nothing left.\n\nThat said, I don't believe that long hours have much correlation with how good a researcher you are- once I stopped working for that adviser, where I was working 60+ hour weeks, I never worked weekends again unless there was a big deadline, and I've been *plenty* productive.  I usually work 10-6, leave my laptop at work on weekdays and usually never touch it on weekends, etc.  And I'm now at an Ivy league postdoc with a reputation for being very productive.  And frankly I think being a postdoc is a blast, even with the pandemic- show up and do awesome science you're passionate about, give talks about what you've done, teach students awesome things and inspire them, go home to my husband to cook dinner and cross stitch or play with our cats or whatever, repeat!\n\nSo yeah, people will always judge you based off whether you are a typical scientist and if you're motivated enough, but I think people judge you for a lot of things in life that is more their problem and less your worry.  I know some people are like what you describe, but honestly I always figured I'm around as long as it's possible on my terms, and if it no longer is there are plenty of things to be passionate about.  And I've noticed that's a huge part of if you're happy in your postdoc or not btw- a lot of people are stressed about getting the next thing, and I'm just marveling that I get to be here and do what I enjoy for a few years.  Not many people on planet Earth get to say that!",

Academics are no different than bureaucrats, or dentists, or hairstylists. Sure, sometimes you go to a passionate bureaucrat and it's a beautiful thing, but ultimately all I care about is that the person can get the job done to a professional standard. How they feel about it is their personal business.\n\nLike, what if the notion that we should love our jobs was sold to us by our capitalist overlords to convince us that we need to bleed ourselves dry for somebody else's bottom line? What if it were morally okay to be an academic who did an excellent professional job for 60 hours every week, but whose eyes lit up for DnD on the weekends? What if it were acceptable to have an awesome career and also not make that career your entire identity? What if it were okay to not be as excited by your research as a first-year grad student - and also okay to have wrinkles at 40, and not fuck like rabbits with your partner of 20 years? What if we're all mortal?\n\nAlso, lots of bureaucrats go into public service because they're passionate about helping people and making a difference. Lots of these people could've gone into academia - some even have PhDs - but ended up not, because academia, depending how you look at it, can seem dusty and irrelevant. Maybe one reason so many academics become disillusioned is that they go into academia primarily in order to feel superior to others, and then realize that they're actually not.",

There's a reason that undergraduates hate group work assignments, and that's because that makes them hostage to the least diligent person in a group (or just assigns them to work with people with whom they have no affinity or synergy). Graduate research, postdoc research, and research as a newly hired TT faculty in STEM fields makes your success dependent upon others and makes it easy to imagine (with justification or otherwise) that other people are responsible for setbacks. Unless you happen to be in a lab or a collaboration with people who are completely unified in their determination to maintain work-life balance and share the same discipline and focus while they're working, any asymmetry can cause everybody to feel they've just got to work more, work longer, work harder. And of course there are times where the work itself simply demands tremendous amounts of time because of the basic material constraints of an apparatus or of the processes involved in the research. Humanist and qualitative work is often though not invariably personal and humanists are often capped by constraints that can't be overcome by working longer hours--archives and libraries are generally only open business hours, many of the materials you'd like to consult require expensive travel, if you're an ethnographer you can't make your subjects be more observable over more hours just so you can keep working. Quantitative social science sometimes is just plain limited by the available datasets--some of the data you'd like to have can't be collected through your own research because it's too big, requires governmental authority, etc. \n\nThe other issue is career goals. It's somewhat foolish in the current academic job market to set your heart on ANY particular kind of academic job, but if you're absolutely determined to be a top researcher in a top R1 (especially in STEM), you are buying into a lifetime of constantly schmoozing at conferences, constantly self-promoting, constantly writing grants, constantly making sure you're in \"the room where it happens\", and most importantly constantly demonstrating that you work harder and longer than anyone else. Once upon a time, you might have been eventually able to say \"I've established my reputation\" and have the world beat a path to your door, and maybe for a perishingly small number of famous humanists that's still sort of the case. But for almost everyone else, that hustle has turned into a lifelong commitment. On the other hand, if you reckon you'd be just as happy being an active researcher but not the world-famous gonna-get-a-Nobel who mostly teaches undergraduates as a tenured professor at a small liberal-arts college, a public university, a mid-tier private university, etc. then I think you can in fact step down from the insane ratcheting up of working hours if and when you get that position (no mean feat) and definitely when you get tenure. This is not to say that you will: many people continue to work themselves essentially to death, and there are days and weeks where there's no way to get all the grading, all the scholarship, all the meetings, all the contact hours, all the reading done in 50 hours or less.",

That scientists are expected to just love their work, and then we feel oddly guilty like \"oh I have this wonderful TT job that everyone wants, if I don't love it, you're selfish/not a good researcher.\"\n\nI would say I love my job and can also say that sometimes work sucks.

They convince themselves that they \"love\" academia because for whatever reason, they feel stuck with this career choice. Maybe that's because of sunk cost fallacy, maybe their PhDs and skillsets are unemployable outside academia, maybe they went straight from undergrad to a PhD program and have literally never had a job outside academia, and/or maybe they're just afraid of change.

Everyone outside his lab thought it was insane.\n\nSomeone started living in a lab that I worked at because he didn't want to pay rent (he could have afforded it, his salary was twice the median income of the city).

I've gone on job interviews to major tech companies that you've all heard of where they refused to tell me typical hours.\n\nOverall I think the love comes from satisfaction in the bigger picture.

You can do other things. It doesn't have to consume you but you can still say you love it, if you want. But it's okay for it to consume other people. Maybe as an analogy we can think about the gym here. Whatever your level of seriousness is about the gym, I'm sure you see people who are in there every single time you are - they're there before you get in and there after you leave. That's okay too. Or maybe you're the one outlasting them there. It's okay to let things consume more or less of your time. I spend 6-8 hours/week working out and I start in lab late in the day. But I'm hella passionate about what I do. I think about it when I wake up, and sometimes wake up in the middle of the night with brilliant experiments dreamed up.

I think they would say, _they like aspects of them enough for it to be worth it, and their job lets them do things that would be difficult in other jobs_. If we want to take the metaphor further, it's like a realistic marriage, not the puppy-love infatuation that it starts off as being. In a long, real-world marriage you generally do not wake up every day and think, \"my god, I love this person, everything they do is perfect.\" But you have a lasting commitment to them, and you work out a decent balance and compromise, and if suddenly one person starts trying to sabotage the whole thing, then you get out of it. \n\nI do love my actual academic research, sometimes. That is _not_ the same thing as my job. That's what my job allows me to do for a portion of my time, when I'm not doing other things I need to do. I don't love dealing with student e-mails because it's registration week and they have questions.

Maybe you'll find more of this type in our world, but it's definitely not an us only thing. This post comes off as shaming to those you're critiquing, even if you don't mean it that way. Basically at the end of the day, academic work is a job just like any other job. You'll find bureaucratic nonsense, despair, exhaustion, etc. You'll find people with balanced lives, and sociopaths who are famous for republishing the same nonsense over and over again.\n\nPersonally I appreciate what I do because it allows me to flex my time to have a life. But I've worked in lots of other industries before becoming an academic, and I've seen what you describe basically everywhere. \n\nI don't think I really understand the point of your post maybe. Love or codependency? It's neither. Most of us in this field just want a job where we can obsess over what we care about. Ultimately it's a job that provides a little more freedom in time and thought than most jobs.",

      "text": "Loved the discussion here, Kudos OP!\n\nI often wondered why I got into academia and the thoughts became stronger as soon as I started pursuing my grad studies. I joined an R&D lab soon after completing my bachelors and I loved what I did. I always loved math, and experiments based on engineering stuff and the R&D lab was the perfect fit. I enjoyed building this and that, playing with a lot of tools and whatnot and soon, I wanted more. I wanted to initiate my own research and carry out experiments. I had a perfect work-life balance and I enjoyed being with a lot of friends. But fast forward a few years, I've quit that work palce to join academia and now, I'm a grad student in a lab working tedious hours. I often question the same thing OP mentioned. Do I love this anymore or am I doing this because it keeps me going? I'm living miles away from my home (in a different country), and I work almost all the time. My social life is limited to a drink or a chat once a week and weekends are just reserved for staying in, watching movies. But I tend to comfort myself with the thought that after my degree, things will be different but deep down I think that's not the truth. I'm in my late 20's and my circle of friends are quite small. However, one of my colleagues said that as you grow up, you will realize what you need in life, and what you feel comfortable at this age will last almost for the rest of your life. While I do not agree with the whole thing, it sort of makes sense after all. Everyone I work with seems less enthusiastic about \"science work\", and they are mostly on auto-pilot mode. But hoenstly, the conundrum is that I still don't want to leave academia! I'm still (maybe naively) hoping that I will, somehow, be able to start an R&D lab or something or teach students  to do what I once loved. I don't think the love for science and academia is dead, I think the system has made it numb and everyone is waiting for a little push in their own ways.",

Please don't take this as an attack, but do you read into someone not working non-stop on their personal research to mean that this person isn't insatiably curious? I personally don't see how spending large amounts of time not working/researching in your specific research niche makes one any less curious.\n\nI'm  absolutely love to learn new things, which is my absolute favorite part of being at a teaching college. I would even moreso categorize my non-academic husband as being truly insatiably curious and we both use that exact term to describe his temperament regularly. However, we both enjoy being curious both in and outside of our fields of work and feel that we are actually better at our work specifically because we don't focus 80-100% of our curiosity on our work subjects.\n\nNeither of us works more than 50 hours/week and usually stick to 40 as much as possible. We simply then turn to learning how to cook new dishes, how to build our own furniture, how to grow new plants in the house/yard, how to build a new deck, etc and so forth. We're both incredibly curious and spend much of our time learning and doing. We simply don't hyper-focus on our specific areas of work interest.",

I just also think that there are many fields for those of us who are very curious (e.g. husband is in project management where he constantly gets to learn new ways to build things, new codes/regulations/specs, etc., which is a way for him to constantly learn how things work in the construction/building world) and that there are many ways to work that still satisfy this.

There are academics who seem to produce absolutely nothing, work zero percent of the time and get spurred on to higher and higher paying jobs. There are people who seem to work comparatively little and are so talented at being efficient and connected they get high results. There are those who leech off the brains of the young and naive and fuel their own ambitions so work hard at - stealing and leveraging off other people. \n\nThere are academics who are dumb as rocks and do very little but happened to be married to very smart people and they publish together. So...guess who is doing the work there? PhD advisors who end up marrying their students after graduation and helping them get tenured positions? Common. Who really helped with that thesis? Generation after generation of academics in a family, each living off the name and achievements of the one before? Also common. \n\nSo, some people are busting their hump. Lots aren't.
