  "text": "Hello! I'm a microbiologist who's about to begin my PhD next fall (yay!). I've had a very successful undergraduate career, including working on science outreach. My parents always act/say that they are ~so proud of me~ but their actions state otherwise. I've had several science-derived arguments with my parents whom are not scientists and don't know even basic biology.\n\nFlash forward to the present; I'm putting on a virtual course as a part of my certificate/fellowship that discusses pandemics. My parents both signed up for the course and have helped advertise the class. My aunt recently warned me that my dad said he was studying up so that he could 'call me out' if he didn't agree with anything I said in the course. In the entrance poll, he wrote he was hoping to learn proof that masks don't work. So, obviously his participation in this course is for the purpose of digging at me. \n\nI've resolved to the fact that though my parents want to act supportive and I've felt like I've made breakthroughs with them, at the end of the day they don't really care how they make me feel. Nor do they truly believe in or support science, my work, or me. \n\nI don't want to spend the emotional labor to truly cut off my parents, but it's exhausting constantly getting picked on by them. Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? I feel so alone because all of my academic friends' parents are either academics themselves or are so so supportive.",

Apparently, this violates some conflict of interest issues they've had in the past, and its been determined that participants with direct family relationships are not allowed to participate in the program.  I think we might be able to get you into the class, but you won't be able to actively participate or ask questions, submit homework or take tests.\n\nLove you all, wish I could do something different.\n\n\n.\n\nFeel free to edit to fit your needs\n\nby the way, your supervisor could help out with this situation too (thats where the 'policy' comes in)...they should be able to ban people from participating, otherwise these classes would be overrun with wackos.",

I think the tone you took in the first half is completely unfair, as it blames me for my parents being wacko. I would love to shut them out of the course but fear repercussions from confronting them. The course is all diy and asynchronous, so no interaction with other participants. Im trying to ride it out unless something happens that truly crosses the line. Considering how my parents have entirely gaslit or verbally attacked me when I've tried to set boundaries before, I figure in the last semester of UG isn't the best time to try to set hard boundaries with them. I appreciate your insight and seeing that even those of us with problematic parents can become professors. I'd just really appreciate it if you didn't assume that I (or anyone else for that matter) am helpless, soliciting help when/where it isn't appropriate, or unprofessional.  I've worked my ass off to be the smart, empathetic, and capable young academic I am today. It just hurts that my parents are trying to hold me down along the way.",

      "text": "I recommend not including your parents in so much of your life. That doesn't necessarily mean cutting them off - but I think for everyone it is healthier if their parents aren't front-and-center in everything. Your parents don't have to be invited to every event you host or know about everything that's happening - even if they are very supportive. Part of being supportive is allowing the child to have her own independent life, too. \n\nMy parents are unsupportive in a different way to yours (and they are both doctors, btw, just to address your assumption that highly educated parents are automatically highly supportive), but what helped me most was having firm boundaries around how and where we interact. This has meant that I don't discuss certain subjects with my parents and have had to develop a support network outside of my parents - which imo is better on net anyway. It has taken my parents a lot of time to adjust to this new dynamic, but I think our relationship is calmer and more productive as a result. A surprising bonus of this approach has been that my parents started to see me as an adult and respect me as a professional when they saw that I was handling my business with 0 \"support\" from them (which was never really support but they thought it was simply because I included them). Obviously, I am not saying that this will work for all families and all abuse dynamics.\n\n> Nor do they truly believe in or support science, my work, or me.\n\nTruth is a multifaceted thing. They may intend to believe in and support you, but their impact may be different from their intent. I think everyone who has unsupportive parents went through a phase where they compared their family to families that seem happy and wished things were different or even tried to make them different, but, at least for me, a big part of growing up has been accepting that I must meet everyone where they are. Accepting that I have the parents I got has freed me and I think them from my expectations of how they and our relationship should be different, and it allowed me to respect that some of the fucked up shit they did they did because they thought it would benefit me. That doesn't mean I've forgiven that shit, and it doesn't mean that our relationship is rainbows and roses - in fact, I think it will always be strained - but it has helped me be more at peace with my past and more confident in my ability to be the person I want to be.",

Not all interest or engagement is in good faith\u2014which sounds similar to your parents. \n\nI didn\u2019t actively cut them out (I doubt they\u2019d notice if I did), but I\u2019d say stuff like, \u201cit\u2019s important to me that you come to my graduation\u2014I\u2019d like to invite you.\u201d Which showed them how they could support me in a way I appreciated. This example goes to show that there wasn\u2019t much they could do to actually be supportive. I tried getting their approval by showing one of my publications with them, but that didn\u2019t really work. I think I make them feel them feel a little threatened, which explains some of the random and somewhat hostile behavior.\n\nAnyway, pump your energies into something and someone who will value and be worthy of those energies.

One thing to consider is having some ground rules / boundaries with your parents. For example, a boundary may be that you do not discuss your work with them, given your parents going to lengths most would not to attack your work. If all of you were to agree to that, then you could discuss all sorts of things (TV shows/movies, food, nature, relationships, etc.) without getting into a topic that requires so much emotional labor on your part.\n\n(How practical that is depends upon to what extent this is an isolated incident, e.g., you have a decent relationship with your parents outside of their anti-scientific attitudes, versus whether their boundary crossing and putting down of what you do is more pervasive.)\n\nUltimately, it is up to you to decide what kind of relationship you would like with your parents going forward. But you do not have to let them into every part of your life, especially parts of your life in which they are hostile.",

In the meantime, what I've learned (through therapy) to do is to have a cordial, but distant relationship with my parents. Definitely don't tell them details about your life (ups, downs, successes, failures) because they will never be the supportive parents you want and need.

Their actions often become those where they are trying to 'win' at other things and belittle you wherever they can, especially when it is in front of other people and in high-consequence situations. I'm not sure these are conscious decisions, nor that therapy will change anything. It is the sort of thing that might be best handled by limiting the types of interactions and content of discussions you have with them \n\nIt can be so hard not to share those details, but when it initiates a pissing contest that you have no interest in participating in, it could be worth a shot.\n\nAbsolutely get them out of your class.

One example; My mom was spouting off some anti vax info and I tried to argue with her and inform her about vax research and how the immune system/vaccines work.

I'm about to graduate as an engineer and since then I have noticed a rapid growing trend in my mother who would 'pretend' she is supportive on surface but extremely deceitful when i need any kind of advice. I.e if i did really bad on an exam she will try to extrapolate all my negative emotions and engrain in my head that I am bad at math. Basically trying to put sticks in my wheels because she's bored in life. Some of my 'friends' are trying to play serious mind games as well and trying to use the pandemic to amplify being rude with me if that makes sense. Also I've noticed my landlords who live upstairs have 0 respect for me and wished I'd die. They told me the last guy killed himself and i think they are trying to induce that on me. Anyways, I'm feeling slightly depressed with all of this but will overcome it. I'm tired of how people justify shitty behaviour to other people because of regret. I can't wait to make big money and laugh at all of this. Cheers. :)",

In other words, you could use it as practice in presenting a cogent, evidence based, structured counterpoints to a diverse audience.

Every toxic relationship has two sides, and based on the evidence presented here it seems to me like this narrative might be part of the problem.

They weren't particularly supportive of me, either, in that I think probably they didn't understand what education to that level constituted. I came home nearly every weekend as often as I could to help on the family farm, which made things pretty difficult as my schooling was about a six hour bus ride away. \n\nMy family also sort of \"picks on\" me as well, in the way that if construed negatively they don't really seem to respect my accomplishments. If I say or do something goofy, they'll call me \"college girl\" derisively. But because they're my family, I understand this is just how they communicate. \n\nThis might be an unpopular opinion, but I don't think it's necessary to cut your parents out entirely. Unless they have a history of being abusive or manipulative before you started schooling, it's possible they just don't understand or they feel somewhat threatened by you \"moving past\" where they are in life. Both are understandable, even if the second one is shitty. If they're worried about losing their connection to you, you might want to make an effort to do something with them unrelated to your schooling so that they know you're not leaving them behind. It helps to remember parents are people too, and even if they're acting poorly to you, you can show them compassion. It might actually make you feel better.",
