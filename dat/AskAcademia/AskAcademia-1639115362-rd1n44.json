      "text": "A PhD is a research apprenticeship. You won\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing at first, but the aim is for you to become an independent researcher by the end. If you don\u2019t bring something new to the table you won\u2019t get a PhD, since your thesis has to be your original contribution to your field.\n\nEdit: \u201cNew\u201d doesn\u2019t mean revolutionary or groundbreaking, it just means it\u2019s sufficiently original that it could (and generally should) be published in peer-reviewed journals.",

      "text": "You're expected to be capable of doing research, but the point of grad school, especially a Ph.D., is to learn how to be an expert in your field and master a subject area. What you're bringing to the table is you. Whatever grand idea you have for your research, your project will evolve alongside your understanding of your area as you study. Bringing in some revolutionary idea isn't expected in most places.",

      "text": "Depends on your grad program and country. In Europe it\u2019s not uncommon to require PhD candidates to have peer-reviewed first author publications before they defend their thesis. That said, getting your PhD is like getting a researcher\u2019s driver\u2019s license to science, so you\u2019re not necessarily expected to publish in top tier journals.",
