  "text": "It seems universities are now less likely than ever to replace retiring faculty with new TT lines. This suggests, in my opinion, that contracted 1, 2, and 3 year positions (benefitted?) will become the new norm, with a smattering of adjuncts to fill the gaps. Perhaps the most well-funded and \"elite\" universities will be the only ones to continue the TT tradition. So, is the TT era over? What do you see happening, or hear, at your universities? This may be a field-specific issue, so please note if so. Eager junior scholars want to know.",

      "text": "Yes and no.  Let's be clear here: the number of graduate students trained and the number of professors retiring (or, let's be honest, passing away) were always going to collide with each other in such a way that caused a crunch for the number of TT positions. \n\nWith the incoming demographic crunch (less students going to Universities) and the massive supply of PhDs willing to take adjunct jobs, I do not see there being many ways where many institutions that are solely teaching-oriented continuing to have TT lines except for core departments that are considered essential to the mission of the University. \n\nFor research-focused institutions, TT lines will always remain just because it's considered such a major incentive to attract researchers to begin with. Since researchers bring in more money/prestige (but mainly money) Universities would be hard pressed to drop that if they would like to remain research-focused.\n\nAs an aside: Tenure has always been kind of weird to me. It's original purpose was two fold; to protect professors from retaliation due to teaching unorthodox (and even sacrilegious) ideas/concepts, and to allow them the freedom to explore new ideas and research directions without the fear of getting fired. I'm not sure the first motivation still really holds today; not often do we hear professors getting terminated for ideas that are deviant to the church or state (with some notable exceptions).",

          "text": "I just wanted to add to your last point about the two reasons for tenure. When I started my academic career, it was a lot harder for me to do more daring research. I can only speak to my experience, but I was most concerned with getting published, making new connections with other academics for further research, all to build my resume to make sure my CV was competitive. \n\nEverything had to be within a framework that I knew would be easy to publish, or quick enough research that I knew would be finished soon. That\u2019s not to say the research was bad, but rather, I didn\u2019t have the security to approach my field from a radically different angle. I actually didn\u2019t realize this at the time, but after I was offered tenure, I had a sudden realization that, not only did those experiences and previous research build up my knowledge and skills to do more research (thus earning tenure), but I was now \u201cfree\u201d to do whatever research I wanted to do. \n\nIf it would take a few years to really flesh out these new ideas, or if I knew it was \u201cagainst the grain\u201d of the field, I knew I had time to fully develop it, make my case, and if it\u2019s not initially accepted easily, I could restart or reassess and present new case studies for more substantive support. Or just really take the time to develop this new research to the point I was confident the top journals, conferences etc would accept it. I never thought about that aspect of tenure until it happened to me: it gives me time and security to actually be a better researcher that didn\u2019t just support the field but moved it in new directions.",

That kind of limits the radicalness of the ideas you propose, because you need to have that clarity/arguments in the very early stages of those ideas. So they need to be pretty radical but not totally ridiculous, just right.\n\nI think what the parent commenter is saying that post-tenure you feel free to pursue ideas that are so radical that it's not at all clear they'll ever work. And because you have the very long-term job, you know you'll have the time to make adjustments and try lots of different things.",

There are fields where the pressure to conform to orthodoxy is quite strong, but I am not sure if TT would help at all. It's still unlikely that those willing to openly question the status quo reached those positions, I am really not sure what's the best solution to this sort of situations.\n\nI work as a medical anthropologist doing ethnopsychiatric research. My experience observing that particular field is that those practitioners and scientists willing to openly question the current state of affairs when it comes to mental health understanding and interventions, and point at the insane influence of the pharmaceutical industry and other interest groups in shaping the so-called bible of psychiatry (currently the DSM-5), the research lines that get funded, and in general what can be said and done without being considered a heretic, face harsh consequences. In some quarters the fear of retaliation, of being a pariah and not being able to advance in their careers or even keep their jobs, is a real issue.",

It's original purpose was two fold; to protect professors from retaliation due to teaching unorthodox (and even sacrilegious) ideas/concepts, and to allow them the freedom to explore new ideas and research directions without the fear of getting fired.\n\nI like this in theory and maybe it was the case that tenure had the desired effects but the filters that determine who gets tenure and what they have to do to get there and the pressured on tenured faculty now basically make this null and void.\n\nOn the teaching side, I have known a lot of tenured faculty and very few, if any, have been teaching unorthodox ideas. It is not that they don't have unorthodox ideas and it is not that they are scared to share them, it is just that they are so overburdened with other responsibilities that teaching is basically an afterthought. Also many of them don't care about teaching anyway and just treat it like a tedious chore. It is easier to just use standard teaching materials than to really spend a lot of time developing something new.\n\nOn the research side, I think the problem is largely that people who are really likely to explore risky and innovative new research directions are very unlikely to make it through the filters and actually get tenure. The modern academic system rewards people for following trends and for consistently producing publications, and the easiest way to publish consistently is to do research that tells us what we already know. Getting tenure typically requires that you are well cited, well known, and have obtained a decent amount of funding, and developing these things is time consuming and it is much easier if you are doing research on easy-mode.\n\nThere is the idea that although younger academics need to be conservative in their research, when they do get tenure they can then open up and start doing high risk research. This doesn't turn out this way partly because the filters have already removed the people who are likely to do this and partly because most modern tenured professors have groups that they are responsible for. They need to get grants to keep people employed and to keep people producing research that they can put their names on, so the same pressures continue to exist.",

If tenure came with an unlimited bag of cash then yeah, people could afford to take on projects that are risky. But any research group worth a damn has postdocs and students who've gotta be paid and who need that steady stream of publications, and the funding agencies don't have a special \"easy\" track for tenured faculty.\n\nTenure is a perverse incentive and doesn't currently fulfil its original purpose.",

And in many progressive countries those norms have become the law of the state, too.\n\nIf you try to do research on satisfaction rates after transgender surgery or potential differences in intelligence or abilities by race, you stand a real chance of getting fired even if you do have tenure.

That's fine, but while I agree with your first point to a degree, your second point reminds me of a Joe Rogan talking point, and I disagree with that.\n\nThere are many studies on intelligence and race, just not the ones you seem to be envisioning. For most people within a standard deviation or so of the IQ bell curve, intelligence is impacted to some degree by social circumstances (parental and educational resources, quality of school, socio-economic status, exposure to problematic chemicals, etc). It is not a purely biological ability scenario, so treating it as such is not good research and probably unlikely to get funded. And, intelligence takes many forms--emotional, artistic, social, analytic, etc. It is not often analyzed as one large thing (even in psychological testing, IQ speaks to different types of abilities). Neuroscience research on intelligence relating to race often factors in social impact on cognitive development to find answers to possible disparities. I bet if you look through top neuroscience journal databases you will find related research.\n\nIn terms of the trans research, my guess is that this research is probably already happening if not already published. If not it will develop when more trans people express dissatisfaction with transitioning, given that so many publicly express a decrease in suicidal ideality and increased happiness. But there is a lot of research on the inadequacy of F to M bottom surgery, and those who have undergone bottom surgery may be more likely to express dissatisfaction with their transition. That would be more about procedure but certainly about \"satisfaction\".\n\nThe issue is that general research on \"race and intelligence\", if there were disparities, would be weaponized to defend some biological reductionist perspective on racial difference, and being so general it would not be adequate research. The trans research similarly would be weaponized to fight against trans civil rights and the authenticity of trans people's desires to transition.",

And inevitably, you are likely going to see certain populations of people that have a higher or lower than average tendency of expressing those particular genes, whether the findings conform with current perceptions of \u201crace\u201c or not. How could you not? \n\nSome credible scientists have legitimate concerns that when that happens, research will be shuttered for political purposes because a lot of people just don\u2019t want to hear it, regardless of the real value of knowing about it for apolitical reasons.\n\nAgain though, it\u2019s not worth getting hung up on the specific cases in question. Yes, highly controversial research that goes against today\u2019s social norms is going to be seen as of no real merit by most people today. That is tautological. But it is also shortsighted to assume that today we have reached some kind of Nirvana of scientific enlightenment, and that we in the year 2021 can be perfect judges of which research is both morally and scientifically appropriate and which is not.",

Of course. But does it measure something having to do with some aspect of behavior or cognition? Almost certainly.

But he knows that inevitably things are going to be discovered that racists use as vindications of their claims, and that some people on the left are going to assume his colleagues' research had a political agenda and deal with the politics rather than take a closer look at the meaning of those findings.

We hired very few last year too, even before the pandemic made everything that much worse. Our budget is highly dependent on tuition revenue, and thanks to the demographic trends others have mentioned, it has been shrinking fast. \n\nMany of our departments have no assistant professors and haven't been able to hire one for close to a decade. We're being told now that we should get used to a smaller faculty and not to expect retiring/departing professors to be replaced. I think it's a bit easier for more prestigious/selective universities (they can always admit more students if they need to), but many of them are struggling too.\n\nI don't know if the era of TT is ending just yet (it certainly is under threat in many places), but my impression from everything I've read is that the number of TT lines relative to non-TT is definitely decreasing overall. Also, I think that TT jobs are less attractive and cushy than they used to be, unless (perhaps) you're a superstar at an elite university. I routinely recommend that PhD students consider alternative career tracks (and that applicants to PhD programs consider alternative plans altogether).",

We also hired 7 tt people in my department in the 3 years before covid- 5 replacements for retirees/a death, and 2 new positions as a result of growth in majors.  I think it depends on the school to some extent. Small private not highly ranked schools are on a sharp decline, but affordable public schools like mine are expanding with students as a result. State budget issues are probably going to prevent us hiring new expansion positions in the next few years but we will probably be able to replace retirements or people who leave at least.  Although the guy retiring this year is the last baby boomer in the department and the next oldest person is like mid 50s I think so may be a while on more retirements...",

      "text": "I completed my PhD in physics a couple years ago and was immediately hired for a TT position at a regional university.  For context, my institution is teaching focused and I made sure to develop my skills and resume for exactly this kind of position.  My end goal throughout my graduate study was to go to a teaching focused institution so I made sure to take every opportunity I could to make myself a more desirable candidate.  \n\nThat being said, I applied for many, many positions and a good number of them were not TT.  I saw a surprising number of non-TT positions that were full time and permanent.  These places were trying to establish separate \"teaching\" (non-TT) and \"research\" (TT) focused tracks.  The non-TT positions were generally lower starting salary with a higher teaching load, but had no research requirements and the same advancement opportunities (i.e. assistant, associate, and full professor).",

At our university department there are currently like 3-4 (or more, can't keep track) commissions open for various positions from junior to long-term. It feels like every few weeks we have to find new people for commission positions to fill everything. A bunch of old profs have to find fitting replacements. You might just need to look in a broader spectrum.\nEdit: Computer Science, Germany. We just got major federal grants for excellence, so we have new research groups like robotics, collective behaviour, etc",
