          "text": "Thank you for the reply! I just usually have equations incorporated in my word annotations, something like the follows: Consider 1+2+3=6, this formula is related to this underlined sentence cuz blablabla. Also, I prefer to type things cuz it's more searchable.\n\nWould you mind sharing how you annotate textbook/pdfs if your workflow doesn\u2019t need such software? Thank you!",
