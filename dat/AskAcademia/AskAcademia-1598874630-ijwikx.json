  "text": "I'm set to start my PhD in September, but here's a few things I'm worried about.\n\n* I applied for a PhD just to stay in the country (UK). My home country is not exactly safe for me to return, and a study visa is the only possible way for me to stay abroad as I wasn't able to find a job before September. So while I have the offer and I'm ready to start, I also know that it wasn't the best option for me persay in terms of career development.\n* My supervisors know about this and support my decision, and they've been very encouraging along the way (they were my professors for my Masters degree).\n* I haven't published before, or even went to a conference, or any of those things that I see other people do before going into a PhD. I want to publish my Masters thesis eventually but I'm still working on it.\n* I've gone straight from undergraduate to masters now to a PhD. The work experience I have are all internships or volunteering. My field is in humanities/sociology and thus more about qualitative research.\n\nI know I'm at a disadvantage going into my programme. Am I really behind? What can I do to catch up?\n\nEDIT: Thanks to everyone who commented! Am a bit overwhelmed by everyone's support so I'll take some time to read over them. It seems I've made myself panic with all the publication and conference stuff - Thank you to everyone who reassured me that I'm doing fine.\n\nAs for the visa thing and my motivation for doing the PhD - I wouldn't lie and say it's not having a psychological impact, but I applied and was accepted before my family decided that I best stay abroad. If not I'd have deferred and gone back home to gain work experience, but the eventual goal was still to do a PhD. So I think I just need to get over that psychological hurdle.",

Remember: you are not expected to be a full-grown researcher, rather the doctoral studies are all about learning how to become one.",

      "text": "I started my PhD with a similar level of experience, and have many friends who have done the same.\n\nI think the biggest thing to be aware of (and the fact you're even asking this shows you already are) is that starting a phd requires learning a whole new skillset. Learning how to survey the literature takes time. So does writing. So does presenting. The list goes on.\n\nI spent the first 6 weeks feeling like a total moron, and it took at least 6 months before I started feeling even remotely comfortable. The good thing is that everything gets easier as you progress. For example, preparing my first talk was about a month of work, but now I can put one together the day before if I have to. Data analysis that took a week at the start of my degree takes me a few hours at worst. Your writing will drastically improve, which means writing becomes faster and you'll need fewer iterations of feedback.\n\nDon't compare your output to anyone who started before you, because I guarantee they'll be more productive than you until you're a year or two in.",

I want to publish my Masters thesis eventually but I'm still working on it.\n\nI did know some people who had stuff published before they started their PhDs, but they were a small minority, and they were mostly people who moved to the UK to do their PhDs, the way masters courses are structured in other countries I feel make this more likely to be the case, but even then it certainly isn't a guarantee with how slow the publishing process is.\n\n>I've gone straight from undergraduate to masters now to a PhD. The work experience I have are all internships or volunteering. My field is in humanities/sociology and thus more about qualitative research.\n\nMost of the people I know who went onto PhDs went straight from undergrad to masters to PhDs, or did one of the undergraduate masters course that exist in the UK, can't think of anyone who had any related work experience before hand other than a few people who got summer internships or that kind of thing, as I said I'm not familiar with humanities, but this is perfectly normal in STEM fields.\n\n>I know I'm at a disadvantage going into my programme. Am I really behind? What can I do to catch up?\n\nJust enjoy the free time you have left before you start as it will be a while before you will have some free time where you won't be worried about your studies. Your professors know you and your subject better than any of us here and if they think you are ready to start a PhD then you probably are.",

I come from a different field but getting the PhD is half of the battle, a PhD is still all about learning and in contrast to what you say I would say you are quite experienced going into a PhD! There will be others who look at your experience and qualifications and probably feel the same that you are much more qualified than them! \n\nI went straight into a PhD from a BSc which, whilst I wouldn't recommend it to others, was manageable. I also chose to do a PhD as I wasn't sure what I wanted to do and again here I am at the other end following a successful viva! \n\nObviously a PhD will have it highs and many lows and there will be times you question yourself but I reckon you will be very successful by the sounds of your experience!

Never published anything in my undergrad, did a few internships which didn't count for anything and attended undergrad conferences (i.e meetups with one generic keynote speaker and a lot of social time).\n\nYou aren't going to be disadvantaged. If you read papers, make sure you're up to date with the research you're going to be doing, and enthusiastic then you're in the same position as everybody else. Depending on the nature of your PhD, you might be able to find time to volunteer part time or get a job if you want more experience out of academia (check your visa restrictions and commitments before you do so).\n\nYou do need to think about what you're going to do if you find out it's not for you; you'll likely have to leave the UK (particularly with the whole Brexit thing, it's probably not worth staying unless you're okay with racist remarks - from personal experience). Even if you are the keenest person, it's never a bad idea to have a back-up plan.",

I've been in industry for the last 8 years and my MSc was done part-time alongside working so a full-time PhD feels like a big step. My supervisor has been great at building my confidence and reassuring me - she explained that a PhD is a training programme, and you're not expected to come in as a fully trained researcher. Ultimately you wouldn't have been offered a place if they didn't think you had potential and the ability to learn! My university has a really comprehensive training programme for first year PhD students so I'm going to try and do as many relevant classes and sessions as possible to meet my needs. The advice I've had from everyone is to spend the next few weeks resting and that there will plenty of development time when we get started. Good luck!",
