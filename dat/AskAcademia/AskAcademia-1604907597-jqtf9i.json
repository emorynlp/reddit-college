  "text": "What should I do with my life?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis may be more of a rant than anything else, but I need to let my thoughts out. I figured this would an outlet where some people might be able to relate and may even realize they're not alone in this position. I hope I'm not.\n\nI am currently a postdoc in South Korea. I am a Korean/American dual citizen. Undergrad (Chemistry) in the states, Master's (Pharmacology) and Ph.D. (Chemistry/Chemical biology) in Korea. My research was in anti-cancer and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nMy experience with graduate school in Korea has not been great. Lack of any real guidance and unfair treatment from the professors. I was subject to significantly high levels of stress during my master's and first 3 years of PhD. I worked hard. For those first two years of my Ph.D., I worked around 14 hours a day, Monday to Sunday, without taking a day off. This was mainly because I was forced to. I badly wanted to leave this lab for these reasons, and many others, but things were complicated due to my military duties. Looking back I should've just enlisted and done my two years. Long story short. \n\nNow, I am a postdoc with glaucoma and\n\n2 research articles as a first co-author (my advisor likes to mess with me by adding on additional authors as co-first authors to undermine my work).\n\n3 review articles\n\nNumerous research articles as co-authors, many of which I was responsible for basically rewriting, reorganizing, or completely writing myself for publications.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel exhausted and lost about my future. This postdoc position is keeping me afloat, but I feel the need to get out of this lab asap. I have been applying for research positions in the US without landing an interview. I had one interview last week with a biotech startup, which I don't think went too well. I may be just feeling burnt out, but I am so sick of everything. I'm at a loss here and feel like I need to do some soul searching. Thanks for listening to my jumbled rant.",

I think the main thing I'd say is, you're not alone by any means, and people like you have so many skills and so much to offer that they do find their way - it just takes a while. If you don't have the kind of privilege and network that just scoots you into the nice next-step academic role it might take a lot more applications - I only start counting after 50, proper ones.\n\nGoing altac is arguably something everyone should consider, if not do, at this point. Personally, I very much regret doing post-docs in which all I did was prop up bad scientists and a bad scientific system, and help draw in fresh meat on top of that. And then when I \"made it\" it turns out university teaching is horrible. So maybe invest a bit of time into researching how-to-interview-in-industry - there are different rules apparently that could trip you up.",

Once your seed project starts working, your PI add more graduates in terms of helping you, but in fact, it's an incentive to recruit more graduates into the lab. If the project doesn't work, you're in line to get fired any time soon. Postdocs are hanging by the contract. \n\nYou should definitely leave the postdoc career. It's always the case. You'd often hear a similar situation across the world, in Spain, UK, US anywhere. The same shit, abusive PIs, churning out the papers hoping to get funded, while squeezing the postdocs. They won't get fired. They have tenure. Get out of academic lab asap. They are toxic.",

I\u2019m not going to advise you regarding academia vs industry as that is a deeply personal decision, but I do encourage you to apply broadly and consider additional postdocs in the US. The job search game is a difficult one and can be soul-crushing. The key is to recognize that there are a million things outside of your control and which have nothing to do with you. Job descriptions are not always complete, area preferences are not always stated, inside applicants sometimes have preference, you can\u2019t control who else applies, etc. My recommendation is to apply for everything that might possibly be interesting and see what comes of it. Good luck with your search. I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but at least in my field (Computer Science), Korean degrees are respected. I would think that plus a US postdoc (should you go that route) would make you very competitive in the academic job market when things pick up again.",

So don't lose hope if you had one or two bad interviews.\n\nAs competition for faculty positions has grown increasingly fierce, postdoctoral training has become a requirement for securing a tenure-track position in most scientific disciplines but you do not need postdoctoral training for many jobs in science.\n\nIt is also important to remember that a postdoc itself is not a career goal. It is instead a training period during which you can develop the skills, knowledge and experience needed for your ultimate career goal. You should not view the postdoc as the terminal step in your career path but as a stepping-stone, useful only if it is required. You have to consider the fact that 85\u00a0percent of all currently employed Ph.D.s in a research sample stated that a Ph.D. was required or preferred for entry into their current position. However, when asked whether postdoctoral training was required or preferred to enter their current job, ONLY 40\u00a0percent responded that a postdoc was either required or preferred.\n\nIn addition to understanding whether a postdoc is required for your intended career field, you need to think carefully about how you would like to spend the next several years of your life, and about any financial commitments you may have. Do you have student loans? Are you providing financial support for your family? Are you willing to live on postdoc wages for the next three to five years rather than moving into a full-time, permanent, most likely higher-paying job? You need to consider the financial implications of entering a postdoc again in the US or somewhere else, as well as the career implications.  to enhance their chances of being among the small percentage of candidates who are selected for tenure-track positions, some Ph.D.s take on a postdoc to increase their number of first-author papers. Some seek to apply for transitional grants, while others apply for training positions to learn new techniques, to gain teaching experience or even to change their research focus completely. They may use a second postdoc to retrain in an area that will make them more competitive for jobs.  Most of these decisions were predicated on the knowledge that the academic job market is now more competitive than ever. Now that you are currently employed as a postdoc and interested in a field that does not require additional training, do not despair. Chances are you have been amassing additional skills and training through your postdoc work that are valuable to almost all employers, including the ability to work independently. Still, the more you speak with Ph.D.s in different professions, the more you will learn about what types of experiences are most meaningful and would make you most attractive for positions in that area. Coming from an extensive research background I am working as a full-time Engineer in a famous manufacturing company now.  You have to decide which path you want to follow now in the future and which one is more realistic for you without making you miserable. Academic or corporate?",

Also, the more you interview, the better it will go because it takes practice!\n\nIf you keep trying, then you won't feel lost. It will give you a purpose.\n\nWith your qualifications, you will find something. Like others who've answered so far, my recommendation is that you look into alt-ac. There must be many private companies and labs in America that could use your research skills.\n\nEven better would be if you could find a company that would value your skills with Korean culture and language.

This is a hit or miss depending on your school. 2) Your professional society (ACS would be right one for you, I think) will have some industry related seminars and groups. Talk to people there. 3) Make a LinkedIn profile and message anyone who has the job you want and ask them for advice. Not too many will respond but the ones who do will give you good advice.\n\nMy advice for you would be this. Don't feel that you have to stay stuck in a stressful job. You don't have to sacrifice your health. You can have a better life and a good job. If you're burnt out, take a month or two off. Getting an industry job with a PhD is not easy (I'm trying right now) but it can be done. Lots of people before you have done it and you can too.",
