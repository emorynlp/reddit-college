  "text": "MathPhys here. My Chair and I started a joint-work, and in the middle of our project, we invited another researcher whom the professor knew personally. She mainly gives general opinions and set the format for our .tex file which she kept making me to fix. I mean, the discussion with her was fruitful and greatly appreciated. Which has contributed to the spirit of our paper from a soulless math article.\n\nFrom the beginning, she has been claiming minor credits that wasn't hers. It started with a minor things like \"I changed this in the file\" even though I was the that did that. But it didn't really bothered me because it was super minor and it was just between us. \n\nHowever, once the paper is published, she would publicly claim even more credits. For example, she would use \"I did xx\" and \"I introduced Y to solve...\" etc instead of \"we\" or tell the truth who actually did what. And I was the one that did the bulk of thing she said. What makes me angrier is that she actually shot down my \"Y\" idea initially until my professor intervened. (We would otherwise not be able to get the result without use of Y). On top of that, before it was submitted, I asked her to check my calculations. Though she said she did, I still find (my own) typos in it. I suspect that she didn't even read the proof like I told her to.\n\nIs she trying to make the impression that she contributed more than she did to the work in the community, in order to secure a TT job?\n\nP.s. In my community, authorship is alphabetically arranged. So there is no way to know who is the major contributor. Unless you do some \"signalling\" like what this lass is doing currently.",

Some people do it less than others, and are more aware of it and thus apportion credit more fairly. \n\nMy advice: avoid working with this person again; always take notes in meetings and send them around by email ASAP afterwards, with a record of who said what; always provide version updates for code and documents, preferably in a way where edits are tracked and cannot be erased; and learn to spot people with unconscious bias, and especially predators who do this deliberately. Most people are just oblivious - it\u2019s not great behavior, but there is no intent. Some are deliberate predators.\n\nETA: based on discussion below: OP should also be aware that students often overrate their contributions - or underrate others\u2019 - because it is not always obvious what else needs to be done to make research possible. We\u2019ve all been there, only able to see the tip of the iceberg that is data collection and analysis. \n\nOP, you should recognize that you are susceptible to this too. It\u2019s a key life skill beyond this particular paper.",

We often overestimate our contributions at the expense of others.\n\nI think it is very common in science to, say, discuss something with a colleague and find that discussion helpful in overcoming an issue or having a new insight. The person with the issue leaves the conversation thinking the other person was a good sounding board to bounce ideas off of, the other person leaves the conversation thinking they added their own critical ideas that helped the other person. The truth is likely in between.\n\nIt's like that study they did when the asked cohabitating couples what percentage of the house work they did, and these estiamtes invariably added up to more than 100%. One person can be a delusional slacker, but it's likely that they are both making the same mistake.",

Before A was brought in, the main theorem was laid out, and the largest part of the of the calculation was done. When the person A brought in, the calculation part was completely done, though still without the help of A. Though we did ask her to read the proof through so spot any mistake. But further discussion showed that she clearly did not and I had to show her to proof over again. \n\nWhat was not largely done was the introduction. Now you should know that in mathematics, these part, though important, is not the main part. The introduction and literature reviews are written by me, and she was, again, asked to proofread it. After knowing she did not read the mathematical proof at the back, I highly doubt she proofread this either.\n\nHowever, she did contribute to the \"perspective\" of our method. And I wrote two paragraph according to what she commented. She also contributed by making me changing the format of the .tex file, which is just unnecessary since the Journal would have changed it with their own format anyway.\n\nI would also like to added that she is not some big professor. Just a post-doc but with a physic degree background. She was a student of my supervisor's colleague from other university, my supervisor thought it would be nice to invite someone with physical background to contribute to the \"perspective\", to which, she did. Last contribution she did was trying to impede the progress by shooting down one of my ideas, which turns out to be essential to the result, wasting my valuable time.\n\nBut my beef with her is how she now trying to claim the whole work is hers by using the pronoun \"I\" instead of \"We\". \n\nAfter actually typing this out, I feel as if A did not jack shit and we would have just been fine without A.",

And everyone is going to talk up the papers they're a part of, and their part on them, to show that they have a robust research program and track record...that's just how the game is played. \n\nNow, mostly people will say \"we\" rather than \"I\" because most of us recognize that this is a group activity. She could be saying \"I\" because she's a narcissist. It's also possible that she could be saying \"I\" because she's been coached to, as there's a lot of research that shows that a woman's contribution when she's a part of a group will be perceived as being less than the men in that group, and she's trying to counter that. I don't know.\n\nAs you move on the the field, you are free to present your contribution however you please, and it's unlikely that the way she's presenting it now will impact your hirability.

I did do those things as part of a group but the optics are better when you say I instead of we, even if you do clarify the nature of everyone's contributions accurately. Anyway, if she is doing this externally, that also doesn't affect you, as there's nothing stopping you from doing the same.\n\nAll in all, this is annoying for sure.

      "text": "I think you maybe leaving something out here. What you describe seems pretty innocuous, a junior colleague making an effort to point out their contributions to the paper and you don't necessarily agree. \n\nHowever, if you felt it was innocuous, I don't think you would be writing us here. Care to go a bit further? \n\nAnd I have a perspective to offer. Women are taught now to talk up their work. In male-dominated fields of academia, women often feel overlooked for their contributions. They feel that when they make substantive intellectual contributions to groups, they are remembered in a more secritarial roll,  like you describe here - formatting files, copy-editing, giving \"general opinions\" rather than informed ideas or intellectual solutions, adding a little bit of spirit to writing but no ideas or insights. This is not to say you are wrong, or sexist. Just keep reading.\n\nWhere I am going with this is that women are taught that their work is sometimes downgraded by their colleagues (male and female) and they are taught to talk themselves up more to get acknowledgement. It's tricky because this is not viewed as positively coming from women as men (also, by men or women, I am not assuming anyone in the mix is a man). She may just be trying to make it known in a way she thinks might otherwise be overlooked. She may be over-stepping, or she may be right. Either way, women are taught to do this now.",
