Being told I was taking too long when I put in so much effort to get it done way in advance of the deadline just makes me feel so bad right now.",

My advice to you is to not look at their perceived \"disappointment\" as a failure, and realize that they're probably an asshole and will mostly likely continue to be an asshole regardless of when you get it done.",

When you ask somebody to work on a holiday, especially an important one, you're not just denying them the opportunity to take a day off - you're denying them time with their family, ability to participate in whatever rituals they want to participate in, time to connect with their community or their culture, etc. I normally am open to work at any point in a 24 hour day, 7 days a week, but I would never work on Christmas because at that point I feel like I'm insulting my family.",

I pushed back more in my final years and refused to work during Christmas and remained unreachable by turning off my email notifications during my vacations, but in my earlier years I was in that naive phase of wanting her to like my work, etc. She was also horrible at time management. The stuff she would have us write over our breaks were actually grant proposals, which to me showed that she is an incompetent scientist if she is relying on students to write the proposals, write the manuscript reviews, prepare slides for her presentations, etc. It got to the point where I told her she had to give us plenty of notice if she needed certain data and whatnot from us, but that got ignored. I mostly just ignored her and did my thing because I had an NSF fellowship so she wasn't even paying me. I felt bad for the international students in my group as she definitely took advantage of them, as they were worried they'd be fired and their visas would then be revoked.",

The typical logistics of putting a proposal together is that junior people write it, and then the senior person does QAQC. It's not cool to force employees to write proposals over break (or do anything over break), but typically, if you are a junior colleague in a place that relies on grant funding, you should expect that writing proposals will be a regular part of your duties.\n\n> because I had an NSF fellowship so she wasn't even paying me\n\nthen in your position I would've taken my free labor to a lab that made me feel valued. Becuase, even if technically any work you do is doing her a favor, you're a) missing out on important skills (including proposal-writing skills), b) missing out on making a good impression and garnering strong references.",

I should clarify that she made graduate students write the proposals I was a graduate student when she did this. And no, it's not normal, at least in my area. Anecdotally, I surveyed folks in the other research groups in my department and they said they usually provide figures and maybe a small summary of what they did to their PI, but they don't write the entire document with no input other than formatting from the advisor. We also had to literally drop everything else that we were doing to write these in a week when she knew about the deadline well in advance. That's not okay.\n3. I didn't get the NSF fellowship until the end of my second year (so it wasn't effective until my third year). I didn't realize how awful my situation was until maybe the start of my fourth year, and at that point I didn't feel like it was worth it to switch or drop out (and the department advisors I spoke to said as much). If I could go back, I would have left with my master's, but obviously I cannot do that as hindsight is 20/20. I learned from this experience now how to identify shitty behavior like this and can stand up for myself and choose who I want to work with to an extent.",

It also means that you should be able to take time off once the experiment is done. I just think the whole \"we do it because we love it\" often gets confused with \"I don't have to pay you and you don't have any rights\". My advice, work a schedule with your PI as soon as possible and discuss what are his expectations. \n\nIn any case, take action. Feeling resentful will only make you feel worse and a PhD is tough enough without all the extra drama happening.  Good luck!",

      "text": "One of the perks of science/academia is having some flexibility in your schedule.  The downside of that is that you'll occasionally have very busy weeks where you work much more than the standard work week, and there will be times that an experiment or looming deadline will dictate that you have to work on a holiday.  I recently had to come in over the winter holidays to keep some lab critters alive, and I took a few other days off to make up for it.\n\nI'm a huge advocate for work/life balance and not working ridiculous hours as a scientist, but I sort of feel like you need a little reality check here.  Your PI didn't \"make\" you work over a holiday; you had an external deadline (from the journal) that needed to be met, and that happened to coincide with a holiday weekend.  He's your mentor, and if he said you were taking too long, I would probably interpret that as him suggesting it doesn't need another read-through; thus, you're spending too much time on this particular task.  \n\nI think you're creating a story around a simple piece of feedback (ie: telling yourself that your PI doesn't appreciate you and thinks your time isn't valuable, when in reality, he probably just meant that it's ready to go so there's no need to read over it again.  In fairness to your PI, that might mean that he IS recognizing how valuable your time is, and doesn't want you to spend more than necessary on a given task).  Done is better than perfect, and there's no such thing as perfect anyway!\n\nI suggest you take a few days off in the next week or so in lieu of the long weekend that you missed, and just let your PI know when and why.",

One of the most critical aspects of success in this environment is to be highly efficient and to recognize when you're unnecessarily spending time on things that are actually finished.  Anyone tending towards perfectionism can just waste infinite hours making things incrementally better, to the serious detriment of their degree or career.  \n\nIt may simply be that your advisor thinks the revisions should only have taken a few hours; in that case, he really shouldn't be praising you for spending 40 hours on a short job.  That just encourages the idea that working too many hours is a positive behaviour rather than a negative one.  \n\nObviously this is just a guess; I don't know you and your situation, but I hope you can consider whether this may apply to you and decide what to do with it.",

Sure you might have to \"take it more slowly\" but how are you going to become a faster writer if your PI doesn't push you? New PI's composing grant applications have to write dozens of them in their first few years and none of those deadlines can be moved.

It means that for whatever reason, the work you've done so far hasn't gotten you to the finish line.

He'd want to make sure you adequately address the reviewer's concerns, and that your changes are in fact correct and appropriate. He might think more measurements/analysis or more data is required.  \n\nHe may think there is still another week's worth of work to do beyond your revisions, and that is why he says you are taking too long.",

Something I'd add is that as you go through your grad program, you will hopefully begin to appreciate the power of not asking.

When I re-submit is between me and the deadline. In many ways it can actually be a nice measure of progress and self-confidence, when you realize that you can answer questions that you would've previously asked your PI all by yourself (and no longer need them for that particular purpose). Of course I am blessed with a PI who does not micromanage, but sometimes it's better to ask forgiveness than permission.\n\nEdit: also if I want to take a day off, I don't ask, I just *do* it. She doesn't know what I do. She doesn't know when I work through the weekend and she doesn't know when I take a Friday off. YMMV if you work a lab-based discipline, but the main thing I've learned is that nobody really knows or has the time to care about what their students are doing on a day to day level. They care much more whether their students are mentally healthy and productive.",

I work in a department with phds, a post doc, staff, grad students, and am staff myself. \n\nThe work culture is... Interesting, having just come government. The younger, recently tenured PI here (2 years ago) I would deem as a workaholic. 10-12 hour days are the norm for him. His weekends are usually filled with grant writing. If he takes one day off on the weekend, that's just more work the next day. He complains that after a one hour meeting, 15 emails will be waiting for him. \n\nThe older PI was never granted tenure, despite multiple large grant successes directorship. I've never really pressed the issue on why, but I've determined that politics in academia, ESPECIALLY when you're based out of a medical school, are quite... touchy, to put it kindly. She is spread quite thinly, and compensated less than the younger PI. \n\nThe GRAs are put on small tasks mostly based around learning and developing their skills. They aren't worked too hard. \n\nThe staff aren't worked too hard either, I would say. Not because we don't want to, but because we aren't allowed to. Those of us who are hourly are paid for with specific grant dollars for projects that, if there's nothing to do...well... There's nothing to do. \n\nThe salaried staff are spread out pretty thinly though. \n\nNow, the post doc is where it gets interesting. His work ebbs and flows a lot, especially now since he actually recently became soft money staff. Before, he would work as it came and always be on stuff, but now it's up and down from what I've seen. \n\nAll in all, work culture in academia seems a bit... Misguided at best. The corporatization of academia has created a very strange work culture, is my theory. The PIs are constantly blocked by admin, and we're always in a budget crisis.",

      "text": "Hi, yeah. I've experienced this kind of attitude from a PI.\n\nTLDR: Not wrong...just not healthy. I recommend changing your perspective on your role in research. You're an expert in \"you\" and you're the one that has to figure out how to become an expert in whatever you're studying. Hold yourself above all else... especially your PIs opinion.\n\nThe longer version (edit): It's insane. It makes you feel like you're never able to give enough. It makes you eventually stop enjoying science...you lose the discovery and \"eureka!\" and it's just terrible.\n\nMy advice to you is not to feel resentful towards yourself. It's okay to be angry at your PI. You can even HATE them. You're not here for them. They need you...even if it's a big lab...they need you. You are their hands, and in some capacity their brains. \n\nYou should have a PhD committee too. Have you done your proposal/qualifying exam? If so, then the role of your committee has changed DRASTICALLY. They are literally your coaches and cheerleaders (not quite like your mom's level of cheering...but they want you to succeed). You can request to meet with them individually and explain your situation. They are meant to advocate for you. If nothing else, it should help to talk it out.\n\nIf the committee is not supportive, I'm happy to help talk about other resources...I've mentored a lot of my peers through things like this and even been through a bit of it myself.\n\nLastly, it's okay to be unproductive...regarding that deadline...if you worked and really couldn't have met it...then you didn't have enough help. Don't beat yourself up about it. Having mentored tens of undergrads during my PhD I've realized that deadlines are ultimately only as effective as the communication between the two parties. If there's one thing I'd recommend...it's grabbing up the courage to ask for help before you really need it. That might mean taking a hard line with your PI...you're not required to be friends, they are required to fulfil their duty of preparing you for a PhD.\n\nSeriously, feel free to DM me if you want to talk about this more...it can quickly turn into a more catastrophic feeling situation.",

Sometimes my supervisor may joke about taking long to get a fire under my butt going, but not when there\u2019s 11 days till the deadline and the paper having already being written. I think you have a right to be upset.",
