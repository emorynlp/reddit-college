  "title:": "Engineer considering PhD in ecology or related field",
  "text": "Hi All,\n\nI completed a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and am now wrapping up a Master's in Electrical Engineering. In the past 4-5 years, I have collaborated on several wildlife conservation research projects ranging from Brown Treesnake abundance estimation in Guam, Magellanic Penguin food availability, cetacean bioacoustic data collection, and novel invasive species detection methods using camera traps.\n\nWhile the work I've done has been interesting, I have not been able to contribute much to the research aside from building the technology that is used in the field. I did get the chance to spends 6 months in a penguin colony as a field biologist and 1 month in Guam, but this arrangement isn't really scratching the itch.\n\nI would like to get to the point where I can work at a Research Institute as a scientist, allowing me to lead research and ask my own questions. I am hoping that a background in engineering will allow me to stand out and work on some cool stuff. It's for this reason that I'm considering a PhD in ecology or a related field.\n\nI have already reached out to a few labs/profs that I feel are doing great work in this area. Since I have been a birder since age 6, I have been looking for labs that do work with birds. Many of the research ideas that have been brought up so far make good use of my engineering background, so I feel like I have options that I am excited about.\n\nMy questions are, should I be concerned about where I want to do my PhD? I have been looking at institutions in NZ and AUS, but I have been told they are less prestigious than US universities. Will this matter if I am trying to go into industry research? Also, which fields would most fit with the work I am trying to do?\n\nI originally decided on pursuing a PhD because many of the positions I have been looking into at startups, research institutes, etc require PhDs for leading R&D initiatives.\n\nPlease let me know if I'm missing something obvious. And thanks for taking the time to answer!",

          "text": "Thanks for the info. It sounds like that if I go abroad, then it will be up to me to market myself properly to the institutions I want to work for. Is that correct?\n\nThe prof I was considering working with at University of Auckland is proposing a project that would combine my engineering expertise with seabird conservation (a LoRa radio network deployed across Hauraki Gulf). It sounds right up my alley, but I obviously don't want to cripple myself moving forward.",
