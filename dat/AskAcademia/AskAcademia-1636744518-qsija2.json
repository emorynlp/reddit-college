  "text": "I have job security and a decent salary right now, but I have no passion for what I do. I really want to go back to school and ultimately, ideally, work in academia. However, everyone is saying the job market is horrible and only getting worse. So here's my question... Say I *do* get a MA (and maybe eventually a PhD) and I can't land a good job because of the job market in academia... Would it maybe still be worth it? I'd be so much more knowledgeable, I'd have the title (stupid ego bullshit, I know), and I'd have done the thing I set out to do... Or would the pain of the debt and whatnot outweigh that?  Let me know your thoughts.",

There is literally no way to predict how you will feel at the end of *your* PhD. But the way I advise people to think about this is by answering these two questions:\n\nIf at the end of eight or nine years in a PhD program you end up back teaching high school, making perhaps a little more money than you make now, would that be OK with you? and\n\nDo you love academia so much, and want a shot at an academic position *so badly* that you are willing to go through with the above?\n\nIf you have to take on debt to do this, though, the answer is definitely no.",

I managed to score one interview, and it took them over a month before they threw me a one line email saying \"you've been passed over, thanks.\" The depression was crippling and to be completely transparent, I cried a lot. \n\nEnded up liking academic administration after working in the Workforce Development department at my university, but after getting interviewed and passed over, I lost hope. \n\nForgot about teaching entirely. Covid destroyed that dream. Can't afford to even apply for an adjunct position because after 2 years interning I need to make money. \n\nSo now I'm in corporate healthcare handling Medicare/HMO claims. It just feels like I did everything wrong.",

If you do, it will likely be an adjunct position that pays poorly, overworks you, has mo benefits, and is in the middle of nowhere. \n\nI went through 6 years of grad school for music. I had high hopes and dreams, busted my ass, and really loved working in academia as a PhD student. I also thought I\u2019d never find myself just not landing a job of some sort, or even an interview at the very least. Like, I was really committed and passionate.\n\nThere was literally nothing. Like sending applications into a void from which they never return. I\u2019ve also never been outside of academia and moved to an entirely new place to find work and make a life after my degree. At least getting to choose where I live. I have had to completely rethink what making a living is like, and how to use my degree somewhat at least and it\u2019s been a rude awakening. Thing is, a lot of my fellow grad students come from affluent backgrounds and have adequate family support. I do not, and I will be royally fucked with debt the rest of my life just from the masters degree. My PhD from Cornell paid me handsomely to be there, but the maters degree is what\u2019s picking at what\u2019s left of my finances now. \n\nAs depressing as this sounds, Honestly, I\u2019m making a pretty good life for myself not using my degree and have recovered from copious amounts of depression over the years. In fact it\u2019s kind of nice to be a normal person, but also have a whole depth of knowledge about music and shit,\n\nAgain, I freaking loved academia and love music. I really would like to be apart of that community and contribute to university life, even now. I\u2019m good at it and it would be so great to have that back. None of this matters though unless you have a bit of good luck, an incredibly helpful and well-regarded advisor, and are a work-a-holic. If you have to take out a loan, don\u2019t go to grad school. Unless it\u2019s a professional degree or with industry options, which yours would not be. If you do decide to pursue this degree, and must take out a loan, I hope you or your family is wealthy. Find your own way, your own happiness, and best of luck!",

Then tailor the PhD towards that goal.     \nE.g. if academia is the goal get into a field that is at the beginning of the hype cycle with the biggest name PI you can get into and be ready to suffer for 4+ years.    \n\nIf you wwnt to get into a specific industry try to find a PhD either already in that industry or if that doesnt work out, with a PI that has good connections to the industry.",

I didn't go back to qualify me for a specific job after my phd (though for a couple of years at the end I got caught up trying to apply to academic jobs and failed), I went back because I wanted to do the learning.  I had been working admin during the tech boom - I'd worked for two different companies that closed their doors. I thought to myself at the time that if I keep working at these kinds of companies I'll still be changing jobs and having all the uncertainty, and not have a degree either, so why not have the degree even if I end up in 10 years looking for a job? \n\nThe academic job situation was grim when I started and worse when I finished, but I loved those years and what I learned/explored/experienced during them. I love the people I met, the people I taught, and the places I went to do all that. I wanted the flexibility of schedule, I wanted to be back in spaces that challenged me to read and learn, and to have the leisure to go down unpredictable paths. \n\nThe toughest part was getting used to how little money even a fully funded phd is, and the only thing I regret even slightly is that I took out a bunch of loans the first three years (tried to keep my same standard of living at first, which you \\*cannot\\* do if you've been making decent money) that I'm going to be paying off forever.",

If you look at undergraduate course offerings in philosophy or literature you will see that the vast majority of courses are taught by grad students or adjuncts. That means that annual salaries top out at about $35,000.  It will be very hard for you to find good statistics on tenure track placement, but that should be a clue by itself. Everyone in your position thinks they will be The One because everyone in doctoral school had always been the smartest kid.

It's better to do it without debt if you can. I made some very good friends and connections, it fundamentally changed how I think in many ways, and it opened quite a few doors. \n\nAfter a LOT of thinking and publishing a few papers to be sure I can carry a project through and don't hate doing so, I'm applying for PhDs. However, 1) I'm only applying for funded positions, so no additional debt, and the salary for a PhD researcher in the places I'm applying is better than I make now and includes healthcare (I'm currently self-insured), 2) I want the actual experience of diving into research for about 4 years and at this point have a reasonable sensor for working environment red flags, 3) I am not at all set on a professorship and in fact would prefer something else, 4) I have done my research on the places and kinds of jobs I'd like to work at and where people at them get their PhDs, compared that to the places I think I would have a good PhD experience, and I'm 100% ok with the fact that I would be very unlikely to get a professorship in North America because I don't want one, and 5) I plan to acquire as many versatile and transportable skills as I can during my PhD, so if I have to pivot, I have something to pivot with.\n\nI personally would not do it if I wanted to be a professor and only a professor, if I were currently making buckets of money and happy in my career, if I had to take on more debt, or (at my age) if I had to do a 7-year U.S. PhD while TAing.\n\nThe pros and cons are going to be different for everyone.",

Other than that even I left academia, I still think the training I got there really shaped who I am as a scientist, so I am glad I did it. However, it will be financially a step back for you if you already have a good paying job. I did it right after undergrad before I care to make money.",

Although I still work at a University, my current job (which I enjoy) does not need a PhD and I regret every single year I wasted on getting mine.\n\nAll my friends and peers who went straight into workforce after their undergraduate (or perhaps stuck around for a one or two year masters in a professional field) are all way ahead of me in the career/earnings ladder.\n\nI hate to say it but if you're wondering if academia is right for you, then it probably isn't. (based on my own experience only, of course).",
