                  "text": "Who says you don\u2019t have this in pharma or industry? One of the biggest myths that keeps people in academia is once you move into industry you have no more intellectual freedom. This is wrong.\n\n1) If I was in academia, my job is tied to my funding. My funding is tied to research I\u2019ve done before. I get more and more pidgeonholed into an obscure corner of research and can\u2019t get out. Also, if there\u2019s no funding for what I\u2019m interested in, or no publishing prospects, I\u2019m totally SOL. I have to hustle my whole career.\n\n2) We are allowed sabbaticals in industry. My company offers 3 months, where I can join a project and focus solely on that for the duration.\n\n3) No publication pressure! But if you do publish, you get rewarded! I\u2019ve published twice this year, in two very different areas. Both times, I got recognized by my team. Felt amazing. You can publish and collaborate with whomever you want still.\n\n4) Remember, at this level in industry, you\u2019re typically working with other MDs, PhDs, and other doctorate levels. We all share the same culture of publishing, researching, intellectual curiosity. This culture doesn\u2019t just disappear, and continues to be cultivated. This is my second company I\u2019ve worked for, and both places my bosses asked me on my first day what I wanted to explore, what research I was interested in, what I wanted to pursue.\n\n5) So much free time. No students, some busy work (paperwork can be a lot - regulations here), but just a lot of flexibility.\n\n6) Finally, if you get stuck in a job or project you don\u2019t like - YOU GET TO LEAVE. And you don\u2019t have to start over! You get to leave, and you can stay in the same city! And whatever company/job you move on to, you\u2019ll likely get a RAISE. If you\u2019ve studied a certain therapeutic area all your life, it\u2019s likely adjacent to ten other TAs you can jump into and explore. And if you want a different job title (you were a clinical research scientist in Med Affairs, now you want to explore health outcomes), YOU CAN DO THIS! \n\n7) I\u2019ve never had a 9-5 in industry, and no one expects you to. Throughout the last few months in covid, I\u2019ve seen my friends in academia struggle with the workload and families. One friend hasn\u2019t had a day off since February. That\u2019s asinine. On my team, if someone is stuck at the dentist and needs to jump off an important call early, no one bats an eye.\n\nETA - the opposite goes too - if you don\u2019t want to do ANY of those things (research, publish, be creative) a you don\u2019t have to and it will not affect your career prospects one bit. It\u2019s so nice over here y\u2019all - come join us!",

                      "text": "What you say is true, but it\u2019s also good to point out that for industry, things move very fast. Your project can be dropped in a week despite having worked on it for years due to the lack of results. That can be crushing. In big pharmas, multiple projects are in parallel so if your project doesn\u2019t produce good results, it doesn\u2019t get prioritised and manpower can be reallocated to more promising projects. This is of course expected, since industry is known to be very fast-paced and very dynamic as compared to academia.\n\nWork hours are variable. I have friends in a major MNC who is from Medical Affairs & Regulatory Affairs departments. Super different culture across different departments. Regulatory affairs is kinda more \u201cstandardised\u201d so 9-5/6 is normal. Things can be occasionally busier when new regulations are put in place. But medical affairs is really about reasoning and being critical and understanding the Science in accordance to the business perspective. That usually calls for very dynamic discussions with clinicians and consultants that can last till 1 or 2am. Medical affairs are not only crucial throughout the entire clinical trial phase but also the post launch as well. \n\nIt really depends on the nature of your work even in the same company.",

My current position is funded by a postdoc, but at this point I've left my original field entirely and there's no chance I'll ever be a professor. I love policy and hope to stay in this field.\n\nCareer wise, there are definitely more direct paths I could have taken to end up in my current field (a masters in economics or public policy), but this career path didn't even cross my radar until late in the PhD, and only because I was paying attention to where other grad students were getting jobs.\n\nAs a life experience, the PhD was definitely worth it for me! The experience of moving to a new city by myself (I did my undergrad and master's relatively close to home) was something I needed at the time, even though I'm back in my home town now. Now that COVID has us grounded for the foreseeable future, I'm soooo glad I used the opportunity to travel a bunch during my PhD. My school had really generous conference funding, so I was able to leverage that into some longer trips. As an English PhD, I had no lab commitments, and I had a fsirly distant relationship with my adviser, so once I finished coursework I'd just skip town for months at a time without telling anybody lol. I still finished the PhD in four years despite spending a cumulative 5-6 months backpacking overseas during that time! I think the travelling actually kept me motivated to be more productive when I was home. My dissertation topic was really fun. There were definitely challenging points early in the research process, but once I got going with the writing I was able to keep up the momentum. I only published one article based on the diss but it's gotten a decent amount of engagement and I'm happy with that.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I did the PhD, but I think a big part of it was the timing. I finished at 28 and I'm a bit immature for my age so it just felt like I was continuing to \"self-discovery\" phase you're expected to have during undergrad.",

(Have worked projects re: how to effectively communicate with the public in order to mobilize action.) Right now I\u2019m meandering a little, but it\u2019s ultimately brought to an interest in politics and education. Just trying to figure out the best way to make an impact, and it sounds like consulting might be the way to get involved with people and groups that I believe in while bringing my own expertise to the table. Thanks for your answer. \n\nHow do you find that your STEM PhD does or doesn\u2019t help you in what you\u2019re doing now? (e.g. your knowledge base, your skills, etc.)",

It would mean not only removing my PhD from my listed education, but most of my work experience too (teaching and other nont-teaching academic jobs). My MA was in the same field, so if an employer really has a problem with it, then that's eight years of my life in a black hole instead of six. It would also leave me unable to express my mastery of all of the skills I had to learn over the course of the PhD.\n\nThis isn't to say that I and other people in this situation aren't trying to find a solution. But our (failed?) attempts to approach the non-academic job market are not the root issue here. The actual problem is that employers decide who starves in the street and who doesn't, and many of them have decided to hold PhD's to different standards than the rest of the applicant pool. I doubt they will receive any pushback for their prejudice, given that everyone else stands to benefit from the reduced competition. But given how quickly demand changes for specific fields/industries, there needs to be a better way to 'start over' so to speak.\n\nOn the other hand, the other recent graduates from my department are all enjoying success in academic and industry jobs. I think a big factor in this is how important networking is to finding employment. And through diligence I did have a pretty solid network back in the US. However, right before COVID I moved to Northern Europe to be with my partner, and now I'm facing another networking-driven job market with no ability to network. So my pessimism is in part due to putting myself between a rock and a hard place, I admit. But man, I would take a minimum wage job just to have some stability right now, but I don't think I have any way to get one with my work history.",

He says he feels like a researcher still and that he is still solving complex math problems all day but now has a far better environment, pay, and better hours. Unlimited PTO, flex can work remotely whenever he wants, structured hours so not working at all times, etc. And he likes that he's solving problems that have a real time impact. Most of his team has PhDs.\n\n\nI was in a PhD program too in a different field, quickly realized I wouldn't want to pursue an academic track in that field alone, but decided to \"masters out\" and go to law school because so much of my research intersected with law and so many of my desired outcomes would also be better served by a JD. With my MA, I was still able to work in some relevant areas and didn't realize beforehand how much of a boost that alone would give me, but now I honestly love my JD program and I have a dream now of being a law professor at the intersection of where my grad school research was and law. So I guess I'm the reverse of this question, where I decided to leave a PhD but may still want to pursue academia, lol. I also find a number of both professors and practitioners\n who have my MA/JD combo, many of whom had the same experience as me of mastering out and taking up law, so it's been a surprisingly useful networking device.",

I'm behind on lifetime earnings and savings relative to my peers who didnt do PhDs, and I am not sure if I will be able to _ever_ catch up. I'm still yet to find a job that actually utilizes the skills and knowledge that I got from my PhD - academia is saturated to hell, and I didnt do a postdoc.

The first job I was able to get was in management consulting (which had nothing to do with my PhD). I left that company after a year and a half when they announced they were closing down the office and moving to a significantly higher COL area with no adjustment to the absurdly low salary.

Could I have got into the same role without it? I think so. Would I have the breadth of experience, or authority? Probably not. I probably could have earned a few more quid going into industry straight after undergrad, but fuck it - that's life!",

I spent five years in an amazing country working on interesting research. Don't regret it at all.\n\nProfessionally, it's hard to say. It did help me get my current job, but the alternative would have been spending several more years as a software architect leading into whatever that would lead into, and I will likely never make up those lost earnings, even if getting the PhD ultimately has a higher ceiling on my career progression (which is itself debatable).",

Can you still publish papers independently?\n\n4. Can you describe your Ph.D journey in brief if possible(any ups or down facing anxious),did you had masters before that,how much autonomy does one get to research on what one wants rather than what advisor tells you to?\n\n5. Did you had clarity that you wanted to get into industry after Ph.D,didn't you feel being left out of fast paced industry\n\n6. Do you think most people are getting into industry after Ph.D rather than in academia due to financial reasons\n\nThanks",

              "text": "Not sure whether I'd say I was a professor or not. My job was with a non-profit research institution affiliated with a university. I did have a joint appointment to the university with something like a \"Visiting Professor\" title, but it was a permanent position. I taught 1-2 classes a year and otherwise just worked on my research.\n\n1. The PhD does help a bit in my day to day work, but my job doesn't involve active research anymore. My current role is Director of Data Science for a publicly traded company. I help steer the work we're doing, but it's decidedly not research in the classic sense, and I don't publish at all. More than half of the job is what in the academic world we'd call \"administration\" (budgeting, people-management, negotiating contracts, etc.).\n\n2. I could publish work I do in my own time. If it were company paid work, I'm actually not sure. It's just not really part of the job description and I never bothered to ask.\n\n3. The PhD journey was a little rocky. I did an undergrad and masters (in a completely different area of Computer Science) at a lower tier university and then got a normal job. About a year later, I had gotten interested in a particular new area that's now considered part of Machine Learning I'd been reading about and decided I'd try for a PhD. I was accepted at a university with a pretty big name in that field, but at that point, I had no real idea how to be a researcher, and I'm not sure he was used to dealing with a student coming in quite that green. So I felt like I wasn't making progress (I'm sure he would agree), and I didn't really have a productive way to channel that into any tangible improvement, so instead I spent some time watching a lot of Simpsons reruns and then bailed. I landed what was basically an adjunct job while I was going to figure out what was next, and over the course of that year, started to figure some things out a little better. I also had some really supportive colleagues who helped talk my confidence back up a bit, and I applied to a different university to basically restart the PhD, and at that point, it was extremely smooth sailing. I was still a bit slow to finish, as my project funding from the military was cut when I was ABD, and I went to work full time as a software engineer while I finished the writeup, and that six months took me two years, but I was publishing quite a lot, and overall it was a great experience.\n\n4. So for the last two years of my PhD, I was in industry writing software. I kept that job for two years after finishing the PhD as well. During that time, I continued to collaborate with colleagues on my own time and published more papers, went to conferences, etc. I still very much wanted to be in academia, but it was exhausting. At some point, I figured I had to just do it or stop trying, so I applied for academic jobs, got a few interviews, and took a job in Europe. I was there for five years, and really enjoyed *most* of the work. Two things happened: I met my (now) wife, and for a handful of reasons, it made some sense to consider moving back to the US. And secondly, I had landed a grant from the EU a few years prior, which was my first taste of life as a more senior academic, and there was quite a lot about that I didn't enjoy. I had the same experience a lot of new faculty have -- I'm hiring students to do what I wanted to do while I'm just begging for money for the next project that I'm at best half-interested in. So I talked to a few people, and ended up taking an industry position back in the US that, as I mentioned, uses my skills, but is wholly outside of the research world really. I still miss the fun parts of my job, and I liked living there more than I like the US, but I don't miss the 60% pay cut and constant begging for money.\n\n5. I don't know that I have any special insight here, but I would guess that most people who go to industry after a PhD are doing it because they were forced to. They probably did a PhD because they wanted a TT faculty job, and they slammed into a job market in which like three universities produce enough PhDs every year to fill every open position in the United States, and faced with making $8000 a year with no health insurance or finding a real job, they choose wisely.\n\n\n**Edit:** Just realized that in all that, I didn't really answer your question about what the PhD was like. In short, it varies wildly depending on your advisor and situation. My (first) advisor very much took the approach that finding a good problem to work on is part of the training, and while he would help you, that was your conversation to drive. I think that's a healthier approach, but it was a recipe for failure with me at the time (my own fault -- don't take that as criticism). I had friends who in their first meeting with their advisor, had a 30 minute conversation about their interests, and then he grabbed a folder out of a file cabinet, handed it to them, and said, \"Solve this problem and you get your PhD\". I think the most common thing is that you're hired to work on an existing grant, and over the course of your studies, you carve out some piece of that work that is your own contribution, and that becomes your research.",
