  "text": "Hello everyone\nMay I ask you for some comment or advice on that matter.\n\nI am doing my PhD since 2019 in the subject of molecular biology. I am at the end stage of my PhD.\n\nDespite the harsh beginning, I put really a lot of effort to become very good in laboratory work and I started spending a lot of time within the lab working at the bench within the 1st year of my PhD until now.\n\nMy supervisor was saying from the beginning that he wants us to release between 2-3 research articles + 1 review. And that he will help us with that. Throughout my PhD, I was involved in 3-4 different projects. Although, it was hard, I was really engaged in all of them because I remembered his words about the publications.\n\nIn addition to this, because we had no post-docs, I was responsible for the preparation of buffers and reagents, as well as the management of the stock in my lab.\n\nThroughout my PhD there were another 3 students who were very negligible about the \"condition\" of our lab. One of them who helped me quite a lot left because of the conflict with supervisor.  After that, whenever some reagent finished, I had to take care of that myself. In addition to this, they come to the lab very spontaneously, and sometimes they can come to the lab only 2-3 times throughout the whole week\n\nNow, roughly 6 months before the finish of my stipend, during the lab meeting, he pointed out that the \"lab members\" have to start attending the lab regularly. His statement was a bit more elaborate, however, It made me feel like I am the one being targeted. In addition to this, I was then asked to come to the lab on some specific day to take care of the master student and do the experiment. I said that \"I cannot, because I want to focus on writing my thesis this week\". He was all surprised and repeated to me I need to come to the lab. I explained to him again that \"at the beginning of the PhD I was told that there is a benchwork period and writing period, and now I want to focus on writing because I am lagging behind with that\" (especially compared to the PhD students who haven't been coming to the lab that often).\n\nAlso meantime I was preparing some review articles. I sent it to him for some feedback, however, feedback wasn't very helpful, and usually was saying to add something more. Now I ended up with a big chunk of text, that I do not really know how to handle. I believe I need more help with that, but it is not coming.\n\nI talked with him again recently, and I said that I am happy to still sacrifice some time for my \"main\" lab project because I hope to have it published. The supervisor said that the process is not that simple and it might take another 3-6 months before we manage to publicize it.\n\nI am not familiar with the publication process or how to assemble a good \"paper\", because It is my first time doing it. And since I am a PhD student, I require some help with that.\n\nOn the end it seems like I spent 3 years, gathering data for my boss for different projects, while, he did not help me to publicate anything, not even a review paper which would make me more employable.\n\nI will add that my supervisor had some conflicts with his employees which made them quit.\n\nI know that it might sound \"one-sided\", but this is really how I feel. I talk with my secondary supervisor, and he shared the idea that my supervisor has his own agenda that he follows. \n\nWhat should I do about this, should I forward an official complaint on him to the University. Or maybe I just complain too much?\n\nPlease help, Thanks",

      "text": "This is going to sound harsh, however take it from someone who's been in your shoes. What you have to do from now on is prioritize YOU. Take charge of whatever project seems most promising in terms of publication and absolutely grind out whatever is needed to get good data out of it for a month or two and add that data to the manuscript if needed. It's good you have a draft at hand so you can focus on it for that one or two months. After that, submit it to a journal and shift to your thesis and focus on that to the exclusion of all else. From your post, it looks like he doesn't respect your efforts to \"help\" the lab and it seems the other students don't as well so why should you care? Take charge, prioritize your time and increase your efficiency. Focus your efforts on work that is meaningful to your publication and thesis. You only have 5 months and you cannot bank on an extension.",

I don't see anything that sounds like your PhD advisor is taking advantage of you.",

I don't enjoy cleaning or keeping lab stocks, but I think it's a normal part of the job. It should be shared equally with other people in the lab, if it's not ask the PI to define tasks and distribute them equally or make a rotation. It's also normal/good to do some side projects apart from the main one described in the stipend. \n\nYou're not working in the lab and writing papers for your supervisor, you do it for your own career, for the satisfaction of advancing science, for the taxpayers/patients/associations that pay for the research. Your supervisor is right that 3 papers is a good minimum target to get a PhD. If you want to stay in science, you need to also think and push hard to make these papers impactful. The job of the PI is to provide the environment where you can conduct the research, your job is to make the papers, and he needs/wants those as much as you do, but you rely on each other doing your jobs. A supervisor exploiting you would be him making you spend most of your time doing his teaching or grant writing for then submitting in his name, stuff like this. I might not grab all the subtleties of your situation, but sounds like he is pushing you to do the lab work that is good for your own future from your description..",

Why he does not say \"ok listen, you just focus on writing now, and on the side do few experiments\" He rather give me some new project which are vaguely connected to my main project, and I cannot put it in my final thesis anyway.\nAs many people mentioned here, releasing a paper or writing it is important skill, I do agree with that. However I was never given a time to do practice \"PhD level writing\". Whenever I was taking day or two to write, I was being asked \"where are you, you should be in the lab\" by my supervisor. This resulted in me refrain from sitting in the office because I thought lab work is most important. Now I am stressing because there are neither enough results for a solid research article, nor I have enough thesis written.",

I don't know what you think that would look like but there isn't typically time set aside for students to practice writing. You practicing writing is you writing your thesis. \n\nI think it's very clear you and your supervisor aren't communicating at all. The fact you've decided to go off and write up and he wasn't aware of that decision is alarming, and ultimately is his fault. Furthermore, you seem to think you've been working towards several papers but he hasn't said anything about those. However, you have to manage the relationship as well and I think you've got yourself into a mental headspace of \"but I did all the cleaning when the other students didn't, and I've done some labwork so why can't I have a PhD\" but that's not what a PhD is about. \n\nI think you need to sit down with your supervisor and talk through what his expectations are about the thesis and papers.

You chose to make buffers and clean the lab, that was your choice but has absolutely nothing to do with whether you're ready submit your thesis. Your focus on what everyone else is doing and resentment about making buffers and cleaning does make me wonder what is going on in your meetings with your supervisor. \n\nYou're saying he's neglecting you and letting you go but elsewhere you say he's insisting you come into the lab. He sounds like a very poor manager, he clearly hasn't been mentoring you, and he isn't being clear with you, but I do also wonder if you're not really listening to what he's saying. It sounds to me like he's saying you need to do more work and is switching off when you don't engage on that. It's not possible for anyone here to say if you're ready to write up and leave, you need to figure that out with your PI. I would say based on what you're saying here you don't have a very clear vision of what a PhD should look like, which I blame your PI for to some extent, but I don't know your work. Ultimately, a PhD is about working towards independent research and judging when you are ready to submit is something you have to decide yourself. If you truly feel you're ready to write up you should go do that. If you feel you do need more work then perhaps going back to the lab is a good idea.",

      "text": "From what I can tell, based on the information you provide, there has been a bit of a mismatch in your communication with your supervisor. Plenty of PIs tend to be overtly optimistic in how fast you can carry out an experiment or write a chapter, and it seems to me that the focus on your main project got a bit lost to him.\n\nTo play the devil's advocate, and as others have pointed out, please consider the following points;\n\n1. It is normal to have lab tasks, and it seems like he was actually trying to get every student back in the lab, not just you. You may feel it was unfair you were putting in the effort for a functioning lab, but if you hadn't done it, you wouldn't have been able to do the experiments yourself either. I make my own buffers all the time, it is a great way of quality control because I know exactly what and how I made it so I can make adjustments if things go to heck in a handbasket. Look at your lab efforts from that angle, instead of comparing how hard other people work on their project / in the lab according to you, as it also has nothing to do with your own project or work, you need to let this one go.\n2. There is not really a concrete thing as a bench period and a writing period set in stone, unless this is something you explicitly agreed upon with your supervisor (as in, an actual timeline with dates). Do you have such an agreement? If yes, you can cite it to him and ask him about it, if not, you'll need to talk to him about it.\n3. Being a PhD is not just doing the experiments, it is also having a certain level of independence, ranging from setting up experiments, reading papers, to data analysis and writing manuscripts. For a final year PhD student, you seem to depend a bit on this PI. From what I can tell, he actually is helping you with feedback, but it is up to you what you do with it and at that stage you should be able to manage this. If you feel overwhelmed, ask for help, if you can't ask your current PI, ask a senior researcher / post doc on a similar project. Being able to ask for help when you're stuck is also a sign of independence.\n4. Your PI is also correct that the process of publication takes a few months; this has to do with the fact that you send in the manuscript to a journal, the journal has to decide whether it fits their scope, then they have to gather reviewers, those reviewers need to read your manuscript and will comment on it, you need to go through the criticism and adjust your manuscript, do this a few rounds and then hopefully your paper gets accepted. This is a best case scenario which already takes time, if your paper gets rejected somewhere along this process you start all over again with the submission to a new journal.\n\nThose were a lot of points and it is not my intention to make you feel bad or to make you feel like you are being criticized. I do not have the full scope of what is going on, I do understand you are frustrated with the way things are going. You need to learn how to prioritise your own project and how you can effectively communicate that to your PI.\n\nMy advice: I would hold off making an official complaint as this would absolutely sour the relationship you have with your PI to the point that it cannot be salvaged, it is a last resort measure you can take when nothing else works. Your issue seems to be a mismatch in expectations and poor communication from both sides which can definitely be resolved.\n\nMy recommendation would be: focus on your main project (as that is your PhD subject), and talk to your PI together with an independent third party to come to a mutual beneficial agreement. In my country (in Europe but not the UK) we have PhD coordinators just for that. Do you have people like this in the UK? Or is there a senior lab member you can trust and who wants to mediate?\n\nI wish you the best of luck with all this, doing a PhD is incredibly hard and it takes a lot from you. Treat this as an opportunity to grow, not just academically but also professionally and personally.",

Being involved in several projects is normal because there is always the option one might fail. \nSo Yea cleaning and these things suck especially if you get no help but nothing what you describe is something that your PI takes advantage of you. \nTalk to him one on one tell him if he wants a well running lab everyone has to take on something or he needs to hire a designated lab manager. In the end I see not the slighted ground for a complaint\n\nEdit : in terms of publication I know very few that publish more than 1-2 paper during their PHD. Time is short and therefore maybe his expectations were still based on the US system. However, I see little issue to move on with just 1 paper from the PhD. However talk to him about expectations and that you get at least that one paper published. It\u2019s however a bit unclear from what you say if the project you work on deliver publishable data. Because if not that might be the reason he lets you continue working to get the data needed.",

The publishing process takes time, I am not sure what you were expecting? He can try to help you publish, but the data has to be there. Just working hard doesn't guarantee you will have something publishable in a fairly short time frame.

The variety lost in this is made up for during the combination of your masters and postdoc. But bad supervisors don't have enough lab members to cover all of the things they want to do, particularly if they don't have postdocs, so they get PhDs to do extra work on top of their project.

Does he want you to stay in the lab past 3 years without no funding (I would agree this is unreasonable)? Does he want you to graduate and defend without putting a manuscript out? Is there an option to keep working on experiments throughout your funding period while writing your thesis, and try to get the manuscript published after you graduate?\n\nSurely you cannot be the first grad student in your program who isn't able to get a paper all the way to publication in 3 years.

Be confident on your work and write with what you have now. You may want to draft a plan to tell a story describing your dataset, then fill each section. There is no particular time to write as often people may do this whithin the day, along side with experiments until thesis write up. Now find what works for you.\nUnfortunately, it is more common than you think to have few to no or useless feedback, particularly when it is not the PI pet critic path/project (it is YOUR PhD). If you think so, seek help from other trusted researchers (be careful with your data / paper not been stolen) and thank them.\nThe thing is unfortunately, it seems to be communication problem between the PI and you. Did you took the 2-3, papers as a promise that as soon as those experiments are done, you can write your papers? Your PI might have been a terrible manager (many in academia are) or his advising style does not jut match your needs, but you learned the hard way here that you can't just blind trust your PI and need to be proactive and strategic, seek help outside if needed, read, etc. The PI is not always right, even if she may often be.
