  "text": " \n\nIs there any benefit to going into academia? I stumbled across this sub a few weeks ago and had been browsing popular posts and comments that all appear to highlight the negative aspects and stresses associated with an academic career.\n\nFor context, I\u2019m an Australian that completed my undergraduate at the end of last year and have been working clinically in my sport and exercise role for almost 12 months but have been very keen on getting into academia via masters by research or mPhil with either a subsequent or upgrading masters to PhD (either in public health, cancer research in relation to exercise or more specific. (Honours is not a financially viable route fo me). \n\nI have tried to start transitioning into the space with some other projects and research assistant work on the side but reading through some of these experiences have really given me some cause for concern about my desired career choice.",

I really like what I do. However, as years passed, and this is my 6th year in academia (2y masters, 4y phd), I now that I want stability and comfort more than I love science. My area, unfortunately, does not have as many options as in the past, plus there is zero possibility of me finding a research-only position, everything is mostly focused on teaching, which I really dislike. This made me \"broaden my view\", and I started to look \"the other world\", of regular jobs, industry and whatever.\n\nBasically, this rambling is more to say that No, life isn't as bad as it seems, and Yes, you might enter a MSc. or a PhD and you might change your mind due to whatever reason, and that's okay too, won't mean that your MSc. or PhD was a complete waste of time/money, really.",

On one hand you have a lot more financial stability as a prof (although if you live in a high cost of living area you likely will not be able to buy and you often have family to pay for). On the other the work stress is in an entirely different plane of hell: being responsible for a whole lab is incredibly stressful.  Teaching workload is miles beyond anything you've experienced as a student, purchasing equipment and finances, dealing with HR, and departmental BS. It's honestly overwhelming and what breaks you is realizing there is no reasonable way for a single human to do it without having to half ass something.\n\nThe question I ask myself daily is: \"what thing can I put off today that will not result in hurting someone?\". Being a PhD student often means worrying about yourself a lot,  being a faculty member means you're responsible for hundreds.",

      "text": "Of course. If you can get an academic career and you enjoy research and teaching, then it can be very fulfilling. There are also definite perks to the job, such as having more control over your schedule than most others.\n\nThe problem though is that there just aren't very many jobs and most people who go to graduate school and dedicate 5-7 years of their life to it will never find stable, longterm employment as academics. For context, from what I've heard my field has something in the realm of 500 applicants per job, and there are about 100 or so jobs posted each year worldwide. Some fields fare better than others, but regardless your odds aren't great. These jobs are also disappearing as tenure gets eroded and universities rely more and more on poorly compensated adjuncts and lecturers that lack stable and reliable employment.\n\nIt is also a job that requires pretty major sacrifices that many other careers don't. You more or less have to give up control over where you live. With so few jobs, you go wherever you can find employment, and it's not uncommon for people to end up in tiny college towns with little to recommend them. There's also the years of graduate school and then usually several more years (sometimes upwards of a decade) of bouncing between short-term adjunct and visiting professor gigs. So there's a real possibility you won't really settle down until your late 30s or early 40s, which for many is a dealbreaker, especially if they have partners or an interest in starting a family. Lastly, the pay just isn't comparable to industry.\n\nSo there is good and bad about academia. But the criticisms and complaints about academia are all, I think, valid ones. It isn't a good time to be an early career or aspiring academic, to say the least.",

I've heard Australia is one of the best countries for academia.\n\nI started a research masters (social sciences) in Sydney, then decided it wasn't for me, but mostly because of burnout and mental health and attempting it directly after a very long stressful undergrad experience. I liked the environment in the master's, the people I met, plenty of scholarships available, and it would've greatly increased my job opportunities if I continued with it. Are there specific jobs you want that require post-grad/research qualifications? Or for moving up in your current work?\n\nAlso keep in mind that anywhere on the internet, for any topic, people are more likely to post when they need support or they're having a bad time. People who are loving academia aren't necessarily on here asking questions about what a good time they're having. So the perspective is a bit biased.",

Yes, getting a fulltime academic position in Aus (either in research, teaching or hybrid) is probably more secure than in the US, but these jobs are still few and far between and notoriously hard to get still. \n\nPay is certainly good (factoring in cost of living which has only increased due to the housing and rental markets) but for many academics in Aus unis, the reality is most will be adjuncts on short-term contracts or casual researchers chasing the elusive lecturer positions to get a foot in. And most will not succeed.\n\nFor some stats about the higher education crisis in Aus right now:\n\n- [40,000 university jobs have been cut in 2021](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-09-13/covid-job-cuts-at-universities-prompting-fears-for-future/100447960), driven by Covid-19 and the fact that Australian universities rely on international students. Many of the cuts were full-time and permanent positions as well as casual/fixed contract.\n\n- Restructures have been occurring in most of the R1 and R2 universities pretty consistently in the past 5 years.\n\n- [Approximately 10,000 PhDs graduate in Australia every year, with as many at 65K PhD students enrolled in Australian Universities at any one time.](https://theconversation.com/its-time-to-reduce-the-number-of-phd-students-or-rethink-how-doctoral-programs-work-68972) And there about 50K staff employed in full-time or fixed-term positions for the entirety of the Australian academic workforce. \n\n- [In Australia, around 51% of PhDs go into industry and the numbers leaving academia are increasing](https://algorithm.data61.csiro.au/where-are-australias-phd-students/). \n\n- In 2013, [less than 5% of Australian casual academics were paid to do research](https://melbourne-cshe.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/2564262/2016-contingent-academic-employment-in-australian-universities-updatedapr16.pdf) (not teaching roles), despite the fact that casual academics make up most of the academic workforce in Australia. \n\n- The current Federal Government isn't exactly known for being supportive of R&D or the educated. [Australian Universities were exempt from jobkeeper in 2020 and 2021](https://theconversation.com/should-i-stay-or-should-i-go-academics-facing-this-dilemma-should-ask-themselves-3-questions-166750), adding enormous pressure to said casual staff and those on short-term contracts.\n\nI always advise that if you aim to get into academia long-term, Australia or not, you will need back up plans. Because unfortunately, you will probably have to use them.",

For tenured academics in my field, salaries are reasonably comfortable, you have lots of free time, and the work is generally pretty interesting.\n\nOne big caveat to all the above is that I went to a top 10 program in the US with a decent placement record, and made a point of working with an advisor who had a good reputation for getting his students jobs. Another caveat is that I think I'm temperamentally suited to the academia insofar as I'm pretty gregarious, I've got a fast mouth, and I'm flexible about what I work on, all of which helped a lot. A huge amount of humanities academia comes down to networking and positioning of your research, and that's something a lot of people don't realise until it's too late.",

      "text": "There's a lot of angles to this, so here goes.\n\nAcademia has a huge number of deep and entrenched issues, some of which are getting substantially worse with time. THe commoditisation of education goes strongly against the ethics of many of us, which puts us in direct conflict with the senior management (and direction of travel) of our organisations.\n\nThe casualisation of staff has become a growing issue; universities have realised they can basically offer terrible working conditions and short contracts because there are so many people willing to work in them they will take crap pay and conditions.\n\nThe vast changes in working conditions and organisational structure have led to a lot of very bad advice being given out over the last 15 years or so, by senior colleagues who have no appreciable grasp of what the current environment looks like.\n\nGetting into academia has huge opportunity cost associated with it. You are outside the main workforce for a long time, and you are often expected to move geographically. THat can separate you from your support networks, and make the entire thing hard work. You might ahve to do that multiple times.\n\nAnd being an academic expects you to be great at a huge variety of things. Not quite astronaut level, but getting there. YOu have to be able to come up with novel research ideas, build them in to projects, write fundable grant documents, and then either carry out the research or build a manage a team that can. You often have to be able to work collaboratively, as well as on your own. You need outstanding time management. You have to be able to teach, and mentor. You need a solid grasp of your area of specialism such that you can justifiably call yourself a world expert on it. You need to be able to engage with committee work running your department, faculty, university, academic societies, journals and so on. You need to be able to write academic papers to a publishable quality. Understandably, no-one (or at least very few people) can excel at all of these things. That leads to conflict, disappointment, and frustration.\n\nAcademic jobs can be wonderful. You can get a level of autonomy unheard of almost anywhere else. You get to work on exciting problems, and solve real issues for the world. \n\nBut academia is not a monolith. Different institutions, and even different schools and departments within the same institutions can have vastly different cultures. Some can be supportive and open and wonderful. Others can be closed, back-stabbing and toxic. MAny are just ineffectual and insular. This depends strongly on who the staff int eh department are, and how they engage with one another. Culture can be changed with relatively small changes in staff. Academia *can* select for people who like working on their own, don't enjoy social interaction, or people who feel they are better than those around them. Those are unpleasant traits to put in high concentrations. I've been fortunate to never work in departments led by these kinds of individuals, but I've certainly come across them. Interestingly, they overwhelmingly populate the old white man chaired professor tier (and are not even a majority there). So I have hope for the future.\n\nOn the other end of the scale we sometimes find ourselves dealing with a variety of student issues. Whether it's undergrads with an absurd sense of entitlement, postgrads who have not grasped what a research degree is supposed to be about, or ourselves or colleagues who are shit or struggling at one or multiple parts of the job (see earlier paragraph).\n\nThe most important thing going forward is that people go into this route with their eyes wide open. A career in academia is - these days - as much down to luck as it is perseverence. Did your project happen to hit on a timely and important finding? Was your paper published before the competing group? Did your grant go into a sympathetic panel, or get a reviewer who liked your work? Did the job opening come up when you were about to hit the market? Was the job opening in your particular niche? Was it in a geographical area you were able to move to? \n\nIt is not all sunshine and rainbows. Similarly, it's also not all the colossal honking pile of dogshit that it can be made out to be. But it also varies by place, by time, by field, and by how you approach it.",

The distribution is more bimodal with spread - either a really shit cog-in-the-wheel job with idealistic aspirations / delusions of grandeur, or King of My Castle with personal minions or ridiculous privilege. It seems (at least in some places) like the middle ground of just a basically interesting, fulfilling academic job, where you're not being jackbooted-in-the-face by workload and moral injury, is thinning out.\n\nSo for any particular individual: you need to determine whether you're a rising star with all the needed support, or not, and make the smart decision accordingly.\n\nEdit: And if you don't know how or when to determine that: be aware you're starting with a handicap. But I think the natural point to jump away from academia is like one or two years max after getting the PhD, if at that point you're not on a clear trajectory to the \"haves\" side of the distribution. That used to be the pretty explicit rule when I was doing my PhD - you get the first big grant or you get out.

There was a genuine sense that *people* valued the quality of each other's ideas and work over their qualifications of job title. I stress *people*, because the organisational structures really didn't reward good ideas and good work. But I felt valued by the people around me, and that counts for a lot.\n\nIt's also good for the ego. I enjoyed telling people I worked for a good university. I enjoyed publishing journal papers.
