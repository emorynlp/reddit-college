  "title:": "How do I publish now that I've left academia?",
  "text": "Earlier this year I left my academic postdoc. I now work in an industry R&D job.\n\nHowever, I still enjoy publishing original research, and I've been working on some projects using largely in silico studies. This work is 100% unrelated to my industry work and there is literally no overlap.\n\nMy question is whether or not there is any roadmap for how I could continue to publish as an independent scientist? Will journals waive fees as I'm completely unfunded? Can I publish using a personal email address as my contact? What do I put as my affiliation?\n\nAs far as I can tell, I can use a personal email address, and some journals seem to have no fees to publish or, more commonly, waive them in certain instances. Any insight is appreciated, especially regarding contact info/affiliation, as I certainly don't want to publish my home address as my contact in any manuscripts I manage to get accepted.\n\nI also recognize publishing as a solo scientist can be quite difficult and a slow process. I have no illusions regarding how relatively slow my productivity will be doing this just in my free time. However, it's for fun and self-actualization purposes, so even if I only get one small paper accepted every 3-6 years, I'd be more than satisfied.",

      "text": "Same as before.\n\nYou do not need any affiliation for publishing. So, you can be an \"Independent Researcher\" with your own email address, and still publish. This is what I am (partially) doing. Perhaps I would recommend to have your own webpage (where you put your interests, papers, etc.) and your own address, and not a Yahoo or hotmail address :)\n\nRegarding fees, this will be journal dependent, and you will need to ask. I personally publish in journals where there is no publication fee (but the papers are not open access). However, I always put a preprint online which I regularly update so that people can still access my papers for free. This is allowed by the journals I publish in.\n\nFinally, regarding paper output, you can still collaborate with other people. I have several collaborations running at the moment, and this helps with keeping the output at a reasonable level.\n\nEdit. I am in STEM.",

              "text": ">Can someone confirm for my curiosity that the fee in STEM is also for open source, not for publishing in general?\n\nNo, that's not accurate.  Many legitimate scientific journals charge money just to publish with them that has nothing to do with whether the paper will be open source or not.  These are generally referred to as \"page charges.\"  If you have no grant funds you can apply for the page charges to be waived, but there's no requirement or guarantee that the journal will do so.  Officially, page charges are meant to defray the cost of the journal running the peer review and publishing process, but we all suspect that it's just another way for the journal to make money.  If you don't want to pay page charges, then you always have the option of submitting to a journal that doesn't have page charges, but unfortunately a lot of the higher quality and more well regarded journals do have them.",

Page charges were common when journals were actually printed, and it was to offset the cost of printing.  Now that 95% of ALL academic journals are on line, the concept of a page charge has generally gone.  There may be remnants of it in some places, but it is by no means common, and certainly in no way do an \"overwhelming majority\" of people pay them.\n\nThere are currently two publication methods.  They are called open access and subscription.  You almost never pay fees to publish in a subscription journal.  Those journals make their publisher money by people (mostly libraries) paying a fee (a subscription) to get access to the articles in that journal.  That 10 million paid to Elsevier was to obtain access to their subscription journals.   It is why you can only access certain papers through your University IP.\n\nBasically open access is author pays, subscription is reader pays (directly or through their library).",

I had to do this when I knew I was leaving a position in May and wouldn't start my next one until September, but I had several papers in for review.  Waiving publication fees typically only happen for people in developing countries, but it never hurts to ask an editor if they have something for unfunded, independent researchers.  \n\nI would say the biggest thing is to make sure you clear things with your job.  Even though everything you think there is no overlap, they may have a very different idea of what they think they own of your intellectual property.  I would also be prepared to document how you did not use any company resources or time to work on anything (e.g., you never used company server time, you never logged in to your servers through the company network or using your work computer, access logs show nothing was done during work hours, etc.).  Maybe you have a completely cool company and they won't care about any of this, but better to find out if they are going to be jerks about this up front than after the fact.",

      "text": "One approach that I don't think has been mentioned here is volunteering with an academic lab. I have done this in the past. It is easier if you know someone in the lab, especially the professor.  In short, universities can just give you a an unpaid position and title like \"Visiting Scholar\" that allows you to use their affiliation in your publishing. Practically speaking, this makes it easier to publish. I have done this before to assist friends with research in their labs. It's free labor for them, and it looks good on your CV. It's good for everyone involved, assuming it is research that you genuinely want to do for free.",

Can't hurt to check, as I know them well enough.",
