      "text": "Yes and no. The old adage has a lot of truth. However, there are counterpoints. For example, in a number of academic situations, being naive has its advantages (in its most blunt form, you solve a problem that had you known better, would have not tried to solve). At some stage in research you need to look inward toward some topic and go down a rabbit's hole. There the feeling of ever-expanding information is replaced by, for example, deep thought on some very specific point. That is you have no time to feel lost in the expanse. Finally, at some stage for everyone, somnolence takes over and your capacity to learn is stifled, and one falls into another status: forgetting more than you learn.",

He knew EVERYTHING -- every technique, every paper, every important person. When I asked, he shrugged, and said, \"Nobody knows. Do the experiment.\"\n\nSo I did! And I think that's when I arrived at the place you're describing. I no longer felt like \"the more you learn, the more you know you don't know.\" I had gotten to the bottom of the problem. Eventually, in academic science, you carve out a little niche of new knowledge that no one else knows. And inside your little niche of expertise, you are pretty comfortable in your knowledge -- or at least the knowledge that no one else knows any better than you do.",

(Something along those lines, according to Socrates.) I like to think about everything I do know and how far I\u2019ve come in that journey because I\u2019ve often felt this way; but fields are changing and new information is always being made available- so be proud of your solid foundation and your knowledge and take pride/joy in the fact that there is always more to learn.

So that\u2019s awesome in and of itself, having a degree; and knowing your entire life you\u2019ll be learning and relearning is pretty exciting but it doesn\u2019t mean you know nothing nor does it mean you\u2019re not intelligent, knowledgeable in your field (and others I\u2019d presume), and you\u2019re not an imposter!
