  "title:": "2nd Masters (mres/mphil) in Europe",
  "text": "I am a mid 30's individual looking to pursue a 2nd masters, but this time in research in management, with field interests in Entrepreneurship/Innovation Management. I don't seem to find too much on Masters in Research (mres) / Masters In Philosophy (mphil) in terms of a general guide for ones in Europe. Though I would love to study in the States, I feel like I want to try my luck by going after some programs in Europe.\n\nI found a few good programs that I am interested in. I just have this hunch that I think that I am missing half the picture for a mres/mphil, like on the reality of those programs.\n\nIs there a comprehensive guide or a book on mres/mphil for general information not specific to a program, but like expectations, locations, supporting organizations and possible funding, etc.?",

Other countries use different nomenclature, often just MA, MSc, or MBA.  For finding degrees: [study.eu](https://www.study.eu) and [mastersportal](https://www.mastersportal.com) both have fairly comprehensive lists and decent search functions.",
