  "text": "Just this month I was invited to review five new submissions from three different journals. I understand that we have an important role in improving the quality of science being published (specially during COVID times), but isn\u2019t it unfair that we do all the work and these companies get all the money? Honestly, I feel like it\u2019s passed time we start refusing to review articles without minimum compensation from these for-profit journals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nField of research: Neuroscience/Biophysics\n\nTitle: Ph.D.\n\n Country: USA",

If I want to drag things out, she might ask if I can be any faster, but if I say, nope, no can do, she says ok. I try not to do that because I'm just hurting myself by not getting data collected or papers out.\n\nThat said, you should expect to work more than the 15-20 hours or whatever that your TA/RA contract says.

It is absolutely insane and abusive. \n\nPeople assuming OP is being malicious for pointing that out is insane. This kind of thinking will keep feeding this machine. Us pals should be more united and have each others backs like in other fields. \n\nOn top of that, salaries received for universities/industry employment should not be factored in. You are producing new information and using that for handing out tenures and such is borderline blackmail, seeing that not everyone will be able to pay fees for publishing in high-impact journals, have time to review and still pay the bills. We should be paid for our services, especially if it\u2019s in this weird cycle. \n\nSadly, it does not look like we will find a solution soon enough. We are kind of trapped in this toxic situation having to overwork for free and having to do it with a smile on our faces.\n\n\nEdit: i do not mean to point fingers, just trying to speak my mind.

(Up to now I've reviewed around 3 times as many papers as I've published and the majority of journals in my subject have 1, or 2, reviewers so I'm \"up\".)\n\nI'll make exceptions for massive breakthroughs or work of students/postdocs who really need it.",

However, the editorial boards are made up from scholars who volunteer their time. So do the peer reviewers. Of course, one could argue not to do any editing or reviewing, if you are not getting paid (they won't pay you anyways and they'll just ask someone else). However, somewhere down the road to grant money or tenure, the number of editorial positons you have held or reviews you have done, become relevant. You'll look like a less \"well-rounded\" candidate when you apply for grants or tenure, if you don't have any of these \"volunteer\" positions on your CV (which at the same time expand your 40 hour workload to a 60(+) hour workload for years).\n\nI do not necessarily agree with this pratice, but I didn't make the rules \ud83e\udd37",

We simply no longer have the bodies to do the PR, to the point where PR is getting kicked down to graduate students at an ever increasing rate.

My personal rule is to exclude society journals from my for-profit boycott.",

The authors get a very limited audience, and also lose the copyright to their own work!\nAfter your post, I think it's lose-lose-lose, cause it's also the reviewers who is being made to work for free without reasonable benefits.\n\nThis is why the world is moving towards Open Science and Open Access. Publishers need to start looking for different ways to make money. Science, by its very nature, must be accessible to society. In Europe, certain projects funded by the public (including government organizations) are mandated to publish open access.
