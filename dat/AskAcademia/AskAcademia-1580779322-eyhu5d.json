My emails consisted introducting myself, mentioning something about their research and where I think I could fit.  If I had a conference coming up, I usually suggested if they were attending then we could meet in person.  Otherwise I included my email and phone number so they could contact me. I also attached my CV.  \n\nMany of the larger labs won't post that they have opening because it is very common to get cold emails inquiring about positions.  And many times it will take a few emails (usually about a week apart) to get a response.  I've had some PI that emails me a no but suggested another lab that was looking that might be a good fit.",

Only 1 was actively advertising for a position so the other 14 were cold as ice - never met them and my advisers didn't know them. I got an interview with the advertising lab and one more interview, so 1 out of 14 cold emails \"worked\". Of the 14 that said no, I got 2 replies saying they didn't have space, the other 12 were radio silence. \n\nAs long as you tailor your emails to their lab and what you could bring to their lab there's no harm in trying. They'll either feel flattered or not read it. \n\nBest of luck!",
