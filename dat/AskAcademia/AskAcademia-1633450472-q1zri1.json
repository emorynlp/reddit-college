  "title:": "How Much Does Prestige Matter in a PhD Program for Chemistry PostDoc/Academia?",
  "text": "I recently started a Chemistry PhD at an extremely prestigious and competitive university that also gave me a somewhat generous fellowship. However, as of late, my mental health has been suffering (even before starting my program) to the point where I've been having suicidal thoughts multiple times a day. I really want to focus on my personal issues, but I don't think I'll be able to adequately address them in my current environment. Consequently, I'm very strongly considering going back to my UG institution (Arizona State) to complete a PhD, where I can be a little more comfortable (socially, academically) and be able to address my mental health. I recognize that switching institutions won't automatically solve all my problems, but I believe that feeling more comfortable and a stronger sense of community would allow me the strength and ability to tackle these long-standing issues. My primary concern is that doing my PhD at less competitive school might harm my chances in securing a job in academia afterwards. I worry that I'm looking for instant gratification, but I don't know if it's worth my current mental anguish. I genuinely love research and science, but I'm just struggling in my current environment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: How much does the prestige of a Chemistry PhD program affect your chances in getting a good PostDoc position/getting hired in Academia? Is it worth struggling through mental health issues?",

      "text": "If you look at existing data for who gets academic jobs and not just people\u2019s \u201chopes and dreams for a fair job market,\u201d academic institution is ENORMOUS for your prospects on the academic market.\n\nIt\u2019s also important for big industry job placement, FYI, but less so.  It much more easily gets your foot in the door on an otherwise identical application.\n\nEdit:  that being said, you can\u2019t apply for a job if you die.  So, obviously take care of your mental health first.  But also be aware that going to a low ranked school/program is almost akin to lighting your academic desires on fire.",

      "text": "I can't address the mental health issues other than to suggest you seek help as soon as you can.\n\nWith regard to prestige: it's overrated. Outside of the biggest name schools there are factors that matter a lot more with regard to getting a job. I'd hire a postdoc recommended to me by a colleague I trust much soon than I would take one based on having attended a school with a good reputation. I'd hire someone who I had an interaction with a conference that impressed me over someone who just went to a big name school.",

      "text": "As others have pointed out, the prestige of where you do your PhD is not the only factor that will affect your career later in life, and it's not even the most important factor, but unfortunately it *is* still a factor.  We know this because the data show clearly that the most coveted jobs in academia (tenure track professorships) are vastly disproportionately held by graduates of fairly small number of allegedly elite programs.  Industry might be different, I don't know.\n\nSo, doing solid research is clearly important, but these other, less essential factors like where you went to school, still do play a role.  Perhaps not a huge role, and hopefully a role that will decline with time, but it would be wrong to think that where you went to school plays no role whatsoever.\n\nGood luck with your situation.",
