  "title:": "How to defend graduate teaching assistants",
  "text": "After months of advocating to university leadership to include graduate teaching assistants in on decisions about whether we hold our classes face-to-face or online (rejected - we are teaching in person while faculty teach online) and pleading for some guidance from HR about documentation of our employee rights (ignored), I learned yesterday - five days before classes start - that myself and my graduate teaching assistant colleagues will have no long term leave if our lives are interrupted by the pandemic. If we are ill beyond 14 days, our contracts will be terminated. \n\nWe had no choice but to teach face-to-face. \nWe do not qualify for FMLA.\nWe have no health insurance through the university. \nAnd now, if we fall ill in a scenario the university constructed, we will lose our jobs. \n\nWe are not unionized, and our graduate student association was kept in the dark about all of this and told we would have the same rights as faculty. \n\nI have two questions about how I should respond to this situation: \n\nAny ideas about how we can productively proceed? All we want at this point is not to get fired if we get sick in the classroom and to be able to use our resources to help the university reopen in a safer way for our entire community. \n\nI value my students and I do not want to disrupt their education, but I am tempted to tell them what the university is doing to the GTAs and then ask that they not come to my class in person unless they absolutely need my help in that format, because it is not a safe space for us. Then, I would host my class online, from the classroom. Would that be unfair to my undergraduate students?",

If 80% of grad student TAs declare that they will teach online, it would be wholly disruptive to the university to find replacements on such short notice, and you are likely safe (though there are still no guarantees).\n\nEven without a union, you can circulate a sign-up for a \"strike\" of teaching online that only goes into effect once a certain threshold (e.g., X number of graduate students) is met.\n\nIf you don't get the numbers you want and choose to teach online for the sake of your own health, don't worry about whether or not it's fair for the students; your health is more important in this case.

Last time, the strike lasted two days (BECAUSE THAT IS HOW LONG A UNIVERSITY CAN FUNCTION WITHOUT GRADUATE STUDENT LABOR; WE DO OVER HALF OF ALL INSTRUCTION THAT HAPPENS ON CAMPUS FOR UNDER TEN PERCENT OF THE TEACHING BUDGET). This time, we authorized a strike but admin caved before it happened. Very few people were around for both of these, but I would say elements of historical collective bargaining and striking were picked over by just about every graduate student on campus in the weeks leading up to our vote to authorize a strike.",

You have to remember that an individual who strikes has to go without pay, with no guarantee of actually accomplishing the goal of the strike.

It's also hard to organize on a dime--my union has been trying to grow membership for several years and is still only at half of the total GA population.\n  \nI would second your suggestion of going through faculty--in my experience, faculty are very supportive of their TAs and TA rights, and also carry a lot more power in the institution.",

Same reason they treat nurses like trash and then shame them when they stand up for themselves (and, as always, a lot of this tends to be gendered and racialized too). I cannot fathom going back into the classroom in September. I don't even think a single Canadian university is reopening in any serious way (beyond small labs, research), in-class undergraduate instruction is donezo for at least this school year. And our COVID infection rates and r0  are miniscule compared to the US. And our healthcare system is more robust and infinitely better for the population. And we're all closed and masked up as a population. \n\nI look to my American colleagues and weep. One of my friends was talking about trying to enforce mask regulations with undergraduates....like just so we're clear here the administration is sending workers to get sick and die. This is just statistically true, and it'll happen, and when it does admin and government will [just.](https://i.imgur.com/Zq0iBJK.jpg) Nobody will take any responsibility, they'll blame the worker, and then maybe they'll say \"we killed them doing what they loved, providing administration with employment via instruction at highly inflated prices.\" \n\nNo, you have to stand up for yourself. And you have to do it together. And it has to be direct action. Don't let some leader say \"oh we can surely reason with them.\" Make the demand, and stipulate the conditions. If they don't meet them, you don't work.",

However, as other have said, there is nothing stopping you from trying to get a group together to discuss working conditions. Practically, this will probably happen on a department level. Is it possible to have a zoom meeting w/ other grad students in your department? And then reach out to friends in other departments? This is daunting/easier said than done, but it is possible. Do you have a grad student association that has any clout? Sympathetic faculty? Getting the other TAs for your class and TAs in your department together is the first step-- best of luck and stay safe.",

Record the lectures and use class time for Q&A or working examples or whatever it is you do in class.  If you don't take attendance, I bet the majority of students will not show up to the face-to-face part.  If someone higher up says something to you, then you explain how you are using a very innovated form of teaching that has literature to back up its effectiveness.",

      "text": "Are you sure this is *real*?\n\nDon't take my comment the wrong way:  I'm sure that the university admin has some stupid/self-defeating policy on paper somewhere, saying this.  But is it *real*? \n\nI've taught at a number of universities, and they *all* have policies like this on paper (for faculty too) that are routinely ignored by everyone, from the department chair on up through the provost.  Often, they are 'cover the University's ass' policies...i.e. they are worded strictly, but only intended to be deployed in the most extreme cases (where there's some fraud or scam going on).  \n\nAs an example, my university (and the one before it) has this policy for *faculty*--14 days sick leave only, and you can be fired after that.  (!)  But it has literally never been enforced or even mentioned... even when faculty would be out for a semester or a year with a debilitating illness.   (in one case, a faculty member was out for two years, on medical leave... so, not full pay... but with the University still covering health insurance, and some partial pay...)  \n\nAlso, it seems *prima facie* a faux policy... because it's just not feasible to fire a graduate teaching assistant who is going to be out for 6 weeks with COVID...  who's going to take over?  It's not an easy thing to \"find\" new TAs, or (even if you have a pool desperate for funding) to slot them into a class that's half over. \n\nIn our department, the DGS is helping to organize TAs into coverage-groups... so that if one TA is out for a month with a serious illness, other TAs in similar courses/subfield, together with the instructor, can step in an help out. \n\nWe're also setting it up so that if an Instructor gets sick, then the TA might step in for a few lectures (or more)... and get a lump-sum bump in pay.  (but we have some money stashed for this, where most universities certainly would not.) \n\nSo, the first thing that *I* would do if I were in your shoes is to get a virtual meeting of the grad students, discuss it, and then elect 2 deputies (2! not 1) to go talk to the department chair, to see if it will be enforced.\n\nMore disturbing to me is the lack of health insurance.  ???  Are you in the United States?  I thought that ALL universities provide health insurance to grad students?  (isn't that required...?  I might be naive here.) \n\nTo all the other people saying \"UNIONIZE!\"...  sure, someday, that's a good idea, I guess.  But it takes a LOT of energy and time to build a grad student union.  A lot.  And it's going to meet a lot of resistance.  Realistically, wouldn't suggest trying to take that on during a global pandemic.  But others would disagree. \n\nSo, check to see if the policy is real, or intending to be enforced.",

I am in the US - the 14 day leave we get is from FFCRA (ordinarily TAs get no paid or unpaid medical leave), and while we are required to have health insurance, the university doesn't provide it. \n\nThe other unfortunate thing is that we have no money for substitutes, and our contracts essentially have \"do teaching things for XX hours\" as the description, so departments can easily redistribute teaching load without hiring new TAs or compensating substitute TAs. Do you think a reasonable thing to advocate for in the future would be more specific job duties so we couldn't be used in this way? I normally am fine stepping in as an unpaid sub, but am now realizing that enables the school to let us get sick. Are other grad TA contracts that vague?",
