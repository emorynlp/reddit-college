  "title:": "Whats your Zero-to-One or Zero-to-Hero Story in Academia Field and What's Your Suggestion to Struggling Students and Fresh Graduates Who Pursue Career in Academia?",
  "text": "Dear Professors, PhDs, Postdoctoral Fellows and Researchers,\n\nI am a master student of Computer Science from a background of Bachelor of Science with GPA 3.35  from Indonesia. My field of interest is in online learning and educational technology. My current research is in Self-Regulated Learning. I aimed to become a researcher for a company or a lecturer in university in Canada/USA/Europe.\n\nI struggle in my study. I had depression with maladaptive daydreaming involved (you can read more on r/MaladaptiveDreaming) that further disrupts my reading comprehension quality. I often fail in my classes due to difficulty in understanding and grasping basic prerequisite concepts (like when I took Machine Learning Classes, I fail to connect them to Statistics and Algebra understanding, which as of today I am continuously trying to grind for better grip). I had passion in helping other people, like teaching. As of today, I managed to publish 2 papers in Scopus Indexed Conferences, all with bitter struggle.\n\nI hope I can hear your stories, from people who now thriving and \"sitting on the cloud\" of their academia career (tenured, appointed as professors, awarded scholarships/grants, etc.), especially from people who once struggle with their academic achievement, financial or even things like procrastination and distraction. Were you able to reach there due to pure luck? (Met with good supervisor or got the scholarship \"the easy way\") or are there other stories (practicing math 40 hours a day? *pun intended :)* ) behind your success? \n\nThis question may seem trivial for you. But as of today, everything is so advanced: new standards, the more narrow expertise in research fields, more interdisciplinary development of fields. In the past, in Indonesia, to be tenured in university, one's only need to get Master Degree in certain field and 3 years experience in teaching. As of today, to become a recognized lecturer (receiving national lecturer identification number/*NIDN*), one needs to publish a ton of paper in nationally accredited journal, peer reviewing journal and had a lot of project in community (just like student, it measured with credit based system). And me, with my struggle and difficulties, finding it overwhelming. And since I dreamed of becoming a researcher for either a company or an university in Canada or USA or Europe, it seems impossible. Your story is valuable for me, or for people who once saw academics purely as genius people (like Terrence Tao or Artur Avila) who jumped around by they merit.\n\nThank you for your understanding.",

      "text": "Unfortunately, in the U.S., \"one needs to publish a ton of paper in nationally accredited journal, peer reviewing journal and had a lot of project in community\" is more or less true if you want to be hired as a research professor in research institutions, as far as I know. Industry-wise, it depends. But if you want to get hired for doing research, at least, publications are like proof for your research skills.\n\nSlightly relevant, I recently read an article on inside higher ed about [academic passion](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2021/11/30/problems-not-showing-enough-love-academic-work-opinion). I would recommend giving it a read.",

      "text": "Pursuing a career in academia is a combination of dogged persistence and pure luck. From my experience, I don't think your setbacks should be a deal breaker. You will need a PhD for an academic career in the countries you've mentioned, which will allow you to make connections and hopefully get a job afterwards. In the UK, many PhD courses don't have exams, which may suit you better than some US-based programmes, for example. It might take some time to find funding, but it's definitely worth trying!\n\nThe best researchers I know aren't necessarily the people who did best in exams, but the people who can think through a problem logically for as long as it takes to find a solution.",

      "text": "Academia is all about rejection. If you can get used to rejection, you might have a better chance of success. It took me five years and maybe twenty rejected applications to attain a PhD scholarship. Once I got that, I had numerous paper rejections before I finally got published. I still have far more rejections than I do papers accepted. After all that, it probably took me another twenty to thirty job applications and four years before I finally got employed at a decent institution. I\u2019m UK based and I\u2019d estimate I applied to 25% of the universities in this country. Get used to rejection and allow it to fuel you.",
