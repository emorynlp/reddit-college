  "title:": "So I got a fat reality check today (\"former\"-ish English prof hopeful)",
  "text": "EDIT: Thank you to all who commented\u2014with both support and practical advice. I\u2019m still quite disillusioned, as I\u2019m sure many prof hopefuls before me have been, but after reading and thinking about your comments & DMs I think I\u2019m beginning to process this situation more levelheadedly. \nTrying out with MAs first, high school teaching, being especially careful w finances\u2014I\u2019ll take all this into account and try to make the best decision. For now, though, I think I\u2019ll try to just focus on my undergraduate studies and not torture myself about the prospects of a career that I may or may not choose, if only for my mental health. If I do end up giving up on academia, then I\u2019d better appreciate my undergrad course as much as I can, while I can.\n\n\nI'm sure you've seen a lot like me on this sub. I'm a current English undergrad @ Oxbridge and have been dreaming of becoming a medieval lit professor. \n\nI didn't have high expectations to begin with, but still just enough to be able to say \"my goal is to be an academic\". So I emailed my prof a couple days ago on applying to graduate schools, and she replied with a warning and a suggestion of a plan B (which I do have with internships and etc, thankfully). \n\nI was crushed... I THOUGHT I knew it was going to be hard; I didn't know enough, apparently, and was expecting at least some sort of encouragement/joy from her that a student was expressing enthusiasm in her field (oh boy!). Then, today, I discovered this sub and read the many harsh pieces of advice on the state of academia and placements. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhich brings me to now. I've been focusing my life and identity on the study of Medieval literature--I just love it so, so much--and now I'm finding myself completely shattered and heartbroken. And I know I should be really grateful to my prof for her realistic reply, but I can't help feeling extremely upset.\n\nStaying on this sub is probably not a good idea now that I've already received my reality check, but I can't stop reading over the posts and comments, hoping to find anything positive, and rn I'm feeling physically sick in my stomach. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can see things more realistically now, I guess, and that's nice, but obviously acknowledging that sth, which has been not only \"THE dream\" but also a central element to my identity, is highly unlikely to ever be attainable hurts. A lot.\n\nEven now, I can't stop thinking \"maybe\"--and I don't know what to do. Not applying to grad school at all seems unthinkable. If I do and get an offer for an MA or PhD though... will I be able to make a smart choice and consider declining it? Should I accept it if it's from a top (Oxbridge/Ivy level prestige) program? My broken mind cannot process this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know it's been a whiny rant--I'm sorry--but I guess one more annoying reddit post can't really hurt. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny warm words/wisdom/advice on how to process and move on from a moment like this would be genuinely appreciated. I'm sat alone in my room during lockdown and feel like I just lost everything.",

Like do not pursue a PhD if all you could or want to do with it is the academic route. I am in STEM, so really not sure what else English PhDs do, but I'd recommend thoroughly researching. And if this is something you are passionate about, you can stay passionate about it while you do something else for a living. The other dose of reality besides the job market is that academics don't just get to sit around all day doing intellectual things. It is an amazing privileged job and I love it, but a lot of BS comes with it. You can have another fulfilling career and pursue this topic as a hobby- might be a lot more enjoyable that way!",

I'm even developing a data science portfolio in my spare time. As much as I enjoy genetics, I also enjoy making money and feeding my family - so banking it all on several years of post-docs and potential tenure is a bit of a risk that I'm not sure I can afford to take. I don't know that literature lends itself to much data analysis, but making sure that you develop skills that can be transferred to other careers is pretty important for any PhD. I saw some stats the other day that only \\~8% of PhDs end up as tenured faculty - meaning that for most of us, plan B is a pretty likely reality. It's not like the \\~92% of PhDs that don't get tenure are unintelligent or lazy - so making it into that 8% through sheer will isn't necessarily feasible.",

That means there isn\u2019t exactly a lot of turnover, and signs seem to indicate that education in general isn\u2019t about to get a drastic increase in funding. So while not all PhDs will apply for faculty positions, there also aren\u2019t necessarily going to be a lot of positions to apply for in the first place (depending on the field), so competition will still likely be fairly high.",

Seriously: I know too many people who completed Ph.D.s then spent 5-10 years as adjuncts hoping to land a TT job. Few of them did, and all of them ended up 35 or 40 years old with no savings, no house, etc.\n\n\nNot OP, but what would you say to somebody who is *already* in their mid, arguably late 20's, and already has no savings and has never had a job or gone even to undergaduate college yet despite graduating high school with good grades, due to a bad and dysfunctional home situation?\n\nI'm immensely enamored with Mesoamerican (Aztec, Maya, etc) history, archeology, and culture, and have pretty much spent the past 4 years researching that on my own, to the point where I regularly make multi-page, sourced posts on various topics from geopolitics, urbanism, agriculture, etc, such as [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtefactPorn/comments/gprn3j/an_aztec_bath_recently_uncovered_with_faint/fro8bfh/?sort=top) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HumankindTheGame/comments/jo2a3m/since_the_franks_got_reworked_culture_card_art_i/) It feels sort of dumb and conceited to say this, but I already feel somewhat connected to the field, as due to those posts and interactions with researchers and specialists, I have (informal to semiformal) connections and regular interactions with a number already online.\n\nI bring all this up to say that while I am aware of how absurdly competitive academic fields and related jobs are, and how inadvisable it is for even people going into school 8+ years before I would be even if I went in a few months, I also don't really have anything else to pursue. I'm in the US, i'd be paying for undergraduate courses and would likely need to take out a loan no matter what, and there's not any other fields or careeers I have an interest in. I also have various mental health and more importantal physical disabilities, so even if I were to want to go into a trade or manual labor or something, I'm not sure I could.\n\nWould you realistically say I have anything to lose by going for it? It seems dumb without a plan B, but I'm sort of not even in a position to have a plan B to begin with, so no matter what I do I'd be risking being in my 30's with nothing to my name.... to be clear here, i'm less asking to be convinced to go for it, so much as I am seeking to be convinced *out* of it, or really be given any sort of guidance or input at all.\n\n**It's also worth noting here, and this is probably something you and others would be more equipped to comment on then giving me and my specific situation advice is this** I don't actually have an interest in being a professor or teaching, **I'm most interested in Digitization, Archival and Conservation work, and Museum curation stuff** (though I would be ecstatic to doing archeology or epigraphy or anything else with Mesoamerica too). My understanding is at least the latter is still fiercely competitive, but i'm not sure if the former 3 things are as competitive or are even typical things that most people mean when they say \"Academic jobs\" (which ties into comments you, /u/sirophiuchus and /u/lucianbelew have made). It's also worth noting that by extension, I guess I see acadamia more a means to an end (both personally and towards the career I actually want) then anything else: I just want to meaningfully contribute to the field in terms of research, have contacts and connections with researchers for the sake of my own knowledge, and especially further public knowledge and appreciation and access. To that end in particulaR is why archival, digitization, and the like interests me. \n\nMy dream job would be spearheading a digiization and public access initiative for a museum collection, opening up scans, photos, and 3d scans of pieces not in copyright to the public online, like the Metropolituian Musem's Open Access Policy and collaboration with Wikimedia to upload their photos of pieces there. Accessing and preseriving high resolution images of various topics and subjects, from marketing and promo images and concept art of games, to of historical sites and art pieces (I probably have some of the largest digital collections of art from some obscure artists whose work was never published commercially I've spent a lot of time collecting from various sources), etc is pretty much my only other big hobby, and it's something I think is pretty important.\n\nI wouldn't even mind it not dealing with Mesoamerican pieces or collections in particular for such a job, or it being a particularly large archive or institution i'd be doing digitization work or general archive mangement etc at, it's not like i'm in a position to be picky.\n\nHowever, I'm relatively sure that even for those positions, even if they are not AS fiercely competitive as tenured jobs in academia, I would need a graduate degree, if not a PHD, and the earliest I'd have the former would be my early to mid 30's, and perhaps not till my 40's for the latter, which gets back to the initial issue of if it's really worth it when doing so risks a situation even worse then what you describe (again, though, not like I have other options)",

You should be aware that museum jobs are highly competitive, however. Also, cynical moment, you will be competing with the kind of people who can earn basically nothing for years due to family money and thus can do loads of internships and voluntary work. In some areas of the high end arts and culture field you will also be competing with people who don't need to earn a living at all. This is not intended to devalue the essential and real work of people in those areas, just to reflect the realities of some parts of the cultural work sector.\n\n- Digitisation, archiving, conservation are much less competitive than traditional academia. Still competitive I believe, and you will certainly need a graduate degree, but it's not unreasonable to consider building a career in the field.\n\n- You sound like you really really want to make a change and give yourself the gift of an education. I definitely support that and I think it's a wonderful idea if you can afford to do it or can make it work in general.\n\n- You're not too old. I'm reminded of what my supervisor said when I worried I'd be 30 by the time I got my PhD. 'You'll be 30 anyway.'\n\n- Your lack of job/finances is more of a problem. Both because you don't have a career or even general experience to fall back on, and because it'll make it harder for you to do this.\n\n- With all the above in mind, I'd suggest you look seriously into scholarship programs and opportunities that would give you funding towards an undergraduate degree. You might find that in state tuition is surprisingly cheap, and there might be various things you'd qualify for as a nontraditional student. Since you didn't have the benefit of a helpful family background I'll recommend you go talk to a competent college advisor, maybe a nonprofit that helps people from disadvantaged backgrounds get into college, to help you learn what's available to you.\n\n- Regardless of whether getting the specific careers you mention is going to happen (even if it were 'likely', shit happens, you know?) I think getting a degree in your area of interest would not only be great for you but also be a very meaningful personal achievement.\n\n- With that in mind, your goal should be to do this as well and as effectively as possible. Meaning looking for all the stuff I mentioned above, making a plan, finding work in the interim if at all possible to save up a start fund, keeping your college loans to a minimum, and seeking support and mental health support on your journey.\n\nI'd never discourage someone from moving forward in their life and pursuing their passions. It feels like that's definitely what you want to do, and I think you should! Sensibly and sustainably, but ideally also with a sense of excitement and hope for the future.\n\nGood luck!",

              "text": "So the work you are talking about-- really technical support for an archive or museum --doesn't require a Ph.D. at all. In some cases you might get such a job based on a BA/BS and technical skills alone, but for a specialized academic library/archives an MA in the subject field will likely be required. If we were considering such a career path I'd start by contacting people who *already do that sort of work* and asking them about their training/experience/qualifications. Or identify the people who *hire* them and ask the same.\n\nOffhand-- and I say this as a historian with decades of archival research experience and several years of archival conservation work behind me --I'd expect something like a dual MA/MLIS could be the ticket. Many library schools have information science tracks now, and most of the big ones offer dual degree programs with their history, anthro, and various \"studies\" departments that can be completed in three years. That's probably the likely path to a technical services position in an archive, library, or museum in your interest area.\n\nThat said, all such institutions are under the same economic pressures that are gutting higher ed. They are also experiencing the trickle-down effect of the academic hiring collapse, i.e. there are now lots of Ph.D.s applying for jobs that still formally require only a master's degree. I'm on the board of one such institution and while it has only hired a single archives/museum tech in the last decade (to replace a retirement) that position drew a lot of extremely over-qualified applicants.\n\nI would urge you strongly *against* investing 10-15 years of your life in a Ph.D. at this point (since you'd need a BA first, and Ph.D.s in History at least are now taking ten years on average). Given your stated goals you would likely be qualified with a BA and some combination of an MA/MS and MLIS, which on paper at least would be seven years. But ask around-- do your research before making any plans. If you are mobile, look into undergraduate programs where you can work in this field as you learn-- either for pay or as a volunteer --because having hands-on experience in the field will set you apart from those with only classroom knowledge. I worked in archives and historic preservation after my BA for a while, which got me student jobs during my first MA that in turn opened doors later down the line. Don't waste or turn down any opportunity to build your resume for the sort of work you want-- but start that process by getting advice from people in the field, and if they tell you \"DON'T DO IT!\" heed their advice.",

Also, it's only a Master's rather than a full doctorate.    \n\n\nGraduate degrees aren't harder than undergrad for the difficulty of the work.  If you get in the program, you can do it.  It's mostly the amount of work being much higher, which is its own problem.  \n\n\nPersonally, if I had looked into stuff before barging in to my program, I would have spent a lot more time with digital and public history classes.  My digital history class was the one that's sort of saved any concept of a future for me, because it showed me the possibilities of doing what I want to do, and possibly even monetizing it, without having to be in the academy.  But I wanted to be a professor, point blank period, and fucked myself up by going for that with no consideration otherwise.  So my only real 'do this' advice is: don't do anything without trying to see other options of utilizing the thing, and try to think of the unconventional outlets.  For an extreme example: Dan Carlin's doing pretty well with his history podcast, and he's not an academic.  But he's had to have some academic training to be as good at it as he is.",

I assume it's still possible to become a tenured faculty in English, but the vast majority people who try will not succeed, and the best way for you to take care of yourself and your career is to have another option in your back pocket. \n\nThis disillusionment is something that every PhD student faces repeatedly over the course of their study: the only way to get a tenured faculty slot is to work your butt off and then *also* to get very lucky.  You got the reality check a little early.  Take care of yourself, nurture your passion, and when you're ready, spend some time thinking about what you want most out of your career.  You can absolutely try pursuing medieval lit, but (even if you do get a coveted tenure-track spot) it will be a lot of work and a long haul, with significantly less income and free time than if you went into industry.

On top of that, you can actually figure out if you want to pursue education, or if it's just something that was an obvious career progression (not that that's not a valid reason for pursuing a career, but it's a different set of reasons).\n\nEngLit is perhaps more complicated to make applicable than PoliSci, which is my field. But education is education, and a PhD in EngLit makes you qualified in a range of ways for a whole lot of jobs, if you did get out of the academy. What you (and other potential PhDs) should do is consider how and if your job prospects are advanced by having the additional education, and whether the \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 is worth it for what you get at the end. \n\nPhDs are not pointless, and there is still that 8% who get tenure-track, but you're right to go into this with your eyes wide open and recognizing that it isn't necessarily a straightforward career track.",

Sure.\n\nThere's nothing *wrong* with doing your PhD. I'm very proud of mine, and I made some severe sacrifices to do it.\n\nWould I do it a second time? No, but I'm glad I did it once.\n\nHappy to answer more questions if you have them.

No matter how much you love it, no matter how good at it you are, the reality is that there aren't enough tenure-track academic jobs for all the people getting humanities PhDs. The academic job market is absolutely crushing even in a *good* field. \n\nLots of new (and old) humanities PhDs get pushed into adjunct positions - which pay FAR less and come with far less job security. Furthermore, COVID is causing massive budget cuts across the country. It's a really risky time to go into that kind of PhD program. \n\nThis very well could change, but personally, a PhD takes a lot of time, a lot of money, and it steals a bit of your sanity in the process - I wouldn't sacrifice all of that without knowing with almost total certainty that I'd have a job at the end of the long, dark tunnel.\n\nWith that being said, Plan B doesn't have to mean \"ditch medieval lit forever,\" though. Is there some way that you can make medieval lit more applied? For example, why not get an applied graduate degree and look for writing grants for non-profits like museums, arts centers, and so on?

However, I would definitely suggest taking some time off after undergrad and getting some \"real life\" experience to help you confirm what you're looking for in life. I took about a decade off after undergrad, though always with thoughts of going back to school. I am now in a MA program in a field that I am very passionate about and I have so much more life experience related to my topic of interest that it's much easier to learn and understand the real world implications of what I'm learning. If I'd gone to grad school right after undergrad I would've chosen a completely different field which, ironically, is a field I now have serious misgivings about. \n\nThat said, watching what appears to be the collapse of academia (and likely of my field which is small and in the social sciences and therefore undervalued) has been brutal. Covid has laid bare just how dysfunctional the academic system has become. I am heartbroken that previous academics allowed this to happen. I am coming to accept that there is basically no chance I'll ever be able to become a professor, which was also my dream. First, because I prioritize teaching far more than research, which is apparently not how academia works anymore (research is prioritized over teaching). Second, because I have a learning disability which already puts me at a competitive disadvantage. And third, because I refuse to be a jerk who throws others under the bus in the name of competition - something that seems to be necessary these days to get ahead in academia. \n\nBut there's not much I can do about all that now. Now, at the very least, I do still want to learn about my field because I am still passionate about it and I think it's extremely important information that would inform any work that I do. So I may continue on with my degree. I have to confirm that it is far from easy - we were told from the start that well over 40-hour work weeks were expected (and this has not really changed much even during Covid). But at least it is interesting work I guess. \n\nMy advice would be to pursue Plan B and see how you like it, especially since it sounds like a secure option. You can always come back to Plan A later and it may be easier to do once the dust has settled with Covid and we've been able to assess the damage done (to academia). On the other hand, if academia goes bust then maybe it won't be easier to come back to. So, maybe my advice is flawed. Maybe it would be best to pursue Plan A while you can, while you still have the passion and see how you like it (caveat: do this ONLY if you're able to secure funding). Unfortunately I think you'll just have to take your best, educated guess and it may be a gamble either way. It is a truly shitty situation and I'm sorry that it is this way.",

Here's what I did, perhaps it'll help as you think through your Plan B.\n\nI grabbed my BS, then took 2 years off, then went back to grad school for my MS.  Once I landed at my 2nd job out of grad school, I qualified for tuition reimbursement and earned an MA in a humanities topic (ANE and Biblical Studies) part-time, and am now doing my PhD in CE part-time.  I'm able to publish in both my humanities and engineering topics, though nowhere near the frequency of a tenure-track academic, but still.  So I found that finding the right job that allowed me to work a 40-ish hour week and tuition reimbursement allowed me to still be involved in my academic interests.  It's not academia, but I don't have some of the very real financial and geographic concerns that I would have had if I'd had my heart set on tenure track.\n\nAnecdotal, I know, but if you could find an adjacent employment opportunity that allows you lots of freedom, you need not have to abandon your scholarly pursuits.

I've spent the last 25 years in American liberal arts colleges, generally well away from major cities and not in the top 50 rankings, and near 100% of the humanities faculty in every case were from top ten programs. I've chaired quite a few searches at our pools are typically 150-300 applicants in the humanities, with large numbers coming from top US and UK programs. Hiring committees have their pick, applicants are lucky to get a TT offer at all.",

I have taught as an adjunct for five years spanning two universities and one community College. Last year I started teaching at the secondary level because I needed a salary and benefits.  I'm in my second year teaching at the high school level and I dream of being a full time professor.  I'm applying to a doctoral program in English Literature at another state school, everyone writing me a letter of recommendation (including an English Education professor) were ecstatic that I was pursuing this, and have offered to help in any way they can.\n\n If I get in and graduate, the best case scenario is I get a full time gig as a professor (tenure is rapidly disappearing so I have no visions of ever becoming a tenured professor), associate professor is fine by me for the time being.  The worst case scenario is I continue to adjunct, I can expand the classes I am able to teach as an adjunct and I earn 10-20k more at the high school level. Either way, to me it's worth the gamble because I truly miss being a part of academia and high school and community college is such a shift from what I loved so much in grad school. I say if you can afford to, go for it, but as your professor said, have a backup plan whether its teaching secondary ed in English or History or a different field altogether. \n\nAfter graduating with my masters in 2014 it took six months to get an adjunct job. Between then and 2019 I have been a licensed real estate agent, a home care aide, worked at a dispensary (WA state), taught for VIPkid, started my own person training business,  worked at Party City as a temp hire for Halloween, etc. I have worked retail, the food industry,  etc. So I know my value and I know what work I'm willing to do for what pay. High school is TOUGH, especially after teaching at the university level, but it has decent pay and health benefits (47k starting for me). My back-up, back-up plan is to apply to be an Officer in the US Navy. I attempted to do this in 2016 but due to a biased recruiter my application packet was \"lost\", he ghosted me for three months and by then I had moved out of state. It wasn't a great experience,  but now that I am in another state it is still a back-up plan to join as even low-level officers here in the states make nearly $3,000/month. Which is more than I currently make working as an adjunct and at the high school and VIPkid combined.",

Don't want to say too much as would like my reddit to remain anonymous but please feel free to DM me. \n\nThe salient points of advice I would give would be to just apply for a masters, then depending on how that goes, apply for a PhD. You can be a successful academic even if you don't get to be a full professor (there are quite a few job rankings in academia which even I don't totally understand) and you might decide, like me, that you want to maybe publish a book and then be open to other opportunities in different lines of work. And anyway, you might find you don't even feel the same about your subject somewhere down the line (graduate study is very different to undergrad and not always in a good way - not a warning as such just a reality). So, it's really too early to tell. \n\nIt sounds like it would be good if you had some other hobbies/interests to balance out your interest in pursuing academia, though. Many students and early-career researchers who are further on in the process often struggle with fixing their identity too fully on their work which they know is precarious and may not last, so - though I know it's easier said than done - try to make the most of being an undergrad and having an open mind about other paths, and the things that make you you, totally apart from any career you end up pursuing.",

Financially, it was a bad choice for me, but even so, I do not regret the experience. I simply regret taking out additional student loans. I learned a lot, met some good people, but did not end up with a career in my field and have almost completely turned away from it, as my life has taken some different directions. I can see myself returning to it as a hobby someday--which my past education will inform quite a bit--but nothing more.",

          "text": "This is a bit misleading, imo. I am all for the message you seem to be putting across, that if you want something you should work towards it and maybe it will happen (though not for your insinuation that academia is meritocratic, I think most now agree this is false), but if you're currently a prof I imagine you were completing your PhD before 2008 when the already-declining academic job market worsened greatly due to the financial crisis. We're now on the brink of an even greater deterioration in academia because of Covid, and we haven't even seen the long-term effects of this yet. (Though, we heard last week that UKRI have declined to support PhD students whose work has been disrupted; this is a move likely to be copied by other funding bodies and also to affect fixed-term postdocs.) \n\nSo, this is not necessarily transferrable or realistic advice to give to an aspiring academic in these times.",

              "text": "I get your point and agree with you. I think I didn't specify that academia is everything but a meritrocracy, and I got my PhD in Spring 2018. I'm the closest to the job market a young academic can be since I just received a campus visit for the only position I applied for this year as a mid rank assistant professor. So, is it realistic to get a job right now? No. Impossible? Certainly not. Impossible for a very very talented applicant as OP might as well be? Absolutely not, particularly if you consider that I stated how relocating to anywhere is a must. Fundingwise? We're all in shit. For sure. Regardless, there are still stipends for talented applicants. In literature studies, the OP wouldn't need to collect data and should be smart enough to focus on something that doesn't require travelling.\n\nI feel that many current PhD candidates and postdocs will attribute their failure in the job market to the pandemic, when it's also likely that they were not the best candidates to begin with. Bottom line is: if you are really good and willing to relocate, you'll be more likely to succeed than if you're average and want to stay in southeast England. Even in the bad (awful) situation we are in. Frustrated people will spread their frustration to other young scholars. I've experienced that myself and won't be part of that toxicity. I hope OP will weigh in their options with a good plan b at hand.",

                  "text": "My apologies for misinterpreting the timeline of your achievements - getting a PhD and a professorship within 2 years is hugely impressive, but in my experience this is extremely rare. \n\nI agree with you about the toxicity of constant negativity - after all, there must be a new generation of scholars coming from somewhere! - but there's a balance to be achieved here. You have had a very impressive career trajectory, but this is not the norm. \n\nAdditionally, applying words such as 'smart enough', 'really good' and 'average' to the likelihood of getting jobs is still misleading. I've seen brilliant scholars have to leave academia and being denied funding. It's really important for aspiring academics like OP (and myself!) to detach scholarly ability from results in the job market. Of course it's good to try one's best, but this won't always or necessarily be appreciated or taken into account by others, including employers.",
