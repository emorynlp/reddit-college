      "text": "What different unions? \n\nThe UK is not like the US where you have lots of local Unions with local agreements. \n\nIf you are an academic in England and Wales, you join UCU. This is likely the only Union that your employer recognises.\n\nYou join the Union by going to https://www.ucu.org.uk/join and filling in your details.\n\nIf you want to get more directly involved - email the Branch at your University and offer your services. \n\nNotes:\n\n* The situation is slightly different in Scotland.\n* For non-academic staff below a certain grade they will be represented by UNITE in the main.\n* It is also slightly complex if you are a medical academic.",

Teachers are often the same as their teaching unions are not recognised by Universities.\n\n\n(There is a whole other thing that many medical academics have to be pay on the NHS payscale not the University payscale).",

Your employer is not allowed to ask you if you are a member of the union, but in my experience most people are. There are no downsides other than not getting paid when and if on strike \u2014even then, the union may provide some relief funds to those in need.",
