  "title:": "Any point in submitting an applied math paper to a journal if it uses \"simple\" math?",
  "text": "I'm a high school student and I wrote a paper about a working method for modeling one-dimensional heat transfer into an egg. It is an applied math paper, and the most complex thing I have done is deploy parametric equations and some simple multivariate calculus. \n\nDespite using relatively simple math, I feel that my work answered a question that has been largely ignored by the literature on this topic, which is accurately modeling the surface area of an egg. I worked on this as a passion project, but I feel that maybe it's worth publishing. At the same time, I feel like anyone who is experienced in mathematics would scoff at its lack of complexity and immediately dismiss it as amateurish. Should I still submit my paper to my regional journal?",

Between getting rejected at journals, going to conferences and getting feedback, and getting feedback from your mentors and peers, you are likely to miss several of these steps.\n\nI don\u2019t want to discourage you from working on this. It\u2019s cool that you have this interest. Just beware of the entire process\n\nEdit: simply because something is simple does not disqualify it. Simple and elegant is better than complex and obtuse.",

A journal for high school or even undergrad students would probably accept it. \n\nIf this is relevant to your future college major you might want to think about where you might want to go to school, look into who does related work, and reach out to a professor and ask for feedback. You could start to build a working relationship and it might help you get your foot in the door. Also most journals charge a publishing fees so having a more senior mentor comes in handy for that as well.",

But it can also be a gambit if you're not _totally sure_ that this gap exists, because few moves undercut your argument than saying \"no one's studied <thing>\" and a reviewer or editor responding with citations about studying <thing>.",

The former is mainly aimed at lower division/high school physics and the latter at university level and physics education research.

      "text": "I think you should submit it to an undergrad journal because 1) you never know and 2) even the process of getting rejected is a very educational experience. A good reviewer will provide you with a lot of papers/research to learn and think about. You shouldn't worry about them responding with anything mean: I've had plenty of rejected papers, and the reviewers have always been respectful. It's just part of the process of peer review.\n\nHowever, for a paper to be accepted, it needs to have a novel contribution. From what you've described, it sounds like you applied an existing method to a specific problem. So unfortunately, I think you should go into it knowing that it's likely it'll be rejected.\n\nSome tips for getting this paper accepted:\n\n1. Can your approach be generalized to more than just an egg? If so, that's worth discussing. If not, how can it be made more general?\n2. Are you absolutely, totally, 100% sure that nobody has explored this space before? Make sure you're looking in academic journals/conferences, not google. Your local university will have access to a lot of these papers for free (you just need to be on the wifi). They'll also have library staff that will probably be willing to help you in your literature search.\n3. With those first two points in mind, how can you frame this as a novel contribution? Is it a novel contribution? If not, what do you need to do to make it novel?\n\nBest of luck!",

I tried to submit something to a math publisher when I was 10 because I was an snot nosed idiot with time, an envelop and a stamp. The editor wrote back very nicely and gave me a book, it was in life changing in a gentle and small way. Now I mentor high school kids sometimes too and love to see things they show me, they're always smarter and more resourceful than I'd have imagined. It really cheers me up. \n\nRegardless the outcome, it is a good thing for you to do. So what ever your decision is, good luck! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.: If you DO decide to major in math, please choose a minor that will bring home the dough.
