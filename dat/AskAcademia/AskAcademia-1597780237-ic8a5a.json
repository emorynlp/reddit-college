  "text": "Hi all, this evening I have the pleasure of going through the reviewer comments I received on a manuscript for a pretty notable journal in my field (a well respected society journal). One of the reviewers was adamant that four out of five of our figures were not mentioned in the main body of our manuscript text and appeared to come across angry about this in their summary (lol)... except they all were... many times!\n\nPerhaps the reviewer commented on our manuscript whilst half asleep, who knows! Slightly concerned our paper hasn't been reviewed properly but their other comments seem legit. \n\nWhat are some of the strangest reviewer comments you have received back on a manuscript? xD",

When I read that draft paragraph now I seriously cringe.\n\nAnyway, in the middle of this really positive review, suddenly the reviewer says \"this paragraph makes absolutely no sense, it's frankly embarrassing, and it should be removed.\" Just fucking brutal. Once I recovered from the shock, I realized they were right, and I did exactly what they suggested. Ended up getting published in that journal.\n\nFast forward 8 years: I know exactly who that reviewer was (*very* senior person in my field who I admire a ton), they've supported my career ever since, and we're also good friends.",
