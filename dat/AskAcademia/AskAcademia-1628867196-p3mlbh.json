  "text": "I got graduated with a bachelor degree in microbiology.\nWhich I was forced into by my parents in hope of getting in medical school. But I was never interested in it. Every one offerd me some BS about how I will grow into it. \nWell, it never happend and I'm thinking of persuing my passion which is physics.\nIm 24 and now and Im afraid that Im too old.\nWhat do you think? Should I get another bachelor degree?\nUniversities are free in my country so money isnt an issue.\nThanks in advance.",

As others have pointed out Biophysics might be an easy way in and from there you could easily transition into a Physics PhD program to fully get on track (if you want to try the Academic career path, that is).  \nMy University also allowed me to take a few Bachelor level lectures instead of Master level when I switched from Biology to Computer Science, which helped but yes, it was still rough. My brother switched from Mechanical Engineering to Entrepreneurship and they made him take one pre-semester with the most important Bachelor level lectures before he could join, which was still faster than a complete Bachelor plus better degree. I think he actually had a pretty good time.\n\nI personally took longer to complete the CS Master (4 years for 2 year program) but it was again still faster than Bachelor + Master and turned out to not only get me a great PhD position but also a perfectly fitting industry job.  \nWhat I would have done differently would actually just be being more careful about the program I joined. Mine wasn't the perfect fit for my interests, which made it additionally hard to get through.",

Timewise OP would be looking at 6 years to get a bachelor's then another masters. If they already have a strong foundation in physics, why add an extra 4 years for the same end goal of eventually needing a masters? Just skip the bachelor's and go into the masters where they can truly explore their passion in a specialized, tailored setting without the need for gen Ed's? Even if the gen eds could be transferred from OP's original degree, that's still two years of coursework needed before having to pursue a masters anyway. \n\nAlso, to Schneizel, no need to be a dick. I'm just offering advice based on my experience of pursuing my passion in academia.",
