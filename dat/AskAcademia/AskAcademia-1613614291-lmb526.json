She was so sweet and made sure there were plenty of breaks between scheduled meetings for me to nip off and do a quick meditation. It was really lovely and showed a lot of care on their part.

                      "text": "> Pre scheduled restroom breaks would be a little odd.\n\nThey don't need to be called restroom breaks. If it's a day-long interview, it's a good idea to schedule 10-15 minute breaks between sessions where both the candidate and the committee can, yes, go to the bathroom, or get a snack/drink, have a smoking break, make a phone call, or whatever they need to do. A full day where you need to be on without any breaks whatsoever is really difficult, especially if you're in a stressful situation of being interviewed. At places where day-long interviews are done regularly, this is an expected practice; the only reason I can think of that this doesn't happen at some departments is that they don't hire/interview very often, so they simply don't realize that this is something they should do.\n\nOn the subject of bathrooms, btw, it's a good idea to have mandated breaks rather than impromptu ones because some people need (significantly) more time in the bathroom than normal, e.g. because of a medical condition, and that's obviously an awkward thing to explain to a prospective employer - but you also don't want to just ditch the prospective employer for a length of time with no explanation.",

I then also added that small breaks are important/useful for virtually everybody, since from your wording it wasn't clear whether you realized that said breaks could be used for non-bathroom things.\n\n> when you\u2019re walking back from lunch\n\n> Sometimes you have an urgent need\n\nand sometimes you have a non-urgent need that is not around lunchtime, and it would be good to have a 15 minute interval between the 9 am and 11 am session in which you can attend to that need. \n\nLike, having small scheduled breaks is a medical necessity for people with all sorts of medical conditions who maybe don't want to disclose their health status to a prospective employer. Somebody isn't a bad person if they didn't realize that; I wrote my comment not to make anybody feel like a bad person, but because I think the needs of people who have said medical conditions need to be considered in this conversation, by whoever is participating in the conversation. Maybe everybody is already considering these needs, but I didn't think there'd be any harm in stating this out loud.",

Everything is a tradeoff. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t understand how any of what I said takes away from your points? I don\u2019t think anyone is arguing against them. I\u2019m not. \n\nThe thing about this is the balance of power is so unfair in some situations that committees don\u2019t even extend basic respect to the candidate. And that is a major problem.\n\nWe also have to ask ourselves the question, do I want to work with these people for 6 years? Do I want to work with someone who doesn\u2019t even have time for a 30-40 minute conversation with me when they are allegedly supposed to at least make an effort? Do I want to work in a department that is so busy that the search tanks everyone to the point of ignoring that the candidate is checking for fit too?",
