  "title:": "Is it appropriate to ask a Professor you\u2019re doing research under if they know how to get academic books for cheaper than market price?",
  "text": "Sorry for confusing wording. \n\nI will start working on a thesis project (MA - humanities) under a new professor which I do not yet have a relationship with (we have exchanged many emails but I have never met them - not even via Zoom). A brand new monograph covering important parts of my research topic has just come out from an academic press but is quite expensive to buy through the press and on Amazon etc.\n\nWould it be appropriate for me to ask this professor - who I don\u2019t really \u201cknow\u201d but under who I will be working for at least the next year - via email if they have access to the work as it also pertains to their sub-field and/or if they knew how I could get it for cheap (market price is over $100)?\n\nI feel like it is a fair question for an academic supervisor/mentor but don\u2019t want to break some academic social protocol that I am unaware of.\n\nThanks!",

Let's just say POC don't usually do this shit.  \n\n\n(And I'm also ambivalent about downloading works because often the students asking are BIPOC themselves.

Having approached a Facebook group for an article pdf that my institution couldn't get during early days of covid shutdown, I was really disappointed to get shamed and called out in response.   \nOne of my grad school friends is pushing open access really heavily. I like books. I like them physically, mentally, everything about them. I'm beginning to lean in her direction though because knowledge needs to be easier to access for everyone. We're also missing out on a lot of great people's research by upholding the monograph as the greatest piece of research possible--but I don't need to get onto that soapbox right now (but if I did, shorter projects being shared online would be far more approachable for people at teaching institutions!). If articles were free and slightly shorter than book length projects were \"publishable\"--we'd really increase the amount of information available in my field at least, and I'd like to see that happen. To hell with the publishers profiting off of us.   \nBut I am totally an asshole, lol.",

If your department does, ask your prof to request the book from the department fund and the library will order it and you can check it out.\n2.

Sometimes you can get lucky with the publisher if you claim you want to review the book for a course (I got a $180 monograph this way once, and it was crap, so I was really glad I didn't spend a dime on it).\n4.

If you are researching under that Professor they should be somewhat of an expert in the field of research you are into meaning they may have access to these texts or can lead you to similar texts which they own for free. Anytime I help my students with research I am loading them up with a ridiculous amount of free texts. I stock my personal library for them. Professors are there to help you. This idea that we are unapproachable really hurts the learning process. It should be a collective after core concepts are introduced and if your Professors do not treat it that way they are doing a disservice to their students. \n\nAdditionally, you should be looking to the librarian. Librians are required to have at a minimum a masters degree in information science. What that breaks down to is basically a research guru that is FREE and Underutilized. The purpose of the library is to get you as much information as possible to aid you in research. My wife is a librarian and the best research help I have ever gotten was from her, not mentors, not my chair, but the librarian in my life. \n\nFinally, OER (open access educational resources) are a life saver. During grad school when I could barely afford food and needed research on the cheap my steps where 1. Raid my chairs personal collection, 2. Use my library resources, and 3. Used the internet specifically, OER's free research. It is last because it takes more time to sift through but still really valuable.",
