Put yourself in the shoes of our Victorian sexist, trying to maintain his male privilege. He thinks to himself \u201cWell, I suppose I could tolerate women doctors saving my life. And if I had to, I would accept women going into law and determining who goes free and who goes to jail. I\u2019m even sort of okay with women going into journalism and crafting the narratives that shape our world. But women building bridges? NO MERE FEMALE COULD EVER DO SUCH A THING!\u201d Really? This is the best explanation the world can come up with? Doesn\u2019t anyone have at least a little bit of curiousity about this?\n(and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just coincidence \u2013 ie I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just that a bunch of head engineers happened to be really sexist, and a bunch of head doctors happened to be really non-sexist. The same patterns apply through pretty much every First World country, and if it were just a matter of personalities you would expect them to differ from place to place.)\nWhenever I ask this question, I get something like \u201cengineering and computer science are two of the highest-paying, highest-status jobs, so of course men would try to keep women out of them, in order to maintain their supremacy\u201d. But I notice that doctors and lawyers are also pretty high-paying, high-status jobs, and that nothing of the sort happened there. And that when people aren\u2019t using engineering/programming\u2019s high status to justify their beliefs about gender stereotypes in it, they\u2019re ruthlessly making fun of engineers and programmers, whether it\u2019s watching Big Bang Theory or reading Dilbert or just going on about \u201cpocket protectors\u201d.\"\n\n\n\nNote that many of these imbalances are even more lopsided than the imbalance favoring men in technology, and that many of these jobs earn much more than the average programmer. For example, the average computer programmer only makes about $80,000; the average veterinarian makes about $88,000, and the average pediatrician makes a whopping $170,000.",

      "text": "In my personal experience at two different graduate schools \\(masters then PhD\\), science was one of the most liberal fields I've experienced. Unless you have tattoos  of swastikas across your forehead, literally no one cares about hair styles, tattoos, piercings, clothing \\(unless lab safety is involved\\), sexual orientation, relationship style, etc. In my lab, my lab manager is the most flamboyant gay man you'll ever meet and does not adhere to a lot of gender \"norms\" and I dont think its ever caused an issue whatsoever. If he wants to wear a dress to a conference, no one says anything they wouldn't say to a woman in the same dress or to him if it was dress slacks \\(just the normal \"you look nice today\" because he dressed up instead of his usual\\). We also have someone with very detailed sleeves, chest and legs and the only person I've ever heard of saying anything negative is our department chair, and as soon as she said it a TON of faculty jumped to his defense and said she's outdated and out numbered. \n\nI know these things are vastly different than transitioning, and there are some truly god awful humans in existence that penetrate any and every field, but my hopes are high that this would be a supportive field for you to be in while transitioning. That said, graduate schools is HARD. Its a ridiculously, unreasonably shitty time in a lot of peoples lives, so you may want to consider transitioning before starting if its possible to take a year off so that your stress level isn't 10000 when you transition.

Thus, academia does seem welcoming in a certain POV. Rather, it's a lot of issues with implicit bias that we all have picked up; people may treat you differently than they would towards others, which may mean less opportunities for success in your career. This of course shouldn't dissuade you, just realistically should know there may exist more bumps in the road for you than others. \n\nAs for your second question, I think it's less different fields of study to consider and more different departments at different institutions. Some institutions are better or worse than others, and then within institutions, some departments may be better or worse as well. I imagine most institutions have a graduate organization to represent LGBTQ issues and when considering programs, perhaps it would serve you well to reach out to such groups to ask their opinions of the various departments and relevant resources at their institution.",

But, usefully, it does speak to the \"transphobia by other means\" that the parent commenter was mentioning (rather than explicit bigotry, you get minimization, being dismissed, held at arm's length, treated like a museum curiosity, but, you know, as long as there are good intentions behind it, right?).\n\n>\"It\u2019s kind of funny to see cis people answering this question.\"\n\n>The question wasn't posed to trans people, it was posed to academics in general. Most people here also haven't clarified whether they are trans or cis so you are betraying your own prejudices by simply assuming that all those voicing opinions you happen to dislike are in the \"other\" group from you. You don't want that to be done to you, so don't do it to others.\n\nYou have totally missed the tone of the quote you responded to. Clearly this person isn't saying, \"oh my god, cis people are not allowed to speak on this topic! Get your hand out of the cookie jar!\" They obviously mean, \"these responses are funny to me, because they are said with a lot of confidence but don't reflect the experience of any trans academics I've talked to, including myself.\" So, of course academics in general can respond to the question; that was never at stake. However, the hostility with which you strongly misread an innocuous comment does betray a few things about your biases.\n\nAs for the \"don't assume our gender!\" tone policing, well, some academics can be clever enough readers to infer all sorts of things about theoretical orientation, educational background, context, identity, etc., from the content of discourse (you know, for some of us this is our main area of training). Weird that in a comment about how great it is to be trans in academia you would choose to weaponize (and misunderstand) a concept that comes out of trans critical theory.\n\n>That's just incorrect.\n\nAs OP pointed out, it would be nice if your comment had any kind of evidence to back it up beyond your \"feelings\" about how nice academics are. Now, since this is an academic subreddit, know that all sorts of things can be counted as \"evidence\" (such as discourse analysis, ethnography, personal experiences). But, from your comment, it sounds like you just \"know what it's like\" for trans academics without actually learning about it in the first place (and even here in this very comment you've had an opportunity to learn from a trans academic and *actually* gain even a modicum of knowledge! But you chose to just tell them that they're wrong without even engaging in dialogue or asking what they mean).\n\n>By making excessively exaggerated claims like this, you are weakening your stance and make people less likely to believe you on other issues. You are harming a good cause with stuff like this. It is absolutely a fact that transphobia is a thing even in academia. Of course it is, because academics are humans and share human flaws.\n\nThis is all platitude and optics policing. Like, \"I agree with the *message* of Black Lives Matter, but why do they have to shout?\" There's also some kind of weird reductionism where the \"you\" that is weakening the \"other issues\" is a collapse of all trans academics into a singularity of response.\n\n>However, it is still absolutely true that academia is typically less preoccupied with such thoughts and statistically is a more welcoming place in that regard than most other career paths one might take.\n\nI almost don't even want to touch what \"preoccupied with such thoughts\" is supposed to mean. On the face of it, it is factually incorrect. Academia is one of the few places where trans rights, trans experiences, critical gender studies, etc., actually get taken seriously, that is, actually \"occupy\" our thoughts. But, the statement doesn't really mean to ask if we *neutrally* think about trans issues. Instead, it seems to imagine that we aren't \"preoccupied with such thoughts [of transphobia],\" that is to say that our brains are too \"occupied\" to bother to be filled up with transphobia---so, this seems to imagine that trans issues are invisible or suppressed in academia (since we're busy doing other things), AND it imagines that thinking about transgenderism can only mean thinking transphobic thoughts (that productive and critical and positive thoughts re: transgenderism don't exist).\n\n>I'm sorry if your experience has been bad, these are questions of statistical nature not of an absolute one. Academia tends to be more welcoming to trans people than most other typical career paths.\n\nThis is no different than a black american in New York saying, \"there's racism here,\" and then being told, well, it's worse in Alabama, and that's a fact, and you do nobody any good denying it. Or even worse, well, you're lucky this isn't 1930, or 1845, etc etc. Or, like, what would your response be if someone said that racism or sexism exist in academia? Of course it is often different than the non-academic world, but it's also a beyond obvious fact that these are all huge problems in academia, and, as the parent commenter put it, often express themselves *differently* in academia, which, I suppose, probably leads to these problems being unrecognized and invisible.\n\n>Academia tends to be more welcoming to trans people than most other typical career paths. That's a fact and that's a good thing. It needs to be viewed as a strength and worked on further so that it can improve in the places where it still isn't good or good enough.\n\nJust more platitudes. Of course being trans in academia is better than being trans in a pit of hungry lions. But it is so ridiculously out-of-touch to imagine that the way academia and academics treat *actual* trans people is \"a strength\" rather than being rife with conscious and unconscious problems. That is, you're asking academics to be complacent in the status quo (which, if you did know the transphobic stuff that some people have to deal with, I'm sure you would never advocate for).\n\nIf I were you, as any good academic should do, I would ask myself, \"what's at stake for me if transphobia exists in academia, and what's at stake for me if it is welcoming?\"",

A poster's trans friend was coming to visit and they wanted to take the town temperature. Lots of commenters were saying no one would ever bat an eye at or mistreat someone who is trans. A trans person responded along the lines of, \"I guess you aren't trans. I am and have had people discriminate against me here.\" Cue the \"did you just assume my gender, shitlord?\" responses. Of course, she then was called a tr/nny, a man in a dress, too sensitive, responsible for her own discrimination because she's clearly just a terrible customer, etc. by the same people who had just been waxing poetic about their sweet, liberal, trans-friendly town. It's interesting to see the academic (attempt at being more \"respectful\"/smarter) version happening here. Instead of \n\n> did you just assume my gender, shitlord?\n\nwe have \n\n>...you are betraying your own prejudices by simply assuming that all those voicing opinions you happen to dislike are in the 'other' group from you.\n\nWhile some might say\n\n> you're clearly the problem\n\nWe see\n\n> You are harming a good cause with stuff like this.\n\nAnd instead of \n\n> you're just too sensitive\n\nwe get\n\n> By making excessively exaggerated claims like this, you are weakening your stance and make people less likely to believe you on other issues.\n \nAnd in review, someone with first-hand knowledge on this topic said, \"I've experienced just as much discrimination in academia as I do in the 'real world,' as have my trans academic friends, it's just of a different variety.\" They were then accused of crying wolf, exaggerating, hurting the \"cause,\" and written off with absolutely zero evidence. Anyway, all this to say I appreciate your response. ",

(Based off of your username, sorry if it's an inaccurate assumption)\n\nSo would you mind sharing what your understanding of gender is so I can see how it's different from mine and maybe learn from it? If you don't want to that's ok too, but I am curious and I do think that it could be helpful for me to see and understand your perspective better.\n\nThanks for the input!",

              "text": "Wow, I'm impressed by your response (in a not-remotely-condescending way, I promise.) I understand how deeply felt people's sense of gender identity can be... and I sympathise with gender dysphoria, or the feeling of just not fitting expectations of what a woman is supposed to be. Problem is I don't quite believe that gender is an 'identity' per se.\nI believe however that \na) Having a female reproductive system is a rather important, material fact of life. It's pretty decisive about your life experience, whether or not you choose to use it. However, *it doesn't need to mean anything else about you than that.* It doesn't mean you have to be feminine. But femininity \u2260 womanhood.\nb) Femininity is an oppressive social construct to prop up masculinity anyway. You don't have to conform to femininity as a woman. *Not* conforming to femininity doesn't make you a man or 'non-binary.'\nc) Having gender dysphoria can have all manner of causes, especially in this patriarchal world. But it doesn't follow logically that you *must* be a man if you feel horrible about being a woman. \n\nUnder patriarchy, women have been forced into a little box. We don't *know* what women would be like outside of that. Whatever you choose to do I wish you the best, but I hope you know that you can be a woman and be whatever kind of woman you want. And what's more, you can challenge people's expectations of how a woman is supposed to be.",

                  "text": "Ha ha, ok, I'm glad you're impressed I guess.\n\nSo just to make sure I'm understanding what you're saying, woman is an innately biological idea meaning someone who has a female reproductive system (Is it based on the function of it? Because what about women with nonfunctional reproductive systems? They seem like they'd still be women, even without a reproductive system?) femininity is a social construct that exists in opposition to masculinity to emphasize it, and gender dysphoria has a variety of causes but does not necessarily have the single solution of transitioning\n\nIs that right? I feel like I didn't completely understand your first point because it doesn't quite make sense to me. But you seem like you have pretty well thought out views, so I think that's more likely an issue with my understanding than your view itself. \n\nAnd yeah, that's a good point, it reminds me of some of the examples I've seen in other cultures where stereotypes are different and we see people displaying different preferences to what we have here (ie women were more assertive than men on average). So then we assume that what exists here is natural, but really a lot of it is probably the result of cultural effects rather than innately biological things.\n\nAlso, I think you might have a misunderstanding that I was assigned female at birth and looking to transition to male. I'm assigned male at birth and considering transitioning to female. And I've heard that people who share some of your beliefs might be a lot less sympathetic to people like me than people who are like what you thought I was, but I hope you don't dismiss me outright, I am actually trying to understand your perspective. I didn't want you to misunderstand though.",

To my knowledge, the rejection was in no way related to gender/sexual identity or expression, but research/methods foci and lack of advisor fit. \n\nFurther, AFAIK hasn't impacted their career trajectory. Shifted to a more androgynous nickname at the new dept., and hadn't published previously -- at least, not peer reviewed, so no concerns re: the lost pubs.\n\nSorry I don't have more interesting insight. But I guess I can add to the chorus of allies saying, \"go you!\" and that my limited experience suggests tolerance and, if anything, it being totally irrelevant to many profs, for whom your self worth should entirely be derived from the quality of your schoolwork \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.\n\nBest of luck! Seconding the statement earlier that grad school sucks, and often will make you feel super worthless and exhausted. The worst thing you can add to that is being uncomfortable with who you are as a person. So, be your authentic self and good grad school work will follow.

I wonder how much of that is bias in the voices that are foregrounded and how much is based more on the trans women being taught that it's ok to speak up more than the trans men.
