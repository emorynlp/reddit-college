  "text": "Hi all,\n\nSo this week I successfully completed my master's thesis and I'm preparing myself for the defence that scheduled to take place in a couple of days. I was going over my paper and I noticed two mistakes re the interpretation of a the P-value under a null hypothesis in my paper.\n\nSafe to say that I'm panicking now and I'm worried that this will adversely impact the grade I receive following the defence. I know it doesn't invalidate my results necessarily ( I continued the interpretation of both tests as with the correct interpretation), but I just feel so awful about. I emailed my supervisor to let him know in advance, but does anyone have any experience with something like this and have any advice on how I can stop feeling like the effort I put in has been for nothing?\n\n**EDIT\nThank you all for your kind comments - my fears have been allayed for now at least. Fingers crossed I can improve for the defence.",

I know it's not the end of the world, but it just sucks so much that I'll probably get penalised for stupidity. Just feels rotten after the months of work that went into it.\n\nHopefully my supervisor understands.",

I submitted mine missing a whole paper I needed to review, and an entire results section knowing I needed to redo major portions of it but I just didn\u2019t have time to ask my advisors about those sections before my defense. There were also MANY mistakes in it that I didn\u2019t catch myself but my advisors did - this includes silly mistakes I should have caught but also mistakes in interpreting my literature and terminology of another field I was using wrong.\n\nAnd I still passed! My advisors did not care at all that I had some changes I needed to make. It\u2019s pretty rare that you pass without revisions anyways. I promise you\u2019ll be fine - don\u2019t sweat it :)",

I was forthcoming about my errors in the defence when I was asked if there was anything about my paper that I thought that I could improve upon. My examiners were really complementary of my paper, and in the end I was awarded a 9/10 for my work!! I was left speechless, honestly so surprised by that result!!\n\nThanks to everyone on here for keeping my spirits up when I doubted myself, sometimes it's the love of strangers that can get you through the roughest of times \u2665\ufe0f",
