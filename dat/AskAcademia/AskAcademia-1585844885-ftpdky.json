  "title:": "Random rejections from journal",
  "text": "A few years ago I submitted a paper to a specialized journal and got accepted with a lot of praise from the reviewers. Even now that is my most cited paper by far. At the end of that paper I hint at a much more general/ambitious result. The editor even said he was looking forward to it if I ever get that done. Fast forward a few years I have now done just what I promised and got some interesting results (or so I thought). I didn\u2019t even bother with other journals and submitted to the same journal. That same editor then held onto my manuscript for months before deciding to desk reject: i.e. didn\u2019t even bother to contact the reviewers. A competitor journal also desk rejected so now I\u2019m thinking something\u2019s wrong with the paper. I know these things happen but the reaction from the first journal still doesn\u2019t quite add up?? I would\u2019ve actually felt better if the rejection included some harsh feedback from the reviewers; then, I\u2019d at least know what I\u2019m doing wrong.",
