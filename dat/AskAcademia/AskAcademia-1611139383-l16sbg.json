  "title:": "Does anyone else feel like they aren't doing enough towards their PhD?",
  "text": "So I'm a second year PhD student (UK) researching horror games. While I'm reading up on the literature, taking notes, working on my literature review and methodology, prepping for data collection next month, keeping an eye out for potential CfPs, attending (and sometimes participating in) online seminars, and making plans with my supervisor to hopefully do some guest lecturing down the line, there are times when I feel I'm not doing enough. I make it sound like I'm really busy, but I'm truly not. A lot of the stuff I've listed is hugely spaced out. Weeks go by without half of this stuff occurring.\n\nAs of now, I don't really know what to do to fill my time. I can read papers and take notes, that's no problem. But I just feel like a lot of the time I'm sat there thinking of what to do. I try to keep a weekly list of tasks I want to get done, but most of my days I feel I can walk away from my desk by 2pm. Sometimes earlier.\n\nI don't know if it's because there's this ideological view of what doing a PhD requires, but a lot of the blog posts and online posts I read from others suggests that this is an unbelievably busy period and there are simply not enough hours in the day and people's mental health is at stake because of the hours they put in. And honestly, I just don't feel like that. I find it very easy to walk away from my work (either in the evenings or to take breaks now and then) and I wonder if this is detrimental to my completing a satisfactory thesis.\n\nNone of my supervisors seem to have any cause for concern and I have plans ahead of me, so I'm not stuck for anything to do. I just wonder if there's a toxicity to the whole PhD lifestyle which pressures people into thinking they have to work themselves into dust or it's not good enough. Maybe this is an American mindset. Maybe it's because of the subject matter I'm researching (I can do it all online from my own bedroom). I don't know.\n\nAnyone else feel this way?",

Lab based students have to fit all their reading etc in around time in the lab so that gives you more undirected hours. Is there any writing you can start on now that will save you time at the end? Like a draft literature review or methods chapter. It will need updating before your submit but could be something to get on with while you have spare time.",

Not because they're no good, but I've been adding to them for months now and they're taking on a sort of Frankenstein's monster look. Just ideas cut and paste all over. I've spoken to my supervisor about this, and she seems onboard with the idea.\n\nHowever, I have my yearly assessment panel in a couple of weeks so I've been prepping for that. While I'm certain it'll go well, there's a small part of me that thinks \"on the off chance I get kicked off my PhD, is it worth putting a lot of effort into more work until the panel is over?\"\n\nMy brain is a dick at times.",

The comprehensive exams stage was the most stressful, and the last year of dissertation-writing was the busiest. In between, there was year 3 of 6 - a glorious year of lollygagging, rabbit holes, infinite reading, slow rumination, and eventually, prospectus-writing. So maybe you're just in one of those chiller, more exploratory phases.",

              "text": "This can be more of a problem in the humanities and sometimes social sciences, as opposed to STEM. In STEM, there's a very, very set protocol for Things That Must Be Done. It's also to a large degree more clear what is (or isn't) relevant to your research. So, you have a clearly articulated giant stack of Things That Must Be Read. Whereas in the humanities there's just less clear boundaries unless you're doing some fairly traditional research.\n\nLike, if I were doing research in Renaissance-era British Literature, there would be a clear, established canon of stuff that absolutely must be read. People whose positions I absolutely must respond to. Etc. But if I were doing research on horror games, my guess is that my committee would be less knowledgeable themselves. They wouldn't really know what games I need to research. And there isn't nearly as much of a canon of clearly established games that have to be talked about, and important game theorists.\n\nSo, maybe this is partially an effect of your focus area.",

I don't think any of it would be imperative, but there are well established game scholars who if I ignored entirely, it would likely surprise my Viva panel. A casual reading of video game studies would organically put me down the path of people like Espen Aarseth, Jesper Juul or Dominic Arsenault (there's a surprising amount of people in my field who's name sounds a bit like \"arse\") and certainly readings of horror theory would lead me towards people like Bernard Perron, Ewan Kirkland and Julia Kristeva. People who's work have helped establish video game / horror studies. Maybe I could pass my Viva without their knowledge, but I think I'd have to work really hard to convince my panel why I didn't read their work.\n\nThat's my take on it, at least. But yeah, definitely it feels as though I can broaden my literature research. Which can be helpful, but also distracting as well.",

In my third year, corona happened. I am lucky to have finished my data collection before the pandemic. Third year was my data analysis and writing time. I worked 35 hours per week, but because the isolation affected my mental health, I then took 2 months off and wasn\u2019t working at all.

I went into my PhD (nutritional science) expecting a hectic schedule .. which to an extent I want!\n\nThe reality is I find myself twiddling thumbs, reading a few papers, having a few periods of data collection here and there, writing comes easily which is great, submitting ethics applications..this definitely doesn\u2019t require even a 40h week!\n\nAnd again .. main supervisor reckons I\u2019m ahead (1.5 years in, 1 paper published and second submitting to a journal this week) but I can\u2019t help but feel like a fraud because I\u2019m not doing enough, not filling my time productively .. even others in my group are constantly \u2018under the pump\u2019 and I\u2019ve been very underwhelmed by how easy it\u2019s felt. It has been a lot of work and I\u2019ve worked hard but I can count on one hand the amount of times I\u2019ve felt truly stressed during my PhD. \n\nI don\u2019t know, perhaps it\u2019s actually a good thing for us lol?",

I'm obviously not insinuating a PhD is easy. It really isn't, but I've been feeling for a while that I should be doing more. The consensus here seems to suggest that a lot more people are in my situation than I thought, so that makes me feel better.",

You\u2019re completely right though in that the major stress is \u2018what to do now\u2019 or perhaps feeling lost in the sea of knowledge or even being unsure of whether what I\u2019m doing is PhD worthy because \u2018im not working as hard/including as many elaborate experiments as others (due to lack of resources at the NZ University I\u2019m at) however when I have a meeting or write things down I can usually keep my eye on the prize.\n\nPhDs are a funny thing ey!",

No matter how much you are doing it's always possible to do more, but not always smart because of the risk of burnout and the effects on mental health. There definitely is an unspoken stigma that you have to be working 24/7 otherwise you won't keep up with your peers, but its a load of bull. Do enough to keep your project moving forward, and try not to stress out about using downtime for personal pursuits and keeping yourself happy.\n\nI had a motto that I followed throughout grad school, and it was \"no zero days\". What this meant to me was to do _something_ every workday to move my project forward. It could literally just be one small thing, but if it was at least one thing then I considered the day a success. It helped me fight the \"I'm not doing enough\" thought that would sometimes crop up in my head and it made me focus on the things I did accomplish rather than than the things I didn't accomplish.",

As a student with most of my data already collected, I averaged one deadline every 6 weeks, between: (1) writing proposals for grants to support my data collection (3-5 per year), (2) preparing presentations for conferences (2/year), (3) preparing presentations for miscellaneous invited talks (2/year)... plus (4) deadlines I set myself for various stages of paper writing/preparation. It was hard to fit in substantial time to analyze batches of my data, think about it deeply, and also read the literature deeply.\n\nSo maybe it will get busier for you later when you have data collected. Or maybe it will still be not too bad, if you don't have to write proposals and stuff simultaneously with doing data analysis (depends on your field). Either way, enjoy the chill time while you can!",

I read people's blogs and the amount of times I'd read a post about someone's average day and they'd say something like:\n\n1) get up\n\n2) check emails\n\n3) have a coffee\n\n4) travel to campus/lab\n\n5) do some PhD work\n\n\nAnd I'd just think \"what does that mean?

Whenever I think of PhD research being stressful and taking up 60+ hours a week, it's probably these fields I'm imagining. Maybe that's just the stereotypical image people have of PhD researchers. Even now, one year in, I still picture everyone in lab coats and holding up test tubes quizzically.",

I guess if we make a headcount, a large number of phd candidates will turn out to be from STEM. \nI had no idea one could do a phd in horror games! That\u2019s great. Looking forward to the insights you will gain from your study and maybe we\u2019ll have some cool horror games in future",

Since my fieldwork is planned in October, I just don't know how to fill my days because there is almost nothing to do.\n\nI have been playing with the idea to try and write a book or literature review in the mean time and get it published.
