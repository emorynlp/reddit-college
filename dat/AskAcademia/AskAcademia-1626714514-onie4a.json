  "title:": "Is this allowed? Authorship question",
  "text": "My partner finished a social sciences master\u2019s degree from a university in a different country. Their thesis is highly related to my research interests. They aren\u2019t going into academia so they don\u2019t feel motivated to publish it in a journal. However I\u2019m a PhD student so I offered to convert it into a journal article as second author and they agreed.\n\nIt feels like I may be breaking a rule either by working with my partner or by publishing research based on interviews I didn\u2019t conduct (and I wasn\u2019t on the IRB application for). We can check with our respective advisors if needed but in general does this seem acceptable?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the replies! We\u2019ll move forward with the manuscript. :)",
