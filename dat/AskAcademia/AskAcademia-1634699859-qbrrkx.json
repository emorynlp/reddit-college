  "text": "A bit of context of where I'm at right now. I finished my masters in ecology 4 years ago, and returned to my hometown with the intentions of getting a job. Worked for a while with a consulting company, but after some months I had to quit and haven't been able to secure anything in my field ever since. I really miss doing things related to my interests (urban ecology mainly), and I've also become interested in other topics (like sustainable mobility, public space, complete neighborhoods, etc). But finding a job in the ecology/biology realm is hard enough, let alone going for something like urban planning for which I have no theoretical or practical experience whatsoever. I've tried getting an internship or something, but it hasn't worked out either.\n\nNow to my main issue. I found this fellowship for a short research residency I would like to apply to. I have to come up with a project proposal, but I'm feeling a little lost on how to actually develop a feasible project or at least plan for one. I googled the research teams I'd like to work with, and I have a very, very vague idea of what it is I want to do, but that's as far as I get. No idea how to look for gaps in their research or how I could replicate their research in a different context. I would like to talk to the researchers for some guidance, but I'm assuming they're expecting me to have all of this already figured out. I'm also feeling very insecure cause I would be doing a project on something a bit foreign to my background (active mobility) but which I'm really interested in.\n\nEven if I don't apply to this fellowship, I had been considering the possibility of applying to a PhD program, but then I would be facing this same issue I am facing now -  that I have no idea how to be a scientist and come up with questions and ways to answer those questions. Maybe this is my cue to not even try applying for this fellowship or a future PhD, since I don't really have the curiosity/passion in me?",

      "text": "Developing good research projects - and then describing them to others in a compelling way - is a skill that needs to be developed, so don't feel bad because you can't immediately conjure one up. You can learn and get better at it just like anything else!\n\nI will say that fellowships like these *are* typically aimed at someone who has a decent idea of a specific project they would like to pursue, and/or people who still have access to university resources to help them develop the fellowship idea into something marketable. I'd see if your undergraduate or graduate university has resources for alumni applying for fellowships; alumni getting these fellowships often looks good for the college, so sometimes universities provide limited support for recent graduates or all alumni.\n\nHowever, to answer the more general question: gaps are only visible when you have a solid grasp of the research in your area. You can't know what hasn't been done until you read a lot of what's already out there on the topic. The more you read in your area, the more you will grasp not only the gaps in content knowledge but also what methods haven't been tried and what approaches haven't been taken. Now, different levels of programs and places require different levels of novelty in the research: for example, an undergraduate theses or a fellowship program aimed at graduating seniors isn't likely to be looking for a project that is going to push the field forward in a specific area but maybe just creativity and curiosity. On the other hand, a PhD fellowship will require some level of novelty, and a grant to a PhD-holding scientist more still.\n\nYou could still talk to the researchers; at the very least, they can help you understand whether your level of knowledge is in line with what they were envisioning for the residency.  \n\n\n>Even if I don't apply to this fellowship, I had been considering the possibility of applying to a PhD program, but then I would be facing this same issue I am facing now - that I have no idea how to be a scientist and come up with questions and ways to answer those questions.

But there is a difference between not knowing how to come up with good research questions (which is *relatively* normal) and not having the curiosity and passion for research (which would be a problem).",

      "text": "I had to invent my own PhD project. It sucked. Postdoc in the lab suggested I read a bunch of reviews as they will often close with the gaps in the field. One review was perfect, and hypothesized a project that would take a PhD thesis to address. So that's what I did. Designing the approach was actually a lot of fun once I had a question.\n\n Found out along the way there was a pretty good reason why it hadn't been addressed.  But in the end there was enough  novel positive and negative data to make a contribution. Wasn't groundbreaking, but it was progress.",
