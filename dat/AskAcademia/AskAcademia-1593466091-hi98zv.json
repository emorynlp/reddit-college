  "text": "How do some people end up completing their PhD (in the USA) in 4 years? I've seen people in Chemistry and Materials Sciences complete their PhDs in 4 years directly after their bachelor's and that too without compromising the number and quality of publications. \n\nWhat traits set these students apart and what skills need deliberate practice to follow their footsteps?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I'm not talking about PhD programs in the European universities where the length of PhD is much shorter in general. But that is an interesting topic too. The students in the European universities also produce similar works like that of US grad students but they take much less time to complete their PhDs.",

They use the papers as chapters of their thesis, adding only introduction and conclusion chapters.\n- They assertively manage their advisors to review manuscripts quickly and to not ratchet up expectations.\n- They have one or more committee members who apply pressure on the advisor if necessary not to delay the defense.\n\n(Coming from someone who took 5 1/2 years but had a few very disciplined colleagues.)\n\nEDIT: This seemed to click with a lot of people, so I wanted to add a few more shared characteristics of the individuals I worked with:\n\n- They had a concrete plan for their career for after graduation; grad school was a means to an end and not a space for exploration.\n- They had a limited tolerance for \"what-if\" discussions and mostly wanted to get back into the lab and work.\n- They didn't necessarily have the most supportive advisor but did know what levers to pull to move forward (e.g., different adversarial styles or networking to pull in high-clout individuals to support them against the advisor).\n- They didn't necessarily feel that they were very smart, but they did feel that they could attack any challenge and prevail. They didn't get sidetracked long by an experiment going wrong or a piece of equipment not working; that would certainly be on the top of their mind until they addressed the issue, but it wouldn't shake their confidence in their research. They weren't overly confident or egotistical in their progress or successes either. In other words, they weren't married to their research; they just *did the work every day* as the units of progress accumulated.\n\nSo: dispassionate, tenacious, steely, organized, savvy, and lucky.",

I helped with fixing the lab AFTER I had done what I needed for my stuff). Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help with stats, argue against extra things that won\u2019t be a benefit to you, and have a good support network.

Yes, you have to do what your advisor says to a degree, but there are ways of declining, ways of reframing, and ways of getting out of things. Some of this is interpersonal skills. Some is that some advisors are a\\*\\*holes. Some is that many grad students are NOT good at advocating for themselves. All of this feeds into a sh\\*tty cycle. BUT, you can change that. Most people are amenable to things if they're framed in a way that appeases them. Or you make them think your idea is actually theirs. Or you push deadlines in a way that people can't argue with. I'm fed up of this idea that graduate students have no power. We do, we just need to learn how to utilize it",

For example, students finishing in 3 years are very unlikely at a university that does lab rotations for the first year,  because they need to be starting their main projects right away. Different universities also have different required lengths of time between prelim and final exam. For example at Purdue in BME, you must have at least 12 months between your prelim and your final defense. Since in wet lab work it's often \"nothing's working, nothing's working, oh! It's working!\", students often prelim here late in their 3rd year to ~halfway through their 4th year,  meaning they absolutely cannot graduate before 4-5.5 complete years. In another department (like MechE here) or another university that only requires 6 months in between,  they will likely still prelim around the same time, but will then defend and graduate in 3.5-4.5 years instead. \n\nDifferent universities also require different amounts of classes,  and somewhere with more coursework will mean less time in the lab in your early years in the program. I don't think 1-2 extra classes a semester will seem like it makes that much of a difference, but if you're really try to push to have a full research thesis and papers out in 3 years, that extra class time each semester adds up. The same thing is true for universities that require students to TA (or students who select/need to TA as their funding). \n\nLastly, these students likely came into an established project in the lab. Perhaps they shadowed a graduate student who was about to leave (and getting a publication early in their program along the way) and then took over with a good idea of the techniques needed and the project direction. You can try to make sure you're in this situation when you interview potential PIs, but sometimes it's just luck.",

On top of that, you may not have many teaching obligations.  And in some places, it's not unusual to have more technical support staff doing things like lab management that (sometimes) falls on the grad students in North America.  \n\nPlus, if you're in a country that treats PhD students like well-paid, contracted employees, that can lead to a culture where efficiency, limited hours, and strong project/time management are more deliberately emphasized than might happen in a more loosely-defined setting.  Of course, depending on your supervisor, department, and yourself, you can also push for that culture in a North American setting, but I think it is less of a default approach there, on average.",

Some of these people were less motivated. Some of these people also had life events that slowed them down, like a major health issue, taking off time for maternity leave, a death in the family, or divorce. But most of the time, they had an advisor who had enough funding for them and wasn\u2019t really motivated to have them leave. So they could stick around and get as many pubs as they wanted until the academic job market picked up. A couple others had been ABD when their advisor retired, so they were stuck with a new advisor with a different program of research and little investment in helping them finish.\n\nThen a bunch of professors began leaving for better jobs at other programs. This included our most famous professor with lots of grant money, so everyone in the department was motivated to help students finish so they don\u2019t have to fund them. Half my cohort ended up getting tenure track job offers around the time they proposed, so everyone in the department wanted them to graduate so they could report more graduates in TT positions. My fellowship had ended at four years and my advisor was leaving, so they wanted me to finish so they wouldn\u2019t have to fund me and find me a new advisor. My husband (same cohort) also got an offer for a research position that required that he finish his PhD soon, so they also rushed him out. At the end of it all, my entire cohort finished their PhDs in 4-4.5 years, in a program that required three years of coursework.\n\nAfter a year or two, my old program fell into the same patterns. They attracted some more funding from new hires, they had people leave that didn\u2019t rush their students into graduating, and they\u2019ve let students take their time when the job market slowed down again. Now the average is up to six years again.",

I had two years of full-time coursework, and I completed my foreign language competency during the first semester (read: translating four totally different article excerpts in German from my field--linguistics). I completed my comprehensive examinations (general and specialty) the following year, wrote and defended my dissertation prospectus, and prepared for fieldwork. I spent every summer in the field (read: East/East-Central Africa), and I wrote and defended my dissertation during the fourth year. Because my program did not have any RA or TA requirements, I was free to adjunct on my own time as available/suited. Additionally, my coursework was arranged by the program so that it could be completed entirely in those first two years.\n\nI knew that I would only get one shot at this, so I planned meticulously and worked through everything ahead of schedule. In hindsight, I actually wish I had slowed down and enjoyed the experience a little bit more.

I don't mean you should work really long hours, just that you have to prioritise brain power on certain things. Some stuff, like tedious data organisation or copying numbers, can be done without too much focus, so you shouldn't waste the 4-5 hours of intense focus you have each day. \n\nA big part is planning ahead and not letting yourself get distracted. If you're in your 4-5 hours working on high-level stuff, you really can't afford to get sidetracked with emails or to start jumping between projects. If you do have to jump between things and multitask, that should be planned.\n\nThe person I know who managed to finish in 3 years without a Masters and without seeming to struggle or work overtime was *super* organised.

Of course, to handle that intensity takes a certain type of personality but if all the ingredients come together, it\u2019s definitely possible.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting though that a shorter PhD program is fine only as long as you still get the training you need to be successful afterwards.
