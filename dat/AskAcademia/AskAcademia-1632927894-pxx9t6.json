  "title:": "How important is the reputation of the lab/university you\u2019re doing your PhD at for an academic career?",
  "text": "Hello there, I have asked this question in another subreddit and it has been suggested to ask it in here.\n\nCurrently I am having two offers for an open PhD position. One is at a (according to the QS world university ranking) top 10 university in the world and the other one is at an university around my area (which might not be known at all in the world). Should it be of importance, it\u2019s in an engineering/material science lab.\n\nSince both research groups are offering interesting and challenging projects plus I am having positive feelings about the potential supervisors, my decision might come down to a rather \u201esimple\u201c is the boost for an academic career that big by doing your PhD at a prestigious university/lab compared to an unknown one? I have definitely realized that quite a few people who have recently worked as postdoc in that prestigious lab are now building up their own research groups as professors, which I can not say about the other group.\n\nHowever, so far it felt like that there is a lot of luck involved in that Academic Space and going to the prestigious university would definitely mean leaving my comfort zone (again) and leads to some restrictions in income (it\u2019s more that the expanses at that place are much higher than the increase in income).\n\ntldr: See the headline:)\n\nHave a wonderful day everyone and I am looking forward to read some experiences and impressions.",

Postdocs are at a different career stage than students and will get different things out of the same lab.",

          "text": ">The outcomes from previous group members should be a major influence on your choice of group.\n\nI would go further and say it should be almost the only influence (assuming that the main reason for pursuing a PhD is to get an academic career as the outcome).\n\nIt's rare for one graduate of a program to be so good that they achieve placements far outside the norm for that program. So my advice to prospective students is always focus on the placements of the program's graduates.",
