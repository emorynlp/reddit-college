  "title:": "Building confidence as a graduate student?",
  "text": "I'm currently in my second semester of my PhD program and entered the program from a Master's institution with a thesis completed. I'm positing here because my current advisor mentioned at the start of the semester that she was disappointed by my training in my last institution. The biggest reason was because she noticed I had very defensive and anxious reactions to questions she or the older student in my lab (he is in his last year and wrapping up his dissertation) would ask. To be clear, my reactions are not \"what I meant was...\" kind of reactions. These would be reactions where I would reply but show signs of defensiveness and anxiousness by talking really fast and/or not make eye contact as I reply. During a meeting at the start of the semester, she said that the main thing she would like me to work on during my time in the program (and she will try and help with) is my confidence so I have less of those reactions. I've tried to shift my mindset to one that accepts \"I'm still learning,\" but to little avail so far.\n\nI should note that I do not have these defense, anxious, or embarrassed reactions when I am asked questions during presentations or receive verbal feedback for assignments (e.g., after class, office hours, etc.) for class-related matters. However, as I'm adjusting and \"unlearning\" my old habits, my old habits crept into my life as a PhD student. If I had to think of a possible reason (although I'm not certain), a lot of my anxiousness probably came from previous work and class experiences where I constantly thought about \"not looking bad\" to whoever is my superior or in charge of me (teachers, bosses, etc.). I was raised in a household and suburb that really enjoys the private sector and their workplace dynamics, so I was primed from an early age to be wary of work and class related authority whenever they saw me on the job. In regards to classrooms, I used to be extremely scared of presenting in front of the class and would not make eye contact with the audience (in K-12 and even in undergrad). For K-12, I was worried about impression management as well since it was not just the teacher's grading but also going in front of the class and potentially becoming the subject of judgment or gossip if there was a presentation moment so infamous that students talked about it.\n\nMy confidence issues were only occasionally present at my Master's institution because most of the faculty (my previous advisor included) had a tendency to not be super involved in matters such as the quality of data collected as long as the data lost was not an absurd amount. When I talked to him, he was always to the point with things and did not stray much into other topics. Even when I asked him how he was doing, the answer was generally vague. However, he would throw his hand up and look away from me whenever he was annoyed or would sound extremely tense when he gave me feedback for papers while I was in his office. I never enjoyed those reactions and would get nervous, but I never showed my emotions much because he would keep talking and not ask any questions.\n\nFor class related matters, graduate school has smaller class sizes and I could present on research subjects I was passionate about (which is why I became fine with answering questions since I knew more about what I was talking about). When I look at my graduate school presentation demeanor now, there's no shaky voice or other nervous habits compared to how I was in K-12 and undergraduate. Despite this improvement, it's clear that the nervous habits came back in the form of discussions with my current advisor and lab mate. My current advisor contrasts my previous advisor because she is more hands-on with me and has a far different style overall. The only similarity between them is that they are to the point. However, my current advisor is willing to show her sensitive side (a HUGE contrast to my old advisor). She gives a mix of positive and negative feedback, which makes the moments where she expresses herself impactful because its clear she's authentic rather than consistently putting up boundaries to keep a distance (which was the case with my last advisor).\n\nGetting to the point - what can I do to build my confidence? I was told by my current advisor that's something she doesn't want to be a thing by the time I'm done with the program. I agree since my confidence issues have been a thing for as long as I can remember and would like to make progress.\n\nTL;DR - I was told by my advisor that she was disappointed by my Master's institution training because my confidence is (still) low and wants that to improve. What can I do to build my confidence?\n\nEdit: Just want to take a moment to acknowledge all of the supportive comments and advice! Even though I have not replied to anyone here, I've read all of the comments. Thank you so much!",

I panicked and acted defensively when asked about my data. I\u2019m normally a confident person elsewhere, but within science, it\u2019s so difficult to be sure of yourself. I still struggle now. \n\nThere are certainly resources that can help with anxiety, and then confidence... but also recognize this: it\u2019s okay to be wrong in your answers. It\u2019s okay to say \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d or to ask for guidance. As long as you are honest and follow up. Try to practice talking about your work with peers, an SO, or other mentors consciously.",

      "text": "You already got awesome answers to this question, I wanted to add somethings that may help with externally managing your reactions. I'm a PhD student,  also have shared experiences with bad PIs in the past/ when I present it takes me a hot second to process the question. While confidence building etc is important, there are helpful tips that you can implement that will give the perception of confidence and/or relax the audience. I picked many of these up from facilitation.\n\nTips:\n\n1. **Slow down when responding.**\n   1. Nod your head, say something like \"good question\" and pause. This will help you think through your answer a bit BUT also it makes people feel heard which in turn, can help it seem like less defensive/offensive.\n   2. To create a natural pause, taking a sip of water also helps.\n   3. Another thing that may help you pause, is writing questions/suggestions down.\n2. **If eye contact** is something that has been pointed out, when you practice your talk practice looking at the audience. I generally scan, don't make too much eye contact (stare at their nose/forehead)\u2014just the scanning motion can make people feel \"seen\".\n3. **Practice \"fill\" in phrases.**\n   1. If you don't know something, or haven't thought about it previously its OK so say \"thats a great suggestion, I will not it down\" or something like that. You can also say \"I don't know, however based on ...\". Have a couple of \"at the ready\" phrases to deal with stuff you may not know.\n   2. Practise positive responses to questions that are \"well duh I did that I just didn't have the time to present\". Useful phrases are:\n      1. Thats a great point, and as a matter of fact....\n      2. oh yes \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, I thought about it and \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n      3. Yes, let me clarify....\n\nMentally:\n\nIts helped me to think of internal lab meeting presentations as \"preparatory\" presentations. They are supposed to help me get better, and give me feedback for when I have to show others. It helps me feel like I DON'T have to be perfect, which relaxes me. In this vein, if you have parts of the presentation you want feedback on. Go ahead and make sure you priori mention it so (a) they know you don't think the work is perfect (2) they will focus their attentions to the areas you need help in. This tactic also makes people feel helpful, and honestly, there is confidence in being willing to ask for help.\n\nAbove all, don't feel like you have to be perfect\u2014NO ONE is. Don't feel like this is a personal attack on you or your ability <3\n\nedit: thank you stranger for the award! my first <3",

Advice I've received, which has helped and will hopefully continue to help, is to state facts I know without justifying them, especially before I state the facts. My bad habit is explaining my reasoning before saying the actual thing so I can't be questioned and reprimanded for not knowing something (my previous supervisor belittled their students for sport). I've been working on it for the past couple of months and, while it's still a work in progress, I'm more confident. That's a combination of my supervisor being supportive, me knowing the material better and me practicing just saying the facts as I know them and answering any questions. I still get really defensive, which my therapist says is understandable, but I'm more confident than the bumbling, defensive mess I was when I left that previous supervisor.",

The fact that you are here reflecting on this says a lot about your abilities.\n\nIn my opinion, this is not necessarily an academic issue but one of personal growth. The difficulty is openly admitting you don't know something. I think the best conditions to practice this in are when listeners, such as your supervisor or audience, allow that to happen. I think what would really help, as it did me, is to just openly admit that you don't know the answer to a question. But, follow up with what you DO understand and just think out loud. As time goes, the more often you'll run into things you won't understand, nor will you understand everything. The first few times you do this, obviously, there's a fear that you might get scolded for not knowing, but stay firm and adamant. Be kind to yourself and recognize that you don't know everything and even if there is something you \"should\" know and someone berates you for not knowing, that's an issue with their ability to give constructive feedback tactfully.",
