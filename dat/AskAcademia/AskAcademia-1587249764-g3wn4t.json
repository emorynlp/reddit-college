  "text": "Here's a small excerpt from the paper:\n\n> *Abstract:* Many people wonder: what\u2019s the deal with birds? This is a common query. Birds are pretty weird. I mean, they have feathers. WTF? Most other animals don\u2019t have feathers. To investigate this issue, I looked at some birds. I looked at a woodpecker, a parrot, and a penguin. They were all pretty weird! In conclusion, we may never know the deal with birds, but further study is warranted.\n\n> *Keywords*: birds, ornithology, behavior, phenotype, WTF, genomics, climate change\n\nYou can read the PDf version of the original article here: https://irispublishers.com/sjrr/pdf/SJRR.MS.ID.000540.pdf\n\nAlternatively, there's a press summary of the situation here: https://gizmodo.com/sketchy-science-journal-publishes-article-titled-whats-1842924936",

He gets to spend taxpayer money on a stupid joke and gets lots of publicity, the journal gets the money and also some publicity, and everyone gets to laugh, except the poor graduate students who wonder why the university budget is going towards this rather than a livable salary, and all the other people who are exploited by the system. I do hope he at least wasted his own money on this.",
