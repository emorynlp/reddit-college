  "text": "Good evening, I am a teaching/research assistant at my university and have a question regarding my some research I was assisting with. \n\nThroughout the semester I was told about helping to organize some data collected through surveys and journals, however, they just recently became available for myself and another assistant to begin organization. After looking through them and seeing what we were being told to do, it would take several days of work to get everything done. We are currently in finals week and I have been doing a lot to prepare to collect data for my own thesis as we return in the spring. \n\nI will not be a GA/TA next semester so I will not have to help with any of this after this week. Should I tell the professor that I simply can not get this done in time? She is someone who I have a decent relationship with due to my background in the same field she teaches and researches in and am worried about any repercussions from her/ the university for not completing work I was given. \n\nI know this is a lot, sorry! Thanks!",

      "text": "At my uni, being a teaching assistant is different than a research assistant. A TA has a strict contract, with biweekly payments and although should be allowed, saying to the prof that you cant do the work wont go over well and you will be strongly asked to do it anyways. However if this was a more flexible arrangement, then yes, totally tell them that you can't complete it. I dont even expect people to respond to emails in December, let alone start working on projects.",
