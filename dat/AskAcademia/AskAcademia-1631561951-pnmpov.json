Someone i know got tenure just before turning 60. Real world experience can be a plus for schools that care about teaching. \nMake no mistake, it is a grueling process and the TT life can be miserable. The good news is that if you are very good (and ok with not having a life) you can go straight to a nice 6 figure tenure track position at a business school right after your PhD (assuming US). It is competitive AF but if you are into that the opportunities are a lot better than in many other academic fields. Just make sure you know what you're getting into.",

I worked plenty of late nights, but I also took a vacation every year. \n\nBeing miserable or not also depends on your department/school. I came up through the TT at a place where administration was *very* supportive of junior faculty. Meaning, they made sure we had plenty of time to do research and resources to improve our teaching, and minimal committee work. Funds to travel to research conferences were never denied. In other words, they would do everything to ensure you had a chance to get tenure.\n\nNot everywhere is like this of course, there are dysfunctional places. My point is more that if the system is working, you will have the support you need to meet the expectations (and if the system is not working maybe you're better off moving on anyway). \n\nAnd, while I did not enjoy every minute of my time as an untenured assistant professor, there were many, many fun aspects of it.\n\nAlso, I'm sure I would have a different perspective if I had been denied tenure.",

The idea of using a book with lots of academic references as a jumping off point is fantastic. Ideally, you would also identify a faculty member (or a few) in each school whose research interests align somewhat and express interest in working with them.\n\nBasically, your goal in the application should be to convince the committee (a) you are either capable of doing academic research or capable of learning the necessary skills and (b) you have at least some passing familiarity with what research means in their discipline, and some realistic ideas about what you might want to study (you can always change this later-- but my experience is that applicants with specific interests tend to be viewed as more credible than those who are vague).\n\nI always suggest that prospective business PhD students check out the PhD project ([https://www.phdproject.org/resources/faqs/](https://www.phdproject.org/resources/faqs/) ; in fact one of their FAQs is basically \"am I too old?\").  PhD project is a consortium focused on increasing diversity in business school faculty, but even if you are not their target audience the information on their website is useful.",

My impression though is that a PhD rec letter should maybe be more detailed/intimate? \n\nI also worked for several months part-time last year as a Research Assistant for a professor. He indicated he would write a letter of recommendation for me. However, I'm not sure if the research wound up going anywhere after I left, and while still in the social science field it wasn't particularly closely related to OB, the area I'm now targeting, so I'm not sure if those things would count against me.\n\nI took a course with one woman who I'd love to write me a letter - she has an impressive professional job and teaches on the side, but has a PhD, and I feel like the work I did for her class is more closely related to my potential PhD topics than any of my other classes. She also gave me the top grade in the class. Much to my disappointment though, she seems very busy and not that responsive. \n\nThen, I did an internship this year that would also sort of tangentially relate to my PhD area of interest. I also managed to work some primary and secondary research into the internship, although again it wasn't OB research. I probably have more of a personal relationship with the supervisors for this work than with the previously mentioned professors. However, neither of them have PhDs or experience in academia post-Master's level as far as I know, and I read that recommendations from people without PhDs should be avoided. And I guess a professor of a UX Research course I took more recently at a CC would fall into this category as well - I got to do some fun original research for his course, and he's a tenure track professor, but he doesn't have a PhD.\n\nWould you agree with the advice to avoid letters from people without PhDs, or do you think there is more nuance to what makes a good recommender? I appreciate your thoughts if you have any!",

Whereas, we sometimes see people with maybe one letter that really comments on their research potential, and other letters that are more like \"I'm this person's manager and they're really great!\" (which is nice but not really helpful).",
