  "text": "I (29M) feel as if I am one of the luckiest people on Earth to have the position I do. Top tier university with a very clear route into a full time academic position. I however have been struggling mentally since getting the post. I am half way through a two year post-doc position with the option to convert to lecturer at the end of my post with the caveat that I publish papers. \n\nThis is the crux of my problem, the stress of publishing is really getting to me. I dont know how to push this process along any faster than it is. It feels like I'm really lost at sea. I keep panicing that I'm not cut out for this post -- not so much intellectually but rather just scoring the funding necessary to sustain myself. It really feels like I'm going to run into very serious problems when it turns out I haven't published enough throughout my PhD and post-doc to warrent my position and therefore \"fail\". \n\nI think its worth noting that I moved overseas for this post and now if I don't convert the job, I'll have to move back and face the reality of being a bit of a failure. \n\nDoes anyone have any sage advice for a lonely post-doc. I dont know who to turn to....",

Use the prestige of your current position to leverage a non-soft money position.  Granted, you will have these pressures again as you approach tenure, so you may want to consider what type of university you want to move to and the types of research expectations they have.  These can requirements range anywhere from don't even think about tenure unless you have >$1million in grants to a paper roughly every other year.",

Focus on writing well and read style guides etc. continuously. Read about making good graphs as well. Reviewers like to read well-crafted papers. Eventually, writing a paper will be quite straightforward and fast.\n\nMaybe you can write more communications instead of full papers? They take so much less time to write and the peer review is generally quicker. You\u2019ll probably need some full papers as well, though.\n\nLastly, stop worrying. Do what you can, but accept that the final outcome is beyond your control. Constantly worrying will not change it  all. Maybe get acquainted with stoicism: \u201cA man who suffers before it is necessary, suffers more than is necessary.\u201d (Seneca) In addition, even if you can\u2019t achieve your goal, life will go on.

      "text": "I also struggled a lot with my mental health this first year in a new job especially under the publication expectations. What really helped me was using Wendy Belcher's book \"Writing Your Journal Article in 12 Weeks.\" It breaks down the article revision process into microsteps that you can space out while also doing other research and teaching obligations. And there's also a chapter about how to draft an article in the first place if you don't have a draft you're working with. It has sections for both Quant and Humanities fields, so regardless of where you fall you might find it useful. Just knowing that when I wake up in the morning to go to my desk, I don't have to decide what I'm going to do to work toward publication, but instead just have to follow the next task in the sequence has taken a massive weight off my shoulders. I've also found that productivity software like \"Trello\" which is normally used for jobs in industry to break down tasks into steps is incredibly helpful as well for keeping track of grants and breaking the grant application process into smaller tasks with due dates.",

      "text": "I'm likely not in the same field as you, but I am a full professor and have published 60-ish papers and have a couple of grants right now. One thing I always tell those starting out is that papers usually a few years in the pipeline, so your publishing record looks low for the first several years. Eventually, the number of papers you write each year are the number that are published (not the same papers), but that takes 5+ years, I think. Nearly all of my publications are with different groups of collaborators. I'm in the U.S., so it's not a bad thing for me to publish with others (in fact, securing federal funding would be virtually impossible if I didn't publish with my study team). My recent postdoc (who transitioned to a research scientist role at my university) was in a similar role as you, it sounds like. I viewed part of my job to be helping her to build her publication record. Will your faculty mentor do the same? If not, you will have to seek out people at your institution or elsewhere. I was in a similar boat as a grad student; my mentor was wonderful but close to retirement, so he wasn't interested in publishing much. I reached out to faculty members at different institutions as well as peers at my institution to collaborate with. I still collaborate with some of those folks! I'm always willing to write a paper with anyone; if it doesn't work out well (e.g., I end up doing all the work), it just won't turn into more than one paper. I agree with others that more junior folks are also hungry for pubs. I publish several times more papers now than I did early in my career, but I work on each paper for less time-there are just so many papers and time is spread thin. \n\nOne piece of advice that I give my grad students is that it's not a failure to end up outside of academia. For me, it was a combination of luck and a great fit for my skills. But there are other great jobs out there; not working in academia does not mean you are a failure! My fellow grad school cohort members have some truly fabulous careers 15 years post-graduation, and only about half of the 15 are faculty members. None of them are a failure. :)",

You have to apply for your own funding? Your work is not supported by your lab/supervisor/whatever? Your post obviously doesn't give many specifics, and it does sound like a lot of your anxiety is motivated by having just moved to a new country, maybe COVID, maybe some mental health stuff, probably a good deal of just the general sense of anxiety that most anyone develops in grad school...

They tend to focus on 1) Make time to write every day, at least for half an hour.  2) You can do three things- outline, write, or edit.  Some days it will be better mentally to edit instead of write, but all three are necessary at various points in writing.  3) Though difficult with COVID, changing your environment can help.  I have been more inspired to write if I'm away from my main computer this year.\n\nOnce you have something you're happy enough with (as said above, co-authors help a lot!), submit and let it be.  Don't check on \"manuscript status\" every day as that doesn't help.  Rejection is part of the process, though I say that with the luxury of being tenured.  Acceptance is, of course, a major dopamine windfall.",

I'm so happy to be able to reach out to this community and hear some feedback. \n\nA number of you have given some very constructive comments and for that I am grateful. \n\nYes, I think my position is pretty unique in that I don't fit even the average post-doc. I'm faculty funded and am treated like an academic in all but title. I think a few of you have said to just accept my fate whatever it might be. As some of the other posts have always mentioned, I believe academics (or close to) have generally done well in school and university, failing at something is often difficult to accept. Just going to try and make the most of the time I have left.\n\nAgain, thank you all.",

      "text": "You are never a failiure but the academic system or the established people in it is not acknowledging the great journey and goad that you strive towards as a PhD-student. Regaining mental strength and resilience is your priority. Claim that right as a person as this is a basic right regardless of which type of role, employment or system we are in. You are the  most important thing in your PhD-journey.  Find out exactly what counts at your university and a couple of additional ones, that you are interested in - don't speculate get numbers. how many articles, in journals that are ranked x, y, z and the weight of single authored, co-authored articles. Take it step by step and reach out to people, many want to engage with PhD-students (from other places ironically). Liase with the right people, the ones that can support or facilitate the publication of your articles. These persons are not necessarily your supervisors, professor and their contribution to your process, as constructive or not is more easily assessed in terms of them giving you 1) inspiration 2) collaboration (i.e. efforts on their part) 3) contributing to your publishing learning curve and savy. Be happy but don't fall into the gratefulness trap. If a senior researcher is engaging with you and your work it is because there is something in it for them.",
