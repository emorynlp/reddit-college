  "title:": "How common is jumping TT jobs right before tenure?",
  "text": "I've seen numerous R1 assistant professors in the job market during their 4th or 5th year before their tenure review to look for higher ranked departments. Is it easier to switch jobs before tenure rather than after? Does switching TT jobs increase the overall tenure clock at the new department?",

      "text": "It is not uncommon to change positions. One game plan (not employed by all) is to look for jobs while under promotion review. Since you're getting letters anyway (and often you can suggest a portion of your promotion letters), you could ask the same people for job letters. In part this could help protect yourself in case of a bad tenure decision (however unlikely), used for negotiation, or simply to move to a more attractive place.\n\nIt's definitely easier to move pre-tenure for the simple reason that there are more jobs. The general principle (at least in my field) is that if you're going to hire someone with tenure (and especially full professor) it usually has to be someone special/distinguished (for your institution's level). This means someone who isn't just the same level as the \"average\" tenured professor at the school who rose through the ranks. Hiring at the assistant professor level, one hires in part based on \"potential\".\n\nIf you move from one assistant professor position to another, you can negotiate a bump in your tenure clock (meaning earlier promotion). However, whether you really want this depends on the institution. Some places will simply put you up when you're \"ready\". At other places, moving your clock forward can't be undone and, should anything go wrong, you'll have less time to recover. Remember that tenure promotion is supposed to be about work done at the new institution.",

Although it's obvious that someone out 8 years will have had more time to build a file than someone out 3 years, if it's for an assistant professor position I suspect people basically ignore the arithmetic. Now, you're usually hired for your best work. So a younger person with a breakthrough beats a more seasoned person with more publications but seemingly lower ceiling.",

This is particularly true if the new institution offers tenure as part of their offer.\n2. It's a way of hedging your bets; if there's a chance you won't get tenure, you resign to start a new job and you were never denied tenure.\n3. There are MANY more job openings for assistant professors than associates or fulls; if you want to switch institutions, it's easiest as an assistant.\n4. You may be able to extend the tenure clock by jumping institutions, but still get a salary bump.",

      "text": "I'm a third year assistant professor at an R2. My dean told me that I could apply for tenure and promotion as early as next year. This year I went to the job market and applied for one job only: also a TT posotion (assistant professor) at a very highly ranked R1. My plan is to get the offer and ask my current institution for a counteroffer. I think they won't be able to match (or at least to near) the offer of an R1, but I'd like to give them a chance.\n\nI think that about half of the assistant professor TT folks I know (and I'm being conservative) have been in the job market even before year 5 or 6. The academic system is rigged against our favor. It's not designed to reward us so we have to remind our institutions of our value. Sadly,  I can say that most people I know don't land a job elsewhere (or don't take it after all) and end up going up for tenure at their original institution, perhaps after a small (or not that small) salary increase or slightly improved conditions.",

Get that better offer and then choose whatever is best. Good luck!!!",
