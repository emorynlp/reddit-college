  "title:": "Woah. Is this normal for a rejection letter?",
  "text": "I've only published a couple other things and have definitely never encountered/heard of anything like this level of contempt in a rejection letter... I mean, *you've already rejected it.* \n\nI feel like the reviewer initially ended the evaluation with KILL YOURSELF before thinking better of it.\n\nHere it is:\n\n  \n\n>This article is *not scholarly at all*, despite its ambitions.   \n>  \n>It jumps about a great deal, touching on everything from Greek myth to Russian romanticism to Alexandre Dumas to the American TV series *The West Wing*.   \n>  \n>The author's understanding of literature, and of cultural representation as a whole, is essentially mimetic: i.e. s/he has little or no sense of how literature functions as *literature.* It implies that misrepresentation can simply be \u201ccorrected\u201d by *accurate* representation, although what an accurate representation of the Caucasus would be remains unclear.   \n>  \n>The main point the article makes, which is that Edward Said\u2019s model cannot be applied to Russian literature, given Russia\u2019s historically distinct relationship to the Orient and to itself, has been said before and much more eloquently, by people with a real knowledge of Russian imperial history and of Russian literature. There is a vast scholarly literature on the subject.   \n>  \n>The author does not reference any Russian sources in Russian, does not seem to know Russian, and offers no close readings of the literary texts which are referenced.   \n>  \n>At the end of the article, the author states: \"Western scholarship has tended to pass over Eastern scholarship with indifference, as Said knew only too well.\u201d In fact the author does not display any knowledge of \u201cEastern scholarship\u201d either, except via a reference to Vera Tolz. How \u201cEastern scholarship\u201d would change our understanding of the subject would seem to constitute an important aspect of the conclusion, but we are left none the wiser.   \n>  \n>There also appears to be a page or a section missing (the transition from pp. 12 to 13).",

Why doesn't it involve a single source from Russian?  What is the status of literature here?\n\nThese are legit questions and it is outrageous that they even need to ask them. How can a scholar not address these issues before pursuing print?",

So I can't help but wonder if the reviewer was one of the people I used as an example as someone who unconvincingly applied Said to Russia relationship to the Caucasus. The other reviewer was much more constructive and offered suggestions in the way of scholarship I should review. \n\nBut in answer to your question, i did an immense amount of research and tackled a hard question, and came up short. Yes I failed. Yes I am newer to this than you or my reviewers.... So what? Won't my next attempt be better for it?\n\nI don't really know what my reviewer meant by not referring Russians though... Of course I did. If I had to guess, i think his/her problem was my critique was about secondary sources, and not a direct textual analysis of literature. Eg iwas pointing out the misapplication of Said to the Caucasus in several examples, arguing they were derivative and I'll suited, and pointing out this was ironically exactly what Said criticized in so much Western Scholarship. But I didn't then go back to the texts and offer a different interpretation.",

      "text": "To OP: did you have another establish/trusted scholar in the field read your manuscript before it was sent off for review? The overall tone of this rejection suggests the piece is not well located in the literature/field in question, which is why I ask. If not, you should make it a practice to get as much feedback on your work as possible from other experts in the field *before* submitting. If you have and those experts thought it was ready to do, then there are two conclusions to draw, either 1) this reviewer has gone off on a rampage for some reason, or 2) your experts aren't really as good as you may think. \n\nI've seen reviews like this when graduate students submit work that they think is good but it's not (because they haven't taken the project to conferences or received feedback from more advanced scholars) and when people are being \"mentored\" by scholars who don't really know what they're doing at the level of the specific journal. For example, sometimes international submissions to journals in another country can badly miss the mark in terms of scholarly expectations because the authors simply did not have access to the materials or even the knowledge that is assumed to be common among \"native\" scholars. This is much less likely in STEM fields (which are internationalized) than in the humanities-- for example, if a Chinese academic were to submit a paper to the North Dakota Journal of Literary Studies such a gap might come into play...the reverse is also true.",

The author of the review actually makes a (seemingly very strong) case for why the article does not meet the standard of the discipline.\n\n>I worked really hard to find all the relevant literature on the subject, and if I missed something, and made a fool of myself, fine, call me a fool if that's the kind of person you are.

Additionally, it is not their job to educate people in major areas of the literature. Personally, I would include references for a review if I thought it missed just a few sources, but if it were commenting on a thoroughly discussed area within the discipline and completely missed a section of the literature, it might not seem worth the time.\n\n>reviewing work for a journal shouldn't be an opportunity to try to insult people while rejecting them.\n\nIt's not. There is nothing ad hominem in the review; it focuses on the shortcomings of the article. It really does seem (to completely outside readers) that you are investing the author of the review with a malicious intent that does not really come through in their words by themselves.\n\nI know it is INCREDIBLY hard to read harsh criticism of something you put a lot of yourself into. Unfortunately, that is our profession, and that is how we grow as scholars. It is not the duty of the reviewer to react to the amount of work you put into the article, but to react to the article itself in consideration of the standards of the journal/discipline. It seems they have done so, at least to us neutral readers.",

What are the comments from other reviewers? Are they making similar points?\n\nI get the feeling that maybe you are a grad student or junior researcher (since this is really about handling rejection), but my best advise is just take what is useful here to revise your manuscript and move on (e.g. how would you anticipate these criticisms in a future submission? Can you provide additional analysis/sources to address their concerns? ).\n\nYou'll constantly face rejection in academia, but I think persistent is one of the best indicator of future success. I had a paper that was rejected 7 times by journals, and on the 8th revision and resubmission we got accepted withoit revisions in an excellent journal. The peer review process does work to improve the quality of papers. So stay positive and keep trying :)",

      "text": "It's unfortunate but true that it is quite typical to receive reviews with this sort of tone, as you can probably tell from the responses to this post. The fact is that while academics often get experience teaching and perhaps writing book reviews, many graduate programs do not teach things like how to write manuscript reviews. I think the assumption is that people will glean this information from other experiences, but IMHO this type of work is somewhat unique and underrated in terms of its importance as a contribution to academic inquiry. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that many academics who do reviews are often overextended due to various institutional changes. Helpful reviews take time to write, but there is not strong enough incentive to take this time.\n\nAt any rate, I'm going to rewrite this in the hopes that the issues with the tone become clearer. I'm not in literature, so excuse any discipline-specific errors.\n\n>This article is *not scholarly at all*, despite its ambitions.\n\nThis article would benefit from stronger attention to the form and conventions of academic essays. It may help to review articles published in *Academic Journal Quarterly,* paying attention to form, organization, citation conventions, etc.\n\n>It jumps about a great deal, touching on everything from Greek myth to Russian romanticism to Alexandre Dumas to the American TV \ud83d\udcfa series *The West Wing*.\n\nFor example, the manuscript could use a stronger sense of focus. It jumps from Greek myth to Russian romanticism to Alexandre Dumas to the American TV series *The West Wing*. To many readers this may seem like a random selection of texts. If this is intentional, it would help to explain how these texts come together, and why we should look across genres, spaces, and time periods to understand your argument.\n\n>The author's understanding of literature, and of cultural representation as a whole, is essentially mimetic: i.e. s/he has little or no sense of how literature functions as *literature.* It implies that misrepresentation can simply be \u201ccorrected\u201d by *accurate* representation, although what an accurate representation of the Caucasus would be remains unclear.\n\nThe manuscript should also be more clearly situated within literary studies. For instance, on page 22, the manuscript reads, \"Blah blah blah.\" This statement implies that misrepresentation can simply be \"corrected\" by *accurate* representation\u2014although what an accurate representation of the Caucasus would be remains unclear. At the same time, how does this idea dialogue with Authors A, B, and C, who take up the question of how literature functions as *literature* \u2014 not just as mimetic, but as \\[fill in the blank\\].\n\n>The main point the article makes, which is that Edward Said\u2019s model cannot be applied to Russian literature, given Russia\u2019s historically distinct relationship to the Orient and to itself, has been said before and much more eloquently, by people with a real knowledge of Russian imperial history and of Russian literature. There is a vast scholarly literature on the subject.\n\nIn addition, it is important to take the time to situate this work in relation to the scholarly literature on Russian literature. Authors X, Y, and Z in particular discuss this idea that Said's model cannot be applied to Russian literature given Russia's historically distinct relationship to the Orient and to itself. How does your research build on this work?\n\n>The author does not reference any Russian sources in Russian, does not seem to know Russian, and offers no close readings of the literary texts which are referenced.\n\nIt would also strengthen the article to reference Russian sources in Russian, and to offer a close reading of the literary texts mentioned.\n\n>At the end of the article, the author states: \"Western scholarship has tended to pass over Eastern scholarship with indifference, as Said knew only too well.\u201d In fact the author does not display any knowledge of \u201cEastern scholarship\u201d either, except via a reference to Vera Tolz. How \u201cEastern scholarship\u201d would change our understanding of the subject would seem to constitute an important aspect of the conclusion, but we are left none the wiser.\n\nFinally, the article would benefit from some discussion of Eastern scholarship, moving beyond Vera Tolz. There is potential for this essay to take up the compelling question, \"How would 'Eastern scholarship' change our understanding of the subject?\" To this end, I recommend that the author take up Authors X, Y, and Z's works on subjectivity.\n\n>There also appears to be a page or a section missing (the transition from pp. 12 to 13).\n\nFine as is.",

If I review a paper that is absolutely terrible, I will not devote my time to critique it line by line as I would a paper that's not great, but could be made publishable. I still am not on board with comments about the author's knowledge though. But I recognize disciplines have different conventions (and am thankful the convention in mine is not that).",

You should also have some grasp of the culture they arrive from, which usually involves at least some understanding of the language, even just as a consequence of understanding the culture. Literature is not a translation field, in the sense that, if you're doing work on non-English literature, you are expected to do it in the original language, not to read the Pevear translation and call it a day. Given it's, you know, *literature*, as in the art of writing stuff on paper, the language of the source is inextricably bound with the content of the source (or is the content of the source, depending on what critical family you're coming from).\n\n> \nIt's extremely harsh that they tell you there's plenty of literature on your subject WITHOUT telling you that there is. \n\nNa, not really.

I no longer have faith in their review process. Note that I've had work both accepted and rejected to this venue, so it's not just me being salty about rejects.",

This doesn't mean that they should screen or edit anything, but rather that they contact the reviewer and ask them to rephrase their review in such a way that it's not toxic or unnecessarily rude. \n\nYou're right that OP's feedback isn't especially toxic, but I've seen much much worse in my field.",
