  "text": "I have been working in a research group for 3 months. My supervisor is not from my University. He is conducting the research as he is an Alumni here and wants to give back to the community. I am a second-year undergrad student who joined the team with the aim to get acquainted with [research.  FYI](https://research.FYI) there are no financial benefits here. Recently, he gave us an NDA to sign where he stated the restrictions of sharing data outside the team, announced him a lead researcher, and the rest of us co-researcher. He also mentioned that he has the full authorship and can terminate the project anytime if he feels [necessary.  As](https://necessary.As) I have been working here for 3 months, I have shared a lot of ideas. That doesn't really matter. But my question is, is it necessary to sign such NDA for independent research in undergraduate? Is it an indication that I should probably leave?",

Not necessarily a red flag, but you should definitely ask your supervisor for more information if you feel unsure about this. In theory if you sign an NDA he could terminate the project then publish it all on his own, but unless he\u2019s a real scumbag he wouldn\u2019t do something like that.",

      "text": "It's not typical for student researchers to sign NDAs, but it's not totally unheard of either if the research sponsor requires it or if the subject of the research is something classified or otherwise needing extra protections.  I would expect that in those cases it would be really clearly explained to you exactly why in this case an NDA was required.  And I'm having a hard time imagining a situation where an alumni is somehow allowed to do that kind of classified or highly-sponsor-controlled research at a university with university students without being an employee of the university.\n\nSo - this \\*could\\* \\*maybe\\* be okay but I'm skeptical.  You would be well within your rights to talk to someone - a student ombudsperson, your advisor, a department administrator, someone like that - about your concerns to get some outside perspective on what's going on here.",

      "text": "Is this NDA a [data use agreement (DUA)](https://www.umass.edu/research/guidance/data-use-agreements) for PII and/or classified info? If not, this is problematic; that sounds more like he's recruiting students to do free work expressly with the hopes of commercializing the results. However, there are definitely legitimate (and necessary) for NDA-like documents in academic research groups. They should always be very clear about what exactly is being restricted and what authority is ordering it, like an IRB or federal agency. It would be pretty unusual for an NDA-type document to solely exist at a PI's demand.\n\nPersonally, I don't think it's the best idea for an undergraduate project to work with restricted data, but it's not a red flag. Ideally, you want to be able to share your work in progress frequently and eventually publish to get feedback and improve your research and communication skills, and that's simply more difficult under some DUAs. \n\nBut, this whole situation with the actual supervisor sounds more sketchy. Does he have a current academic affiliation? Does he have a proven track record of good research and mentorship?",
