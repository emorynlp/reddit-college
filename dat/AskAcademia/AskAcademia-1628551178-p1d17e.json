  "text": "Hello! I have a tenure-track assistant professor offer at a state university in the Midwest. It is my only offer. I am a woman of color. My friend (male), who is assistant professor there in the same department, and who does similar research as me, shared with me that he received $350K for 3 years (this was 2017). My initial offer is way below, $150K for 3 years. This is a brand new chair (male) and I am their first hire. I am perplexed as to why the amount is so different, especially when the budget I sent was a padded $500K (in anticipation of having it cut by a couple 100K or so). Advice and suggestions?",

      "text": "R2s can be all over the map, really. So I'm not surprised to hear one offer for $350k at one institution and $150k at another. Mine was in between. It depends a lot on how the institution sees itself. Some R2s (like mine) see themselves as serving the teaching mission first and research is secondary. Others see themselves as R1 aspirants.\n\nI guess I would go back to the negotiation with an eye towards that. Are you comfortable with the balance of teaching and research? If they're offering you relatively little, they know you can't exactly hire a postdoc and a few grad students on it. So what are they expecting for research? Is it a little research? Or is it tons and you're going to be expected to apply for grants 24/7?  \n\n\nEdit: Shoot, just saw they are in *your department.* That's a bit different. Can your friend give you some insight? I got more start up because there hadn't been a new hire approved in a couple years, and the account had been accruing interest, for example. So the hire the following year got less. A 200k swing in the same department is hard to imagine outside a) budget trouble, b) a change to external grant expectations or c) a change to job description.",

I have the exact same job description as my friend (50/50 teaching/research). No one has mentioned any budget problem and in fact they did just get a very large COBRE grant so money is on the way. Also, 50K of my offer was contingent that I get 20K in grants over two years.",

              "text": "Hmmmm, kind of weird. COBRE doesn't necessarily mean money for the department, though, depending on how it's administered. Would you be able to fund grad students on it?\n\n150k you'll blow through on one postdoc and one grad student for a year, basically. Can you do your research with that? It's not like they're expecting you to get much in the way of grants, but depending on your discipline, getting funding without many staff collecting preliminary data for a proposal can be tough.\n\nIt's a negotiation. So think hard about it, see if you can dig up a little more info on why the start-up is so low, and negotiate for what you need. Some people really try to low ball the offer, but expect you to negotiate up. Or there might just not be money for start up now. Those are two drastically different situations, and it would really suck to get on a treadmill of not having enough money, then not being competitive for more  money without staff and data.",

That R2 just didn't want to or couldn't make such a research investment anymore. They are counting on you to take the position absent any other offer as there are likely others in your absence who otherwise would. \n\nGet the best possible person for the least possible amount is often the mantra of such schools.
