Reviewers are anonymous and additionally can be dynamically added and chosen, so such a data base cannot exist.\n\nIf this about a person you would like to exclude, just state that in your cover letter with submission; these requests are typically honored, and many journals even have a space in the submission system to list excluded reviewers.",
