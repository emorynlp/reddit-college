  "title:": "Is using Turnitin or other anti-plagiarism software unethical?",
  "text": "I know software like this is popular, and it fulfills a service that is otherwise incredibly difficult to carry out for an individual instructor a small team of TAs. That said, is it ethical?\n\nThere have been debates about this for a few years. This article from NPR is from 2014 highlights questions about relying on software that can't detect intentional vs. unintentional plagiarism: https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2014/08/25/340112848/turnitin-and-the-high-tech-plagiarism-debate\n\nHowever, what I'm more interested in is the ethics of students' work essentially supporting the database and profits of a private company. Inside Higher Ed discusses this side of things here: https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/06/19/anti-turnitin-manifesto-calls-resistance-some-technology-digital-age\n\nI guess in my mind, I find it -- at the very least -- a little off-putting to submit original student work to companies like this, that then not only have access to the papers but use them for profit. I think there are real questions of privacy and labor, as well as knowledge and consent (do students really understand where their work is going? Are they OK with it and is it possible to opt out?).\n\nI don't know the answers but I'd be interested in people's opinions, especially those who do regularly use services like this.",

It is rarely about the assignment and more often about the attitude of the student towards higher education, which unfortunately is formed before they end up in one of my classes.

In my experience, most professors are either doing the same or only actioning on clear cases.\n\nAnd even then, the first step is always to talk to the student and get their take. I have found in most cases it's not really that the student didn't know copying entire paragraphs from the internet wasn't something they should do (because, come on), but they simply thought they weren't going to get caught. Usually, students who don't know citation style at least make SOME awkward attempt to cite their sources (\"According to Wikipedia...\")\n\nNow the second part, about Turnitin storing and retaining student data - now that I agree feels unethical.",

I begin by laying out my guidelines for the class, but I work with students where necessary, if flexibility is warranted. What I meant by saying they could leave is that they do have some degree of choice in the matter.\n\nFor the record, I also do not add the students\u2019 papers to the repositories. I do this both for practical purposes (I don\u2019t want to check their final drafts against their first drafts) and for ethical reasons. I still believe that the \u201cburden\u201d of being the arbiter of plagiarism remains on my shoulders and I always treat instances of plagiarism as pedagogical opportunities rather than with a draconian punitive approach. The software is a tool for highlighting where/how that misstep is happening, but it is not the only tool.\n\nEdit: we also walked between cities for centuries, but that doesn\u2019t mean I should value walking over taking a car.

It's an issue of scale: it's entirely possible to keep track of what students are doing and to know their voices *if* class sizes are reasonable. If not, I guess you automate it and hope for the best. That's not a solution in my book though.",

Of course, teaching about academic honesty always is central to the class (and I always do it), but when I\u2019m reading 60-80 research papers by students who are addressing topics way outside my field (I teach intro-level writing classes), I can\u2019t run down every book or website they may have copied from.

I teach similar classes (freshman seminars) but they are capped at 20 and it is entirely possible to maintain academic quality with that number of students.  It's not your fault your classes are too big to do so, but rather a failure of the system itself. Replacing faculty oversight with poorly-tuned algorithms isn't a solution.",

The issue is that the university wants to extract more of my labor without recognizing the full effect that each additional section has on my \u201cfree\u201d time. To be fair, from a purely numerical standpoint it doesn\u2019t make sense to factor plagiarism checking into my labor, as it should be rare that I need to follow up on this.\n\nThe way I see it though is that the poorly tuned algorithm doesn\u2019t replace my oversight. I still need to read and judge my students\u2019 work and assess how much is coming from them. The program doesn\u2019t make the determinations for me, it is just one more tool in my toolbox. \n\nI try to use it as a pedagogical tool.

Some students will turn in a paper that was previously turned in for credit at their institution or at another institution. In an interconnected world, students can access each other's work almost frictionlessly. Without a centralized service, it is impossible to know if work is unique.\n\nI also don't buy Inside Higher Ed's argument that the service devalues student work. I'd argue it increases it. Student work should have value only if 1) it shows an instructor that the student learned, 2) if it helps the student learn, or 3) if it gets published. Turnitin contributes to 1 because it makes it at least a little harder to cheat, which hopefully helps with goal 2. And Turnitin doesn't interfere with 3.\n\nI'm much more worried about real invasions of privacy in higher ed. Every freshman at OSU receives an iPad, for example ([https://digitalflagship.osu.edu/students/technology](https://digitalflagship.osu.edu/students/technology)). There's no way every freshman makes a fully conscious decision about how their digital footprints are monitored by Apple, Google, third party apps, and the university while using those \"free\" devices.",

If students are intent on cheating their toolset is a lot richer than it used to be. We are running behind. But teachers always have run behind. There are billions of people on the planet, and a percentage of them will at one point have access to secondary or post-secondary education. Centralized services for managing student work are a totalitarian nightmare. This is not a trade-off I'm willing to make.",
