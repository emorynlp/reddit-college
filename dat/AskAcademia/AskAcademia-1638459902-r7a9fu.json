  "title:": "Paper rejected from journal - next steps",
  "text": "Hello AA community, \n\nI woke up this morning to a rejection letter from a journal I submitted my manuscript to. I submitted this paper about 3-4 months ago, so I was genuinely expecting acceptance with minor or major revisions. I'm in a pretty niche field (between sociology and environmental science) and I felt that the journal in question was the perfect place for my paper. They've actually accepted very similar research papers before, so the rejection was super surprising for me.\n\nNow, this is my first ever submission to a journal - so I wouldn't have been surprised with major revisions. What has surprised me, is that the rejection letter seemed to indicate that they felt the paper wasn't suitable for the journal. The editor said (I'm paraphrasing) \"the reviewers feel this paper is not suitable for publication in \\[this journal\\] and I agree, so we are rejecting the submission at this time\". \n\nThey then gave me the feedback from the reviewers, which I largely agree with, and can see their points\u2014effectively they said the paper needs work and isn't ready for academic publication, although the research does offer a useful contribution to the field. Still, it sounds like the outright rejection was on the basis of the article not being appropriate for the specific journal; which I don't believe to be the case. \n\nMy question is this: Should I write to the editor, thank them for their time, let them know I will be applying the recommended changes, and ask if I can resubmit once these changes have been applied? Or should I accept the rejection, still make the changes, and find another journal to submit to? I don't want to waste anyone's time or annoy the editors/reviewers if it's inappropriate to resubmit to the same journal. What is the etiquette here?\n\nThanks in advance :-)",

In my field, it\u2019s rare to see an argument with an editor working out in your favor. \n\nNow, reading that, it doesn\u2019t read to me that they felt like it wasn\u2019t a fit for the journal itself. It reads like the paper needs some substantial work. That\u2019s fine; that happens all the time to me. Adopt the changes, improve the paper, and find a similarly ranked journal.\n\nIf editors are real good, they may specify alternative outlets they feel are more suitable.",

      "text": "Rejection after review is almost surely because of the reviewers' decision, regardless on whether the topic of your paper suits their journal or not. If it does not suit the journal, it will be rejected without review to begin with (desk rejection).\n\nMost journal usually do not reconsider resubmission. If they do, they will surely mention it in their rejection. I think it's better if you submit to another similar journal. Make sure to include the comments provided by the reviewers before submitting to other journal. There is a chance that you will get the same reviewer (especially if it is a niche field) and they will not like it if you don't consider their comments.\n\nAlso, a word of encouragement, keep in mind that paper rejection is the norm. We just don't see it because there is no public record on paper rejection. You will be surprised at the number of times a paper that you have cited actually got rejected before published.\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Sorry about the rejection. Probably doesn't make you feel better, but it happens to all of us, **a lot.**\n\n>\"the reviewers feel this paper is not suitable for publication in \\[this journal\\] and I agree, so we are rejecting the submission at this time\"\n\nThis is kind of a generic phrase that just means \"I'm rejecting it\". It could be because the perceive the paper to not be in the scope of the journal (though I would expect them to say explicitly elsewhere), or it could be that they think there are fundamental flaws in the logic/results/conclusions.\n\nThere is sometimes some ambiguity with whether a rejection is \"not this version\" or a \"no, never\". Ideally the editor would make it clear if the door was still open \"e.g. I am rejecting this version, but I am willing to consider a revision that addresses the reviewer's comments as a new submission\". It's worth asking a co-author (if you have any) or experienced colleague to read the rejection letter and see what they think. If it's unclear to everyone, then there's no harm in reaching out to the editor to clarify whether they would consider a re-submission.\n\nIt's also possible to appeal a decision, but ideally you should have a good ground for it (e.g. a reviewer got the wrong end of the stick, that you have data on something that was thought to be missing, that you can explain why a concern raised by reviewers isn't a problem etc.). If it reads like the reviewers and the editors have clearly understood everything then you're on shaky ground with an appeal.",

Assuming you stay in academia, you'll have plenty of rejections (and hopefully many accepted papers) in your future.  \n\nRemember that reviewers are not specific to a journal, so even if a journal seems to be a good fit for your manuscript, you may still get rejected if the reviewers just don't like your paper.  It's ok, it happens, and it'll happen plenty of times in the future.  Don't take it personally, just move on and submit to the next journal (if you think the reviewer comments are helpful, you could make some appropriate changes first).",

If you find along the way that you have revised the paper so significantly that it has evolved even more than they suggested in ways that you feel make it more appropriate for the journal, you could contact the editor, explain how it has evolved, and ask if resubmission might make sense. At that time you can point out the similarity between your article and others they have published. Just be careful to avoid appearing to argue the previous decision (which, as I said, is a closed matter).\n\nBut your best bet is going to be to find a different venue for it. Once they have rejected a paper, unless you have a \\*very\\* strong argument for why they should reconsider--and following the reviewers recommendations is not nearly enough--most editors will not do so.\n\nJust be aware that rejections is the norm and it often takes several submissions before an article is accepted, especially with one is getting started.
