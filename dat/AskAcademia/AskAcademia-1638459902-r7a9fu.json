  "title:": "Paper rejected from journal - next steps",
  "text": "Hello AA community, \n\nI woke up this morning to a rejection letter from a journal I submitted my manuscript to. I submitted this paper about 3-4 months ago, so I was genuinely expecting acceptance with minor or major revisions. I'm in a pretty niche field (between sociology and environmental science) and I felt that the journal in question was the perfect place for my paper. They've actually accepted very similar research papers before, so the rejection was super surprising for me.\n\nNow, this is my first ever submission to a journal - so I wouldn't have been surprised with major revisions. What has surprised me, is that the rejection letter seemed to indicate that they felt the paper wasn't suitable for the journal. The editor said (I'm paraphrasing) \"the reviewers feel this paper is not suitable for publication in \\[this journal\\] and I agree, so we are rejecting the submission at this time\". \n\nThey then gave me the feedback from the reviewers, which I largely agree with, and can see their points\u2014effectively they said the paper needs work and isn't ready for academic publication, although the research does offer a useful contribution to the field. Still, it sounds like the outright rejection was on the basis of the article not being appropriate for the specific journal; which I don't believe to be the case. \n\nMy question is this: Should I write to the editor, thank them for their time, let them know I will be applying the recommended changes, and ask if I can resubmit once these changes have been applied? Or should I accept the rejection, still make the changes, and find another journal to submit to? I don't want to waste anyone's time or annoy the editors/reviewers if it's inappropriate to resubmit to the same journal. What is the etiquette here?\n\nThanks in advance :-)",

In my field, it\u2019s rare to see an argument with an editor working out in your favor. \n\nNow, reading that, it doesn\u2019t read to me that they felt like it wasn\u2019t a fit for the journal itself. It reads like the paper needs some substantial work. That\u2019s fine; that happens all the time to me. Adopt the changes, improve the paper, and find a similarly ranked journal.\n\nIf editors are real good, they may specify alternative outlets they feel are more suitable.",

      "text": "Rejection after review is almost surely because of the reviewers' decision, regardless on whether the topic of your paper suits their journal or not. If it does not suit the journal, it will be rejected without review to begin with (desk rejection).\n\nMost journal usually do not reconsider resubmission. If they do, they will surely mention it in their rejection. I think it's better if you submit to another similar journal. Make sure to include the comments provided by the reviewers before submitting to other journal. There is a chance that you will get the same reviewer (especially if it is a niche field) and they will not like it if you don't consider their comments.\n\nAlso, a word of encouragement, keep in mind that paper rejection is the norm. We just don't see it because there is no public record on paper rejection. You will be surprised at the number of times a paper that you have cited actually got rejected before published.\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Sorry about the rejection. Probably doesn't make you feel better, but it happens to all of us, **a lot.**\n\n>\"the reviewers feel this paper is not suitable for publication in \\[this journal\\] and I agree, so we are rejecting the submission at this time\"\n\nThis is kind of a generic phrase that just means \"I'm rejecting it\". It could be because the perceive the paper to not be in the scope of the journal (though I would expect them to say explicitly elsewhere), or it could be that they think there are fundamental flaws in the logic/results/conclusions.\n\nThere is sometimes some ambiguity with whether a rejection is \"not this version\" or a \"no, never\". Ideally the editor would make it clear if the door was still open \"e.g. I am rejecting this version, but I am willing to consider a revision that addresses the reviewer's comments as a new submission\". It's worth asking a co-author (if you have any) or experienced colleague to read the rejection letter and see what they think. If it's unclear to everyone, then there's no harm in reaching out to the editor to clarify whether they would consider a re-submission.\n\nIt's also possible to appeal a decision, but ideally you should have a good ground for it (e.g. a reviewer got the wrong end of the stick, that you have data on something that was thought to be missing, that you can explain why a concern raised by reviewers isn't a problem etc.). If it reads like the reviewers and the editors have clearly understood everything then you're on shaky ground with an appeal.",

The advice on this thread generally seems to be to move on to another journal, but I\u2019m hoping a quick, polite and professional email to thank the editor and ask for clarification on whether they would consider a revised resubmission would be appropriate. \n\nI don\u2019t plan to appeal, I see the value in the reviewers comments; but I do hope to gain clarification on next steps\u2014perhaps via the editor :-)",

At that time you can point out the similarity between your article and others they have published. Just be careful to avoid appearing to argue the previous decision (which, as I said, is a closed matter).\n\nBut your best bet is going to be to find a different venue for it. Once they have rejected a paper, unless you have a \\*very\\* strong argument for why they should reconsider--and following the reviewers recommendations is not nearly enough--most editors will not do so.\n\nJust be aware that rejections is the norm and it often takes several submissions before an article is accepted, especially with one is getting started.

      "text": "Plenty of great advise already here. Rejections sucks, regardless of their frequency, but they almost always bring a new perspective and insight that will improve your work(I wish I could say always, but sometimes reviewer's feedback is not up to professional standards).\n\nStep away for a week or so from this paper and related work. Comeback re-energized and with a clearer mind to go over each of the comments with your supervisor and co-authors and critically think how they can improve your manuscript. Apply that to your research and take special account into threading a story within the paper (this can be easily forgotten when focusing too much on the comments). Continue refining it, get feedback from colleagues and your supervisors, and find a new place for it once ready.",

      "text": "While it is common practice by editors to reject, based only on reviewers' reports and not allow authors to reply, I am very much against it. Reviewers/editors are not gold standards, they could be wrong, even in very elementary manners. However, since most of authors are used to this, they probably take this as granted, without thinking whether this is a right thing for editors to do. (Here is an example to show how strange this is. Say, person A violated some laws. Even so, person A still has the right to give a say, not forced to take whatever the judge says. Authors don't even have that minimal civil right. )\n\nBy the way, the OP and commenters here may like to take a bit time to give inputs in this related topic:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/r3mpor/what\\_is\\_the\\_common\\_practice\\_of\\_reviewing\\_in\\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/r3mpor/what_is_the_common_practice_of_reviewing_in_your/)",

      "text": "Lots of great advice here from people who seem to be much more experienced with paper submission/acceptance/rejection, so thank you all for your insights! I unfortunately received this rejection on my birthday (today) so I think it stung a bit more than it may have usually. That said, I feel very validated and encouraged seeing that this is a common experience, even for people much more experienced than I. Just to be clear though, I was never planning on fighting the outcome; I understand and agree with the necessary changes but didn\u2019t know if the rejection was a \u201cmake these changes and we\u2019ll reconsider\u201d thing, or a \u201crejected, move on\u201d thing. Sounds like it\u2019s the latter, so I\u2019ll take a breather, apply the feedback, and search for another suitable journal. \n\nThanks again for the great advice, encouragement, and support! Academic Reddit is the best :-)",

Try another place.  Even fixing stuff highlighted may not bring it to within standard.  In theory, there is nothing to stop you asking the Editor if you can revise after correcting, but practically you are wasting your and their time, as the answer will almost certainly be \"no\".  Absolutely do NOT resubmit without having run it past the Editor.\n\nDo fix as much as you can before submitting elsewhere, and do not take the rejection personally.",

Some journals encourage resubmission after a transformation of the manuscript. Some would say their decision is final. However, there are many journals out there who are open for your work. The fact that the editor did not reject it outright is a very very good sign. \n\nBut the really valuable thing is the reviewers' comments. Take it and make the edits and submit it to another place. You'd be pleasantly surprised!\n\nBest of luck to you!",
