  "title:": "How do I get my thesis published?",
  "text": "I recently finished a Master in humanities research at the University of Amsterdam. Like many of you, most of my classes were held online and so I wouldn't say I was able to foster friendships with any of my professors. However, my final thesis received a good mark, with my supervisor and second reader both saying that it is of high enough quality to be published. I've never had anything published before so I don't even know where to start. What would be the most logical route for me at this point?",

      "text": "The first thing you should do is to look for where do you want to publish. I recommend you to look for the Journal Citation Report (JCR, your uni should have a way for you to get access to it), and there look for journals on your field with a high Journal Impact Factor (JIF). You usually wanna publish in journals that are in the first quartile (Q1), but also make sure that what your article matches the topics that the journal is about. When you've found the journal you want to publish in, go to their website and look for the submission procedure, follow those steps and cross your fingers.\n\nThis is just a general procedure for publishing, however, if your supervisor told you that it was a work good enough to publish, they can probably guide you on the process.\n\nGood luck!",

                      "text": "This is super genre- and methods-specific. I don't know what discipline or what kind of text it is, so I can't say for sure. Some topics need a 300-page book to make sense. An article in Science about some atom can be compressed into an extremely dense format. The two projects may still represent the same body of research.\n\nMaybe you could pick the best parts and make it into a journal article. In the humanities, some outlets allow for way longer texts than the typical 6k format common in e.g. the social sciences. (20k is not unheard of...) You could look around in different journals in your field and see what lengths they allow for. \n\nAnother alternative could be to publish it as a chapter in an edited book. To do so, you definitely need connections, and for this, you need the help of your supervisor or someone similar. (There is no way for you to find out if someone is planning to put something like that together.)\n\nIn sum, this is what you should do imo: \"Hi Dr supervisor! I would like to see if I can get parts of the thesis published somehow. Do you have any suggestions on how I could go about to do that?\"",
