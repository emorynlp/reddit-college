  "title:": "Co-supervisor in PhD, how does it work?",
  "text": "I am recently offered a PhD position in a good uni (Australia). There will be 2 supervisors, a Professor and a Dr. Will I be supervised mainly by the Dr? As I aware, he hasnt had much experience supervising students. I will be his 3rd PhD student and the other 2 phd students havent finished their thesis yet. However he is nice, he even suggested me to work as an Research Assistant in their lab to get to know the environment before I decide.\n\nThe Professor is a beast in his field, received many grants and supervised many students before. \n\nThe Dr is a nice person, I talked to him and really enjoyed his working style. However, he hasnt supervised anyone before. So I will be his first PhD student. His publication profile is only around 28 publications with some in the prestige journal of my field (minerals and chemistry). \n\nWhat do you think?",

      "text": "Having two supervisors is very normal in many countries, it is even mandatory at many universities ( for example where I work in the Netherlands). This is done primarily to protect your interests, so that your entire PhD and academic career do not depend on one person, who at some point might turn into a tyrant. Also full professors have less time to devote to PhD students, so with two supervisors you get more support and guidance. The more junior supervisor is commonly someone you can consult daily, while the more senior one is someone who comes at more crucial moments which shape your project. But this of course depends on the people themselves and how much interest they have in your project. \n\nPS. 28 publications is not something to be taken lightly, especially if your co-supervisor is only few years out of a PhD himself. So I would suggest not to underestimate someone just because you have some idea of what a good number of publication is, when likely at this stage you have 0. And the co-supervisor has already experience in supervising, as you mentioned that he has two other PhD students, so you will not be the first. But even if you are, that does not mean too much as they could still graduate lots of people while being terrible supervisors. The only thing that matters is that the people are nice and that you think you can have a good working relationship with. In my experience that is far more important than anything else.",

And that is something I really appreciate. He is 6 years out of his PhD but only focused on research in the past 4 years so his academic skill should be good.\n\nHowever, I was an RA before and I saw some supervisors, although being nice, lack a good working style to support their PhD student, e.g in direction of research.\n\nAnother question would be, how do I know if their working style suits me if I never work with them before?",

That should give you some impression. Although, you must accept that there is always an element of risk when taking a new position. I also do not think it\u2019s tragic if they have slightly different working styles than yours as you will have to work with many different people down the line, and you would need to have some flexibility. I would look for warning signs of verbal abuse, micromanagement, neglect and god-like behavior, and run if you hear anything like that. It is unfortunately not uncommon in academia and could really make your PhD years truly miserable.",

Personally, I never seen full professors having less time for their students \u2013 except for the head of faculty types \u2013 but even then, they're often okay with their students coming up. In fact, most of the researchers with a proactive supervisor were full professors (the type that asks you where you want to go after PhD, reaches out themselves and connects you). Australian universities (even the top ones) tend to not have the hard ass slave driver mentality that you'll find it North America, Asia, and parts of Europe (e.g. Oxford, Cambridge, ETHZ), and I've found there's a lot of tolerance for your own preferences.

      "text": "This depends a lot on you and the two advisors: there's no one way that this works. I had a similar setup in graduate school: two advisors, one who was less experienced but whose research interests were very close to mine, and another who was a titan in the field but whose methods were a little further afield from mine. Wonderfully for me, the experienced professor had been the newer professor's informal advisor when *he* was in grad school and they knew each other well.\n\nOne was my official advisor; the other was the official chair of my committee (your chair had to be tenured). I met with each of them regularly, just different cadences; I went to both lab meetings and worked on papers with each, sometimes together. Both reviewed my chapters. Both were able to help me with very different things.\n\nI really liked having two PIs (I also had two postdoc advisors - I'm an interdisciplinary researcher so it's sort of a thing for me). Having them at different stages in their careers was useful for different things: for example, my senior PI knew everyone in the field and helped me network and meet people, while my more junior PI was a little closer to the experience of the job market and was better able to advise me on that. I was also my more junior PI's first PhD student and I didn't mind it, but you do have to be a little more proactive and independent (and that's where having a senior PI can help too).",

      "text": "I\u2019m doing my PhD in an Australian university and the policy in my school is that you have to have two supervisors, and sometimes three is acceptable as well.\n\nSimilar to your situation, one of my supervisors is a full professor with a long and decorated academic history and the other is a fantastic and promising lecturer (assistant professor ranking in the US). I think you\u2019d have to discuss what the expectations are regarding communication and guidance with your supervisors, and what the format will be. Each of my meetings are with both supervisors and they are very collaborative but I know this is not always how things are done so I\u2019d recommend you check with them. \n\nIt\u2019s been mentioned already but 28 publications is pretty good (depending on their quality and the journal rankings) and your younger supervisor may be more hungry, which is good for you!",

      "text": "This is normal. It's so that if one supervisor leaves the university, or cannot fulfil the role, the other can step in. I have 1 supervisor, 2 co-sups. I have friends who have up to 6 supervisors (esp when the funding is coming from a mix of unis and museums). \n\nI am the first PhD student my primary supervisor has ever had and I love it (I'm in the UK btw). She's super enthusiastic and didn't complete her PhD so long ago (2014 or smth) that she is completely unrealistic about the job market. I know others with older Prof sups who struggle to dedicate time to academia, never mind an entire whole PhD student.",

Like you, one is an established superstar, the other an ambitious up-and-comer. More importantly, they \\*like\\* each other. It's working MUCH, MUCH better than a few years ago. :)",

I was his first PhD student (the co-supervisor). Each had their strengths and weaknesses. The co-supervisor was more hands on and often really helpful. The primary supervisor had great \"big picture\" advice and guidance to give, but could offer little help with the daily grind type of problems you run into. I was in Physics BTW. Overall, I thought it was a great combination.",

The other two (Psych and Snr Lecturer) provide subject matter expertise and more importantly a different view on a number of subjects. \n\nThis has proven so valuable for me as I have grown as an apprentice academic! The three academic are all brilliant professionally but also get along and work together on other projects. This chemistry has made me feel so blessed as I can\u2019t complain at all about my supervisory panel.\n\nHappy to answer any specific questions you may have over DM",
