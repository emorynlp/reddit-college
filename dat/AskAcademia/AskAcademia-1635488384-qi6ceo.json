      "text": "You should not do a PhD with the expectation that it will lead to a paid TT academic position. Statistically it won't. There are more PhDs graduating each year wanting to get such a position than there are positions, by an order of magnitude or more.\n\nI'm not a psychologist and not in the US (which I assume you are since you didn't specify? be aware this answer is very different in different countries), but I would suggest to apply for PhD programmes and masters programmes, and if you don't get on the PhD do a masters first to become a more competitive.",

      "text": "Psychologist here... If you're in the US, do not get your masters first. It is typically part of the PhD program for you to complete your masters on the way. If you do go get your masters first, expect to only save about 1 year on completing your PhD. So you will still have 4-5 years instead of 5-6 years. The years don't transfer exactly and you will lose some of that time you spent in the masters program. Definitely not worth it in the US.\n\nThe one time you should consider it, is if you have poor grades from undergrad and no research experience. If that is the case, you many need to demonstrate that you can handle the classes in grad school.\n\nMy personal experience/opinion is that getting research experience as a coordinator would be more beneficial than a masters.",
