  "text": "Obviously the last year has been weird for graduate students. Despite the darkness I\u2019ve had the good fortune to receive funding that has liberated me from the need to TA for the remainder of my degree. But it\u2019s opened up some new questions.\n\nI\u2019m in the social sciences, so I don\u2019t have any physical lab equipment I need access to. I\u2019m done classes as well, so I\u2019m seriously considering whether to just go somewhere sunny to crank out the writing and analysis for the next few years. It seems pretty common for people to leave for relationship based reasons and finish remotely. Then again, there\u2019s a community of scholars I would like to engage with at my university, but I also find that faculty are not that interested in building relationships with grad students if they\u2019re not on your committee or you\u2019re not doing research for them. \n\nI\u2019m wondering, especially among people with social science backgrounds, how critical was sustained campus engagement for you? Is networking better done on campus than at conferences? Is sticking around with your cohort important for your professional development? \n\nMany thanks!",

      "text": "I have a PhD in psychology (social/personality) and I found that people tended to take notice of who was on campus and who was not. I was able to get involved on a few projects largely because I was around. Then, as people learned I was reliable, I was able to get involved in a lot more collaborations. Some people couldn\u2019t care less if students are around or not, but for those that do care about it, showing up can do a lot for their perception of you. \n\nAs much as networking at conferences was invaluable, I think the networking within my department gave me a good jumping off point for when I networked elsewhere. Academic communities are small and people talk to each other more than you might think. Sometimes impressing a professor in an adjacent field can mean that people at conferences have already heard good things about you.\n\nI also found that being around was helpful whenever I needed another perspective or some help on my work. Sometimes I would explain my reasoning to other grad students just to have them poke holes in it. Overall, I think those perspectives made my thesis stronger and helped prepare me for my defense.",

But a physical presence means that senior people know who you are, colleagues can interact with you naturally in meetings without you being a giant, floating shouting head, and it provides opportunities for informal networking. These are the small things that give you an edge and will in aggregate open doors career-wise.",

      "text": "Once the world goes back to normal, there will be a class of networking you won't be able to do if you're constantly away from campus. Interfacing with visiting faculty, with other members of your cohort and in your program, developing secondary contacts through them, etc. Depending on how important that is for you, it can make a difference. A lot of my networking happens through fellow grads or faculty introducing me to people.\n\nAdditionally, as a historian, I'm not sure I could be anywhere where I don't have reliable access to a trove of books. Meaning I can't work without a library. My University's library doesn't just allow me access to their own books, but is also the institution I'd work with to procure books and items such as microfilm records that my own doesn't possess through systems such as Interlibrary loans. Without access to that, I'm not convinced I'd be nearly as competent as a writer. So for me, being close to the library is absolutely critical to my work. Now the thing about history is that a lot of stuff isn't digitized. Old microfilm records for instance. If you can manage with digital sources entirely for your work, then this isn't such a consideration for you.",

My \"home\" library didn't own 90% of what I needed to research my dissertation but they didn't bat an eye when I'd submit 50-100 interlibrary loan requests in a week.\n\nWhen I left town ABD it was to take faculty position at a small college. The library was worthless for research, but it also had robust ILL services and I quickly became one of the top five users in terms of volume (I know because I was part of a focus group on improving ILL service my second year). That was in the late 1990s, before digital delivery made ILL faster, cheaper, and more convenient, so it's probably even easier now. But I can't imagine trying to write a dissertation in the humanities or social sciences without access to an academic library.",

Now things will show up in 2-3 days instead of taking weeks. My projects with film (I still use microfilm sometimes actually) usually involved working with massive collections of stuff that has never been digitized. For example, in the early 2000s I got a big mess of USAF records on MF, probably 25 reels and thousands of pages, that had to be read through page by page. The stuff had never been scanned, in fact I had to go through a classification review process because nobody had ever even requested it from the archive before. The last time I went back to that collection (more recently) it was still on film. So now the challenge is finding a MF reader/scanner!",

Once classes were done (three years in my program) the only reason to stay in town was to gain TA experience. My cohort was large and the average time to degree was close to ten years...very few people stayed in town more than five unless they had a partner who was working there or tied to a lab or something. When I left in year five (I finished in eight) we were among the first from my cohort to leave, but almost nobody was left in town when I went back to defend three years later.",

Add to this how much I need my personal support network in this city, which was built half out of talking to people in my department after classes, and how much easier it is to collaborate with other disciplines while on the same campus as them, I'd say frankly going remote has been an unmitigated disaster for the progression of my degree and by extension career. Hell, I'm no longer sure I want to or can go into research at this point.\n\nAll this said, the fact that it's functional at all tells us all we need to know about accommodations for students who *can't* or *shouldn't* be on-campus normally. While I'll never recommend someone in my exact circumstance be off-campus, it's very clear that completing a graduate degree remotely is possible, and we need to pressure admin to allow it for students who think it's their best option no questions asked (if your admin doesn't already). Likewise, if it's an option for you, and you think it's best for you, I won't tell you not to.",

      "text": "I'm a pretty introverted person, and realized early on my thing was not going out and hitting up the bars with my cohort, but I am glad I had the ability to actually participate in those things when I was new in town and trying to figure things out. However, I had a lot of personal stuff come up during my time in grad school, and sort of became one of those \"ghost\" advanced grad students. Nonetheless, I have friends in my department, and well as friends who aren't grad students (the latter is really important IMO). \n\nThe willingness of faculty to build relationships with their grad students varies significantly by department. In my department, faculty are generally happy to help advise any student who comes to them with a question, even if that student isn't helping them out with a project or isn't planning on having that faculty member on their dissertation committee. \n\nJust a question/comment: did you get the NSF GRFP? Because I did, and then when I used up my three years of funding, I was able to get funded as an RA this academic year, and then somehow will be funded for next year while I'm doing my diss research. BUT!!!! I recently found out the hard way (my advisor being straightforward with me, though I appreciate the straightforwardness) that teaching experience as a grad student is very important on the job market. So unless you are truly funded indefinitely (rather than the 3 years you get on the NSF), consider trying to teach further down the line.",

              "text": "I think it depends on your career ambitions. I was chair of a dept of social sciences at a 5000 student state baccalaureate college in GA, 30 miles from a major metro area (not Atlanta). I wouldn't hire anybody who didn't have positive teaching experiences with good student evaluations and positive letters that addressed teaching qualifications. We're a teaching institution so while research is appreciated, teaching is critical. I hired 1 political scientist and 1 sociologist in my 5 years as chair. We got about 35 applications for each position and immediately half just weren't qualified because they had no teaching experience, at all. They only made it past the first cut of, \"Doesn't have an appropriate degree.\" but got no further.\n\nIf you want to teach at a teaching college and/or you want that as a backup, please do gain teaching experience, either at your home institution or apply to be an adjunct at a CC that's hopefully nearby.\n\nIf you are going to an R1, I'd imagine that teaching qualifications are of lesser concern than are research productivity. But, somebody from an R1 might chime in concerning this issue.",

I have a pretty solid CV research-wise for a grad student, and I WAS told to spend my fellowship time on research, so the teaching thing was a rude awakening",

For example they may say \"Oh yeah the woman who always has xyz with her! Yes she's always here!\" And THAT gets you points\n-unplaned conversations lead to collaboration/ discussions and friendlier relationships are the key in academia and to projects\n-the administrative employees get to know you and they are the modern \"king counsel\" and can make your time there much easier since they have all the tricks to navigate your uni : they can be friendly and usefull contacts\n\nOverall don't need to be there all the time but regularly there 2-3 times a week and say hello to people. You can also eat in the common room instead of your office and you'll get to know more people. Showing up to the events held in the department is important too.",

Even if I could have done all my work remotely, I would have wished for networking, communication, etc. Near our school was a lot of businesses that gave discounts to students and hired us for jobs/internships, which I would not have been able to attend from afar. So for me, very important. If you are doing grad school while you already have a job lined up, or you already know a lot of people in the field from previous years or something, and don't feel like you need the networking then yeah there is no reason to live near your college campus. So I'd say it would HEAVILY depend on your field, plans for after, etc.",

I served on many search committees as a faculty member and I hired a number of people in our social sciences department as chair and I found in interviews that people who had been remote from their campus thought differently about their academic area. I found those who had been on campus for 5-6 years had a more comprehensive view of their academic area. I found that appealing; of course, that's how I spent my graduate years and so I likely had a bias toward that type of perspective.",

My partner left their campus to be with me in their third year. \n\nIt is not incredibly clear there are a ton of advantages to staying on campus as you write up your dissertation - once you've been on campus for a few years and met everyone. In fact, being off-campus has been amazing for me and my career. I am now in a city I love, where my family is, and I'm connecting with local academics. One of them will probably be my post-doc advisor (seems things are going that way!). I am putting academic roots in the place I want to stay, NOT the place I did my PhD. I still chat with my advisor, but I'm pretty independent research-wise. My collaborators have already said they are happy to write letters for me, so not being on campus is not a problem at all.\n\nI'm frankly surprised so many people are leaning so much on informal conversations to improve their research? Maybe my department is special, but we have tons of student and student-faculty seminars where we can present on Zoom and get informal feedback on our work. Even once that's done, I feel so comfortable emailing faculty to ask a quick research question. Again, maybe the faculty here are just really nice? I don't know, it really hasn't been a problem for me.",

Doesn't the textbooks say it? burial field if you are not tuned to it.\n\nAnyways, all very relative but I went to good universities(domestically and globally). Felt those institutions were far overestimated and I was full-on milked compared to the teaching quality and service.\n\nThough, do not regret it because of the people; not the lecturers but the course mates I've met. Was stupid as fuck there as I scraped through doors but was not that hard getting an upper second. Shed some tears but much easier than other stuff. Not Oxbridge but even ours and even one-third of the Oxbridge students are naive as fuck. Despite their sharpness, the ones lower than an upper second, I see as pretty lazy or their orientations are situated somewhere else... that's really good to students who are less bright but super invested (like myself).\n\nSo, if you are able to be excepted into whatever uni, you making an effort is precious to the uni (professors and staff) and to the upper distinction students that really care and matter in terms of academic achievements. That's is a golden pass tbh. If you are the smartest one, then it's your chance to shine (suck prof's bum). Plus, showing effort is important and inevitable if you think of the tuition and compare it to more immediate stuff you can benefit from that sort of time and money.",
