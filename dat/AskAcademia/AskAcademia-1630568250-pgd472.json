      "text": "The exact date? The scheduling can vary, but generally a date would not be set until the thesis has gone to the external examiner. The date would be set according to the availability of everyone involved (examining committee, candidate), so I would say from as little as a few weeks to a couple of months. A rough date could be known further in advance, since you try to time things to meet a target date (the specifics will very much vary according to the country and institution you are in). For example, there could be a nominal time that the external examiner has the thesis for evaluation, and everything is planned around that with buffer time for administrative steps.",
