  "title:": "[SERIOUS] Is it possible to achieve a Masters in Biomedical Engineering with a Bachelors in Neuroscience?",
  "text": "I'm a senior with a Neuroscience major and am looking into a career in Neural engineering. As i'm aware, theres a-lot that can be done in this field (prosthetics, artificial organs, etc.) and I'm really interested these topics and what's been done in recent developments of it.\n\nThat being said, I've been looking into it and it seems a Biomedical Engineering masters would be an amazing lead way into the field. However , I was wondering if i can get into a respective university for a BMEN masters degree with a Neuroscience bachelors?",

      "text": "I don't know about neuroscience, but when I was the advisor to biomedical engineering students at a small U.S. university, the main issue students had when transferring into engineering from adjacent fields was the math & physics core.\n\nSpecifically: the entire calculus sequence (typically 12 credit hours or so here), diff EQ, linear algebra (probably), and calculus-based physics (AKA \"physics for engineers\" or similar, usually about 8-10 credit hours over two courses) including in-person labs.\n\nFor a graduate degree, you'd likely have even more specific course requirements to knock out before jumping into the main engineering course sequences that would define the degree.\n\nEDIT: You should also ask the school at which you're considering a grad degree about ABET accreditation. If your bachelor's degree is from a non-ABET accredited school/program, you may have additional complications, since engineering-relevant courses that you took in undergrad may not qualify as their usual equivalents at the new school (if the latter is accredited by ABET).",

Do you think this could be something to where, if i take a year off, i could knock those out and potentially apply for August 2023?",

              "text": "Possibly, yes. But first I would speak with a graduate advisor (probably a faculty member) at the prospective school and get an official answer on exactly what courses they want you to take prior to applying for their graduate program. Depending on your exact circumstances, you might find that some schools are willing to work with you on the course requirements.",

      "text": "It can be possible depending on what classes you've taken. Look at admissions for schools and they should say what is required. I'd highly suggest taking a programming class your senior year if you haven't already. Are you looking for course based on thesis based? My opinion is course based is a waste of time, but you will be more likely to be accepted because they are a huge income generator for a school. Issue with thesis based will be do you have the skills needed to get you into a lab. The overlap between skills as a neuroscience student and skills of a BME student vary depending on interests and of course what previous lab experience you got.",
