  "title:": "How do I approach my conservative scholarship program about making our content more inclusive?",
  "text": "Please let me know if this isn't the right place for this question! I'm new to Reddit.\n\nI'm in an undergraduate mentored scholarship program (I'm a rising sophomore). This was my dream program, and I feel lucky to be part of it. However, this program has a reputation on campus and in the community for being extremely conservative, which I am not. I was assured when I was offered the scholarship that it was a non-partisan group without bias and that I would be welcome.\n\nWhile I have enjoyed my time in the program, I have a few issues. We read books and hold upwards of 50 unique private and public lectures and seminars throughout the year. Every book we've read has been by a white man, and all of our guest speakers have been white (though we had several women speak this past semester for the anniversary of the 19th amendment). \n\nI have brought up my issues with the lack of diversity before, but I don't think I'm being taken seriously since I'm new to the program, and I'm one of the few outspoken liberals. Once when I did mention diversity during a philosophy seminar, I was told that there just aren't many female philosophers, and the ones who did exist don't have many, if any, surviving texts, so we couldn't study them. Obviously that wasn't the response I was hoping for, and I didn't feel comfortable bringing up the problem again.\n\nAdditionally, several of my fellow scholars seem to think I'm overreacting or that the program is trying to bring in diverse speakers, but they won't come because of our reputation (though there's been no evidence that this is the case).  I know some of my friends feel the same as I do, but they don't want to rock the boat or make any of the staff upset by criticizing the programming.\n\nThis mostly flared up because our summer reading list was just announced, and it is once again all white male authors. \n\nAm I overreacting? Is there a certain way I can approach this without seeming too confrontational or disrespectful? I know a lot of work goes into making our schedules and choosing books to read, but I want to work with the program to make it better for future students. I'm just nervous, and I feel a bit lonely since no one seems as bothered by the issue as I am.\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "This is obviously a huge problem, and it's really courageous of you to take it on. I suspect that there's some long-standing problems here\u2014beginning with a commitment to \"classic\" humanistic study that largely depends on a critical tradition established by white male scholars in the twentieth century. In addition, it's clear that you're being gaslighted\u2014the notion that there are not female philosophers (in both continental and analytic traditions) is patently false and disprovable with a quick google search. So, dismantling what is clearly a deeply entrenched ideology in the very curriculum of a university program is something that will probably require one of a few major things: a) curricular change approved at the dept/program level b) a change in the director that you mentioned picks most of the reading or c) a demand from a large proportion of the students that the readings be revised.\n\nSome of these are institutional and are completely out of your control. Nonetheless, I think there's some things that you can do. While the reading group idea is obviously a bit patronizing, there's something to it, at least to the extent that you'd be bringing together some like-minded individuals to study, say, Wollstonecraft, Fuller, Douglass, Du Bois, etc. There's reading lists available online for this kind of curriculum, or you can reach out here if you need help (I'd personally be happy to assist). Once this gets some traction, you'll have allies in the truly venerable goal that you've set. One other idea with which you might be able to approach the institution is the following: think about suggesting the democratization of the program. Ask that students (or a student rep) be involved in the process of selecting texts or inviting speakers, or that you all vote on a particular text/speaker to be added to the curriculum. Even if only a couple texts or speakers each yr are student chosen, you can perhaps start to chip away at these arcane practices. Best of luck!",

The scholar-elected Chair of the program typically is the liaison between staff and students, so I've been discussing different options with her about giving students more input for the curriculum. In any event, I'll likely start my own small reading circle. If you have any particular lists or recommendations to get me started, I'd be grateful!",

              "text": "Of course! What kind of stuff are you interested in? Or, does the program have a particular theme? Another way to approach this would be to think about dialogue\u2014so, which readings have you done, and which ones might complement them (e.g. Ralph Waldo Emerson's essays alongside W.E.B. Du Bois\u2014Du Bois partially gets the idea of \"double consciousness\" from Emerson). Some places to start with primary works might be Phillis Wheatley's poetry, Frederick Douglass's *Narrative*, Harriet Jacobs's *Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl*, Kate Chopin's *The Awakening*, Leslie Marmon Silko's *Ceremony*, virtually anything by Virginia Woolf, although \"A Room of One's Own\" is a classic. These are more typically literary works. If you're interested in philosophy, some texts might include Mary Wollstonecraft's *Vindication of the Rights of Women*, Margaret Fuller's writings, W.E.B. Dubois's *The Souls of Black Folk.* But these are just starting points! Feel free to send me a message if you have some specific themes/topics you're interested in and I can point you in the right direction.\n\nI'd also recommend getting in touch with a grad student in English, American Studies, or History - they might be able to point you in a more specific direction, and might even offer to help out (though don't be offended if they politely refuse\u2014grad students are severely overworked and underpaid).",

That's true if they're writing about race (*The Souls of Black Folk* wouldn't be the same if not written by W.E.B. DuBois) or not (*The Wretched of the Earth* is greatly influenced by Fanon's positionality).\n\nBesides, there are different philosophical traditions too, outside of just the U.S. and North America.

Whether that's smart or not is up for discussion but I bet that's what they object to. \n\nYou might be more successful if you specifically look for philosophers who have really good ideas, but seem to get overlooked because they don't fit the mold of what a philosopher \"should\" look like. Then make your argument based on their ideas, not their gender or ethnicity. \n\nI also think that it's probably *true* that there there aren't many historical female philosophers with surviving texts. I wouldn't interpret this as someone saying that women can't be philosophers, though. They are probably just as aware as you are that institutional barriers made it nearly impossible for women to work or publish in the field. Not much can be done about that now, so you may want to look for your non-white-males among more modern scholars. \n\nDo you find that the men and women in your program are treated equally? No doubt philosophy is historically male-dominated, but if the program does a good job of encouraging its female students, I consider that a good sign.",

          "text": "I mostly agree with this. While not being \"allergic\" to the notion, I would encourage works to be promoted on the ideas they present against a cultural backdrop researched deeper than skin colour, gender, or sexuality of the individual author. There are many authors weighty enough that the mention of metacontext to their works presents as a lack of research I to their merits. The perception is often: If the works are worthy of merit, why not discuss the works, rather than who wrote them. \n\nConservatives, while frequently framed as favouring white male authorship and chafe a bit at the idea that this is properly presents our ideals: we don't value white male works because of intrinsic white maleness, but rather the merits of their works, so approaching the discussion in this way seems  ill advised. \n\nAs I've posed above, the value of many non-white male authors is not reasoned by their proponents, to lie solely in their statistical demographics, but in their talent. This being the case, advocacy centered around presenting value in sources based around gender, ethnicity, or nationality is likely to do little to sway the Conservative thinker or advocate for the quality of authorship as these criterion do not speak to the works themselves. \n\nIndeed, I find most often what people value is not colour of skin, sexual preferences, or nationality, within the lifestyle of author, but of culture (culture not being synonymous with Individual lifestyle ) and what ideas the person presents through this , therefore I would distance from language based on labels and not content. It's not that Franz Fanon was black, it's that he wrote about being black, just as it is not that Judith Butler identifies as Queer, but rather what she has written on Queer theory, which lend them weight and therefore relevance. Showing people there are ideas of value within labels rather than valuing labels because they represent a political ideal seems the best way to approach this.",

There are scholars from underrepresented groups with works of value who don't necessarily do research/scholarship specifically on their identities.\n\nAnd quite honestly, I disagree with this:\n\n>we don't value white male works because of intrinsic white maleness, but rather the merits of their works, so approaching the discussion in this way seems ill advised.\n\nI'm a social scientist who studies race. People often *believe* that they do not value white men (or whatever identity holds systemic power) because of their whiteness and maleness...but the research tells us that they do, actually. When the exact same words are spoken/read, they tend to be rated and valued more highly when they are portrayed as coming from a white man rather than a woman or a person of color.",

I will say that I typically don't use liberal/conservative labels within the program, but it is a political science scholarship (I maybe should've included this in the description for clarity). So politics comes up more often than not. \n\nI'm currently working on compiling a list of possible books, speakers, and topics to recommend to the staff, and I hope to have a number of other scholars sign off on it before I present it either to our chair or the staff. I will likely start my own small reading group whether they take my suggestions or not (and I'm looking forward to it!). \n\nI agree with your point about echo chambers, and sometimes I feel like I'm just bouncing back and forth between the conservative stances in my program and the liberals outside of it without any middle/common ground. I want a diversity of opinions and experiences represented, and I hope I can be a strong advocate. But it's hard, and I know I do have my own biases to work through at the same time.\n\n(Also it may not sound like it from this thread haha, but I am having a great time in college and really enjoying my studies!)",

      "text": "I'm a black woman who left academia and have done what you're trying to do both inside and outside of academia (with varying levels of success...more in industry, interestingly enough). I have found that I get the most traction when I acknowledge their efforts (like you did), say that I understand why the \\[insert activity here\\] is structured this way; but here's why I'm concerned and here are some suggestions for how to do it better. \n\nThe suggestions part is the most important part. Without them, it's far too easy for people to say \"I hear you, but we don't have a better solution so we're just going to keep doing it this way.\"  And then nothing changes. This may take a little bit of research on your part. Do you have professors in your department or program that you trust and can talk to one-on-one? If not, you could also reach out to other scholars of color in your field and related ones to ask for recommendations of readings or speakers.\n\nThe other thing is that I always assume best intentions. I've found that when people do unintentionally exclude voices from women and people of color, it usually actually *is* unintentional. They simply just don't notice because they haven't thought about it. Keep asking questions. There aren't *many* surviving texts from female philosophers? \"Oh, really? So then there are *some* surviving texts from some female philosophers, even if not many? Do you have any recommendations for us to look up?\" The important thing is to be genuine (not just to *sound* genuine, but to *be* genuine) when you're asking.\n\nIf you find yourself getting angry or upset, stop and try again later. It's not that you don't *deserve* to get upset (as I mention in a different comment - people are never asked to justify white or male scholars, only women, people of color, etc., and that's *infuriating*). It's just that your chances of being successful go way down when you do exhibit any kind of negative emotion about this.",

My issue is probably just being a little shy (especially as a freshman) and afraid to question things too much or too publicly. But I will try to take your suggestion and frame my questions differently because I think your framing is a much better approach.\n\nIt is frustrating because I have trouble expressing my thoughts in an \"academic way\" since I tend to get emotional. I think my best bet is to make my list of recommendations, have as many other scholars in the program sign on as I can, and ask our chair to send it to the staff.

I mentioned medieval Islamic philosophy, which may in large part be thought to be \"Western.\"\n\nBut I am not aware of much outside of that.\n\nEdit: Also aware of W.E.B. Du Bois, whose work many consider to be philosophy, even though as I understand it he eschewed being \"a philosopher.\"",

Or is this happenstance?\n\nThe real problem, as I see it, is class, not race.  By accident (not design), because the way the academic job market works, it favors people from fairly affluent backgrounds. To oversimplify to illustrate my point, only people from rich families will stay to get a PhD (rather than start earning money with their BS), and only people from rich families will put up with spending 6-10 years doing postdocs (or worse, adjuncting) at random places until a TT position opens up. Because they\u2019re not even worried about the lost years of earnings or having enough money. A similar dynamic goes on in show business, where you will find that lots of singers and actors come from money and can happily spend years pursuing a dream because they\u2019re okay on money. Meanwhile at each rung more middle and lower class people drop out.\n\nI\u2019m oversimplifying and I haven\u2019t even address (comparatively) poor immigrants who will also put up with years of hardship because it\u2019s their only way of staying in the country.\n\nBut where I\u2019m going with this is that since wealth disparities persist across races (in aggregate) with white people and Asians at the top in this country then\u2014ceteris paribus\u2014if my analysis above is somewhat correct, then I\u2019m not surprised to see that so many academics (especially from prestigious institutions) are white.",
