TT positions open up far slower \u2014 even if each of them hires 1 new TT each year, that\u2019s only one tenth of new PhDs. And those new PhDs are going to be competing with visitors at other institutions too. It\u2019s just a wildly imbalanced ecosystem",

They came from good universities, have similar number of publications, similar teaching experience, etc.  So to even make the short list, you basically have to luck into someone on the committee finding something that they like.\n\nWe think that the 10-12 people that we phone interview can do the job.  At this point, we weed out those that do not have good communication skills or can't think fast on their feet.  After that, we have to pick 3-4 to come to campus out of probably 8-ish that are well qualified and did well on the phone interview.  You are almost in coin-flip territory now. \n\nI have been on at least two dozen search committees so I have sat through around 75 on-campus interviews.  I bet fewer than 10 eliminated themselves during the interview (bad presentation, socially awkward, tell bad taste joke, etc.).  It is not unusual for us to send all 3 names to our Dean in ranked order saying they were all acceptable.  \n\nThe luck part does not end here.  Rarely, we have had the Dean make offers out of order (after all, they are all acceptable) because they may have an initiative they want (increase diversity, cluster hires, etc.).  More common is that the first person turns down the job, so now the offer goes to number 2, etc.\n\nI'll give you a story about how random this all can be.  This is how we hired one of my best colleagues.  First, they didn't apply for our position, instead they applied for another position in our department.  Someone from that committee came to me with a CV and said I think you should look at this one.  We did phone interviews and then invited 3 people (my future colleague  not among them).  One of the three got a job offer and pulled out.  The remaining two were good.  We made an offer, but due to a family emergency, withdrew.  We made an offer to the second, but there was trouble finding the spouse a position, so declined.  We then called #4, 5, and 6 from the phone interviews, but they all have already received other job offers.  So we get to the person ranked #7 after the phone interviews (my future colleague).  At this point we are just going to bring in one at a time to either make an offer or move on, but they did wonderful and was a great hire.  \n\nYou just can't plan on any of that.  Everyone in my story was perfectly well qualified, but who ended up here was complete luck.",

It is not surprising the top 10-ish out of 100 applicants are also competitive for other jobs.  Most of them have probably applied to dozens of jobs.  Almost all of the candidates that I liked but we didn't offer ended up in a faculty position elsewhere (I sometimes google them the next year out of curiosity).  \n\nI'd guess we are about 50% getting our first choice.  I have only been on 2 committees where we went back into the pool.  The one I described above, and another where one cancelled the week before, another got a better job offer, and the 3rd did not interview well.  The rest we either hired someone from our on-campus pool or failed the search. \n\nBut you are right, I would assume a small group get multiple offers while the majority never hear back from anyone.

I am one exception, although my experience was that I got 0 campus visits for the first 6 years on the market, and then last year I applied for 3 jobs and got 2 campus visits, then one offer which is my current job.\n\nWhile there certainly is a luck element, I think people sometimes overstate the value of luck or misapply it. It's not the case that applying is a pure crapshoot and that there's nothing you can do to increase your chances of getting a TT job. At the same time, you can definitely fail to get a TT job thanks to forces outside your control. The \"luck\" tends to be like \"there were 3 really strong candidates, and you happened to be the one who specialized in the exact area the department happened to be looking for.\"",
