  "title:": "Going back to do a rotation after disappearing",
  "text": "I'm a second year PhD student in ML related field in US. In the first year, I asked a professor to do a rotation with him. I met him once and attended one of their lab meetings. He asked me to talk to some of his students before going back to talk with him. I didn't go back to talk to him, and basically disappeared without contacting him again (until 2-3 months later. I emailed him to apologize).\n\nNow I am thinking of going back, as I feel I am still interested in what he does. What will professors think about such a student? Will they be willing to accept such a student back? Does it depend on personality of the professor (I think he is strict)? Will they think that 'well you have shown me already you are not a good student, why would I want you back'? (I have a demonstrated history of being inconsistent.)",

      "text": "This is one of these questions no one can answer. Students often think that professors are one amorphous mass, all following the same rules and acting the same. Professors are people and are as erratic, irrational and human as you are. \n\nNo one here can tell you how this person will react. I don't even know how I'd react tbh. I suspect it would depend on the impression I'd got of you and how you'd apologised. It sounds awful but some people you meet and you're willing to invest that extra time in even when they fuck up and others just scream headache and drama.\n\nThe only way you can know is by asking this person. If you really want to go back to this particular lab, I would make sure it's clear you know you fucked up, you know why you fucked up, and what you're going to do to ensure you don't fuck up again. You'll need to be prepared for a no, but your other option is not to try at all.",
