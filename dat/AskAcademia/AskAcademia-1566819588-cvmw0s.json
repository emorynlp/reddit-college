  "text": "I was hoping others could share salty emails they have received from their PI. For example, I recently got one that said \"...In fact, your presentation suggests\u00a0that you don\u2019t understand your own results.\"\n\nFor context, this is a notoriously difficult person who provides very little feedback months or years after it's been requested. The comments, in this instance, were relatively minor, but extra tangy!\nI definitely chuckled at this! \n\u00a0\n\nEDIT: In asking this question, I am hoping to highlight the (potential) commonality of such comments. Ultimately, I hope that readers are reminded that poor manners and salty comments are not a reflection of academic merit.",

At one point my postdoc adviser sat me down and said that I didn't have to keep trying to prove I was actually working when I wasn't getting a lot of good output, they already knew and trusted that completely. One of the few times something *nice* in a PI's office had me crying all over the place.\n\nI hadn't realized how obvious it was that I was used to dealing with a toxic environment. That made me cry a bit too.\n\nThis became something I felt I had to apologize for further down the road, and I'm still working on regaining my sense of 'normal'. I posted one of my PI's unreasonable responses to waiting for his feedback, and the way I learned to deal with similar situations is to send reminders regularly and then at some point say 'If I don't hear from you by X I'm going to assume I should go ahead and submit it.' which came across as pushy and judgy when my PI forgot my previous lab situation. They were immediately apologetic about having gotten snippy with me once I explained my intent, but it still sucked to realize how many protective mechanisms I'd developed and how they were making things worse in a new environment.\n\nAlso, maybe try not to judge other people for crying at work? Work is a third of your day on weekdays, and some people are criers. My wife cries at hallmark commercials and pictures of sad puppies, to name the most innocuous things that have triggered tears. She can't help that she cries at any stressor, even as she keeps working despite it and talks past it reasonably enough, any more than a morning person can help being peppy in the morning. Humans gotta human. I try not to judge them for that when I can, especially when it's obvious they aren't humanning *at* me or manipulatively.\n\nGood luck!",

But my school is incredibly lax about deadlines, and my PI had previously berated me for not getting his feedback and edits on a committee update. He didn't tell me he would be out for two weeks, but asked that I send him a copy he could edit and email back to me. I sent it the Sunday before (the 7th) and he said he'd get notes back to me soon. I sent him one email per day trying to get a response that week. \n\nFinally, the day it was due (the 12th), he told me to request a one-week extension. My school did not care in the slightest, so now it was due on the 19th. Another weekend came and went, and I again sent him up-to-date copies every day that weekend in an effort to get him to read it without saying 'hey, dickwad, either read this or tell me you're not going to'. Thursday he asks for another copy (the 18th). Email on Thursday didn't get a response, and another one on Friday didn't get a response. I figured the admins aren't in over the weekend anyway, so I'd hang on to it in case he had edits, since I didn't want to get berated again, and submit it Monday morning (the 22nd). \n\nSaturday's 'hey, did you get a chance to look at this yet?' email came and went, and then came Sunday's. This was the full extent of his response (the 21st):\n\n>I thought we had agreed that you would turn this in on Friday. You\ncan't keep missing deadlines like this. \n\n>\nJust to be clear, you are the only person responsible for meeting your\ndeadlines, just as you are the only person responsible for ultimately\ncompleting your PhD thesis.

You then have to politely prod me until I get back to you,\nbecause if I don't get back to you on something you still need to meet\nyour obligations.\n\n> In the future, if you want an extension on any of your thesis deadlines\nor want to delay any of our meetings, we need to agree to this delay\nexplicitly.\n\nThis was the first deadline I'd ever missed in his lab.",

But if I feel like you don't or are lazy, then I'm going to be passive aggressive to everyone... seriously.  That email was for ONE person out of the entire lab but to not hurt their feelings, he sent it to everyone.  So we all ignored everything after a week.  If you're gonna lay down some rules, be consistent and enforce them (said he was gonna make people who didn't follow the rules present extra papers during lab meeting but never did).",
