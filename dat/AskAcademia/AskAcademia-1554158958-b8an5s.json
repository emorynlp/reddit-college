  "title:": "Loved the PhD, hate the postdoc. How to quit?",
  "text": "I love research. I've loved the people, the atmosphere, and the independence. I worked like mad all PhD and loved it - I finished with (by my quick and dirty calculation) a publication record in the top 2% of graduating PhDs from my department. I only say this as a reflection of my outlook on the prospects of my academic future - it all looked so bright upon starting a postdoc. However, I failed to realize why I loved research before taking a position - the people, the independence, and a series of stellar supervisors - and joined a lab that had a \"tough\" reputation. I thought I could handle it. I thought my independence was stronger than the will of a tyrannical PI - I can not handle it. The work environment is horrible. People don't talk to each other, I am the only one who says good morning, the PI has a temper issue, I feel more like a lab tech doing the PIs research than my own scientist, 80 hour work weeks are expected, and the entire lab is fast and loose with statistical techniques and general scientific ethics.\n\nI am not going to last in this lab, at least not happily. I would quit outright, and then look for jobs, but have a chronic condition for which I need health insurance. I fear bringing up the idea of quitting before actually finding a job because I think it will errate the PI and lead to an even worse work environment, and possibly lead to my early termination. \n\nThere is currently a very enticing job right down the road. I want to apply now, and only quit with an offer in hand, but I don't want to burn bridges, even if I hate those bridges. What would you do in my situation?\n\n",

Wasn\u2019t even looking for it when I found it but it worked. That being said, you should go somewhere that you will be happy. It sounds like you would do well in research, just with the right mentor ship. There is no shame in saying this is not working out for me and looking elsewhere, you just have to explicitly state that to whomever you will be interviewing next with.",

They\u2019ll be invested in your success, and good ones will help you find a good mentorship team. Teamwork is the norm and you\u2019ll have a bigger role in helping the PI set the culture by helping hire the people that work best with you. ",

It was a wonderful and beneficial experience for everyone. The research was done well, and everyone got more publications than they would have otherwise. \n\nPersonally I like that dynamic, and depending on how much research you have, (I hate to say this but its accurate) just pawning it off on a promising undergrad so they can get a small first author paper or a name on a bigger paper is a good strategy, as long as you can help them be productive. \n\nIt's better than trying to do 3 people's worth of work by yourself and ending up driving yourself into the floor.",

      "text": "You mentioned you are about halfway through a one-year postdoc, right? Isn\u2019t this exactly when you\u2019d be expected to be looking for your next job? I know postdocs can last longer, but if you\u2019re on a one-year contract, nobody should fault you for applying elsewhere. And if you get a job offer you\u2019re interested in, you should take it. What is your PI going to do, complain that a postdoc applied for other jobs? Your position is meant to be short-term. \n\nI\u2019ve been in toxic labs, so I know that the above outlook is rosy, but I would definitely try to frame the situation like that, or work through it in a similar way. If you go this route, consider working out a way to give your PI the least fodder for whatever temper tantrum is coming (but still protect yourself). \n\nEven if you anger your PI and absolutely burn that bridge to the ground, if someone asks you for an explanation down the line, you can always say that the right job came up just a bit too early in your postdoc than you would have liked, but you felt like you couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. It\u2019s amazing how different the experience can be from lab to lab. They\u2019re surprisingly isolated places, and we really haven\u2019t figured out a good way to put safeguards in place to protect people from poorly-run labs. Take care, and good luck! ",

Working in a niche means that everyone in the field tend to know each other.

Insurance under FMLA: you must continue to make your share of premiums: https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28a.pdf\n\n3. Check if you have short-term disability - pays about 66% of your income for about 5 weeks. Check all the above with your company/univ's HR. \n\n4. In the meantime, apply for academic jobs and industry jobs. What's your field?\n\n5. Did you have other offers before you started here? Why don't you check with them if the position is still open? \n\n6. In your resume you can ignore this position and just say that you took a break for medical reasons. \n\n7.

I know that some of the research areas can be very niche  and a tight knit community.. perhaps you can branch-out?",

In both of my cases I was expected to stay in my role for at least one and a half additional years (in one case it was 3 more years) and that definitely made it so hard to switch. Luckily in one case the PI moved to a different institution so I was able to switch to without burning any bridges, and I\u2019m glad I did (even though it meant almost 2 years of stress and unhappiness).",
