  "text": "I am a doctoral student studying climate change. I know academicians aren't supposed to be experts on all topics out there. Although, I have this constant thought in the back of my head that it's sad that I don't know topics such as machine learning, quantum mechanics etc in detail although I don't have to. Does anybody here feel the same way? That we are missing out on 'cool stuff'?",

If you're doing new experiments, then you're also learning new techniques. \n\nI did a physiology PhD and I had to teach myself some electrical engineering, partial differential equations, electrochemistry, in addition to the physiology material I needed. Since then I've taken some online courses in audio engineering, statistics, mathematical logic, and history, done coursework in pedagogy, learned a fair amount about immunology and the history of medicine while writing a book, taught myself enough to be a kind of okay woodworker, and a lot of other stuff.  \n\nAn education isn't really limiting what you know-- it's just a starting point.",
