  "text": "I would love to work in a lab after graduation studying the climate. My job is in an oceanography lab and there are opportunities to do my thesis on an acoustics project or possible an ocean model.\n\nMy question is, since my degree is interdisciplinary does it matter what my thesis is on for the work I\u2019ll do later? I\u2019m worried about not having the opportunity to work on climate models if I do an acoustics or oceanography project. The benefit to do the work project is I can combine work and school. Thank you for any help.",
