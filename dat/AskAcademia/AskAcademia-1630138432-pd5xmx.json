  "title:": "How to approach research labs or people you want to collaborate with? COVID19 edition",
  "text": "Prior to COVID, going to any f2f conferences/workshop/campus visit etc makes finding a new collaborator easier. But in current situation where everything is online and pretty much not as interactive, how do you find people you want to collaborate with? and how do you approach those you're interested with collaborating (but never met) professionally?\n\n\\*I'm a really new junior faculty member trying to survive current situation. Any tips and advice to share? TIA!",

I get more emails than I can handle, and sometimes it just comes down to if I need a break from whatever I'm working on and an email like yours sparks my interest.\n\nI send out my own fair number of cold calls, and have the best luck when I introduce myself, what I like about their work, how my work overlaps, and how I could see us collaborating (generally, a specific funding call).\n\nGetting introduced by a colleague with connects also makes your chances go way up for getting a timely response.\n\nAnd, if they don't reply, don't take it personally. It happens, and it's part of life. They may have been too busy, wanted to respond and forgot, forwarded it to someone else that may have been a better fit (I do this a lot), or just couldn't deal that day. You'll get to that point in your career before you know it.",
