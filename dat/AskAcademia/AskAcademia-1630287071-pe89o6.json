  "text": "So I was looking at [Nature's guidelines for authors](https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors) and they list 5 pages as the maximum article length. Exactly what is the point of this limit? To me it just seems like it would be restrictive on content and what can be discussed.",

      "text": "Nature publishes short, data-dense reports on robust findings of extremely broad interest and significance, i.e. the sort of studies that are expected to have major implications for many workers across multiple subdisciplines. As such, Nature wants manuscripts to be honed down to just the information that is of interest to that audience. So, you won't necessarily get a thorough and exhaustive examination of the problem and data, but you'll get the greatest hits and the central takehome message. \n\nPeople may complain about that, but realistically journals like Nature, Science, Cell, etc exist because no one can read everything and we need quick easy access to studies which may force us to rethink our approaches or assumptions in adjacent research fields or may force us to update lectures, textbooks, etc.",

It was ALL about space.  There was a single introductory paragraph that was highly formulistic containing a few lines of introduction.  This was nothing to do with keeping it \"punchy\", and ALL to do with issue page limits and the cost of printing.  \n\nRemember that in those days, there WAS no on line version, no supplementary materials.\n\nWhy does your society journal charge for over ten pages?

                          "text": "> If published papers and articles in journals that have passed peer review aren't meant to be \"the research\" and just communication, then why are they cited as sources for, well, everything? If somebody is reading an encyclopedia or even an academic book and the bibliography cites a peer reviewed paper which isn't actually intended to be research and is just meant to be a summary, then that's problematic. Isn't the Abstract of a paper meant to be the summary and the basic communication?\n\nPapers are cited because they are vetted *reports* on research. They are a form of announcement of what research has been done, and it\u2019s natural to point to them. What use is it to reference a thousand of fitted experimental curves (how average \u201cthe research\u201d looks), instead of a short report on the fact that it has been done and the conclusions?\n\n> Also, it makes the crisis of public access even more dire. It's bad enough that the general public can't readily access papers in journals, it's even harder for them to then get extra material beyond that. All of the data and research should absolutely be published alongside the paper that the findings are in, and ideally, those papers should also be publicly accessible.\n\nIt\u2019s easier to get access to the research than the article, really. Every single funding body that has ever given me money for research demands data retention policy as part of the proposal, so that the data can be provided upon request. All public funding agencies in the US and EU have pretty straightforward mechanisms for anyone to get full access (unless it\u2019s export-controlled, which can happen surprisingly often in many fields).\n\nThis is just the usual case of lay people not bothering to understand how research works and lamenting about something they can\u2019t bother to look up. Research is free and publicly accessible, papers are not. Papers are not research. Should public have access to the papers? Sure. But it should maybe first understand what it\u2019s getting their hands on.\n\n> The entire peer review process and the role of journals, to add onto that, is supposed to be that the methodology is solid and that the data is being properly processed. How can you possibly ensure that if the totality of the research and the data isn't examined alongside the paper, and is then immediately available to other researchers or the public who is then reading that paper?\n\nIgnoring the fact that it is available, it\u2019s rarely necessary. Every single piece of research that most of us lay eyes on in our whole scientific careers is incremental to the point of being banal. There are very few surprises in real scientific work and reviewers are chosen such that they work on effectively the same thing as the authors, so they can tell whether the presented work makes sense in the context of the figures provided in the paper.\n\nIt can, in principle, lead to some biases or fraud, but that\u2019s much more rare than the public believes (in hard sciences, at least), because everyone is salivating to the idea of being able to prove other research wrong (it\u2019s a free publication, where I would not have to do any thinking).",
