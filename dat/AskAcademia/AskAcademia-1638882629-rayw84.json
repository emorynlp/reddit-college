Thanks.",

      "text": "Honoraria absolutely can be considered a financial COI depending on the amount and when it was payed. The most common threshold I've seen for disclosure of a COI is receiving $5,000 or more in the previous 12 months from a company/organization (whether you're talking about that company's products or not). Individual meetings might have their own COI disclosure policy that has a stricter reporting requirement. \n\nNote that it's very common in biomedical research for presentations to include COI disclosures, especially for physician scientists.",

The company paid you money to talk about their drug.\n\nYou may well be being on the level and completely truthful, but there is a huge apparent conflict of interest here.\n\nImagine if their competitor paid you an honourarium instead.  Would you disclose that?",
