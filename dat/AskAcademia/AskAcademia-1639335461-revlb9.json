  "title:": "Transitioning out of academia - what other jobs are we eligible for?",
  "text": "I'm mulling over leaving my current position after the 2022-2023 school year is over for a variety of reasons - low pay, very conservative atmosphere at my school that I'm not comfortable with, no growth potential, and just general boredom with the job in general. I only have a master's degree, and getting a PhD in my field would be a full-time commitment that would take at least 3-4 years, and I don't want to be out of the work force that long.\n\nMy academic background is in a medical-adjacent field that I'd have to get recertified for, and it's been so long since I've worked in the field that I'd have to complete another 1-2 year long BS program to be eligible for recertification. I'd have my pick of jobs once I got recertified, but the pay wouldn't be that much higher than what I earn now. There would be more potential of moving up the ladder though, and earning more money in the long run.\n\nI'm also thinking about instructional design or something else similar at a publisher, or possibly getting a master's degree in another medical-adjacent field that I'm really interested in that would involve more face-to-face time with patients and families.\n\nWhat are some other fields I could be thinking about that would utilize our teaching/communication skills and other soft skills we gain from working in academia? Have any of you made a successful transition into a different field?",

      "text": "Many, many jobs. Probably most jobs. When looking to transition out of academia, I find it more helpful and useful to ask not \"what can I do?\" but \"what would I *like* to do?\" So...what would you like to do? If you had to describe your ideal day at work, what would you be spending it doing? What are the tasks in academia that you really liked? Which ones did you despise and never want to do again? What bored you about academia?\n\nI transitioned into UX research (I have a PhD also in a medical-adjacent field) and I use the communication, teaching, and other 'soft' skills from academia all the time. The way I settled on this field was by reflecting on a lot of the questions above: I loved doing research and finding answers, I loved writing and communicating about my research, but I hated working solo for long stretches and wanted more collaborative work. I also wanted a faster pace and more practical problems, so I started looking at jobs in the private sector that still required research (and had the title researcher, perhaps).\n\nI found many: UX research is one, but many entertainment (TV, movie, etc.) companies hire researchers to conduct the background research necessary to flesh out their shows. Market research is a related field examining purchasing behavior and making predictions about near-term trends in consumer behavior. There are researchers in the HR functions of many large companies, dedicated to analyzing data about their employees to increase retention or achieve other goals.\n\nThere's the research & development that goes into developing products at a variety of large companies, and they hire all kinds of researchers, not just STEM - and in places you might not expect. I know a tech company that has a decent-sized society & ethics research team, with ethicists and social scientists working together to examine the human impact of their products. I know an economist who works at a video game company - he works to balance the game's resource economy. I know historians who have done consulting work for video games and television shows.\n\nAlso, since your degree is related to health, could you work in a field adjacent to it that doesn't require the recertification but benefits from the fact that you have that degree? For example, a nurse could probably become a hospital administrator, as their experience and knowledge would be useful. Perhaps there are jobs for you at health insurance companies, health-related nonprofits, or state or local government that could benefit from your expertise.",
