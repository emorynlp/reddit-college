  "title:": "I am borderline autistic. I did well in research due to long deadlines, deep focus in 1 subject and highly structured tasks (lab work). However I really struggled with jobs that require rapid creative thinking, switching and multitasking. What jobs can I do outside of research?",
  "text": " I tried both medical information and medical communications - these were an issue because I need longer times to process information. I need to rearrange any information in my head into concise logical order with vivid descriptions before I can understand or process it and act on it.\n\nFor example, if a client speaks really fast in a roundabout way, many of my colleagues can understand it first time, but I need to ask lots of questions in order to create an SOP in my head that I can process.\n\nFor research it was not an issue, but it was a problem in medical communications due to fast pace and multitasking required.\n\nWhat else can I do career wise outside of research.\n\nBackground: BSC, MSC, PHD in stem with research experience.",

Lol Im not sure if that interests you or is in the same field as your research and I know thats a stupid thing to suggest all people with autism will like software development so please dont assume I feel that way but on the off chance that interests you I know the world sure needs more wizards in that realm. Not sure id that was useful... but cheers on your journey mate!\n\nSorry sleep deprived\n\nEdit: on the off chance it DOES interest you and you want to know more just let me know. Im not the sharpest tool but am happy to send send links to resources that have helped me learn",

Search for coupons each course should be about $11-15. They put higher prices but coupons are easy to findm if you have trouble lmk ill def try to help out\n\nAs far as what language to start. Everyone will tell you different. I recommend python or javascript for a beginner language. Go is freaking awesome though. All preference and what you want to build imo.\n\nLinkedIn is a great spot to connect with people.. im absolutely brain dead but I promise I have more and will circle back after I get some rest and dont feel so crazy!\n\nAlso my DMs are wide open for anyone!\n\n\nEdit... sorry for shotgun blasting you with info. I did not know what would be interesting or useful to you. If it is too much please understand you DO NOT have to know even half of that stuff to be an amazing developer. We all have imposter syndrome, none of us knows everything, and we google things constantly. Id just find something that interests you in those lists and go from there.",

              "text": "Most people without any conditions at all will struggle to follow verbal math, so no, it\u2019s not a sign of ADHD or of anything else necessarily. It means you\u2019re a human person. Mathematics is a very dense language and it\u2019s *designed* to be stared at for a long time. It\u2019s not designed to be read aloud or to be read in a short time (which is why you should avoid non-trivial math in presentations)\n\nIf you have an auditory processing disorder (APD) then you won\u2019t just struggle with comprehending spoken math, you\u2019ll struggle with spoken everything. You won\u2019t be able to understand people over the phone or if they\u2019re facing away from you. You can\u2019t understand someone speaking right next to you if there\u2019s a TV on. You can\u2019t understand anything if multiple people are talking at once in a room. Auditory processing disorder means your brain struggles to separate out sounds, and spoken words turn to unintelligible mush. But APD is related to a lot of conditions, not exclusively or even mainly ADHD.",
