  "title:": "I am borderline autistic. I did well in research due to long deadlines, deep focus in 1 subject and highly structured tasks (lab work). However I really struggled with jobs that require rapid creative thinking, switching and multitasking. What jobs can I do outside of research?",
  "text": " I tried both medical information and medical communications - these were an issue because I need longer times to process information. I need to rearrange any information in my head into concise logical order with vivid descriptions before I can understand or process it and act on it.\n\nFor example, if a client speaks really fast in a roundabout way, many of my colleagues can understand it first time, but I need to ask lots of questions in order to create an SOP in my head that I can process.\n\nFor research it was not an issue, but it was a problem in medical communications due to fast pace and multitasking required.\n\nWhat else can I do career wise outside of research.\n\nBackground: BSC, MSC, PHD in stem with research experience.",

I am also struggling to find something similar but even in academia I have found that the people that do most progress are the one that can make a lot of contacts and can make good collaborations which is not my thing. However most jobs are the same in that regard or worse so academia is not that bad if you are good in what you do.",

My mentor has autism and he is a freaking wizard who appears to be happyish..? Lol Im not sure if that interests you or is in the same field as your research and I know thats a stupid thing to suggest all people with autism will like software development so please dont assume I feel that way but on the off chance that interests you I know the world sure needs more wizards in that realm. Not sure id that was useful... but cheers on your journey mate!\n\nSorry sleep deprived\n\nEdit: on the off chance it DOES interest you and you want to know more just let me know. Im not the sharpest tool but am happy to send send links to resources that have helped me learn",

He's filthy rich but more importantly he gets to do the math he loves and he is basically revered by the rest of the company. Sales would have nothing good to sell without him.",

They spend most of their time now on flight simulation as a hobby that Hope's to fruit to actually flying. So maybe a pilot could be ur thing also. \n\nMaybe architecture could be ur thing also? I'm not sure of the amount of communication skills required though.",
