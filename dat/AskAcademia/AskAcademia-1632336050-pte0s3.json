  "title:": "Are PhD Students Really Older?",
  "text": "I'm applying to PhD programs this application period, and I was wondering if PhD students are actually older in the programs. I'm currently finishing up my Master's, and all of those in my cohort are fresh out of undergrad (22-24), and I know many students go straight to PhD from undergrad as well.\n\nI worry I'll be older than many other students if this is the case, as I am spending two years in the master's program prior to attending PhD.",

      "text": "In terms of when you should start a PhD, I think age is less important than how prepared you are for a PhD program and what it entails (which is field dependant). In some fields, having some years of relevant work experience before starting the program is helpful, whereas in others going straight through might be beneficial so you can more easily retain prerequisite knowledge. \n\nOnce you're in the program your peers will be the other students in your cohort regardless of age. It's just like in the workforce where your peer group may include people in their 20s and people in their 60s.",

So how does being a software engineer for 25 years make you a better PhD candidate in history?",
