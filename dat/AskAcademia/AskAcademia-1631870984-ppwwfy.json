Ask \"what can I do, publish, and get funded for now that will position our science for the next step?\". I had senior PIs telling me that my stuff was useless a while back, because it didn't benefit the problems that they were trying to solve. Fortunately, what we were doing provided trans-disciplinary benefits elsewhere, so we found plenty of new funding and work to do without having to directly compete with the \"old boys\" (now, we can collaboratively work with them on their projects, and get funding for our own projects to make some new impact). \n\nFrankly, I think it is a mistake to assume that you need to outcompete the old folks at what they do, or to dive in to the hottest niche and compete in a pool of peers -- you can achieve higher impact by getting way-ahead on a new/niche problem, or something clearly being done wrong or to an insufficient standard, where you won't need to compete, provided you have some luck to identify or be exposed to one.",

But especially at \"the top,\" these institutions cater almost exclusively to elites despite their lip-service, and it is evident when you are at them, and especially who is successful in them. But again, it will depend on the kinds of places one is talking about, and there are relative degrees. Berkeley is a lot less \"elitist\" in this respect than Harvard, though you'll still find a huge proportion of Berkeley profs have Ivy League degrees.\n\nIf one simply means, \"are academics elitist because they are _experts_\" \u2014 that is not elitism in my mind, but it frequently is used that way by anti-intellectuals. I am not an \"elitist\" just because I have studied something for many years and believe my opinion about it is better-informed than someone who is largely ignorant of it. Expertise is not necessarily elitism, unless the pathway to expertise is _only_ open to elites (which is not the case in the USA, even with the elite bias of academia), and even in that case, the problem isn't with expertise, but with the pathways.",

As a general rule, your university doesn\u2019t care about you, as evidenced by the salary disparity between most administrators and professors, the consistent cutting of funding, and the slow transition to an adjunct driven gig economy that leaves people with PhDs on food stamps. The scientific community probably doesn\u2019t care about you, as evidenced by the rampant financial corruption of \u201crespected\u201d journals, where you must give up your rights to compensation and ownership as an author and offer to do free reviewer labor in order to be published. \n\nNo job should steal more than 40 hours a week from you. No job should require you to perform  a task which costs money (e.g., research), but also expect you to find that money yourself. No job should involve you working for free as you do in the current review system while other people simultaneously charge exorbitant fees for access so they can profit from the product of your unpaid labor.\n\nOur system is seriously messed up, and the idea that academics should expect to work 60-80 hours a week on a regular basis just because they \u201clove\u201d academia is toxic and sickening.

You give up at least a decade of your life to get established, take hits financially, socially and to your mental health. There is an incredibly high barrier to entry which reinforces that elitism. Then there are the mechanisms that reinforce this throughout your career.\n\nBut your question was whether academia is elitist, and by extension academics. I added that qualifier because, while it is elitist, it\u2019s also one of the few areas where people can (ostensibly) get recognition for disadvantage to help level out the playing field. You don\u2019t get that in industry. Academia seems to try and account for the high barrier to entry, more so than anywhere else. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m analysing your question too deeply or from the wrong angle. I wrote a bunch of blog posts a couple of years ago, exploring why the general public has started to reject scientific consensus - everything kept pointing back to scientific elitism. But it\u2019s important to understand why/how that exists. You have to invest a lot and prove yourself to earn that sense of elitism, and it\u2019s not necessarily without merit.\n\nAs someone else has said, if you want to answer that question you need to clarify what you\u2019re comparing academia to. Most responses here sound like the focus is being placed on internal dynamics and how academics treat each other. Both are valid perspectives.",
