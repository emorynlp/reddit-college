If you want to edit documents using track changes for example in Word I\u2019d say MacBook or iPad with a keyboard. My MacBook broke and I had to use track changes on my iPad to grade and it was a pain without a keyboard IMO.\nEdit: using an iPad to read papers though has been a game changer for me.",

Even for digital office hours. \n\nI do not at all regret buying a 12.9\" iPad solely for that.",

      "text": "I know 2 profs who got iPads and Apple Pencils to use for virtual STEM classes (to draw equations) - they ended up not using them at all because they couldn't figure out how to use it.  I'm sure you won't be like them :)\n\nA few things that will make grading assignments on iPads easier:\n\n1) Get a clear screen protector for the iPad - you can find one for a few bucks (some people swear by a product called Paperlike that's $30 - probably unnecessary). It'll add a little friction and make it less slippery to write. \n\n2) Figure out which app(s) you want to use - I like GoodNotes ($8) because I can import pdf files into the app (from Google Drive), mark it up, and then export back to pdf. There are probably a ton of other apps out there (Notability is another that has good reviews).\n\n3) You don't have to get the Apple Pencil (it's like $100 or more) - there are other styluses that will work well for writing like the Adonit Note (costs about $50).  Presumably you won't need the pressure sensitivity feature if you're just marking up papers.",
