  "text": "Context: Recently left a 2 year relationship because distance couldn't keep working (I'm studying for a masters and she worked a lot, so were seeing eachother less frequently). The final straw was my accepting a PhD at the end of this course, which she'd supported my intention to do throughout, but the prospect of several more years of long-distance was too much. \n\nHave any of you had similar experiences? How did you move past them?",

      "text": "I was with my ex for a couple of years, doing long-distance. When she decided to do a PhD, it meant that we would have been long-distance for at least several years more. She broke it off.\n\nI can't say your experience will be anything like mine, but it took me a long while to get over her. I put all of her pictures and belongings into a box and stored it away (they say you should get rid of everything that reminds you of the other person). I couldn't bare myself to throwing everything away, so a box away from view sufficed.\n\nI then read advice that after a breakup, you should focus on yourself, try new hobbies, meet new people, etc. I picked up social dancing lessons, horse-back riding lessons (for a short bit, too expensive in the long run), swimming lessons (yes, as an adult), and I volunteered my time at a charity shop. I needed to stay busy, and it helped keep me sane, otherwise, I would end up depressed in my bedroom thinking about my ex. I'm also naturally a very shy person, so social dancing was perfect because it allowed for female contact without having to start a conversation.\n\nIt took me six months before I started feeling like a normal person again. After one year and I felt ready to start dating again. I think 1.5 years later is when I met someone new that I really, really liked (and eventually married). Although I have to admit, the first year into my new relationship I was scared my ex would try to come back to me, because I wouldn't have known who to choose. Anyways, I'm glad I'm married to my now wife.\n\nI still have a place in my heart for my ex, we had an incredible relationship, and I'm happy that we had it, but I'm also more thankful that I'm with my wife. My ex was a good person, but I never knew a relationship could be so much better until after I met my wife.\n\nAnyways, only time will heal you. The best thing you can do for yourself is to stay busy and focus on becoming a better person. It's a slow process, but for every day that goes by, is one day closer towards recovery.\n\nHope you didn't mind my ramblings. Take care of yourself.",

It's pretty essential that your partner be understanding of the huge workload and pressure you'll be under and that this means you'll not be always able to give them as much attention. But you at the same time can't fall into the trap of becoming so overwhelmed by everything that you constantly choose work over your partner. You have to carve out time to prioritize your relationship, even though it may always seem like there's something you need to be working on. This for me was where I struggled the most at the beginning of the PhD. I neglected him a lot, to be honest. And although he mostly was understanding about how much stress I was under, it's not fair to the other person to not give them your time and attention and care about their struggles. That really takes a toll.\n\n I hope things work out for you!",

It\u2019s been one year since I moved away, and we went the first 10 months without seeing each other because he was unemployed and neither of us could afford a trip. He\u2019s now employed and coming to visit me next week for two weeks! We decided 10 months apart was way too long so we have plans to see each other every 3-4 months. I\u2019m going to try to attend conferences that are closer to him. \n\nEvery few months doubt creeps into my mind about why we\u2019re still long distance after 7 years and why we seem to be getting further apart in distance, rather than closer. But I know that there\u2019s no one else I\u2019d rather be with, and I wouldn\u2019t be here without his support. We\u2019re both so deeply committed to each other and we know that things will work out for the best. ",

My MA and PhD are certainly partially to blame for the ending of my marriage, which, ultimately I was very glad for because she turned out to be an awful human. My academic pursuits meant my attention was no longer on her fully, which she disliked, and I think she resented my drive and success (if you could call it that) some as well. That, combined with serious mental illness and a shitty character led to her to cheat for almost two years before I found out and ended it. It was she who pushed me to move over 600 miles away to start my PhD. I thought it was because she cared, but really it was because it would make it a lot easier to continue to cheat and have a spouse who financially supported her. It wasn't easy at all, but I'm so glad I was able to figure out what a horrible person she was sooner rather than later. \n\nSo I guess...academia can cost you relationships, but I'd like to think it's for the best most times.

And even IF you both get a gig at a single place or in a single city, you're sort of stuck there to a certain extent because if one of you wants to leave the chances of the next place doing a spousal hire is unlikely at best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but I guess I just want you to know that I empathize and often reflect on how many academics are in the same boat -- myself included.

Doing my own academic work and having no support whatsoever helped me to realize how much our life was about him. I had supported his career with multiple moves, being the lone parent for months at a time while he traveled, and picking up the slack after he choose to work late nights and he was \"so tired\" and couldn't pitch in with household tasks or parenting. We didn't have conversations about anything because he was completely uninterested in me or my career but I always explained it away as him being busy or stressed. It was like being married to a brick wall who I had to clean up after. \n\nWhen I started my PhD, I thought things would change because the plan was always that we invest in his career and then it was my turn. That didn't happen. After he tried to talk me into putting it off for a few more years because we needed to focus on his career more (I said no), it being \"my turn\" meant that he let me hire a maid so I didn't have to clean... end of list. Nothing changed on his end. Once, I asked him what my degree was in and he didn't know. Another time, he expected me to skip a conference presentation at one of the top national conferences in my field because he was \"super busy\" with work. And when I mentioned how important this was to my career, he told me his career was the priority since he made more money. It was the red flag I needed (although one of many).\n\nI realized how one sided our marriage was and how miserable I was. Got a divorce and now have the most amazing supportive partner. He helps around the house, emotionally supports me, and is amazing with my kid (he coaches my kid's sports teams and it makes me turn into a puddle of mush). I'm so incredibly grateful that getting my PhD \"hurt\" my marriage but also empowered me to realize how bad it was. I couldn't be happier now.",

      "text": "Almost. We were long distance throughout the last years of my B.Sc and all of my MSc (he was in the US, I was in Europe). We were constantly messaging/skyping whenever timezones allowed, and we'd meet up for weeks during semester breaks. The good thing was that it allowed us to live very independent lives (e.g. no guilt for me when I stayed late in the lab or worked weekends), but the lack of physical proximity was very difficult, and we almost didn't make it (there was a \"break\" towards the end of my MSc). \n\nThe key moment was that we decided that, in order to make this work, we needed to make a concrete plan to move together and prioritise each other, even if that meant not going for the \"dream PhD in Sweden\" - e.g. I applied for an RA job in countries/cities he'd be able do get a visa/job in (luckily he's not in academia but IT at the time), but financially support him while he was looking for a job. Then after he was employed, I'd apply for PhD programs in the same city (easier after having made connections through working as RA).\n\nIt all comes down to that you both need to value the relationship over more \"comfortable choices\" (me: a \"smooth academic career\", him: stable job and closeness to friends). It's a big leap of faith and everyone's situation/values/journey is different. 6 years on, we're happy about our choices - we're married with a baby on the way! That being said, I'm not pursuing postdocs abroad and will most likely exit academia in the long run (for unrelated reasons).",

Most often this happens with partners who are not in academia, and some has settled with new partners in either a similar field or similar academic role. Not uncommon for me to leave at 7 and still see them focused at work 5 days a week, and certainly thats gotta have some impact on their home. \n\nIt\u2019s honestly made me reconsider some aspects of academia and my options post PhD. Having said that, I\u2019ve had a good long discussion with my partner about my journey (we met after I started my degree), what it meant for my future commitments, travel, tying the knot, etc. and thankfully she\u2019s super understanding. I had to be upfront and brutally honest with her but I\u2019m glad i put my cards on the table so to speak. It also helps she\u2019s busy with other things so we\u2019re both on a similar level when it comes to quality time",

      "text": "I have an opposite story. I met my incredible partner BECAUSE of my PhD and now our relationship is what keeps me sane while I am in the last 2 months of my PhD. \n\nWe lived in different cities (Perth & Melbourne) and met at a conference (we had the same scholarship) in Sydney. Long story short him and I ended up talking nonstop for the rest of the conference and sparks flew.\n\nOver the following year we did long distance, (including him being in the US for 6 months) and I eventually decided to move to Melbourne to be with him. Luckily I'd collected all my data and my supervisors were totally cool with it. \n\nSkip ahead to now - we've been together almost 2 years (lived together for 1) and I am just 2 months away from submitting my PhD. He finished his PhD a year ago.  I was there for him when he finished his PhD and the depression that came afterwards - it was hard. But we got through it. And now our relationship is the only reason I am not going insane in this final part of my PhD. Being with someone who knows what a PhD is amazing.\n\nIt's not always been easy - communication and knowing how to communicate your stress is essential. The hardest parts of our relationship was when one of needed something from the other but didn't communicate it. There were a lot of moments I wasn't sure if we were going to make it and lots of crying where I thought I couldn't finish my PhD AND be in our relationship. I had to go to therapy, he had to focus on healing himself. It was hard. But we pulled through and are now stronger than ever.\n\nIt's easy to get fixated on your research and thing that is the only thing that is important. I try EVERY DAY to make him feel loved and like I appreciate him and he did that with me while he was in his stressful period. Without that, our relationship would surely fall apart.\n\nMoral of the story - relationships are hard work and you need to prioritise them. But also, who knows, you could meet the love of your life at a conference ;)",

She got a job this year; I did not, and even postdocs are looking unlikely. She'll be moving from the US to the UK; I have no clue what I'll be doing. \n\nOur problem is that we're both now in our mid-30s and were both divorced earlier in the PhD. We love each other deeply, but if I plan on staying in academia (a relatively strong field within the humanities, but the humanities nonetheless), we'll have to split. We both want kids and while I can still wait at this age, she'll need to find someone with a more stable career ASAP.\n\nThe end of the relationship paired with the shit job market results are causing me to strongly consider an industry job. Unfortunately, I'm now ten years deep into grad school (including MA) so it's going to be very tough to transition. But thankfully, I have good connections and networks so I think it can work.\n\nFrankly, I realize that it just may not be worth it, and that I'm more likely to be happy in a 9-5 with a partner and family (and better money) than a free scholar on my own.",
