I write articles 30% faster with Scrivener because everything... my research, drafts, notes, etc. are all in one place and can be viewed at the same time. \n\n(2) Research and then outline and THEN write. This seems obvious, but until I became strict about not starting to write an article/chapter/etc. until I was 95% done with my research and had a strong and detailed outline I was not an efficient writer. Writing is SO much easier and so much quicker now that I work in discrete phases. My work is stronger, too. \n\n(3) Always include a full citation with every quote I pull during my research. Every single one. \n\n(4) Orienting my daily writing goals around words, not time. There have been some interesting studies that have shown that word goals (\u201cI must write 500 words every day this week.\u201d) rather than time goals (\u201cI will write for 30 minutes every day this week.\u201d) lead to far greater productivity. That has DEFINITELY been the case for me. It\u2019s surprising how quickly the words add up when you hold yourself to a certain amount each day. ",

      "text": "The other thing I'll say here that's more \"big picture\" is that, as academics and grad students, most of us have a story we tell ourselves about \"how we write,\" and we're all certain that our stories are correct.  Why wouldn't they be, right? We've spent years and years writing papers in grad school, undergrad, high school, etc., and done so successfully, and so we think we *know* how we write.\n\nIt took a long time for me to figure out that the story I had been telling myself for years wasn't accurate and wasn't, in fact, the best way for me to write. I had been telling myself for decades that I was someone who couldn't write in small doses.  I *had* to write in long blocks and long stretches of time because that's how I \"thought best\" and \"wrote best,\" etc. etc. blah, blah, blah.  Similarly, I didn't need to try Scrivener because Word had always worked for me and I didn't like complicated programs.  I *knew* how I wrote.  No one could tell me otherwise.  I was wrong, though.  I was justifying my bad habits and path dependent methods and, worse, I couldn't see that I was doing it.\n\nMy writing process became much smoother, faster, and less stressful when I was forced to change how I wrote due to various changes in my life.  After I had kids, I no longer had the option of writing for 8 hour stretches.  The only way I could reliably get writing done was by doing it in small chunks.  And, lo and behold, not only could I write in small doses, I was *better* at writing in small doses.  I was more productive, too.  Similarly, when I sat down and forced myself to learn Scrivener, I learned that I liked it a lot better than Word and that it did all kinds of things I had always wished Word would do.\n\nOnce I was willing to challenge all of the stories I had been telling myself for years about \"how I write,\" I became a better writer.  I became a faster writer.  I became a more productive writer.  Challenge your stories and I think you may find the same thing.",

Keeping track of my words written per day seems really OCD, but I find that it gives me a lot of flexibility.  If I know I want to take a few days off, I just exceed my daily quota in the days leading up to the break and make sure I have words banked.",

As you've noted, having to go back and find the source of some quote or fact later is a huge PITA. It's also how a lot of young writers end up flirting with plagiarism, as they often cannot find that original source. Why faculty aren't teaching basic research skills to college students is beyond me.\n\nWhat faculty in my department often hear from senior majors from *other* departments is some variation of \"What is the Endnote magic of which you speak? You mean I don't have to manage my bibliography as a Word document?\" Again, baffling\\-\\- and in my own university \\-\\-that some disciplines don't bother to teach event their *seniors*  how to use basic research methods when collecting information.\n\nWhat I wish I'd known before I was well into my second graduate degree was the value of keeping a research *journal*. Having a record of each day's work on a major project, including what sources I'd consulted and which search terms I had use in a given database \\(or hey, *card catalog* back then\\) would have been very helpful down the road. That's more true on a thesis or diss than anything...I finally did pick up that skill and when working on book\\-length projects those journals saved my ass more than once when I needed to go back to a particular source for more info or had to verify a quote or wanted to find out when a particular photo was taken.
