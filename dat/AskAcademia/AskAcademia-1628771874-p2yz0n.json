  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI am interested in applying to math PhD program at NUS (National University of Singapore) but could not find much useful information on its department website and other websites, so I was wondering that would this subreddit be more updated and having more info...\n\n1. This is no acceptance data on the website or grad cafe. Do you know what is the usual data of acceptance rate, like how many students apply and how many are admitted each year or in recent years?\n\n2. What is the usual requirements for admitted PhD applicants?\n\n3. What is the percentage of international students who receive fundings other than the \"basic\" research scholarship?\n\nMany thanks!",
