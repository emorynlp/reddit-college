  "title:": "Those of you who have taught or attended a For-Profit College, what was your experience like?",
  "text": " I am researching for-profit education for a project of mine to see if or  how the profit-seeking nature of these types of colleges affects the   learning or teaching experience there, and I would be interested in   hearing first-hand experiences from anyone who is a current or past  student or instructor at one of these institutions.\n\nIt's okay to not disclose anything specific, the main things I would like to know are things like:\n\n\\- How much do you think what you learn/teach can be useful or applicable in your/your student's future profession?\n\n\\-   Is the experience working for a for-profit college similar or different  to that of non-profit college (if you've experienced a non-profit   college as well)? And if it is different, what are those differences and   why do you think they exist?\n\n\\-  Do you think that your voice \"can be heard\" by the administration? Do  you  think that the administration has your best interests at heart?\n\n\\- Why did you choose a for-profit school over a non-profit?\n\nI  know that for-profits, especially big ones like DeVry or Phoenix, are  quite infamous in the public eye and online, but I would love to hear   more personal experiences that might reinforce or even dispel some of   the baggage that they carry. I'm more familiar with the situation in the   USA, but I've heard that they are very popular in Asia as well, so   experience from any for-profit college is completely welcome.",
