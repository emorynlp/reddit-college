  "text": "I am currently a politics student who has applied for a history masters at another university. Whilst writing my dissertation I have come across an academic who\u2019s work has helped me massively and I have discovered they\u2019re a professor at the university I want to attend. What is the general consensus if I wanted to email their university email (which is their profile on the university website) and say I appreciate the work you have done and also low-key mention I wanna study at their university?",

      "text": "Hello, this is how I was taught (history major, UK/US):\n\nLet's say that you want to work with XYZ. Before you send anything, ask yourself this: \"Am I on good terms with anyone in academia who might be friends with XZY?\" If yes, talk to them. They might drop XYZ an introductory email singing your praises. This would increase the chances of XYZ paying attention to your email. Obviously, not every lecturer would be up to do this so it is better to let them offer than asking.\n\nDo not worry if you don't know anyone who knows XYZ. Having a middleman is a boost but absolutely not essential. The majority of grad school candidates won't.\n\nLet's get to your email.\n\n* First of all, send the email from your university email. If you're using your personal email cause you've graduated  (which is totally fine) just make sure it is not that silly one with a cartoon reference you made when you were twelve.\n* Have a clear email subject line such as \"Prospective Grad Student: MA/Ph.D. in \\[subject\\]\".\n* Then, a respectful opening: \"Dear Dr. XYZ\" or \"Dear Professor XYZ\". DO NOT start your email with \"Hi XYZ\". Make sure you use their correct title and pronouns.\n* Followed by a sentence stating your intent. Kind of repeating the subject title:\n   * \"Good morning and I hope this email finds you well. I am writing as a prospective student for the MA/Ph.D. in \\[subject\\].\n* First paragraph:\n   * Briefly describe how come you know about their work. There are several ways to go about this but a classic one is mentioning how you found about their work and how much it taught you (just like you did above). Something along the lines of:\n      * \"I learned greatly from your book \\[book name\\] while writing my undergraduate dissertation on \\[subject\\]. I have been following your work since.\"\n      * Don't get too gushy, it is not a fan letter.\n      * This should not take longer than two sentences.\n   * Mention your ongoing or previous research if you think it would draw their interest.\u00a0\n      * Pick and choose the option that they would draw their attention the most. Do not fill the email with academic name-dropping and \"padding\" (they will see the rest on your CV anyway).\n      * One sentence, max two. DO NOT BOAST.\n* Second paragraph:\n   * An introductory sentence stating your current university, major, and GPA (if it is good).\n      * Since you're switching from politics to history, you might want to mention why.\n      * \"I am an undergraduate at \\[university\\] with a \\[gpa\\], currently majoring in \\[subject\\]. However... (I have been taking history classes / I want to continue my graduate studies in history as etc...)\"\n   * Tell them how you are interested in studying \\[topic they'd be interested in supervising\\] from a \\[x\\] perspective / with a focus on \\[x\\] / using the methodology \\[x\\].\u00a0\n      * You do not have to be too specific. In my experience, it is much better to come across as flexible than obsessed about one niche topic.\u00a0\n      * Just let them know what kind of work you are planning on doing if they supervise you. Since you're applying to the history department, it can be something like:\n      * \"While it is a preliminary idea, I am interested in studying/looking at \\[broad subject\\] in \\[region/country\\] during \\[time/period\\] at \\[university\\] under your supervision.\n* Final paragraph:\n   * Kindly ask them if they will be taking in students for the \\[term - year\\] and whether they would be interested in supervising you.\u00a0\n      * In your case, you already sent your application, so mention that.\u00a0\n      * Mention that you attached your CV and a sample of your writing.\n      * Pre-COVID, you'd kindly suggest that you visit them during their office hours to introduce yourself in person and further discuss your planned research (if they were at a reasonable distance).\n      * Since the meeting in person is not an option, say that you would be happy to set up a Zoom call with them in case they have any further inquiries.\n* Thank them for their time and sign it.\n\nBefore you send, make sure you've attached:\n\n* Your most recent CV.\n* A sample of your work. For most undergrads, this is usually an assignment that received a high score (ideally in the supervisor's area of interest).\n\nNeedless to say, my advice may not be suitable for every supervisor or university. I know that some Scandinavian Universities have a zero contact policy with candidates to avoid bias. Emailing the potential supervisor beforehand is considered very bizarre in some Middle Eastern universities too, as some use a placement exam for graduate school. So make sure you do your research and it would help to ask an academic advisor or one of your peers if you are unsure about anything.\n\nBest of luck with your studies!\n\nEdit: If you do not hear from them after two weeks, it is OK to send them a reminding email. If you still do not hear back, let it go.",

This shows that you've done your homework and you bring something to the table instead of the same old - \"I'm very excited to work with you\".
