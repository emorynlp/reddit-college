  "text": "I know it's a bit of a weird question, and before you say anything, I'm fully aware of the consequences of scientific misconduct and I oppose this practice.\n\nAnyway, in my experience, scientific misconduct is way too common among my colleagues. It can range from simple cherry-picking to plain data fabrication and falsification.\n\nI started my Ph.D. more than one year ago and I still have no publications. My research simply doesn't work and I can't just make up good results.\n\nExcept that I know that my peers are doing exactly this, and every day I'm tempted to do so as well.\n\nI know that the probability of \"getting caught\" is extremely low, I just don't do it as a matter of integrity. I started a Ph.D. to follow my passion for research, it would make no sense for me to make it up.\n\nAnd yet I'm tempted. I'm failing my Ph.D. and I'm desperate. I'm not asking you whether I should do it (I already know the answer), but I want to know if you ever find yourselves in this situation, and how do you cope with it.\n\nThanks.\n\nEDIT: I didn't expect so many comments. I'll share a couple more points here since I have no time to reply to everyone.\n\nFirst, I didn't ask whether I should cheat, I just asked if someone who found themselves in a similar situation could share their experience.\n\nSecond, from what I read, I was probably wrong in assuming that every institution had the same problem. I work in a toxic environment, my supervisor ignores me, nobody can do actual research, nobody actually has a field of research (everybody publishes papers about anything). It's all about publishing, publishing, publishing, not about research. They are pressuring me hard because I have no publications, and yes, everybody here is supposed to have a few publications in the first year.\n\nI can't keep working in such a toxic environment, I will probably quit my Ph.D. soon. Maybe I'll try again somewhere else.\n\nThanks everybody for the answers.",

The only people I know who have results and papers in year one are people whose PIs give them ready to analyze datasets on day 1. And only a small subset of PIs run their labs that way.",

I mean, the only reason to even be tempted to fudge data is to get into a better journal. To claim that something exist where really there's nothing. (And then hope that you die before the building built on this \"finding\" comes down haha) But if you only want to publish, if only quantity matters, you can as well publish negative results. It is totally possible to publish negative results; these papers will get fewer citations, sure, but at least they will be consistently reliable.\n\nMy understanding (from Retraction Watch) that it is usually so called \"fancy labs\" with alarmingly brilliant non-intuitive findings that burn the brightest when misconduct is found.

Moreover, if the community fails to reproduce your work, it might not even get cited much or worse, get cited for the wrong reasons, so what's the point?\n\nIn my field, unfortunately, cherry picking is all too common and work that is good can get rejected since comparisons will be with respect to previous cherry picked results. One work around (for example) is that in the paper, you can report \"cherry picked\" numbers (e.g. upto 10% better), while the appendix reports the complete results.

After all, the process of doing literature review, forming ideas, setting up experiments, etc. does take a long time. \n\nTo answer your question, I think it depends on what you mean by 'scientific misconduct'. I know people who cherry pick their data but they have always been able to come up with explanations to justify their action so it's fine I guess. If you're talking about straight up fudging your data then I would never do it because some where down the line it will come back and bite me. For example, maybe the fake data works fine for my current work but probably won't work at all in my future work and then I will have to come up with more BS to explain why they won't work. Imo the potential downfall and and repercussions outweigh the short term gains.",

Importantly, there are two different sets of ethics: the first is your career\u2019s ethic (e.g., scientific integrity in your case), the second is your own personal set of ethics. And also importantly, there is a third shadow set of ethics\u2014ethics a community has crafted. The shadow ethics are the trickiest I think, because they may disregard the career ethics. They are justified by the community because of the pressure or because everyone else is doing \u201cX\u201d and it\u2019s impossible to get ahead if you don\u2019t circumnavigate the career ethics. \n\nAn excellent example is doping in sports. Think of the doping scandal in bicycling. It was almost impossible to win races if you weren\u2019t doping because everyone was doping. So there are very real consequences to not going along with things, but equally, there are very real consequences if you are caught. (Lance Armstrong anyone? What a fall.)\n\nSo yes, there will always be opportunities to cheat...in academia or any other job. Only you can decide what is most important to you (your personal ethics). At the end of the day, would you feel better about yourself if you cut corners and got ahead (gaining a future position is most important) or would you feel better if you did things according to stated ethics and didn\u2019t get ahead (playing by the rules is most important).  Ideally, the ideal situation is where you don\u2019t have such a stark choice. It can not be overstated that having people with shared goals and ethics around you is the best scenario. Less temptation, more support. \n\nMaybe you aren\u2019t in the right field for you. Or you aren\u2019t in the right place. These are hard questions. \n\nI\u2019ve always said to my PhD students that I was surprised by how I had to ACTIVELY monitor my decisions and actions to make sure I was staying true to my own set of ethics.",

I worked at an R1 for my thesis work and did some computational work beside my experimental work while recovering from a broken arm.  I was taking a class taught by my PI\u2019s collaborator and he went off on me about the computational work because of how sloppy it was, but I told him my PI was telling me to do it this way (and she was notorious for retaliating against students who questioned her).  His response? He told me I should do it anyway, and risk losing my job.  Sounds great right?  Well, when I brought it up at the next meeting he was at, he just sat there quietly and refused to bring up any of his objections to the research.  And this was a pretty common game for him - he\u2019d chide graduate students for not standing up to their PIs but wasn\u2019t going to stand up to the PIs himself, and surely wasn\u2019t going to back the students.  The apologists will say he had politics to worry about but even with tenure his attitude didn\u2019t change.  And he kept collaborating even though it came out she had a student fake most of his thesis and she didn\u2019t pull the papers, which probably had a lot to do with her bankrolling his graduate students.  After 4 years of that nonsense I sent a packet of documents to the DOE and had my PI charged with grant misappropriation, then transferred to another institution to finish up my work. She\u2019s still at the university despite loosing $500k to the feds, and the collaborator is still enjoying tenure despite being part of the grant and its many questionable activities.  \n\nSo to address your question, yes it happens a lot and the publish or perish mentality of academia drives it. PIs want to publish and tend to look away from even obvious flaws if it means supporting the narrative of a grant or research program.  The graduate students are at the mercy of their PIs and have little recourse if their PI is pressuring them into compromising their integrity, which I think drives a fair share of it. You can look at it two ways.  One: it\u2019s rampant so it doesn\u2019t matter what you do, so just fake it so you make it.  Two; it\u2019s so rampant so it doesn\u2019t matter what you do, so you should keep yourself clean and do the right thing. I\u2019d personally advocate for the latter - it\u2019s a real problem with higher education and there\u2019s no sense in you contributing to the problem, plus you never know who\u2019s documenting the behavior.",

Your lab mates are publishing crap.  What kind of journals are they getting into?  Focus on doing better work, even if it takes longer, and getting into higher impact journals.",

      "text": "It's weird that you expect to have a publication after starting the PhD just one year ago, and that you think you're failing your PhD because you don't have one. Is new grad students pumping out pubs the moment they matriculate normal in your field? Is somebody of any rank taking a pub from start to finish in 365 days normal? Where I'm at, even people with completed doctorates will take several years to gather and clean the data, design the model, test, tweak, write the paper, plus 6+ months of journal submissions and peer review. To me your expectations seem unrealistic.",

I\u2019m crossing my fingers for you to keep on keeping on! I am currently trying to figure out a good program myself, and can respect the hard work it takes just to get in... So thinking some bully may take your hard work away from you... I hope he doesn\u2019t . I hope you find a way to fight the good fight and maybe you can apply to change advisors or something!Good luck, and I hope you are able to have the chance you worked hard for to get.",
