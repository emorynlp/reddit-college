  "text": "I am writing my thesis and I have adopted IEEE standar where the reference to the end like this: \\[1\\]. Lets say I want to refer to the author's name before that e.g. Doe did that \\[1\\]. But the paper is Doe et al. Should I go like \"Doe and his team did that \\[1\\]\" or \"Doe did that \\[1\\]\". An important thing to methion is when I have 2 papers and one paper's team includes the author of the other. e.g. Paper 1 Doe and Joe and paper 2 has just doe.",

For example, \"The structure of DNA is primarily a left-handed double-helix [1] and also exists more rarely in other forms [2-4].\" This makes the writing flow better, avoids repetition of so-and-so did this or a study found that, and is easier to write.",
