  "title:": "Do you trust peer review or do you double check the data analysis of publications?",
  "text": "I'm in a social science field in which there is a wide variety of data analysis.  I personally have not had to do anything more rigorous than correlations.  That is not true for some of my colleagues, but it is generally true for a large part of my field. Recently, I've seen a lot of conspiracy theorists saying \"do your research,\" which usually means watching a random video online.  In response, I've seen what are presumably researchers or academics giving people examples of legitimate forms of research. It ranges from fairly easy things, such as looking up the funding and affiliations of the PIs research, to very rigorous statistic analysis, such as finding a random sample of the literature and redoing the statistical analysis.  Are scientists actually doing this with their own literature reviews?  Is it common or uncommon in your field? I don't know of anybody in my field (who doesn't actually publish about methods) who does this. Some of it has to do with the lack of statistical analysis in a lot of the work in our field, but I think to some extent there is a large trust of peer review.  Is that true in other fields?",

      "text": "I don't totally understand the conspiracy theory part of your question, but in general, I trust that any individual paper has been reviewed to be at least reasonable based on the data presented. That doesn't mean I think the things everything paper says is reproducible, accurate, or should be trusted. I'm in the chemistry field and I have a large dose of skepticism of papers until I've tried to reproduce it. This is especially true for reproducing the way people make molecules (which is pretty poorly reported often). However, peer-review is the best thing we have and I do trust it to eventually weedout mistakes and dishonesty over many years of multiple papers/people reporting on the same topic.",

If someone has the ability to review a peer reviewed paper and properly check an analysis they also have the ability to peer review the evidence for a conspiracy theory, thereby presumably resulting in them not believing the conspiracy? \n\nWhen conspiracy theorists say \"research\" they mean trawl Google to find articles that support their belief and discard or twist evidence that doesn't suit. Conspiracy theories can't be disproven to believers because to them everything is evidence either of the conspiracy or the attempt to cover it up.",

I keep seeing memes where people explain extremely rigorous research methods which I just don't think other academics are doing on a regular basis.  The conspiracy theorists don't know what they're talking about, but I think that there are easier, more accessible, ways non-academics can find valid information.",

                  "text": "I think you have a genuine point here - my area of research is fairly niche and the published, peer-reviewed research on it tends to be OK but not as rigorous as I would like. \n\nSo, yes, it's all gone through the peer-review process, and, no, they haven't done anything wrong but at the same time there is reason to be critical of some of the choices they made when collecting and analyzing their research. And that's healthy! It's normal and good to subject sources to critical evaluation.\n\nHowever, I can see why academics are sticking to clearer examples of \"good\" research when trying to communicate to people who don't read peer-reviewed research on a daily basis. Starting out by explaining double-blinded, randomized controlled trials is better than nitpicking sampling methods or debating the pros and cons of different statistical analyses with an audience that doesn't care about Cronbach's alpha",

They aren't using reason to come to their position, so you cannot reason them out of it. You have to address and understand the emotions, fears and anger that underpin these views.",

But they always seem to recommend really aggressive double checking of the research in their literature reviews and I was just wondering how often people in other fields do a systemic review of the data analysis behind the literature they're citing. For me, these posts seemed to be telling people about how to double check the science behind the literature when I wasn't sure scientists in other fields were doing this on a regular basis.

                          "text": "Firstly, when people talk about checking the science with a lay audience I don't think they really mean do a full peer review of each paper. Rather they mean learn to recognise reputable sources, understand what makes something scientific versus pseudoscience and what makes a body of evidence and scientific consensus. Most research papers focus on minutiae while conspiracy theories are about fundamental principles - does 5G trigger activation of a virus, does covid exist etc.   Most undergraduates can't peer review a paper in their own discipline why would a conspiracy theorist be able to provide a peer review level analysis across multiple topics? \n\nI think researchers do check data and analyses quite often. Not with every paper, but firstly their expertise means that just reading a paper will give them some sense of whether the findings hold up. Then, if they're particularly interested they will go more in depth into the findings. Where I work we make all of our data openly available and we have hundreds of downloads every year, so people definitely do scrutinise our data and build on it.",

Within the field, there is also a lot of single case stuff, small-n studies, and convenience sample surveys. Some of these studies are shaky but important. There\u2019s also a lot of contradictory findings in my field, so there\u2019s value in applying prior methods to new cases, data sets, or settings. There\u2019s also value in unpacking assumptions in methods and revisiting those (for example, a 1986 study segmented data in one way and said \u201cwe wish we could do it this other, better way but we don\u2019t have the computing power\u201d but everyone since then has just duplicated this sub-optimal segmentation because it\u2019s what was published.)\n\nPeer review helps establish a baseline level of trust. But, I tend to look at the bibliography (did they cite the people I would expect for this topic?) data (are they transparent about their data? Can the data answer the questions they say it does?) and methods sections (is there enough information to replicate if I wanted to? Are the methods appropriate to the data? Do the methods answer the questions they say it does?). If these all line up, then I\u2019m pretty trusting. If they don\u2019t, then I start looking at things more carefully (if I need to use the paper) or just ignore it and move on (if the paper isn\u2019t necessary).",
