  "text": "I'm a postdoc who has never made investments in equipment for conferences. I only have my very heavy laptop, my normal work backpack, etc. I tend to scribble furiously in a notebook during talks and, of course, never end up transcribing these. I'm finally thinking of investing in some lighter / more convenient gear so that I can be more effective at taking notes, and not be literally weighed down by dragging everything around.\n\nWhat pieces of your conference gear have proved to be most helpful and why?",

      "text": "I have a tablet - specifically a iPad Pro with the accompanying pen, but any tablet+writable stylus would work for me. \n\nI disagree that you need to furiously take notes, even with publishing lag. You need just enough notes to understand the topic when you review later but you most importantly need their (correctly spelled) name, organization, and, if at all possible, their contact information. You then  email them, tell them you loved the talk, would they be willing to share their abstract/slides or have a short meeting. \nYour hastily written notes will never encompass what you can learn by asking them to chat with you for 20 mins. \n\nThe main reason for my tablet is that a lot of my research is image based so \u201cshow rather than tell\u201d is useful. Second is if I get to brainstorming or meeting a group of people, it\u2019s super easy to have people input their own contact info.",

      "text": "I'm involved biomedical field (immunology, microbiology) so take this for what you will.  I agree with u/thegreenaquarium, conferences are a place to catch up with people and discuss things casually over wine or beer.  Conferences are very useful and a lot gets done, but it's rarely through the formal presentations.  (in person) Conferences are a tremendous catalyst for collaborations.  Conferences are also a time to put a face to a voice.  Sometimes I'll talk with a person for a year or two before meeting them.  The dynamics of future interactions will almost always change to be less formal (and sometimes more productive) once there is that opportunity to sit down and chat at a meeting over a meal, drink, or event/outing.  That seems to have changed somewhat with the explosion of zoom, where previously conversations were all by phone.\n\nAfter awhile you start to hear the same talks over and over again (or the presentations are regurgitations of already published papers), so I don't find it useful to take detailed notes.   \n Depends on the conference - big association meetings are much less exciting than the smaller Keystone or Gordon conferences, which tends to have more unpublished data and opportunities for discussions.  At the larger meetings, I quite often skip sessions at the larger association meetings in favor of a drink and conversation with a colleague.   I tend to just note points of interest (e.g., X has access to this resource, Y is moving in a new direction, surprisingly data Z) or thoughts.  I spend more of my time after the day's event writing a recap of interesting points.  Sometimes there will be a really interesting talk and I find myself writing more notes than usual, though often with the thought of talking with the speaker later to discuss (over dinner at the meeting or by phone after the meeting) or communicating key points to colleagues back home.  As a graduate student, conferences are great for meeting PIs and seeing if they'd be someone you'd want to work with as a post-doc.  As a post-doc, use the time to have your PI introduce you to people - your goal is to build that name/face recognition for when you apply for positions.  The science presented is important, but as a post-doc you should use this time to network.\n\nI used to take a notebook, but found I very rarely referred to it a week after the conference.  I actually found it more useful to take notes in the program, which I could throw in a drawer and refer to later.  Conferences programs are easier to remember and find than a notepad.\n\nNow I take notes in OneNote on my iPad, but I also rarely look at the notes for the sake of reviewing the notes.  OneNote does allow me to easily search across my notes to review before a scheduled call or meeting with a PI, or look things up if I'm in a meeting and think \"didn't X talk about this last year\".  For the meeting I usually just take a bag, a pad of paper, pencil, iPad, phone, and the meeting booklet.",

I'll even do it in front of the person, and they usually wind up doing the same on the back of my card. That way when you find it six months later you'll remember why you cared enough to not just 'accidentally' leave that on the night stand of your hotel room when you check out. \n\nGranola bars are also nice for if you have a slight hangover and don't have time to wait in line for food prior to heading out in the morning, if your session is running way too long and you can't get food until late, or you're with a few people going to get food, but know the wait is going to be a long time.

      "text": "Pre-covid I would travel to international conferences annually to network and see what was going on in the field. It was great to introduce myself to names I recognised in the papers I cite, and discuss my own work as well as their current projects.\n\nI would \\*always\\* download/print the papers presented if they were made available beforehand, so note-taking wasn't super necessary. I put those pre-printed papers into a folder to annotate during the relevant presentation with the verbal notes added by the authors. \n\nRegardless, the list of gear I found really useful includes;\n\n* *Empty notebook and pens.* I don't take detailed notes but I always want to write SOMETHING down. No clue why, but conferences just inspire and motivate me so much I'm often scribbling research ideas, story ideas, and tips from professors down whenever I can.\n* *The pre-printed papers/slides in a folder*. By pre-reading as much as I can, I can ask intelligent questions and really get into the presentation. I select the sessions I attend carefully to make sure the information is relevant and interesting, and read up on the references supplied to familiarise myself with the author's citations. Because I'm an expert in my little niche field, some of my questions might also include 'have you considered X theory?' and 'what was the motivation to select X scope?'. I'm always learning things, and love the opportunity to open a door for others as well.\n* *Phone, battery powerbank* \\- charging space is premium at conferences and I want to be able to google things. Plus, you are always the hero if you show up with a spare wall charger and cable and offer a foreign academic to borrow it for an hour.\n* *Comfortable but professional-looking outfits*. First impressions matter! I found a great pair of elastic-waistband pants that look exactly like suit trousers and they're honestly the best.\n* *USB* \\- if I'm presenting, I want my work backed up in case the pre-conference upload submission didn't work. It's kept in a plastic snap-lock bag in case I get caught in the rain.\n* *Map of the city I visited.* Let's be honest, some conferences have dead space. I'm not fascinated by every single topic and sometimes I want to explore the foreign place I landed, so I skip out and try a local cafe or something instead of aimlessly milling about during the designated lunch breaks. Bonus if you can tout a cool place you found to other attendees as some of them stay a week or so after the conference ends.\n* *Clear the schedule.* I plan ABSOLUTELY NOTHING during conference evenings, as I have made far too many valuable connections over impromptu dinners. My thesis examiners and future colleagues were cemented with handshakes over burgers in Portugal, no joke. While I'm not a huge fan of academic drinking culture, it admittedly has its perks.\n* *Business cards, a business-card folder.* I have a little display folder with pockets specifically shaped for business cards that I picked up at one of those japanese stationery shops. I always keep spare business cards in my wallet just in case, but if I'm ever offered a business card by another I either put it in a special pocket of my wallet, or I whip out the 'special business card book' and add it to the collection. It's like collecting pokemon cards, and academics in the Asia-Pacific are super impressed that I took the effort to treat their cards properly. I usually follow up with an email at the end of the conference to let them know I bothered to read their business card, and thank them for the opportunity to connect.  \n* *Mints.* The free coffee can make it difficult to talk to people afterwards. \n* *Paracetemol.* See: Headaches and crowded spaces.\n* Other sundries like a comb, lip balm, hand sanitizer, glasses wipes, and a novel to read if you arrive at the conference too early.\n\nEverything I take with me, physically, usually fits inside a small satchel - and some are often provided by the conference organizers anyway. So I'm happy to tote about the official bag with the dinky little souvenirs that go inside, and whip out whatever I need between socializing and note-taking. \n\nGood luck for your next conference!",
