  "text": "Hey y'all! I'm up on the job market and I have a practice job talk at a colloquium coming up. Although it's practice, it's my first job talk, so I still want to look the part and be fully prepared for the real thing. I was looking at men's fashion, but I don't know what's appropriate or how formal this needs to be. To be upfront, I am not a suit and tie person at all. However, I do love blazers, shoes, and V-necks. Not sure if I can wear a V-neck under a blazer for a job talk/interview though. In any case, I was thinking one of the three looks below might suffice, and I wanted some opinions and pointers. Field is Education, if that matters. Thanks in advance.\n\n[https://www.zara.com/us/en/birdseye-suit-jacket-p01564320.html?v1=137549745&v2=1886035](https://www.zara.com/us/en/birdseye-suit-jacket-p01564320.html?v1=137549745&v2=1886035)\n\n[https://tinyurl.com/jobtalkgo](https://tinyurl.com/jobtalkgo)\n\n[https://tinyurl.com/jobtalkgo2](https://tinyurl.com/jobtalkgo2) (was also thinking something like this minus the tie)\n\nTips? Are all of these acceptable?",

      "text": "Look #1 - the V neck t-shirt is far too casual for a job talk.  You need to replace it with a proper dress shirt.\n\nLook #2 - appropriate for teaching at a business school. You could get away with this for a job talk if you are a tenured business professor. If you are untenured, you would certainly want to add a tie.\n\nLook #3 - appropriate for teaching undergrads in the liberal arts. Too casual for any job talk (pants are too light).\n\nStop making this complicated. Male job talk attire is a navy or charcoal colored suit, white or blue dress shirt, and an appropriately contrasting tie. You say it's only practice, but you should practice how you're going to perform.\n\nWhy anyone would want to risk not getting the job because they appeared too casual is beyond me.\n\nPS. every male Dean or Associate Dean I've met wears a tie to work at least some of the time (maybe not on Fridays). If you are interviewing, you'll probably meet one of these people, and you wouldn't want to be dressed less formally than them for an interview, would you?\n\nEdited to add: I've been at the hiring committee meeting where someone says they felt the candidate did not take the interview seriously enough, and this was driven at least in part by the candidate's attire.",

      "text": "I think the Zara look shows style and professionalism (and looks comfortable), whereas the second blue suit look doesn\u2019t hit right for an academic setting (too tight?). The third look is great but not formal enough for a job talk. I like the Zara suit but with a dress shirt instead (I\u2019d recommend wearing a tie too; best to be a bit more formal than usual because it sends the message that you understand that the occasion is important). Make sure whatever you wear is comfortable and shows that you put effort into dressing for the occasion.",

          "text": "Thank you for checking those links out! I really like that Zara look as well. But let me get this straight -- I can't have the exact same (or similar) look as this guy? I guess what I'm saying is, I prefer the V-neck he's wearing instead of a dress shirt. Is it a little too unprofessional for a job talk if I'm not wearing a dress shirt and a tie?",

              "text": "I\u2019m in the Humanities (and am an artist, and I appreciate fashion/style!), if that helps, and I think at least a dress shirt (tie optional) would be ideal for a job talk. Wear the v neck once you have the job. I agree, the look on the model is excellent! If the school/department interviewing you is very casual, you do you, but for a job talk I think it\u2019s best to be more formal, especially in case there are very traditional faculty members on the committee.",

                  "text": "Thanks for the advice! You know what, that is actually a good point about traditional faculty members... It's just a practice job talk, but the faculty members here are much older than I am and have been in academia for a very long time. A dress shirt is probably a safe bet...I have an appreciation for fashion as well! Is it ok if I PM you with a link to a suit or shirt, etc.?",

      "text": "This really depends on the field. I\u2019m not in education, so I\u2019m not too sure. Generally, professional schools (e.g. business, law) lean towards traditional suit and tie. More creative fields, art, architecture, music, would probably frown on a navy suit and tie. Other disciplines are somewhere in between. Look at your professors and try to dress a little more formal for the interview",
