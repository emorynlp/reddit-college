  "text": "I submitted my PhD thesis ten days ago. This was followed by a couple of days of moving house, then travelling to the North (UK) for my partner\u2019s birthday and finally back to my parents\u2019 home on Monday.\n\nI feel awful, I didn\u2019t really sleep the first few days, I feel so up and down. I\u2019m having to sleep in the middle of the day, which I never do. I feel so exhausted I can\u2019t even bring myself to go for a run, and I\u2019ve had all of this weird muscle pain and headaches.\n\nSome colleagues have said this is normal but I didn\u2019t expect to feel... this bad? I feel so guilty for being lazy and mooching round the house but I barely have the energy to go outside at the moment. Does it get better? How do you learn to relax when that\u2019s something I\u2019ve never really allowed myself to do?",

And then my body degenerates, my immune system disappears, my sleep cycle alternates between insomnia and narcolepsy, and I crave and binge on food with terrible digestive consequences.\n\nTake a week. Consciously and actively relax. Do happy things, do quiet things, be kind to yourself. \n\nFor me, I get my sleep fixed first. And then everything works itself out.",

Do the grocery shopping, some yardwork, etc. Or if you miss the intellectual connections, wander the stacks of the closest library...grab a few books from a section you're unfamiliar with and just skim. (My favorites are books that are illustrated catalogs of things...\"Perennials of North America\" kind of stuff. It starts off mindless and then you get sucked into the details of someone else's passion.) Reading poetry is another good one; I go with brilliant poets who use plain speech, like Jack Gilbert: https://www.amazon.com/Refusing-Heaven-Jack-Gilbert/dp/037571085X",

I think you're feeling the effects of a let down, a very anti-climactic let down, and are now learning how to be with yourself and in your head, sans dissertation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTotally normal. And, I would try to push yourself a bit to re-define yourself outside of academia. Perhaps try to find the things that you once upon a time enjoyed. For me, post dissertation, I tried baking again and it's the thing I return to when I know I need to separate myself from all the manuscript writing. Don't let your work define you, YOU define you.",

From a follower (just do the work) to a leader (initiate the work). We're on our own! It's enough to induce a mid-life crisis, regardless of our age.\n\nI'm in psychology, so a bit different than finance. But I felt incredibly overwhelmed and anxious when I realized that I was working under my own license, and had nobody to count on anymore. It was safe and secure to know I could fall back on past supervisors or bosses. That the buck did not stop with me. And then, on my own,there were so many decisions and options, all of them with a glaring warning sign of \"Don't F- up.\"\n\nYou are about to get real intimate with yourself. You'll get to know your brain when it's silent, peaceful, and is in a state of just being. That's cool in theory, and scary in practice. Hang in there, I promise it gets easier. If it's one thing I've learned, it's that life is a series of \"leveling up.\" You've beat the thesis level, now you're off to the \"adulting in the professional world 101\" level. You'll prosper, I'm confident. And just when you think you've mastered that...life will throw something else. But hey, that's what communities, friends, and support is for, right?",
