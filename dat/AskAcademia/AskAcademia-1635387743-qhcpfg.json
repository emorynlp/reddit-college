  "text": "Yeah, there were many flaws in my decision-making process over the past 6-8 months and I know I screwed up. I should've never gone the post-doc route, but there were reasons.\n\nI started a post-doc in the fall. I moved from NYC to a midwestern campus (mistake 1). Right before the move, but after I had accepted the offer, I started noticing some concerns about my supervisor, but I thought I had my own funding in the form of a fellowship, so it wouldn't be so bad (mistake 2). \n\nBut probably the biggest thing was that I realized that I had been suppressing certain emotional issues by distracting myself with work and that's why I wanted to stay in academia. I realize this now after the past 4 months of working with a very proficient therapist. To be precise, I realized I was trans, and given the levels of trans-acceptance in STEM academia (not too great), I really don't see the point of staying in academia, combined with the previous realization.\n\nI'm in CS, and I have decently marketable skills. I \\*should\\* be able to find a decent job. But I don't know how to navigate this situation. I have my own funding, so it shouldn't be like I get fired if my supervisor finds out I'm interviewing (yeah, he'd likely do that if he knew). But I also don't want to be in a very negative environment while I hunt for jobs, and I do recognize that I am causing him inconvenience by leaving (but I'm not going to stay in a career I'm not interested in just to avoid causing him an inconvenience). \n\nShould I inform him of my decision? Should I just walk into his office one day and tell him hey dude, I'm leaving next week? I have checked with my fellowship people that I can leave before the end without any penalty, so there's that. Would industry people wonder why I'm leaving this early into the postdoc? \n\nHas anyone left a postdoc for industry this early into their stint? I mean, I'd likely take more than a couple months to find a job though.",

      "text": "Leaving a postdoc early for a job happens all the time. You should in no way feel guilty about it. What is important for your advisor is that you are getting your research done as they are paying you for that. The only time I've heard of profs getting annoyed at the job-hunting postdoc is when the postdoc spent all their time looking for jobs and neglected their work.\n\nYou should not walk in and say you're leaving next week! They will need enough notice to plan, such as to hire a new postdoc to do the project. You may need to negotiate with your new employer to not start immediately, but it should work out.\n\nYou said you thought your advisor would fire you if they knew you were interviewing - are you sure? That is a bad sign about this postdoc position if that's really the case.\n\nGood luck on your interviews.",

          "text": "Thanks! \n\nThe whole walking in and telling him I'm quitting next week was a hyperbole. I'm definitely not doing that and I don't want to either. I was trying to illustrate how lost I'm feeling about the \"protocol\" here.\n\nAnd yeah it really is likely that he'd fire me if he was paying me. He has funding issues so it's not likely that he'll be able to hire another postdoc, which made it great that I had my own funding.",

              "text": "You owe your PI nothing. It\u2019s insane how people still get told they have an obligation to finish their research. No you do not. Tell the PI as soon as possible that he should start looking for a replacement and do not be a sick about it , meaning keep on working until your new contract starts. However if there is nothing written in your contract there is 0 reason to \u201cstart the new job later to finish your research\u201d you look for notice period give final notice you take your hat and walk out of the door!",
