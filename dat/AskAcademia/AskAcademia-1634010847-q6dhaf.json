  "text": "hi there, i\u2019m a 1L law student on a full ride (scholly unconditional luckily?) who is behind 7 weeks into the semester\u2026 im confident or at least hopeful i can catch up in most of my classes.  \n\nexcept for legal writing (2 credits), & a \u201cprep\u201d class (1 credit) which are concerning me\u2026  \n\nwhat happened: moved in with my BF of 4 years in august. things changed, fast. won\u2019t get into all of it but he started physically abusing me for abt a month until i finally left and moved out.  \n\nmy parents don\u2019t live far from school- i would have stayed there/ commuted but my mom had breakthrough covid. stayed w friends for a little but i do have my own apartment now and i\u2019m mostly settled!!  \n\nit has been weeks now since i left him, (i have a therapist, my parents know etc) and i am getting back on my feet & feel ready to tackle the rest of the semester. it has just been so draining. emotionally obviously, but moving in general, feeling fearful, crying, trying to figure out school?? i am already prone to mental illness and this made me spiral.   \n\ni want to explain to my 2 professors (who have emailed me about late assignments) but not sure how to respond. \n\nwhat do i tell them? is that burdensome? (i\u2019d like to email them and follow up by stopping  by at office hours)",

      "text": "You need to contact the dean of students, or your school's equivilent, might be called Student Affairs or something like that. You do not need to explain all your sensitive things to individual professors and throw yourself on their mercy and opinions of your worthiness for help, the dean of students will help you. That office will walk you through your options, which might be working with professors to catch up, might be taking an Incomplete on your classes this semester, might be withdrawal. Law school is Very Different so I'd let them advise you. Any competent professor would redirect you to the dean of students for emergency services if you contacted them with your story. (But of course, many are incompetent.) \n\nThis is a mandatory reporting situation for any school staff (other than the counseling center) so it could get messy. However most schools have legal aid for students (my school helps domestic violence or stalking victims file no-contact orders, etc.) which could help you. \n\nIt's a week day - contact them today!! After you contact them, email your professors telling them that you've had some personal issues this semester and you're working with the dean of students (or your school's term) to figure out your next steps, and you'll be in touch in a few days. I'm sure they're worried about you, and this will tell them that you're alive and taking the right steps.",

      "text": "In general, I prefer students keep their private lives to themselves. I am not trained to assess or respond to these things, and you should not have to expose them to get accommodations. For your specific circumstance, I think it is also a mandatory title ix report. (I'm not sure, but I'd definitely be checking if a student disclosed this to me.) That's not a reason to not tell them - but you should know the policy just in case.\n\nYou might prefer to go through your school's counseling center (most staff not mandatory reporters). But more importantly, they can help coordinate with advisors for what you need across the school. There are systems in place to help students who fall behind for things like this - instead of the burden being on you to initiate and juggle the process for multiple classes. You'll also be plugged into any possible fallbacks, in case you cannot catch up in some classes.",
