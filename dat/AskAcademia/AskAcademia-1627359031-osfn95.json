  "text": "I graduated from my undergrad in Computer Science last year, post which I joined as a resident in a Research team in one of the top tech companies. At the end of my first year as a resident, my team has offered me a **Associate Researcher** position in the team. They believe that in the next 4 years in the position, subjective to my performance, I will be able to \"graduate\" to a Researcher position. While the offer looks promising, I have a few reservations :\n\n1. How much a degree matter in an Industrial Research career? While I like the firm I am working in currently, I may want to switch to some other company in the future.\n2. Will not having a PhD degree affect my chances of a promotion?\n3. Will it be possible for me to move to Academia later with my research experience in an industrial lab?\n\nA few clarifications regarding the Associate Researcher position:\n\n1. It is a position below the Regular Researcher position.\n2. According to job description, I will and can do independent research.\n3. I am free to switch teams/projects according to my interests.",

      "text": "> How much a degree matter in an Industrial Research career? While I like the firm I am working in currently, I may want to switch to some other company in the future.\n\nIt depends on the company, and the nature of the job.  Some positions will strictly require a graduate degree, others won't.  It probably depends on how cutting-edge and novel the research is.  You'll have to find an answer for yourself by reading a lot of job ads and noting the education requirements for the positions you find most interesting.\n\n\n> Will not having a PhD degree affect my chances of a promotion?\n\nAgain, it depends.  Your company might not care.  Others will.  You can get an answer by looking at people in higher levels than you (both internally and externally) and seeing what degrees they have.  You can look at online bios, linkedin, etc to get this information.\n\n\n> Will it be possible for me to move to Academia later with my research experience in an industrial lab?\n\nWhat do you mean by \"move to Academia\"?  If you mean you want to use this experience to increase your chances of getting into grad school, or of being hired as a junior research assistant, then yes, this will help.\n\nIf you mean you want to be a tenure-track research professor based on this job, then no.  Getting a research-oriented faculty position is incredibly competitive even for people with PhDs and postdocs from top institutes.  You may be able to get a teaching post at an undergraduate-focussed institution after several years or a decade, if you can demonstrate some skills/experience in teaching or teaching-related tasks.",

      "text": "No idea about degrees needed for industrial research career. For academia, certainly you won't be able to land pure academic positions at a high level without the degree, its possible to work research associate jobs at unis with just undergrad, but if you're thinking researcher or prof then wouldn't be possible without the degrees.  I can't imagine not having a phd wouldn't affect promotions at least minimally, but I also think that could easily be overcome by your research record (depending how open minded the place is).",

      "text": "Depends is the honest answer. The best course of action, and what I recommend to my students, is to look at the CVs (or LinkedIns) of those who are in the sort of jobs you want to be doing in 20-30 years. You may not need a graduate degree now but you may eventually and grad school is usually easier the younger you are (fewer financial responsibilities, more tolerance for housemates or tiny apartments, no spouse or kids etc). Maybe this company is different, but even if they are that may mean you are stuck. Maybe your experience will eventually compensate for lack of formal qualifications but computer based application sorting is making box ticking even more important, when I worked in the private sector I only looked at the applications that hadn't been pre rejected by the computer.",

      "text": "I always say you're only as good as the last thing you did and by that I mean that the last thing you did tends to overshadow everything else. So if you go into industry without a graduate degree and you end up being highly successful, odds are the next employer, be that industrial or academic, will focus on that rather than your degrees or lack thereof. However, if you go into industry and have an undistinguished run, the lack of degrees might become an issue as you compete against more successful candidates. However, finances aside, it's not a huge thing to go back a get a master's full time or part time. Lots of people do it and frankly this job sounds really great. If you're enjoying it or you think you'll enjoy it that's the best path to success. Doing what other people think we should do to be successful rather than what you want and enjoy is the route to dissatisfaction and failure.",

      "text": "Like others are saying, a lot of this will be - it depends. In my area of computer science, publishing research papers can also provide the evidence of research capability that a PhD degree typically provides, and would be crucial for moving to a research position in a different industrial lab. A research professor in academia would require a PhD though.",
