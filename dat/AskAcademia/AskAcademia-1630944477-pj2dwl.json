  "title:": "MA and PhD in Communication: about the future",
  "text": "Hello everyone, I am going to get a Master's degree in Communication/Journalism. I hope I'll be able to learn the subject deeper and go for a PhD. \n\nThe topics I am interested in are:\n1) ethical issues in Marketing/Advertising: how those who work in this field see moral problems of Marketing/how do companies find a line between truth, effectiveness of advertisement and business development\n2) the power of mass media: which linguistic and rhetoric instruments they use to correct people's opinion.\n\nI've got an experience in Journalism (News Editing) and Social Media, but I want to explore it theoretically, to check some hypotheses and use the results in order to help mass media or business companies to reach their goals. At the same time I am not sure if I need to continue academic career, to work in uni, to teach students etc. \n\nMy questions are:\n1) Are these questions actual for Communication science? i checked researchgate, students' theses in universities I want to study in, but maybe there are people who study related topics here. \n2) Is my goal real? Maybe I am too presumptuous and it is unnecessary to get a PhD if I am not going to teach students.  And there are a lot of people who say pursuing PhD in Communication is a waste of time, it's better to work in mass media/PR/SMM etc. \n\nThanks in advance!",

              "text": "Now I want to go into academia to write a research project and maybe to use it to write a book for masses, because I guess I am not a person who can work only on academic research papers. I see a PhD project as an instrument to deepen the knowledge and then to move to non-academic job, for example, to become an observer/columnist. I noticed that journalists without PhD (or even Bachelor Degree) can become observers, work experience is more important than education in this case. But their knowledge is often superficial (not because they are bad, they often don't have enough time to read more, to focus on problem and to prepare an article for weeks, it's too slow for average mass media). \n\nFor example, as a person who learned a lot about antivaxxers, you are (theoretically) able to understand and explain who are they, why are they afraid of vaccines, so you can 1) write articles for mass media to educate people in some aspects 2) help biopharmaceutical companies/government to promote vaccines thoughtfully and use different strategies of promotion in social media. \n\nHowever, not sure if getting PhD is an appropriate way to improve my background in some topics Communication/Journalism, and work experience in mass media is still better. \n\nP.S. Your topic is quite interesting!",

So you have four paths:\n\n1. (no PhD) become a working traditional journalist, though it would take a while to establish a beat where you could explore your interest; \n\n2. (no PhD) become a working independent journalist, where you could work on projects that interest you, though it's harder to establish an audience and credibility; \n\n3. get a PhD and hope for a tenure track position;\n\n4. Get a PhD and work on research independently/shop for a publisher.",

Although not necessarily out of working as a journalist. Just make it clear you'll work for the pennies journalists make.\n\nComms jobs have a different attitude than journalism jobs and don't really appreciate experience, wisdom or education. And they certainly won't pay for it. They'll just trash your resume. Journalism jobs will at least give you an opportunity.",

      "text": "A lot of social sciences investigate the same phenomena but just apply a discipline specific theory. This sounds like one of those cases to be fair. Or you can take an inter-disciplinary approach and poach ideas from another one. Only have to look at the study of \"the internet\" or \"social media\" to see that.\n\ni.e. communications investigating mass media but using some linguistic/psychological theory, but mainly situations themselves in the extant communications literature. Or ethical issues in marketing/advertising and stealing insights from business studies or computer science on the big data/ML use in advertising.\n\nPhDs are good if you want a career in academia or if you're neurotically interested in your research area. Usually an MA is more than enough for industry.",
