  "title:": "When do you know it's time to leave? Return from parental leave",
  "text": "I've just come back from mat leave, and I think like with any life changing event (having a baby, death in the family etc. etc.), it makes you view the world in an entirely different light. \n\nI've come back part time which was an excellent decision. But I dread my working days. I'm getting emails about projects that need to be done NOW for some reason. And I'm sitting here thinking, what's the point? How is this work helping people in the community? Why is everything due NOW? Is this just academics keeping busy for the sake of keeping busy?\n\nFor context I did my phd in 3 years and published a bunch of papers, and could count on my hand how many times I worked outside of office hours in that time. So being 'busy' to me doesn't equal 'productive'.  I'm also in Australia so we get paid pretty well and have generous mat leave.\n\nAnyway, I started a business while I was a mat leave, but its going to be years before it's profitable. I'm actually pregnant now with our second baby so will be going back on mat leave in about 7 months so feel like I should just stick it out. I ask my husband about 5 times a day if I can quit though lol. \n\nIs it just the transition back from maternity leave? Or is it something else?! I don't want to waste my life being sucked in to being stressed out about meaningless projects. I don't know if my ramblings make any sense. But I'm sure I'm not the only one!\n\nAny other academics who are parents who had a bit of a change of heart after having a baby?",

          "text": "Thank you for your perspective! Yeah, I look at my supervisor and the other senior academics and I really don't want to be like them. They are all stressed, doing long hours of work, and doing work that I don't particularly find exciting. I guess it doesn't mean I have to be like them necessarily, but I think its easy to get sucked in to get that next big grant. The business that I'm building is really exciting though and I'd love to rely less on an employer over time.",

Initially I thought I'd become a PI who does lots of outside activities but in the end I realised I was more motivated by the other stuff than being a PI and have built a career doing that while remaining in the academic sector.
