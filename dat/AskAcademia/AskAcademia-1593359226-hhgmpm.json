In the U.S. a lot of what they are paying for is the \"college experience\" - not much of that if your sitting alone in your childhood bedroom staring at a computer screen. Whereas, if students wait a year, then the money they spend will be more worth it (assuming in one year in person classes will resume).\n\nFor the small private universities/colleges, a year of much lower income (because far less enrolled students, less tuition, kids not in dorms so no revenue from there, lost fees from sports centers & health centers, and on and on) will be more than they can sustain. \n\nSo better to pull wool over new students' eyes for the time being, make them think everything will be on campus from at least August until late November - even though chances are that will all be \"surprisingly\" shut down in late September or early October - but by then the university will have more than just a money deposit, they'll have that fat tuition, and the students and their eill families have paid so much non-refundable tuition they'll need to stick it out for the year.",

Most of the very highest faculty  salaries are people in the law, medical, and business and economics departments.\n\nYou are living in a bubble if you think that there aren't large numbers of faculty (just faculty) earning $200k+ at any major US research university. Think about computer science profs at top unis, FFS.\n\n(Edit: I will say that by 'faculty' I mean tenured and TT faculty.)\n\n> Regardless, they should be focusing on admin cuts before grad students making 25k.\n\nCutting back on recruiting incoming grad students is a sensible move. Training people for jobs that no longer exist is getting borderline unethical.",
