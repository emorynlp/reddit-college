Of course we said yes, and they got him a second entree. When we returned to the school I found out that he had been rude to the secretaries.

Both the candidate and spouse were in the same field and did research on essentially the same thing; it would have meant appointing them both to our department. Imagine being in a Zoology Department and being asked to hire two people who study the wing structure of the Peruvian pelican (not the case, just an example!). \n\nWe didn\u2019t want to hire two people who studied exactly the same thing and there was also the problem that the spouse had an unimpressive CV and wouldn\u2019t have even made our long list. Sounds like an easy pass, you might think, but we were having a hard time as the candidate was really, really good (a superstar in her field) and we really, really wanted her. \n\nSo, we ended up offering the spouse a 3 year guaranteed adjunct position. They turned this down, saying they would only accept a TT position for the spouse and emphasized that he had a job offer from a very prestigious university (in another country) and that we would be lucky to hire them both.  Having quite a few friends in that other university, I asked about the supposed job offer and discovered it didn\u2019t exist. That was the final straw - we ended negotiations and rescinded the offer. Even if you\u2019re a superstar candidate, pull a stunt like that and you\u2019ll be shown the door pretty quickly. \n\nEdit- typo",

      "text": "Kicking off what will hopefully be a useful thread, these are some of the stories over the years about candidates who didn't get the job, and the reason why. We are a chemistry department at a large regional public university.\n\n* Lack of enthusiasm. We watched two candidates stand and look bored the entire time they gave a mock lecture. The content was fine, but it was painful to watch someone not move at all when giving a talk (and they had no disability that would prevent it as they walked around campus fine). If we were bored, how would students feel? I will point out that these individuals were both in excess of 400 pounds, but their lack of energy definitely turned us off.\n\n* Bad reference. A candidate rubbed someone the wrong way in the past, and asked them to be a reference. The reference looked good on the surface, but as soon as we asked them if they worked well with others, they said no. He was our first pick until then.\n\n* Lack of knowledge. I recently watched a mock general chemistry lecture full of wrong information. Everyone was shocked that someone with a PhD would know so little about very simple chemistry. Not only were there errors on the board (could happen from nerves) but also on the PowerPoint they prepared.\n\n* Lack of professionalism. I have watched a candidate brag about not using a briefcase/computer bag in lieu of their old ratty backpack from undergrad. This is what they brought to their interview. And then she proceeded to cuss her way through all her meetings. And she wasn't even dressed appropriately to tour the labs. \n\n* Not the right one. There was simply a better person that would fit our research needs better. This person was absolutely great, and we would have been happy with the hire, but we had a slightly better candidate that was first pick for research reasons. Had our first pick turned us down, they would have been offered the position.\n\n* Personality issue. We have a very large at-risk student population, and they are always in need of a little extra help. If you come off as someone that will be unapproachable, or someone that the students would be unwilling to seek help from, that's going to kick you out of our pool.\n\n* Mediocre job teaching. If you know your stuff, that doesn't mean you can teach it. We've seen several people who are able to hold a great conversation with other chemists, but were unable to communicate that knowledge at the front of the room. \n\n* They obviously don't want to be there. If you do nothing but talk 100% about how great your current institution is, don't interview with us. We aren't them.\n\nIf you notice, in our department we have never not given someone a job for research reasons. That would likely be different in more research-based programs, but my guess is that would all be weeded through before an actual site visit. If you are on the campus interviewing, you have a great shot at the job. \n\nWe've had candidates turn us down for about as many reasons as I have above. Even had one once turn down a gig in a sister department because we didn't have enough bike trails in town. Our cost of living is very low, we've been turned down for that. We've lost a few good ones because of pay. \n\nHope this info is at least moderately interesting to those of you on the market. ",

I'm definitely in a prosperous area.  Of course, travel an hour either direction and you get to another area like mine (and even one with some serious urban sprawl).\n\nSo to be as accurate as possible, I may be in the south, but I am in a small city that is not solely dependent on the university to exist, nor am I in a tiny rural enclave.

I DO have a nice leather thing I can use for interviews, but it wouldn't hold a laptop easily.\n\nIt sounds like the candidate had a lot of other problems, though.

There is really no point in arguing further, but committees are made up of fallible human beings, and hiring practices are not scientific or fair. Failed searches show this well: the committee did a bad job of picking and no one is suitable. Bias plays a big role, and the sooner we realize this, the sooner we can fix it.

That's commonly a graduate advisor or department chair, and sometimes they clearly are not keen on giving a reference...so they will damn with faint praise. I've only had a couple who ever gave what I'd consider negative references, and they were basically warnings about personality issues we had already flagged.\n\nIf you are asked by a candidate and cannot give a positive reference I'd indeed simply decline. I have done that with students many times.",

Much more commonly, though, we get an opening due to a resignation or a new line gets approved. At my institution hiring requests go to the deans in May and we get answers around August 1st. So \"how far in advance\" is typically about two weeks, the time period between receiving that approval and the deadline for posting the job ad.\n\nDifferent of course at other kinds of institutions. Sometimes we have grants, endowment gifts, or other such golden eggs that know about earlier.  We also have a strategic plan for the department that lays out our next 3\\-4 hires based on priority, but that might well take 20 years given the rate of retirements/growth we expect.",

Of course, being very fat still makes some aspects of the professor job more difficult and more problematic - e.g., they may need a large, reinforced chair to sit in while lecturing and in their office, and some professors need to travel a lot and very fat people need two seats in a plane etc. - but that doesn't seem enough to declare that very fat people can't or shouldn't do the job.",

      "text": "Whew! Most notable: we had an extremely talented scholar interview at my PhD program. They had already published a monograph, several journal articles, and were on contract for a second book (this is a big deal in my area in the humanities). Their work had received some positive attention as well, so they were known. \n\nResearch talk was abysmal. It was unfocused, and they didn't articulate a publication agenda. With a second book under contract, that should have been a slam dunk. \n\nThe biggest issue was dinner. Everyone ordered food and a beer/wine. Candidate ordered a pitcher of beer. Questionable. The pattern continued, and the candidate got sloppy drunk at the dinner. They were supplying beer to the graduated students, which made the senior faculty feel a bit uncomfortable. It doesn't matter how talented a scholar you are- don't get sloppy drunk at a job interview. \n\nAside from this, the most common reason is that people don't understand the institution type/job. I've been on searches with research faculty that only talk about their passion for teaching and instructional faculty candidates that ask about research sabbatical opportunities. That immediately kills interest because we know they wouldn't be sticking around, and that they didn't even bother to google us. \n\nNext in line is the lunch test. We always take lunch easy, and we talk about TV, sports, pop culture, never politics- it's a \"fit\" test. Can this person integrate in a non-academic discussion about us as people? A surprising number of people fail this test and either clam up or try to spin everything towards their research/teaching. I always tell my students to do their work, but watch TV/movies/listen to music- whatever- keep hobbies. It's likely we will have a really talented researcher/teacher that also knows how to engage their coworkers. ",

          "text": "> I always tell my students to do their work, but watch TV/movies/listen to music- whatever- keep hobbies.\n\nHaving finished my phd only a year ago, I've unfortunately seen a few advisors steering their grad students in the opposite direction. For example: \n\nI led a first-year \"welcome to grad school; here's some tips to succeed\"-style seminar during the last year of my program. As a tip, I suggested finding or keeping a hobby that students enjoy and sticking to a plan to indulge and enjoy time spent with this hobby a few hours each week to maintain sanity. I even made the caveat that there will be weeks where this may not be possible, but did say that work-life balance is difficult in a time-demanding job, so grad school is a good time to learn skills towards achieving whatever a healthy balance means for each person.\n\nAn advisor had been sitting in on that session and contradicted me in front of the first year students, saying that work-life balance is over rated and grad school is the only time in our lives that we will be able to devote ourselves to our studies fully. She said the answer to mental health isn't to \"just go bake a cake\", but to instead be better at our own research. I bit my tongue in the moment, because she had already written me a good letter of recommendation for the job I now have, but still fume over the side conversation we had later where I tried to calmly tell her that not everyone works like her and that it's okay to do so (spoiler: she disagreed and said that she will never regret spending so much time at work instead of with her family, and already regrets not spending more time at work and less with her family).

I hope I'd think about all the human interactions, the good things (and the bad) that come with family and friends.",

However, having to compete for jobs and grants against people who would rather spend their time researching/writing/producing data than with their family/friends/hobbies creates an often toxic environment of \"if you're not working as many hours as the person next to you, you're a slacker and should give up now\". \n\nAdditionally, I've found that a large percentage of R1 academics do actually fall in the category of those who would enjoy a work-life balance skewed towards work (nothing wrong with that if it's enjoyable to the person). I just hate that advisors force students who have no desire to pursue R1 careers into a work ethic that doesn't match their own interests/goals. As an anecdote, I now work at a teaching SLAC and work 40-50 hour weeks during the school year, despite my advisor's insistence that I would still be working 70 hour weeks (like she does) but grading and lesson-planning instead of researching.",

At our R1, also highly respectable, where she had her first faculty appointment, she said that our university shows there is clearly a better way of doing things: people are doing work on par with that at the previous institute she was at, but everyone has hobbies, work-life balance, and is much happier. She said there was no reason for the people at her previous institute to work so much and be so miserable, because they really weren't getting ahead of anyone else by doing that. ",

I taught at 4 different colleges, 7-8 courses a semester while applying for jobs-- since I needed to eat. \n\nI challenge you to find out how many TT professors you have at your school in the humanities versus STEM. I think you will be surprised, since I already know the way the funding has been going. Has everyone had some cuts? Sure. My STEM friends have already told me about the grant issues. But whole humanities departments are being cut, whole majors abandoned, and since not all colleges have graduate programs, it's more than possible to not only have adjuncts outnumber the full time professors, but to, yes, have entire departments where the program director is the only one who isn't an adjunct. That is actually the case for one of our programs at the school I teach for now. \n\nI was lucky enough to get hired full time at my institution, but I see plenty of friends and others in my field at conferences with solid resumes and publications and they still cannot get an interview. You're basing all of this on your own experiences, which I get-- we all do this-- but I'm suggesting there are other experiences, and someone with a graduate degree in history or English *will* struggle, and it's not always because they don't look good on paper. The system is just not all that interested in them anymore. \n\nPeople with PhDs in my field are clamoring for jobs at community schools. And I'm sure you know that most of those jobs will be filled by adjuncts as well.  ",

I would never deny that. \n\nMaybe my school is an outlier, but our lit and lang department dwarfs any of our STEM programs except biology. They have about 3X the number of full-time people than we do. They have a ton more adjuncts too, but as far as I've seen when looking through the ads, and knowing what I see at my own school, there are still a lot of job openings for TT lines in non-STEM fields. Maybe there are more people applying for them, but I wouldn't know either way about that.\n\nIf you are associate, we've likely been teaching about the same amount of time full time (decade in my case). I don't know if you have seen the same issues I have, but we DO see a lot more people applying for jobs than when I started. Of those applicants though, we haven't seen any higher number of highly qualified people. 10 years ago, we would have 40 applicants per line and 10 would be worth giving a phone call to. The past 4-5 years, it's closer to 70 applicants, and 10 are worth giving a phone call to. I've heard that from others in different disciplines as well, and not just at my school. We've discussed it previously on here also a year or so ago. IMO, and it's 100% anecdotal, there are a ton of average students going to mediocre graduate schools and graduating with mediocre qualifications. They are flooding the job market. Few people seemingly get hired out of those schools for TT lines unless they go on to do a prestigious post-doc type job (at least in my discipline) unless it is as an adjunct somewhere. \n\nDo you think that in the future, institutions will completely get rid of tenure track English professors? Would they just have adjuncts teach everything? I haven't seen any departments with quite that extreme number of adjuncts that you describe outside of community colleges, but it has pretty much always been like that there from my limited recollection. \n\nEdit: Also, I would love for you to contribute to this thread with reasons your department didn't hire people. Humanities people are needed in the discussion.",

Our committees typically have 5-6 members, and there's always very strong overlap between the individual lists, which suggests we are in agreement as to what makes a good candidate. The basic criteria are 1) a clear match with the advertised position and qualifications, 2) a strong teaching portfolio, and 3) evidence of potential for scholarship in our environment (i.e. on a 3/3 teaching load). \n\nFrankly, applying #1 usually eliminates about a third of the candidates, many of whom are either reaching in terms of their fit for the position or their qualifications for the job in general. After that committee members have their own processes...I personally read c.v.s first, then cover letters, then teaching statements, and if I'm still interested at that point I will read LORs and the rest of the teaching portfolio before I rank them. Quite often candidates are rejected based on poor cover letters that betray a lack of understanding of the position or our institution...winnowing them down to a couple dozen isn't that hard actually. It's the step after that I find challenging, and someone I might rank very highly on paper might fall completely out of contention once we've talked with them.\n\nIt's an imperfect process. One way we strive toward \"fairness\" is that every candidate deemed \"qualified\" (i.e. that meets the position description) gets evaluated using the same criteria and is given a series of scores that are recorded, then used to drive the initial ranking by the committee. So if one person scores a particular candidate much higher or lower than the rest of the group, we discuss that to find out why-- that brings out both positive and negative things that some on the committee might have missed. I'm ultimately looking for standout candidates who present with as thoughtful teachers and who can check off more than one box for us...for example, if we're looking for a labor historian and find one who also does gender history, that's a plus since we often collaborate with gender studies. Or we might find a labor historian who also does digital humanities, which might not be in the job description but is a great \"value added\" piece for a department if nobody is already doing so. The more bonus boxes a candidate checks, the more interesting they become as long as that's in addition to primary competency in the advertised field.",

I haven't seen any departments with quite that extreme number of adjuncts that you describe outside of community colleges, but it has pretty much always been like that there from my limited recollection. \n\nMan, ten years ago even I might have said no, but. HLC is going to have a say since they require a ratio of full time to part time supposedly, which adjuncts can\u2019t provide.  HLC  could make a difference if they stepped up and forced more full time positions for accreditation since this current system isn\u2019t set up to help students or people in general, this adjunct thing.\n\nI hope this makes sense between my last response and this one I took a shot, out with friends before a conference tomorrow.",

Basically told by academics to go out and get more experience to show that I could do/teach some systematic literature review shit because I hadn't done it in my PhD.\n\nIt's really brutal out there... it's very random, there are too many graduates, too few quality jobs, too many bullshit adjuncting jobs. The only positive thing I can say is that if you get out of academia completely you'll likely be seen as an expert just for having a PhD and no one will even ask if its in the field you're working in. Every weird turn on my CV is seen as something to highlight now that I'm in industry.\n\nI hate to offer advice because I'm sure you've researched it yourself, but depending on your need for benefits, it might be worth trying to get to Canada. Things like surgeries would be covered regardless of your job. Medications are often tied to private insurance paid for by your employer, though. Academic positions are just as hard to get, though.

      "text": "Hard question to answer in anything but anecdotes. I have a *lot* of experience on search committees and have read thousands of files. There are so many different reasons to reject candidates at the paper stage, so I'll skip that. Here are some for the later stages:\n\n*Phone/Skype interview stage:*\n\n* candidate clearly knows nothing about our institution\n* candidate doesn't understand what a liberal arts college does\n* candidate obviously doesn't want to teach (talked about research non\\-stop)\n* candidate presents as entitled, seems to think he's already got the job and is doing us a favor\n* candidate cannot answer basic questions about pedagogy\n* candidate has no questions at all for *us* despite multiple invitations\n* candidate demonstrates zero passion, engagement, excitement for our field or teaching\n* candidate makes disparaging remarks about our region/state/city\n* candidate makes sexist remarks during interview\n* candidate apparently doesn't know anything about the field in which s/he is applying\n* candidate won't stop talking so we can ask our questions\n* candidate seems on the verge of tears/breakdown, constantly apologizing during interview, seems to want to get away asap\n* candidate was rude/unprofessional to our support staff who set up the interview with them\n* candidate was not really going to be defending their dissertation next month as claimed\n\n*Campus visit stage:*\n\n* candidate was rude/dismissive to staff/students during visit\n* candidate presented as cocky and superior (neither of which was merited)\n* candidate seemed to think s/he was doing us a favor by gracing us with her/his presence\n* candidate repeatedly asked about teaching releases despite being told there were none for new hires\n* candidate gave the worst teaching demonstration we've ever seen\n* candidate gave the worst job talk we've ever seen\n* candidate dressed unprofessionally, was late to appointments, showed minimal interest in the position/school\n* candidate made sexist/racist remarks at dinner\n* candidate told dean s/he wouldn't even consider the job without a salary 33&#37; above our range, teaching releases, and other demands that were ridiculous\n* candidate revealed to search committee member(s) that s/he wasn't really interested in the job and was just using it for leverage elsewhere\n* candidate revealed s/he had no interest in staying with us long term, was only looking for a stepping stone to a research\\-intensive position elsewhere\n* candidate failed to demonstrate basic competency in field(s) claimed in their application in casual interactions\n* candidate was clearly a whack\\-job (variations: jerk, angry, mean, bizarre, unhinged, etc.)\n* candidate told search committee member s/he didn't like college students and really preferred to work from home\n* candidate apparently wanted a position in another department but thought getting into ours would be a good first step\n* candidate went to dinner with search committee, ate steak with hands, and talked about nothing but comic books unless directly questioned otherwise (hands!)\n* candidate was universally deemed unacceptable by multiple groups of students after student\\-only sessions (see \"dismissive,\" \"cocky,\" \"sexist,\" etc above).\n* candidate said offensive things to support staff, students, or search committee member(s) on the ride to/from the airport\n\nThat's a quick list. There are many, many others of course. Virtually all of these are avoidable, and all happened *despite* careful review of files, lengthy phone interviews, and reference checks in advance of campus visits. The single most common reason someone doesn't get an offer from us, of course, is concern about teaching\\-\\- if you are interviewing at an SLAC and are not confident that you can 100&#37; hit a grand slam in your teaching demonstration/classroom presentation then practice it until you are. A poor teaching demo will sink the best paper candidate every time, because while we actively mentor new faculty we *must* have something to start from that goes above the baseline of \"I have a degree and like to talk about my field.\" If you don't have any pedagogical training, get some before you apply.",

Children here are taught never to eat anything but \"finger food\" with their hands. He cut it into bite-sized pieces but ate about half of them with his fingers. That alone wouldn't have been reason to reject, but it was pretty damned odd given that said candidate had no cultural reason to do so...he also refused all the vegetables/sides that came with the meal and told the waiter just to bring the meat.",

Teaching vs. research focus, mission/strategic plan, etc. I heard a story of someone interviewing at a religious institution and he said he \"didn't mind\" that they were Christian. He didn't get the job. \n\n- One tricky part for the search committee is to suss out how interested the candidate is in the job; it's nice to make an offer to someone who is going to accept. Asking *informed* questions (see first point above) that make it sound like you're trying to envision yourself in the job is a good way to indicate interest. \n\n- As indicated elsewhere in the thread, you are always interviewing. There are the formal parts where the committee asks you questions but the meals and the car trips are as important - sometimes moreso. Many departments may not get another full-time hire for years, so they want to pick someone who has their ego under control and can play nice with others.\n\n- It's easy to find interview questions online, and if you think about it, you could probably make some up: what's your teaching philosophy, what's your research plan, etc. Come up with some solid, concise answers to those questions. You should not be fumbling to tell them basic stuff about your experience or vision for the future.\n\n- Just because you're a grad student doesn't mean you have to remind them of it constantly. Everyone needs a first job at some point. They know where you're at in your career. On the flip-side, don't oversell yourself, because again - they know where you're at in your career. It's okay to say \"In the course I taught last term, I noticed X was a challenge for me, and I've been thinking about how to address it.\" This sounds a lot better than \"I'm great at teaching and every student loves me.\"",

We are actually very forgiving, however it seems that after every round of  interviews we shake our heads in amazement that so many who wax poetic about their passion for research and current teaching methods seem to have so little evidence proving either.

When on campus for an interview, you should be asking questions about what your job and life would look like at the institution, but the details of salary and pension are something you would work out after you have already received an offer. It can come off as presumptuous to bring it up early and already sets a tone that you will create a potentially difficult hiring process with a list of demands instead of a set of negotiations. \n\nAt the interview stage, it is much more appropriate to ask about how the department/institution runs, what policies are in place (i.e. things that are fairly set in stone and are non-negotiable). While at the offer stage, you will begin asking questions and making comments about what is or isn't negotiable (i.e. salary/pension, teaching load for the first year, startup funds, etc.).",

We work in a world where salaries are not discussed openly in many/most workplaces and I'm providing advice on how to navigate that world. \n\nI will say that I applied to a number of lower-paying academic jobs (my current position included), and I was informed of the salary range or the relatively non-negotiable payscale (community colleges) before the interview process in order to not waste my time or theirs. Beyond that, public university salaries are searchable on Google and vary widely depending on how well the applicant negotiated their base salary and/or how in-demand they were as a candidate for the position. This would make providing a salary range fairly difficult as an employer.",

And if you work in California, or another location where you will feel comfortable and/or protected in asking for this info upfront, I say go for it. Unfortunately, if you live outside of these locations, you will likely be perceived as I stated in my earlier comment if you insist on discussing negotiation of salary early-on before you have been considered as a final pick for the position. As such, I would still advise against doing so early and instead encourage those of us who already have TT jobs to push for providing these metrics to potential hires.",

If a candidate is simply a \"listen to me lecture\" type they won't even get a phone interview with us. We expect active learning pedagogies in the classroom from everyone, and there are always plenty of applicants in every pool with teaching awards, experience as a trainer, publications on pedagogy, documented innovations in blended learning, or who simply present as aware, active\\-learning educators that it's never a problem to cull those who are not. Sometimes, however, one will sneak through and get a campus interview...if they spend an 80 minute class simply lecturing they are finished. At an SLAC like ours there is no part of the on campus interview more important than the teaching demonstration, unless it's the breakfast meeting with the department in which we talk about pedagogy. If a candidate cannot provide evidence of pedagogical awareness (or ideally, some sophistication) they aren't going to be a good fit for us.",

In practice it means lots of discussion, application/skill practice, problem solving, and project-based learning. Lots of variety across disciplines and instructors of course, but it's been happening for a long time...I learned that way as an undergrad in the 1980s and when I was hired in the 1990s everyone in my department (history) save a couple of about-to-retire senior faculty had made the transition long before.",

Thus, think that wanting to do one's job well, and reflecting on whether one's personality fits the general nature of the job would be foundational for everyone. Evidently my assumptions are often wrong. ",

In my SLAC world (as a student and a mid\\-career professor) friendships between faculty and students are the norm, not the exception. While *dating* would certainly be frowned upon (and likely violates policies on most campuses now) social interaction is obviously not. I have lots of faculty colleagues who socialize with students; I've gone to concerts and movies with mine, have them over for dinner (in groups), meet them for coffee, play on intermural teams with them, joined unofficial clubs with them, I even played lead guitar with a student band for a year once. As long as such relationships don't cross the lines of dating or professional conflict\\-of\\-interest they would be seen as quite normal on my campus and those of most other SLACs at which I've been.",
