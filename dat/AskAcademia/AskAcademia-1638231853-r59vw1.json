  "title:": "Is it acceptable to ask a professor / mentor for opportunities to work with them / an opportunity to do a PhD with them?",
  "text": "I am a couple of years out of my undergraduate degree program, and have a great ongoing relationship / mentorship with an old professor of mine. I completed a couple of research projects under their advisement as an undergrad, and they wrote one of my LoRs for an MS program I'm enrolling in in the spring (at a different school / degree field). I've talked at length with my professor about my interests, studies, career aspirations, etc.\n\nRecently (but certainly not abruptly), I came to the realization that more than anything else, I just want to work under this one professor and collaborate with them on their research / projects / work at the University. I'm extremely passionate about their specialization, and we can talk about it for hours on end together (and continue to do so from time to time). I have the right skillset to add value to their research. They're a well-regarded professor at a large university for their field (Economics).\n\nI'm thinking I'll reach out and just share this thought with them and why I came to the conclusion. I feel good about my reasoning and the decision for me personally, and feel good enough about my relationship with said professor to broach the topic. I'm confident I'd enjoy and get value out of a PhD, but don't necessarily want to become a tenure-track Economics professor. I just want to work for my professor, who oversees a lot of research funding.\n\nWith that being said, does anybody have any advice or thoughts on how best to approach this topic with them?",

I might be accepting of the possibility but strongly encourage a student to pursue other possibilities because I think that\u2019s in their best long term interest.  Regardless, I would welcome a conversation like this generally speaking. At the very least they will be flattered and you would\u2019ve effectively communicated your esteem for them and their work. I\u2019d be curious how things play out for you.",

      "text": "You can start the conversation, but I would put more forward thought into what you intend to do with that research specialization after the PhD. Your potential adviser will probably be less impressed with \"I just want to hang out and work on stuff with you!\" than with \"I'm interested in working on XYZ, and a PhD in your specialty would be excellent preparation\".  Advisers invest a LOT of time into their mentees, and after graduation you represent them in a sense.",
