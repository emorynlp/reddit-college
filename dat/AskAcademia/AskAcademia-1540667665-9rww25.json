  "title:": "Professors / Instructors, how have your student's political views affected how they learned or digested your class material?",
  "text": "I'm just wondering about any experiences that you've had where the political views of your students affected what they took away from the material you were trying to convey in your classes.\n\nI'm in engineering and I teach two classes, one fundamental and one elective. The fundamental class is thermodynamics and there's virtually no room for political filtering in that subject. The elective class focuses on engineering and environmental impacts, where we learn about how engineered systems contributed to causing but also solving environmental problems from a technical standpoint.\n\nIn my elective class, most of the students are pretty okay with the class material in a neutral sense, but usually there is at 1 or 2 students every year that like to argue with me about whether the examples of environmental problems I talk about are / were real. \n\nFor example, I had a student last year who argued with me about whether the smog problems of the mid-20th century were really caused by automotive emissions. He argued that it was a conspiracy by liberal government regulators to gain increasing control of the automotive industry and that the smog was really caused by one-time unusual meteorological conditions. He didn't change his mind even after we went through the atmospheric chemistry of air pollution and the input precursors from automotive emissions. This was a graduating senior undergrad. At a highly ranked R1 university. He ended up dropping the class later and called me a liberal shill. (I'm actually registered no party preference).\n\nPolitically, I feel like the engineering students at my school generally lean slightly conservative or libertarian, but not by much and there are also a lot of politically liberal engineers as well (in the U.S. sense). \n\nIn general, **my student's political views have not strongly affected how students learn my material**, but I feel like in other fields this can be a significant factor. \n\nDo you have any experience / stories about how your material is filtered by a student's political views?  \n",

That's true of most pre-professional students, and if you are teaching liberal arts courses that are required for general education they often don't want to be there because they don't see it as relevant. I get a lot of senior business majors who enroll in my 300-level history courses in their final semester after they've put off their last humanties requirement as long as possible. At least a few of them drop the first day when they see the reading list. But some stick around, and a few have come to me and said things like \"I never realized how much history impacts the present!\"",

      "text": "I'm a MD/PhD student, not an instructor, but was having a conversation with an engineer who told me that CO2 emissions were just as bad from nuclear power plants as from fossil fuel burning ones so it didnt make sense to switch. He also implied climate change wasnt real.\n\nIn my field (medicine and physiology) I've had fellow students and colleagues suggest things like astrology as having made valid predictions and so they hold them up as equivalent to science. \n\nI feel the problem is not that one's political beliefs are coloring feelings about topic, but that there's a larger disbelief in or misunderstanding of concepts in science in general. The political bent makes it too emotional to overcome with just education sometimes (see: evolution). Also, in medical research, I feel the grant writing process forces us to over-inflate what we believe about our own data.\n\nThat engineer obviously didnt understand how nuclear fission worked. The medical students I've talked to (and this is true in medical professionals) have some superstitions that they hold barring any evidence. Individually it might not be an issue but at population levels, these misunderstandings start to have serious effects.\n\nOp, have you had any experiences with students where you've overcome their biases? Is it something we can fix?",

It was generally a lot of fun, and spurred a lot of interesting and productive conversation, but the \"conservative Christian\" kids were the absolute worst.  You always knew who they were, because they would invariably announce it on the first day of class.  They seemed to mostly show up to be argumentative, disruptive, and borderline abusive.  One term we had a student stand up and yell \"WHY DO YOU LIBERALS HAVE TO TRASH THE BIBLE AND TREAT IT LIKE CRAP?!\" before storming out on the first day of class while the professor (who was a kindly older Jewish woman that practically bent over backwards to be respectful and inclusive of everyone's beliefs) was giving a general overview of the history of scholarship on the Bible. That same term, I had a kid show up to my office hours to rant at me for 20 minutes about how I was \"biased\" and had a \"bad attitude\" because I gave him a (very generous) C+ on the midterm.  Thing was, that exam was about 70% just identifying key figures, events, and terms from the Bible (basically, questions with an objectively right or wrong answer) and he had completely bombed that part. It was pretty obvious that he'd done none of the course reading, but had years of Sunday School under his belt, and *assumed* he knew everything about the Bible.  When I pointed out that if he had done a better job at just correctly identifying things in the Bible, he would have easily been in the A-/low-A range, he huffed off... To his credit though, he later apologized over email.",

For one lecture in particular, our reading had been the penitentials - basically handbooks written by priests of the penance required for certain sins - and the one we read was directed specifically at monks, explaining the punishments for common sins. Many of the sins specified are things like getting riotously drunk, and having sex with each other. I remember one of the Catholic women absolutely losing her mind, furious with the professor, for 'slandering' the church because he had obviously made this up since monks would *never* do things that the Bible explicitly forbids. He managed to spin it into a fairly interesting class discussion but she was dead convinced that it had to be fake. ",

I don't personally care what students' political biases are when in class; I have a bias towards reasoning and ethics, and if they cannot make a strong deductive claim in support of evidence, based in things in the world that are demonstrable/probable/plausible, their claims are irrelevant. And if they can make an ethical claim based in things that are demonstrably or at least highly probably existent in the world, based in some recognizable and coherent system of ethics, then they have succeeded.\n\nWe struggle more with truth claims in that \"truth\" is obviously always a difficult thing to define, but treating these as strong hypothesis is usually effective for weeding out the wing nuts. My students lean strongly left, but not necessarily liberal. Occasionally strongly libertarian too. The few who are on the far right have failed in a spectacularly embarrassing fashion in trying to justify unjustifiable things through arcane references (\"No, Timmy, you can't make an ethical argument based on Heidegger, all due apologies to you\") or shitty reasoning that they, themselves, come to notice. A few have dropped quickly due to this; they look dumb, in short, and not because I say \"You look dumb\" but because they realize they cannot explain and support their ethical claims if they are not, in fact, ethical.",

I simply would not accept partisan bullshit from either side; students are expected to use historical evidence to support anything they say in class or write in a paper. I've always had both extremely conservative students and fairly liberal ones; neither group are particularly well informed about US history though, so they don't have a lot work with beyond what I provide in class, the readings, and the modest research assignments I give.\n\nI have, however, changed the content of some of my courses in response to the current political environment. I devote much more time to McCarthyism and civil rights in the 1950s, for example, and to the political tumult of the late 1960s/early 1970s (Vietnam, Watergate, 1968 elections, and the general cultural/political divides of the era) than I once did. I made room for that by dropping some content from other eras...so now less about the 1910s and more focus on the economic/political events of the 1920s, less about WWII and more about the post-war political realignment, less about JFK and more about Nixon. Though my main goal is to teach historical analysis and argumentation I think it's important for students to have context for what's happening today-- so now we spend time on the America First movement c.1940 and less on the Dust Bowl. Things like that.\n\nI have always taught LBGTQ history, the sexual revolution, women's history, etc. as a normal part of my classes. Every so often there is some student who will say something to me privately like \"I don't believe in homosexuality, so do I have to read the novel you assigned?\" I always say yes, of course, because they are in college to learn, not to hide behind whatever narrow belief system they mave have developed in high school. That hasn't changed, and I don't see any more of it now than I did 25 years ago.",

I've been researching something related to your question.  Political ideology we know can be a pretty good predictor of religiosity (the most powerful predictive variable in how someone voted in the 2000 Bush v. Gore presidential election, for example, was whether or not they attended church) and there is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates religiosity is inversely correlated with scientific literacy, possibly socioscientific reasoning (what I'm working on).  In other words, the line connecting political philosophy and science acceptance is fairly short and straight.  \n\nObviously I'm not saying that all persons of a particular political persuasion have their scientific literacy negatively impacted by their degree of religiosity, but there is a connection.  I've surveyed my own students (college freshmen and sophomores) over the years which is what got me interested in this and in my totally non-scientific convenience sampling of about 10 of my classes, a very clear pattern emerged: students from conservative religious families were less likely to accept as fact three controversial theories I teach: Big Bang, Evolution, Climate Change.  \n\nOP, please take note I said \"accept,\" not \"learn.\"  Learn can mean a few different things and depending on how you define it, I have encountered students where religiosity or political ideology prevented learning.  For example, I clearly recall one student in particular who, having aced the final and the course, told me that, \"Wow - that stuff (Big Bang) was really interesting but I just don't believe any of it because I'm a Christian.\"  Did she answer questions correctly on an exam?  Yes. Did she \"learn?\"  Well, if we define learning as the acquisition and processing of new information so that a test can be passed then, yes, she learned it.  But that's a bad definition for learning and I certainly don't define learning that way.  Learning is evidenced by a long-term change in behavior or mental representations about the world.  Despite conveying to her the explanation and supporting evidence and answering all of her questions until she was satisfied, I just was not able to alter her mental representations of the world in which we live.  She chose to believe the fairy tale.  She had not learned.",

However, there are a variety of natural conditions - forest fires, volcanic outgassing, etc. - that will also create the problem.\n\nYes, that's why I said the atmospheric conditions were necessary but not sufficient. Correct conditions + no VOCs = no photochemical smog.\n\n> The same is true with the instructor's explanation. He didn't need to explain about atmospheric chemistry. He needed to explain about how the various factors were weighted\n\nThe proper weight given to the idea that emissions controls are a liberal conspiracy is zero.",

If you cannot demonstrate your knowledge better than \"it's that way because I said so\", then you're going to constantly be running across problems like this.",
