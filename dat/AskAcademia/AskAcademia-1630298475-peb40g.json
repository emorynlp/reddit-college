  "title:": "Tips on choosing supervisor for PhD? The one we've had experience working with, or the one with research project closer to our own?",
  "text": "Hi all, I've been thinking a lot about this. To keep it brief, I've been in contact with two professors in my pursuit for PhD application. They both responded positively.\n\nThe first professor is someone I've worked with in the past. I was their research assistant. They were very, very kind and helpful during the project. Working with/under them is one of the best research experience I have. When they knew I was looking for a PhD position, they eagerly offered a position. However, their research focus is quite different from mine, although some parts do intersect. They're teaching in one of the most prestigious university in Europe, especially in my field.\n\nThe second professor is someone I've only met once in a conference. But I'm a huge fan of their work. One of my inspiration during my master. Their research project is the closest to my own. They have plenty of publications and are more established than the first professor. However, I have no prior experience with the professor (putting aside meeting them once). I don't know them personally, only their works. I don't know anyone who has worked with him too. Their university is less prestigious, however I've heard they've been able to secure funding and huge grants for multiple researches.\n\nI'm from a country in global south and both require me to study abroad. Two different countries, both located in Europe.\n\nWhich one I should choose? What I should consider? Any more general tips on choosing supervisor for PhD?\n\nThank you in advance.",

      "text": "The university 'prestige' matters next-to-nothing in European academia. What will matter the most for getting an academic job is your publication record and supervisors' reference letter. Even if you go to the industry, unless you go into politics, having a PhD degree matters more than where you did it. The reason you may want a more 'prestigious university is that they typically have access to more alumni/governmental funding (helping them maintain their status), which may translate to more equipment/resources for research.\n\nPutting that consideration aside, your dilemma becomes a choice between:\n\n1. Known supervisor/less interesting research; and\n2. Unknown supervisor/more interesting research\n\nIf there are indeed some intersections in research with the colleague that you have worked with, then IMO you should go with that option. Having a supervisor that you trust is fundamental. The research project itself can be steered\u2014as you need to own the research by the end of the PhD\u2014to a direction you want. Getting expert advice, if your supervisor can't help, is typically not a problem as you can always ask the second professor to collaborate.\n\nIf the above does not convince you, then you should also consider the two countries. Being in a city/place you like is also an important factor.",

          "text": "Completely agree with this. But I'd add European countries aren't all the same, particularly with regard to the costs of education, access to healthcare and other public services and how commonly English is spoken.  This might be a factor to consider as well.",
