  "title:": "Hi historians, what's a good referencing software for Chicago style that isn't Zotero?",
  "text": "I'm going to give a quick writing workshop for some students in the subject I'm tutoring. Many of them had issues with their referencing, but said that they had used some sort of software to generate their footnotes. I'm pretty sure that many just took the footnotes without giving it a second look, so doublechecking will be my first piece of advice. But also, to my understanding, Chicago's one of those referencing styles that's been difficult for software to deal with.\n\nI've personally used Zotero throughout my postgrad and last year of undergrad, and I personally think it's the best referencing software for Chicago style, but I'm keen to provide them with alternatives if possible. Any recommendations?",
