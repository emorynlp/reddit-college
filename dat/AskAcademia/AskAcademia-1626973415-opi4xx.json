  "title:": "I have a near complete manuscript that is too boring and niche to be a popular history, and I don't want to put in the effort and time to have it published by a university press. I'd hate for all of the research and writing to go to waste. What are my options?",
  "text": "I've written two books for a well-respected university press, and it sucked. I love researching and writing, but I hate the minutia of having to have my footnotes in a certain format and the whole editing process in general. I don't ever want to do it again, and considering the way the job market is, I'm not sure that another book would help me career wise. \n\nAdd to this that almost no one reads the types of books I write (or books in general anymore) and that I want to spend more time hanging out with my daughter and working on fun projects, I don't see a point in going through the scholarly publishing process again. Especially not for something boring, which is the case with my latest project.\n\nThe problem is that I've spent the last four years researching and writing a manuscript. It's 200,000 words and it reads well, but the footnotes are gobbledygook and there's a few areas where the narrative goes on too long and others where it needs to be fleshed out. There's also a few gaps in the research that I don't think are important to the overall story, but they would have to be addressed before bringing it to a university press. Because I'm bad at editing and I work full time and can only work on the manuscript one day on the weekend, I'm guessing it would take at least another year before I could bring this to a press and then it would be who knows how long addressing their edits. That's two years of my life, I don't want to give away for little return.\n\nSo what should I do? I don't want all of that time and effort to go to waste. I think the subject matter is important and that someone somewhere would benefit from what I've done. I also wouldn't mind getting some sort of credit for my work if possible. I'm worried this may be a case of sunk cost fallacy, and I should cut my losses, but I'm hoping someone will have another option.",

You could ask your previous press for a recommendation or just see if any of your grad school contacts know anyone. An acquaintance of mine has her own business doing editing, but she does pretty much only gender studies topics. Ask the historians you know if they know someone.",

I didn't realize developmental editors were a thing, and I would never have expected they'd be used enough for someone to make a living editing only gender studies topics. I'm guessing they'll be out of my price range, but it's definitely worth looking into.",
