  "text": "I received an email from a potential PhD student who is in discussions with my advisor about joining our lab. It was a straightforward, professional email asking how they evaluate potential students.\n\nIs it expected to let my advisor know he reached out to me or is this pretty standard? Apologies if this is a silly question! I myself am only in my second semester.",

      "text": "As someone who's applying to grad school currently, I've been advised by almost *every* person I've talked to, to do exactly this - contact not only the PIs of potential labs, but current grad students whenever possible.\n\nWhy? To find out if the PI and lab culture don't throw up any red flags, aren't toxic, that there are no hidden issues about the PI such as creepiness/sexism/bigotism, to gage whether the PI will be supportive or impossible to reach, etc. The idea is that current or past grad students are really the only resources who will speak honestly about this.\n\nFor us international students or minorities applying from abroad it's extremely important to find a lab with a safe/nontoxic PI, because it's often our only shot to do grad school in a good country/envt, so the stakes are even higher. Especially for female-presenting students like me who are worried about being hit on by a PI or current students and then having our career derailed (which has happened). \n\nIf you want great karma with the universe, please help a bro/sis out and tell them honestly about the lab environment if you can (if there's a lot of negative stuff about the lab, warning them indirectly could make a huge difference between them having a horrible experience and dropping out of grad school, or finishing, and having a major good impact on their lives).",

For example, consider how hands on or off certain advisers are. Some are great at adapting their advising to students\u2019 needs. Others have one advising style they use for all students, regardless of the student. Students who fit that style thrive. Others can succeed but must learn to adapt and speak up for their needs. This info is helpful to know.\n\nI talk to prospective students for my program, and my adviser encourages interested students to talk to current students to get a feel for the PhD program, department and PhD student culture, advising style, and life in the city where the university is located.",
