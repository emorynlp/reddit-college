  "title:": "How do I nicely tell a student she needs to pay attention in class?",
  "text": "I teach Anatomy and Physiology at a large, public University. I have a student in my class who just switched majors from fine arts to Nursing. My class is hard and also required for the students to continue in the major. I am always sure to remind them of due dates, upcoming assignments, and tests in class and through our class website. The student in question seems nervous and anxious when she speaks to me. She asks questions in class after I just explained and gave the answer. She is always asking about due dates after I specifically go over them. She is always venting to her classmates about how hard her workload is and how \"lost\" she is. I do not want my class to be the reason someone cannot continue in their major, but at a certain point it is on the student to pay attention and keep up with these things. \n\nShe is a nice girl and I can tell she's studying and actually trying to succeed. Any advice on how to kindly tell her to pay attention?",

      "text": "> Any advice on how to kindly tell her to pay attention?\n\nAs others have said, it sounds like she's already trying and asking her to \"pay attention\" will only accomplish making her feel bad about herself and to stop asking for clarification when she misses things. \n\nJust as an anecdote: I went through undergrad with undiagnosed ADHD, and I would try my damndest to pay attention and take notes. Even so I would regularly miss things because my mind wanders no matter how hard I try. It only took one professor lecturing me that maybe I should try \"paying attention\" after I'd asked about something he'd already said for me to pretty much stop asking questions in class even when I was completely lost. Much to my detriment for the rest of my undergrad career. \n\nIf you want to help her, answer her questions and as others have said, maybe point her to some resources. If you're worried that she's wasting class time, defer her questions until after class or office hours. You say that it is on the student to keep up with these things, but it sounds like she is taking responsibility on herself to make sure she doesn't miss things -- that's why she's asking questions if she misses something.",

          "text": "To follow up on this, I would recommend having a discussion with her about academic support resources that exist on campus. It is not your job to make sure she is constantly reminded about due dates. If she is having difficulty organizing herself then an academic support counselor can show her different options to stay organized. She has to take that step though and not waste her time seeking sympathy-related attention for her problems.\n\nAs an academic support counselor, I do encourage students to self-advocate and make professors aware of their environmental needs ahead of time if they have a learning-related accommodation. However, we aren't sure there is a learning accommodation (viz, diagnosis) in place or would be one in place. And even if that is the case, how you would need to respond to this particular student would depend on an accommodation specialist's interpretation. Sometimes students diagnosed with certain learning disabilities or developmental disorders have processing difficulties that generally look like a difficulty \"paying attention\". But the underlying reason could be lacking the ability to physically organize materials (make study schedules, take down reminders, place reminders and notes in routine spots so they find them) which is more like a central-executive difficulty vs. having an auditory comprehension difficulty where they don't hold onto verbal information well and lose the meaning of ideas quickly. Or it could be even something else. That is why it is worthwhile that the student investigate their options with a specialist and have a plan in place for themselves if need be.",

I don't want to jump to conclusions but undiagnosed ADHD is the first place my brain went as well and explicit coaching on executive function things is one of the better interventions besides medication. Constructive suggestions will be far better received that criticism.\n\nShe doesn't need to listen to you repeating due dates, she needs to create her own easily accessible record of when thing are due, not lose it, and develop a habit of making note when those due dates become available. Actually very challenging for some people to do.",

It took me over a year of actively going to appointments to get an ADHD diagnosis and proper medication after I had realized something was wrong, a year while I still had to be taking full courseloads in undergrad. Frankly, I would have been mortified and upset if a professor during that time were to have pointed out my attention issues and told me I need to fix them while I was, say, waiting for my insurance to approve my neuropsych evaluation or trying out a brand new medication. Why shouldn\u2019t professors give students the benefit of the doubt and assume that they\u2019re trying to fix the problem? A lot of these issues can\u2019t be fixed overnight and it\u2019s honestly a bit self-indulgent to assume that a professor\u2019s suggestion alone will be the catalyst for instant improvement, as if students are completely unaware of their own struggles and all they need to realize and solve their problems is a professor\u2019s talking-to.",

Should I give you a B because you're entitled to the benefit of the doubt that, \"Hey, I think this student is trying really hard to manage their ADHD\"? What do I then give the student who made a 75 and doesn't have ADHD? \"Sorry, Jane, I guess you just get a C. Maybe you should have performed worse but with some more obstacles to overcome\".\n\nIt doesn't work that way. I want you to succeed. I really do. And I'll do whatever I can to help you succeed. But there's no option on the table to say, \"I don't need your help, and it's none of your business, but I'd still like to be the beneficiary of a pity grade because of how hard it is for me.\"\n\nThere's no pity grade. Meet the standard of performance or don't. That's it. If you do, that's great. I'm honestly happy for you. But if you're halfway through the semester and you're not meeting that standard, the responsibility is ultimately yours to address the issue. I encourage you to explore every avenue to do that, including coming to me and asking for help or asking someone else for help. But I honestly don't know what you expect if your response is \"nothing is going to change this semester, but maybe next semester I'll have a proper diagnosis and better meds\". I agree that that sucks for you, but what do you expect me to do about it. I can't just give As to every student who says college is hard. There are actual options available to you. You can go to the university's disability services office. If it's severe enough that you just need to take time away, you can basically take a leave without a penalty and come back when you're able. There are hundreds of people at a large university who will help you if you ask. If you don't ask, they can't help you, and when the semester is over and you've failed the classes you were too depressed to attend or too manic to focus or whatever the problem was, the window for that semester is closed.\n\nI repeat, what do you expect your professor to do when you've recorded failing grades and not made any visible (to them at least) attempt to improve your performance?",

I'm a human being, and so obviously I do care about the difference between someone who's trying to solve the problem and someone who isn't. But my job as a professor is to be as objective as I can be with respect to performance and grades. **Trying** to solve the problem doesn't matter. The student needs to successfully solve the problem. If they ask for my help I'll do what I can, but if, like you, they prefer that it be none of my business, then that's fine. You're right, I'm not entitled to know your medical history. But the result is that you're expected to fulfill the requirements of the course.

I find myself overwhelmed sometimes when there are lots of dates/assignments announced verbally. One thing I did in a class I taught was send out a weekly newsletter where I said \u201chere\u2019s what\u2019s coming up in the next two weeks!\u201d Now, my class was online due to COVID and this was mainly to help students adjust, but it might be helpful for your students?\n\nJust a thought, may not be applicable for your situation.\n\nETA: You could also talk with her after class and ask her to try taking notes when you discuss dates and things like that. I worked with one student who would forever ask me questions I'd already answered or outlined extensively in emails, and I told him to first try to find the answer on his own, take notes during our meetings, and THEN come to me with simple questions like dates or \"what am I supposed to do\" sorts of questions.",

Just yesterday I was talking to my advisor, we set up a meeting and I got my phone out to put it in my calendar and... I forgot the time. 2 minutes later? More like 10 seconds later. \n\nI'm not trying to diagnose her with ADHD from this one tiny example, but that's one explanation that would make sense and just telling her to pay attention isn't going to help. I've failed classes because of not being able to manage deadlines. And before I was medicated, school was incredibly hard for me, I wouldn't have made it into college if I didn't get diagnosed in high school. If she's struggling with that or something similar then yeah school is going to be really difficult. Honestly even depression or insomnia can make someone without ADHD struggle with attention and memory. \n\nI second what other people are saying, you need to have it in writing on the board or your slides and it's so much clearer to say a date along with \"one week from now.\" Repeating it multiple times is helpful too. And if you don't have a very clear schedule in your syllabus, you should make one. I'm kind of assuming you do since that's kind of the norm these days, but I have to say it because I've had professors who are weirdly averse to making schedules for classes.\n\nEdit to add: if you are doing that stuff, I would suggest meeting with her and asking if things are ok, how the class is going, if there's anything you can do to make things more clear, and if she's talking about difficulties she's having with like a counselor or something. I wouldn't frame it in a trying to get her to the doctor to get diagnosed with something sense, but rather the sense of pointing her in the direction of resources that might be helpful whether or not she's struggling with ADHD or just wasn't equipped well yet for college from her experience in high school or previous classes or whatever",

This is important.\n\nThe short answer to your question is: there isn't a nice way of doing it, it may be like telling someone swimming upstream to just swim faster.\n\nI was undiagnosed ADHD while I was in college. It was very difficult for me and both my professors and myself didn't recognize or accept that I have this \"disorder\" I use that term in quotations because I despise that term, but I digress.\n\nPaying attention isn't a simple on/off force of will for some people. If I'm not in the flow, or got hung up on a concept I don't understand, it is difficult to intake any new information, it's like swimming upstream.\n\nI implore you to please have a private discussion with here and help her connect with some counseling resources. Be empathetic here, her academic career is at stake.\n\nPlease be an ally here.",

An Endocrinologist is who could help rule in/out pheochromocytoma.  Dr. Karel Pacak at the NIH is who she might want to see should she have pheo.  He is the best in the world!  I am adding to my original post to say that it mimics ADHD in some people as well as it can mimic mental illness even.\nI am editing this again.  Here is how bad my memory got.  My sister was on the phone and I told her a big long story over and over again!  She started yelling my name at me and she told me what I was about to say!! She had to repeat, repeat, repeat that I told her already!  It sunk in that something had to be wrong with me.  I went to the emergency room not long after. It also could be a sign of a paraganglioma or other type of neurological tumor.  I got a call and I was telling my retired teacher friend that I was answering this post when she called.  She said I should tell you to feel free to share this post with her.  I think a word for word is okay with me!  That is a lot to remember! Or, make up your own letter using this info.  Be sure to follow up too with her! Oh, print it out!!! Have her give to her doctors.  Give her some additional copies.  Doing anything for yourself is near impossible when one has a neurological tumor!",

It sounds to me like you're already doing a pretty good job trying to help this student, and I think a great next step is probably to have a one-on-one conversation in which you just lay out -- \"Hey, I've noticed you seem like you're being hit pretty hard by the workload here and struggling to keep your head above water. Let's discuss some ideas for how we might get you pointed to a more positive outcome.\" It sounds like that help is at a minimum some coaching on just general success strategies for being a college student.\n\nBut beyond that, I'm not sure what else is advisable for you to do. Sometimes students fail, and sometimes failure is a really good kick in the ass to figure out your shit. You don't really want your nurse to need an entourage of people following her around saying, \"Just so you don't forget, you need to give deong his medicine at 9:00. Don't worry about it though, I'll be sure to tell you again at 7:00, 8:00, and 8:45.\"",

Was only required to take 2 semesters of it but loved it so much that I took 2 additional semesters as well as a gross anatomy class with a cadaver. While human anatomy hasn't changed much in the last 100,000 to 150,000 years or so, the way the organs lie in the body can be a bit different from patient to patient.
