  "text": "Looking for some outside opinions. I am coming to the end of my science Ph.D. from a top university in Canada (I did my undergrad at a good school in Australia). I have thoroughly enjoyed my Ph.D., have a world-renowned supervisor who really cares about their students and wants them to succeed in their degree/life. Need to think about my next career step: academic vs industry. I spent a little time in the industry before my Ph.D., and I prefer research. But the overall vibe I get about postdoc life is depressing. I've seen so much about how toxic academic culture is on social media. How people that leave academic life are happier. Is there a change afoot? Did you have similar thoughts, or were you gung ho about academic life from the start?\n\nThe way I see going into academia:\n\nPro\n\n\u00b7 Reasonable success at getting student grants (14 student grants totally over 100k CAD \u2013 none of these are stipend related as I had average grades in my undergrad; still don't know if this is a lot?...most of my peers don't apply for grants as they all want to go into the industry)\n\n\u00b7 Success in international collaboration \u2013 I have been a visiting student in South Africa and China \n\n\u00b7 Success in industry relations \u2013 I have dealt with several companies in my sector to get access to datasets and/or small amounts of funding\n\n\u00b7 I like teaching and have been told by students I'm good at it. Never dealt with the full force of managing a subject. Still, I've TA'ed entry-level classes (+200 students) and graduate-level courses (5-10 students), and I have received good reviews.\n\nCon\n\n\u00b7 Postdoc positions I've seen appear dreadful either in pay and/or duration\n\n\u00b7 Fear of postdoc jumping chasing that tenure track position.\n\n\u00b7 Academic culture.",

      "text": "I think that you have to remember that the most extreme cases are the ones that you tend to hear about from friends/colleagues and on social media, and similarly, people are much more likely to go on social media and complain so I think people complaining makes things look worse than they actually are.  Having said that there's no doubt that getting a tenure track position is challenging, the budget situation seems to get worse every year resulting in less support staff and more work pushed onto professors (at least at my institution), new committees get formed but old ones never seem to go away, and classes seem to only get bigger.  \n\nI think it's good that you are considering things carefully because there are definitely challenges in the post secondary system that you are going to have to face and overcome if you choose that path but there are also challenges in industry that you'll have to face and overcome too.  Overall I have enjoyed my academic career (tenured teaching position at a large Canadian institution): I like teaching, I have tons of freedom to research what I want to research for the little bit of research that I do, and I don't mind most of the admin/service roles I have taken on over the years.  But I was also fortunate to land a tenure track position that was a good match for me during my first year as a post doc and I'm extremely grateful for that because I did not enjoy being a postdoc.\n\nGood luck with your decision.",

      "text": "I think people who leave academia who might enjoy the stability of an industry position are happier. They might not have known how important such stability is for them so they may keep talking about it on twitter to reach people like then for whom thought a postdoc was the only next choice.\n\nBut I bet the people who went to industry who really really wanted to be PIs are not happy. \n\nI actually think doing a postdoc would be fun if I purely cared about academic freedom. If I wanted financial stability, academic job security and work life boundaries I don\u2019t think it would be fun at all.\n\nSo do a postdoc if you want to be a PI. Don\u2019t listen to all those voices. If it\u2019s what you really want to do it can happen. But if you have doubts then perhaps go the industry route, that\u2019s what I\u2019m planning to do. I need the financial stability and have no interest at all in being a professor.",

He knows a lot about this colleagues; what they are doing, who's a jerk to their postdocs and who isn't.  \n\n\\- Get yourself some kind of postdoc grant before you start a postdoc - as soon as possible, in fact.  You'll have more freedom and choices.  \n\n\\- Find the papers and affilitations of previous postdocs of scientists with whom you would like to work.  After they finishe their postoc, do they get the kind of position you would like?  Do they have a reasonable number of first-author publications during their postdoc?  You can even ask them what their experience was like.\n\n\\- When you have an idea of several people you would like to work with, or that one person you would love to work with, ask to meet with them during a conference or at their institution.",

      "text": "At least you\u2019re thinking about things and not simply taking whatever the path of least resistance is in your field.  What field *are* you in?  Are there good industrial opportunities?  Are you open to moving outside of Canada?  How many PhDs are pumped out each year in your field relative to the number of faculty positions posted?  Do you have a family (I mean spouse, kids)?  If so, what kind of uncertainty are they willing to put up with?  \n\nI don\u2019t know what university you\u2019re at, but at mine for someone to be hired as a postdoc they\u2019re supposed to be within three years of having received their PhD, and are only allowed to postdoc for 4-5 years; if this idea has spread beyond my institute (Western), perpetual postdoc hopping might not be a worry anymore (yay?).\n\nHonestly, you sound like you want to do a postdoc but are mostly afraid of a bad experience.  Talk with your supervisor.  When you find someone you think you might want to work with, talk with a few other profs who know the individual.  Talk to the potential supervisor\u2019s grad students, if in-person conferences are a thing again.  Just watch for any red flags.",

      "text": "From the economic pov, compensation as a new PhD graduate in industry is approximately the same as an assistant professor (80-100K), which increases at a faster rate than professors in academia. One can also do basic research in industry. Personally, I feel like research in industry and academia are both restricted by money. Of course, there is more room for scientific exploration in academia, but I personally like to spend time on projects that have the most likelihood of success. I also don't care if my manager completely cuts off my failing project. In contrast, I have seen many postdocs who just keep on repeating their failed experiments with the hope that it will work the next time around. I see that as a huge waste of my time but is viewed as normal in academia. \n\nFrom your list, most of the pros are just things that you have done in academia and not really things that you enjoy about academia and is exclusively only found in academia. Aside from teaching students, industry can also let you work with international teams and be involved in drug development that can be FDA approved.\n\nPersonally, I don't like to teach and my dream has never been to be a PI, so I am going to industry. I would only stay in academia to be a PI if doing/learning/talking about science is my hobby. But I have a life outside of work and have MANY non-science hobbies that I like to do.",

      "text": "I did leave for industry, but I did a postdoc before and it was quite pleasant! I think the dreadful ones are just the most extreme versions. The pay I got was above average for a postdoc, but in the small town I lived in, the regular postdoc salary would've been quite fine; I worked probably around 50-55 hours a week but nothing ridiculous. Personally, I also had a timer; in my field it was common for people to get academic positions after 2-3 years, so I committed to myself that if things weren't looking good for me after 2-3 years I'd leave academia, and I outright refused to do more than one postdoc. (I knew a couple people who had postdoc'd 6-7 years.)\n\nIf I were you, I would ask myself: Do I want to give it a shot? If you have even the barest glimmer of maybe wanting to be an academic, I'd go ahead and do a postdoc - a postdoc won't hurt you when looking for industry roles (and may help you) but is probably all-but-required for academic roles. If you don't like it, you can always leave.\n\nDepending on your field, you can also do research in industry - so when you say you prefer research do you mean you prefer *academic* research, or literally just research?",
