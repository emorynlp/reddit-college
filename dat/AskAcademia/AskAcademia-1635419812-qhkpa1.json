  "title:": "Conflicts of interest between supervisors and conference chairs?",
  "text": "I'm a 3rd-year PhD student in computer science in Europe. Today, a faculty member in my lab (not my supervisor or anyone that I regularly work with) let it drop that my supervisor has a lifetime conflict of interest with someone who is permanently part of a prominent conference's committee, is regularly involved as a guest editor to prominent journals in my field, etc. She's a big name, we'll call her Camille. Camille was my supervisor's supervisor, and the only thing I know about their relationship is that my supervisor was worried that Camille would find out that our lab is working on the same problem as Camille's (there was no evidence to suggest that Camille was actually upset about this at all).\n\nIn my first year, I submitted a doctoral consortium paper to the conference that Camille chairs. I remember my supervisor saying that she highly doubted it would get accepted, but I didn't know why (it was accepted - maybe I should note that at the conference, Camille and my supervisor interacted quite warmly). Since then, my supervisor has strongly encouraged me not to submit to certain conferences or journals, saying that my work was never ready or good enough for them. I'm not saying that what she said was baseless, but looking back, I can see that Camille is involved in each one of these conferences and journals. \n\nHas anyone every heard of this kind of conflict of interest? Is it a real thing where supervisees can't submit their (anonymous) students' work to any publication that their previous supervisors' are involved in? Or is it likely that this faculty member is only telling me that basically they don't have a good relationship? Regardless of whether it's real or not, I feel like I should have been told about this before I accepted the PhD as it has affected my publishing opportunities. I came in as a total outsider without a relevant undergrad or masters, so there was no way I would have been able to see these kind of politics before starting. Even the fact that I'm only finding out about this now is super weird to me.",

Even large fields aren't that large. \n\nIt's very unlikely Camille is making these decisions alone and while she may well help out former students (which is fine up to a point) she's also probably got a lot of people in her networks and lots of bigger priorities than helping your boss get their student into a conference. Your boss sounds insecure and pessimistic and your colleague sounds jealous.",

I asked the editor about it, since it was literally the only concrete example of a conflict of interest they specified in their instructions to referees.  He told me in the post-LIGO era it's an impossible standard to have.  Fields ain't that large, and author lists are that large.",

So it doesn't really make sense.\n\nI don't think my colleague is jealous of anything. I was discussing with her about a paper of mine that has been rejected twice now, and she said that I have to remember my supervisor's lifetime conflict of interest with Camille, and so if my paper was rejected from places that Camille is involved in, that could explain the rejection (I realize I'm coming across a bit snooty - there are genuine problems with this paper, but my colleague was only trying to be helpful). It didn't come across as jealous. This colleague is above my supervisor in the hierarchy.",

There is a difference as well between conflict and conflict of interest. \n\nIf Camille feels conflicted then the appropriate thing is to hand over decision making to someone else. Penalising applicants for someone else's CoI is not appropriate or fair.",

It is possible that your advisor has issues with Camille, but not the other way around. Your advisor sounds a bit paranoid, unless Camille is a total jerk in which case they should tell you. There is no way Camille is on every top journal, so there should be many for you to consider.",
