  "title:": "Survey about Reference Management Systems",
  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am reaching out on behalf of a group of master students from LMU Munich to ask for your support for a university project course. \n\nwe are currently researching the topic Reference Management Systems (RMS) (also known as Literature Management Systems like **Citavi, EndNote, Mendeley, Zotero and many more**). We are assuming that most of you have probably used a reference management system at some point and we would like to find out what you think about these tools and specifically about Mendeley.   \n\nFor this purpose, we would like you to participate in our short survey (no prior knowledge necessary). We would be very grateful if you could give us some insights into how you have already dealt with these tools. **Here you can directly access the survey:** [https://lmubwl.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_5ooyZuRBe9GIw62](https://lmubwl.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5ooyZuRBe9GIw62)\n\n**Thank you very much in advance for your participation! Also , feel free to leave a feedback here or at the end of the survey :)**",

      "text": "Gave it a go - stopped fairly quickly.  You have no area option under biological sciences/life sciences?  Seems a strange area not to have.\n\nGave up on the University question.  Why would you need to know what University I last attended to get information on my use of reference managers?",

          "text": "Thank you for for the feedback. \nWe used a pre defined list for the field of studies which was used by several websites. We have the text field for other to account for areas we missed out on... etc.\n\nFor the university question, it is more to know the usage patterns and influence of universities on the selection processes. A simple example would be, If you currently live in germany and pursued your studies in the US you might have a completely different preference and that's  what we are trying to explore.\n I hope that made sense.",
