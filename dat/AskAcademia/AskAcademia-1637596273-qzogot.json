  "text": "I\u2019ve recently completed my MSc, finishing with an Investigative Business Project in the field of Human Resources. I finished with a Distinction overall and achieved a 74% for my thesis - is this grade sufficient for a publication, and if so, how would one go about doing this? I understand there is re-formatting to be done, but I\u2019m not entirely sure of the process and feel like I am receiving mixed messages from the information I am finding online. For reference, I am in the UK at a reputable but not red-brick university.",

      "text": "Grades aren't used to determine whether you publish (unless it's different for your field). It's based on the quality of your work. You should discuss it with your dissertation supervisor (assuming you want to publish from your dissertation), they'll have a much better idea of whether your work is publishable, and you'll likely work with them to get it published :)",

              "text": "You need to identify whether you're thinking of writing a review or a research article. Depending on the nature of your dissertation you'll be leaning one way or the other. \n\nAs you recognise, you'll need to reformat your dissertation to fit with journal formats. A review article may be more problematic as depending on field, these are often invite only. If you've done research for you dissertation, you should discuss with your supervisor whether it's sufficient for a research article and what you might need to do to make it so. A good grade doesn't get you a paper, but it's a good start. \n\nCongratulations on the excellent score for your master's.",
