  "text": "I am writing my first academic article. When I was writing my draft I have added a lot of notes. I generally write them like example below\n\nExample:\n\nNote : Roses might be red.\n\nBut I never saw something like this in any article I read(even though I haven't read many). Can you suggest me anything",

Some high end reviews will have aside boxes or definitions in the margins but most primary paper will relegate additional info to supplementary.\n\nYour best bet will probably to comb the literature in your field to see how others do it.",
