  "title:": "Nervous about starting PhD",
  "text": "Hi all, I am due to start my PhD soon and I am really nervous and questioning whether I have made the right choice. I enjoy research and currently work as a research assistant. I will be moving cities to start a PhD in a new lab. I am really questioning whether I am suited for study - I am already dreading the pressure and the reading and writing. My current area of research is different to that of my new lab (although there are some overlapping themes and lab techniques). The new lab is smaller compared to my current one and to be honest the institute is not super well known or renown. \n\nI am quite an overthinker and I am a little worried about my mental health and feeling lonely for the next three years as well as my job prospects afterwards. Starting during the pandemic does not help either! Any tips/ has anyone felt this way before?",

      "text": "It's very normal to feel nervous before starting a Ph.D. program! After all, the fact that you've made a commitment of 5-6 years to a specific program, field, and city is starting to feel real now. Certainly, doctoral programs all involve a level of stress, and it makes sense to feel concerned about that, too.\n\nA few tips:\n\n1. Your advisor wouldn't have selected you if you weren't qualified. And, at the same time, being qualified doesn't mean that you don't have a lot to learn. There will be things that feel challenging to learn and many stresses along the way, but none of that means that you aren't cut out for this. You'll learn and grow over the course of your program.\n\n2. A doctoral program is a not-insignificant chunk of your life. It's still your life, so do your best to treat it that way. (I'll admit, I wish I would have listened to this advice more myself in grad school.) Take the time to explore your new city. Work to establish a new network of friends--even now when everything is virtual, and especially once it's safe to do in-person things again. (That can include your cohort of fellow grad students who will also be in a new city where they may not know anyone!) I encourage you to avoid resigning yourself to being lonely for the next several years. You can complete a Ph.D. program and also build strong relationships. But you may have to take extra efforts to make that a priority.\n\n3. If you're worried about your mental health, be proactive now. Consider seeking out therapy in the university's counseling center or broader community, especially as you navigate this difficult transition. (Most universities will offer e-therapy due to COVID, if safety is a concern for you.) And concerns about mental health are all the more reason to prioritize establishing a good support network and taking care of yourself in other ways (e.g., getting exercise, getting ample sleep, eating well, etc.). \n\nBest wishes as you start your new program!",

Most faculty need it, too, whether or not they seek it out.\n\nAnd remember: there are very few completely irreversible decisions in life. I'm sure you'll do well, but there is *absolutely nothing wrong or weak* about leaving graduate school. I wish people would understand that **it's the same as leaving any unfulfilling job**, despite all the cultural baggage that emphasizes how \"special\" and \"unique\" academics are.\n\nGood luck with everything.",

At different points, you have different decisions. Even if things do not go as expected with your PhD, it\u2018s not the end of the world. You\u2018ll be able to learn a lot during your doctoral studies, and you can still use that knowledge for your future jobs. In my case, I was very unsure whether I wanted to complete a PhD, so I was nervous, but I still tried, and I realized research is not for me. So I left, but the knowledge I learned during my PhD also becomes handy.",
