  "title:": "How familiar with a topic should I be before asking for undergraduate research?",
  "text": "I am a rising sophomore in computer science and I was looking into getting some research experience this semester. I have narrowed down a list of professors I want to talk to but I feel really intimidated by doing so since I don't have much knowledge on the topics they are researching. I have tried to read some papers but everything goes way over my head. I feel like I have to google every other word and I am doubting whether I should even ask. \n\nMy question is do professors expect a certain amount of familiarity about a topic before they consider someone for undergraduate research? And if so what can I do to prepare? Thank you.",

For CS, there are a ton of reddits/youtube channels/podcasts since its such a popular field now depending on what you want to research. I'd suggest checking those out to maybe help before diving into papers.",

My old Prof would only respond to follow ups from undergrads looking to do research with him. To him, it showed drive since they kept on it.  But when the profs do talk about their research, don't be afraid to ask questions. Even simple questions like defining a term they keep using.  It shows you are listening and are curious.",
