  "text": "Ok hi I don't know how many of you saw a previous post I posted here asking for advise on how to speak in an online conference as an undergraduate anxious child, and you all were so kind to tell me such nice tips and tricks and practice methods and \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d thank you all so much! I had my talk yesterday and I (acc to my prof) nailed it and I didn't hesitate, wasn't anxious (even though they made me the first speaker instead of the second). It went so smoothly and within the time limit and I wanna just thank all of you who helped!! Thank you so freaking much!!!",

Everyone. Don\u2019t get embarrassed or feel bad if you do. Be prepared to present your topic without the use of slides if that happens (or make sure the conference host has a copy and can show them for you).\n\n I\u2019ve been to big tech and business academic conferences online this year where they keynote speakers had tech issues from home and had to just wing it or reconnect to the meeting or switch their microphone setup while live. \n\nGood luck!",
