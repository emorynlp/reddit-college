  "title:": "What questions do you wish you had asked during your tenure track faculty interview?",
  "text": "Hello all,\n\nI'm in the fortunate position to have advanced through an interview process with a great university in my field. This is for an assistant professor, tenure-track position at an R1. The university is in the USA (as am I), and I have a final round interview via Zoom next week. It's 8 hours of interviewing and I'll meet quite a few individuals.\n\nI have a list of questions I'll need them to answer for me, and of course have quite a few questions I expect (hope?) they'll ask me.\n\nHowever, I'm wondering if anyone that has interviewed for a similar position has any regrets? Specifically, were there any questions you really wished you'd have asked, but didn't think of at the time or were too timid to ask?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. Thank you!",

Our department is very social and people are all friends, to the point that it comes across in interviews without anyone asking (so we've been told). But were that not the case I'd very much like to ask that as a candidate. My Ph.D. department was dysfunctional, broken into warring camps that made it very hard for graduate students to navigate and I'm sure quite challenging for pre-tenure faculty who had to avoid pissing off anyone while making various groups think they sided with them.",

While most did lie, it was actually shockingly easy to tell who was lying and who went on to provide enthusiastic and positive details about their colleagues.

      "text": "I haven't been a candidate since the 90s so can't help from that perspective. But I've served on a *lot* of search committees (including some when I was a student) and I think it's really important to have good questions to ask the committee that show you have not only done your research but have thought about how you might fit into their department/institution.  I can't imagine doing a hire over Zoom...our on-campus interviews are typically three full days and include a lot of casual events (meals, coffees, tours, etc.) during which most of those questions get asked.  But that said, I always think it's helpful (as a committee member) when applicants ask questions that allow us to share insights into the institution so they can decide if it's the right place for them. That would include things like \"What do you like most about working here?\" \"What's the biggest professional challenge you find working here?\" \"How would you describe a typical student?\" and the like.  While these might seem mundane they really can uncover a lot of interesting responses and they in effect turn the tables for a bit-- they put the onus on the search committee to respond and share.\n\nBeyond that, questions about what the department is like can be very helpful. At an R1 in a big department it may not matter as much, but my department is <10 people even with contingent faculty included so we are all together often. We have to be able to work together and by choice we are very social as well. It's a great work environment and I truly consider my colleagues to be good friends as well. If we were applying for a position elsewhere I would ask directly how people get along, what the culture of departmental leadership is like, how service work is shared, how much time people spend actually in the office (vs at home or in a lab or whatever), things like that. \"Describe a typical workweek for a junior member of the department\" might be helpful too.",

I was born and raised in the city I work in, so I often am tapped to chat with candidates who have been offered the job but want to \u201ctalk about the city\u201d before accepting it. Usually we end up talking about a lot more, but it\u2019s a good excuse to talk to someone a little less formally and get some more information that could help them decide whether or not they accept. We had a unicorn candidate that we REALLY wanted and I know that they talked to 3 people in our department before accepting the position.",

You're TT, so you need able to accomplish your research goals, I saw some good advice in another comment about asking about student labor, grad students, lab start-up, or even regular equipment might not be standard. \n\nAt the end of the day you \\*must\\* accomplish your research and no one wants a 3 or 6 year failed search, so how can the university help you?\n\nDoes the department have a grant writer in your dept? What is the process of applying for a grant internally/what red tape is there that I need to be aware of? What happens when two people apply for the same grant, how is that dealt with?  Is there a marketing department and can you use those services? Does the department have any specific connection with XYZ people/organizations (that I have previously researched) who can help me with my research?",

Ask about the things which are really important to you.\n\nFor me, I would ask questions about access to research funds, hiring research assistants, what the policy is for conference travel funds, sabbatical policies, tenure expectations/requirements, socializing with your colleagues.  At job interviews I always ask about the thing people DISLIKE the most about the job and institution.  You'll usually get a bullshit answer for that one, but sometimes something will slip through that will give you some insight.\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "One thing to keep in mind, that I don't think I fully realized until my second or third interview is that the question \"Do you have any questions?\" is a test, and people will be evaluating you based on what you ask about, so you want to have a few questions based on the position.\n\nFor example if you are interviewing for a R1 TT job, you want your first questions to be things like: \"What sort of research and grant application resources/support does your school have available for faculty?\" or maybe something like \"What do you see as differentiating assistant professors who flourish here from those who struggle?\" (things that indicate you are interested in being research productive, bringing in grant dollars, and achieving tenure - be sure to ask about teaching supports / students / service requirements / collegiality later, if at all).\n\nAnother important tip, ask people the same question even if you already \\*know\\* the answer. Of course only do this when there are not people who have heard the question before in the room (if it's unavoidable, you can always start with - \"Jane already told me some great stuff about this, but I'm curious to hear what others have to say about...\" the research support/tenure success/best coffee shop in town).  For example I found it helpful to ask the same things about research supports to the dean, the chair, and various meetings with TT faculty.  First - this gives you some triangulation on answers (if one person says - we don't have any, you can sniff out if they are just grumpy deadwood, when others tell you there are 50 different small seed grants and offices) , and second, when they are telling you about the \"Office for Research Innovation\" for the third time, you can take a quick mental break to gather your thoughts and think about what's coming up next.  8 hours of interviewing is exhausting and you'll need/want to go on cruise control at some points.",
