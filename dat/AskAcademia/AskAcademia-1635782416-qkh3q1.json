  "title:": "Should I take these PhD redflags seriously?",
  "text": "Hello, I am looking at an interesting PhD. However there seem to be a few small redflags:\n\n-Previous guy in a similar position left after 2-years. I asked them why, they said he didn't like having \"too many projects at the same time\" or something. But didn't give me a clear explanation. I found the guy on linked in as I want to be SURE, and friended / messaged him. He accepted my request, read my message, and then unfriended me with no reply! I'm not sure it's for privacy reasons or he doesn't talk to random strangers, but it struck me as weird.\n\n-People there I talked to mention multiple projects (it's quite a big lab) so I would have to have many irons in the fire.\n\n-I came to visit the lab, they told me they would pay the train ticket. However, they recently transferred only 50 EUR to my bank, the train ticket, costed 180 Euros however. It's not a big deal for me, just that I thought it may indicate some BS *(EDIT: I sent them an email about the travel fee and it seems they mistook the VAT which was written at the bottom as the travel cost , they responded right away and said they will reimbourse.)*\n\n-They mentioned I will need to help people with their studies (I do IT/engineering research) to get their tools to work \"occasionally\". But there are many PhD's there and only 1 other engineer, so I got a feeling It might turn into a consultant job. I asked about this and they didn't directly address this point of mine, but mentioned I will be doing very original research myself which is not rudimentary or repetitive.\n\n-I told the lead PI that I needed about a week to think about it, he didn't reply since then(I assume no reply means 'ok'). Others in the lab are very helpful though when asking about renting and such things.\n\n-The PI is a successfull researcher but people I talked to mentioned they are \"pushed hard\" during their work to meet deadlines etc. \"You might need to stay in for an evening to get it done for tomorrow\".\n\nThese are minor things, but as it's several years and I haven't done a PhD before, I don't know if it means anything or could be a major issue down the line.",

      "text": "I will address your points in order:\n\n1. It's good that you reach out to former student. But you should shop around and ask other students. Preferably those who stays in the lab. That way you can have a more holistic views of the lab. One quitting student cannot tell the full story.\n\n\n2. That's normal. As long as they can manage it, no issue.\n\n\n3. They may have underestimate the cost. Seems to be an honest error and not a deliberate act.\n\n\n4. That's normal. Everyone helps everyone to do their research. As long as it does not disrupt your schedule, it's fine.\n\n\n5. Reply is a nice gesture but not necessary. PIs are busy.\n\n\n6. You will always find a workaholic PI in every university. They usually expect the same level of commitment from their students. If this is not for you, then don't take the offer.\n\n\nAll in all, more of a yellow flags rather than red. Do consider them before deciding.",
