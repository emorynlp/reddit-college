  "title:": "1st Year Question about Theoretical Framework",
  "text": "Am I wrong in understanding the purpose of the theoretical framework as this scene from the movie Usual Suspects? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4IlqqJ7z5k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4IlqqJ7z5k)\n\nUltimately the theory used is a simpler way to show the reader that you've read what the community of prior researchers have previously published. The goal of the framework is to convince the reader that you are trustworthy, that you know more than they do in this specific situation that you've laid out. \n\nPut another way, the reader will walk way from the framework knowing that:\n\n* the phenomenon is worth the reader's time to look at\n* you can describe the entirety of the problem\n* you've listed to all others who have tried to tackle the problem before\n* you accounted for all variables - those included and those intentionally excluded\n* they could replicate your results if they wanted to, but they trust that your work is sufficient\n* the results of this study will make a difference\n\nAm I understanding this correctly?",

      "text": "\nBeen a few years since I wrote my diss in Poli Sci but from what I remember the theoretical framework outlines the theory you will use as a framework for your whole project (influencing the methods and modes of analysis). \n\nYou use the lit review to situate yourself \u201cin conversation\u201d with others in the discipline.  So for example I wrote my diss on visuality in IR. My theoretical framework outlined where I stood in the discipline compared to the discipline as a whole (poststructuralist - which influenced what methods I used and my data) and my lit review placed me in conversation with others studying the same types of things (images in IR). \n\nHonestly the first 3 chapters of a social science dissertation (lit review, theoretical framework, and methodology) have so much overlap it can be hard to decide where they start and end. It\u2019s a good idea to check with other students in your cohort and also go online to your institution\u2019s library and download other peoples dissertations from your department published in the past 5 years and skim over them for ideas on chapter outlines. \n\nBest of luck!",

I know I'll get there it's just difficult grasping the nuances. I appreciate the advice on looking at recent dissertations published, that's a very practical way to find examples.",
