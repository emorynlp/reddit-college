In turn, this leads to publications of bullshit research, i.e. research that has managed to bullshit its way through the editorial and peer review process. This is why we currently face a replication crisis in many areas of science.\n\nNo question, just an observation.",

I've run across a number of studies that did not provide enough information to even attempt to reproduce the study, let alone try to apply the approach on a new data set. There are also cases where the supplementary information is referenced in the text, and both the caption and text do not match the actual data. Papers are also contain more experiments than before, without a corresponding increase in the length of the methods section. \n\nWith NIH grants, there is no longer an extensive methods section describing how an experiment will be done. I think this makes it hard to review if a proposal is reasonable on its own merits, so the focus is on what the lab has published before. \n\nThe whole system trains reviewers to avoid reviewing based on methods, because the full methods are often not provided.",

My boss doesn't have money to pay my salary without support. So. I will likely be quitting science now because of this. 2 years and 10 grants and nobody sees the potential in an older idea that was literally curing the disease. But why bother moving it forward? I mean, it fixed the mouse, so we know it works, let's find something else now......smh. scientists have no intent on curing disease. Only intent to understand it. It's taken a decade for me to really understand this. It's a shame. People are suffering because of this mentality.",
