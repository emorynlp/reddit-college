Do you have a system that works for you like a binder per class with dividers? A planner digital or paper with due dates? A lot of times the unorganized students are the ones doing worse. If you can't find last months notes there's no way you can study with them. And if youve no idea where you syllabus is its unlikely you know what chapters to read before attending lecture.",

I have about 6 years of experience in commercial software development and more than 10 years in programming at all. I want to get a bachelor degree to start scientific career. I'm sure that I know computer science well enough to get a degree, so I don't want to spend 4 years learning what I already know. However Russia is part of Bologna Process or something like this, so it is impossible in Russia to just pass tests and exams to get a degree. I know that it is possible to get a degree in this manner in some countries (at least US) remotely and than make it valid in Russia with the established bureaucratic process. How can I find a university to do it? My requirements are: tests and exams in English (or Russian), remote test passing (while I can go once to other country to pass an exam).",

I have been spending time in this subreddit and it seems most people here pursue PhDs because they dream of an academia position (professors..) so let me be clear I don't want to teach I just want to do research. So my questions are  \n1/ Is a PhD required for what I want to do?  \n2/ (if yes then) How important is the university reputation when I look for a research job (I have an offer from the same school as my engineering degree, the subject is interesting but the school isn't really known outside of my country)",
