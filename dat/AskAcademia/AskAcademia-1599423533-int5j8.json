  "title:": "Is it even realistic/feasible to become a professor anymore?",
  "text": "I have always wanted to become a professor.  I absolutely love teaching and was fortunate enough to have my name published on some publications throughout undergrad and grad school. However, due to the current job market, it seems that all Academia is filled with now are burnt out people making below minimum wages as adjunct professors. I want to become a professor, but I also need to put food on the table for my family. Is it actually realistic to become a professor without being some research rockstar? (especially with projected college attendance) If not, is a lecturer position easier to obtain? I\u2019m asking because I have a choice to either go into industry with my masters or get my Ph.D (and I don\u2019t want to commit more time to grad school if the job market is as awful as people say it is).",

Many open positions will even allow applications to professor positions from ABD (all but dissertation) grad students.\n\nThe catch-22 of this is that teaching is not part of your dissertation so it doesn't help you graduate. Me and a friend in my cohort both were teaching four classes a semester while working on our dissertations and we both were able to go straight to assistant professor positions at smaller schools after graduating. \n\nIf you have any follow up questions, I am happy to help.",

My school would be happy if I got a grant and reduce my teaching load to focus on the grant but is happy as long as I focus on students and student involvement.\n\nEven if this is not your field, check out this site for all current psych job postings\n\n http://psychjobsearch.wikidot.com/#toc10\n\nBrowse some postings and you can see just from the language which jobs put more emphasis on research or teaching.

My school requires no research for tenure, which is good because I have a very high teaching load. Literally the only time I have for research is the summer but the pay for teaching professors is also pretty low so I pick up extra courses or apply for opportunities elsewhere during those months to supplement my income in stead of doing research of my own.\n\nThis is honestly perfect for me (beyond the low pay) as I love teaching and never really loved research. But you have to know that you won't be doing much personal research during the school year at a teaching school without a pretty crazy schedule.",

I had a decent amount of teaching experience for a grad student -- the critical part is I had a coherent teaching philosophy and evidence to back up my teaching effectiveness. I also went to a top program in my field with very very high research expectations so I had a better than average research portfolio, which I think helped ease minds that I would be able to publish a few papers for tenure. In the end it's all about selling yourself to the kind of institution you want to be at. In my case those were places with mid-to-high teaching expectations and mid-to-low research expectations. But the balance would be much different at teaching-exclusive institutions like community colleges.\n\nEdit to add: I TA'ed 3 courses & taught 3 (1 co-taught) throughout my PhD to give you an idea of amount of teaching experience.",

Technically there are R1 through R4 schools, but I rarely hear about a school referring to it's status unless it's an R1. Uc Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD are R1 to name a few.\nYou might also hear the term SLAC- Small liberal arts college, these schools are more teaching focused and less competitive/research oriented.\n\nAn R01 is a type of grant awarded by the NIH (national institutes of health). These grants are very prestigious, generally around $2.5million in funding, and run for 4-5 years. It's not unheard of for professors at R1 schools to be the PI (principal investigator) of multiple R01 grants.\n\nThis was all alien to me when I was getting into academia, hope my explanation helps!",

Not always, but most of the time.\n\nI will say that right now in my department there is a lot of turnover happening with covid and online classes convincing a lot of the old guard to retire before they originally planned.

      "text": "Honestly, for the people saying an R1 is unlikely, come back to earth. A TT job at a SLAC in Nebraska would me much more than most PhD holder get in academia. You won't be able to choose. Sorry. \n\nWithout knowing your field,  I can tell you, I know what it feels like to want to be a professors. I was there 3 or 4 years ago. I'm now a professor at a research intensive institution by a mixture of unhealthy hard work, physical exhaustion, very good social skills and luck. Yes, there was some talent in the mix, but not as much as I'd like to think.  Particularly looking at the job market from this side of things. \n\nNow, you're making it sound like you have a family. If you have kids and your family relies on you mostly, you're probably looking at foodstamps. That is after you get your PhD, which will be a beast of its own. Strangely,  a PhD will give you a few years of sustainable stability. Of course,  it (never pay for one) should come with money (25,000 to 30,000 a year in the US, now in some areas). Again, never pay for a PhD. Nothing at all. Not even gym fees. It's not an \"investment\" unless you're in nursing and maybe some areas of business. And even in those fields you're looking at relocating where the work is. \n\nNow, for the love of god, don't become an adjunct. Adjuncts are not real professors. They're not academics. They are not part of the department, taken seriously, or needed. Yes: they're not needed because there are so many desperate people at the bottom of the barrel willing to teach whatever101 for 2,500 dolars a semester (just because it was their dream to be a professors) that their worth is near 0. Believe me when I say, I hate to say this because I know how theyre treated.  I only wish all of them would find real jobs that pay them decently so that academia can sink, and we can start again without slavery. I wish better for them, regardless of what it may sound.\n\nOne last point: lecturers. You ask about becoming a lecturer being  maybe easier. That'll depend. A lecturer at Cal State Fullerton is, basically, nobody in academic terms...it's a schoolteacher who happens to teach at a place with \"University\" attached to its name. A lecturer at Princeton? Much better money, pretty much a glorified high school teacher,  but good place to work with some professional development opportunities. In between these two you have good institutions (U of Florida), mid rank institutions (Colorado State) and crap institutions (Kennesaw State) where, regardless, youll always be reminded that youre second class to TT and T'ed. If you're cool with that, no problem. \n\nOh, by the way,  if teaching is your passion, academia will destroy you more than anything else.\n\nBest of luck,  and whatever you don't, please, don't be an adjunct. Respect yourself.",

Sounds familiar? \n\nMoreover, there are still pockets in academia where you can make good money, get paid for all 12 months, and enjoy yourself. There are also vast swaths of academia where an academic job is an equivalent of winning a lottery ticket, as you yourself know. Yet all of this is public knowledge and could be easily researched prior to choosing a career where you feel underpaid and under appreciated. Just saying.",

And yes, I'll be patiently waiting for your update in two years once you encounter and endure structural pressures. \n\nAnd the attitude towards adjuncts really is a different story and it's not about them as people, but about the role they decide to accept in academia, and the system the perpetuate by enslaving themselves.

I would have gone straight to industry. If the structural pressures are more than I can bear, as you anticipate, I can still go into industry. We paint a very grim picture here, and it's true if tenure is the dream.\n\nI don't know that it's fair to put the ENTIRE burden of the adjunct/full-time pay gap on the adjunct.

A possible exception to this is if you've built up a track record (either during your PhD or perhaps in your first postdoc) of getting a lot of grant money (institution and advisor be darned).\n\nIf you mean \"visiting professor\" or some other fancy term for \"postdoc\" then those positions are easier to get but it's really just a postdoc, don't fool yourself (and you should only get a postdoc if you fit the criteria listed above for an R1 job).\n\nIf you mean any faculty position down to adjunct lecturer at any institute of higher learning including obscure CCs and regional campuses then those are also easier to get.\n\nIf you mean \"research professor\" at an institution in a developing country (including China) then my understanding is you have a much better shot.  Especially in China where I believe they are going through their faculty hiring boom analogous to what the US went through during the Cold War, but I could be wrong. But those positions may be reserved for Chinese PhDs or people who are already internationally-known (to lend prestige).\n\nRemember, we're facing a demographic cliff in higher ed. There are *no* signs that hiring is going to pick up, and *lots* of signs that 50% of universities and colleges in the US could close forever in twenty years.

      "text": "I got hired as an adjunct through my former program director who also taught in it. Was not that hard to get ones foot in the door really. He and the departments just wanted someone who had drive, commitment and a proven ability to contribute to the program. Helped a lot that i was the one who designed the rehash of the capstone course with/for him as based on my previous M.S. so he had me teach that and cover down here and there. Really more often than not just need to show what you know and can do to specific people and build a relationship with them. \n\n>seems that all Academia is filled with now are burnt out people making below minimum wages as adjunct professors.\n\nBurnt out sure, but that has a lot to do with the type of job in question and the outright demoralizing aspect of dealing with students 9 out of 10 of whom do not want to even try to apply themselves and are only in the courses for sake of filling in degree requirements. those same 9/10 don't even bother to properly proofread their submissions and tend to damn near exclusively rely on grammarly to do their work for them.(read the damn papers out loud to catch your mistakes... grammarly aint gonna catch them all, let alone the serious ones.) \nThereafter nothing like spending some hours grading and annotating papers for point of improvement, tips on topic exploration etc, talking to the students about it all and then.. being wholly ignored and the next paper being just as much in need of improvement as as the first. Just makes you feel like you've wasted your time trying to help them learn and develop as graduate students... the worst part honestly is when you meet someone who is super bright and capable, but they just don't care to apply themselves to do things right. Super depressing and demoralizing. Once some family issues came bearing down i resigned... was super depressed and burned out by then. the work was super easy and relaxed... but the psychological aspects of the rest, and the drama some students started each semester to try and get out of doing their work were not all that much \"fun\".\n\nBelow minimum wage? Don't know about that. Was making roughly $24 an hour setting my own hours for online instruction with 3-6 hours in person per week. \nMost of my lectures were something like 20 minutes long and everything past them were in person instruction trying to deal with the students themselves directly through various means.\nKind of had to since the capstone projects were student specific things.  Am also a military retiree, so the money itself was just a nice extra.. not something i actually needed. \n\nMost of my fellow adjuncts had multiple universities they worked at to provide online lectures, or were from an external institution doing the same at mine. \n\nYou want permanent tenured faculty etc position? a \"research professor\" one? yah those are hard as fuck to get in to.. but the path usually starts at a lower level as an adjunct with your foot\nin the door and going forward from there. \n\n>Is it actually realistic to become a professor without being some research rockstar?\n\nIt can be, i'm no research rockstar.. i just had to show i was capable to the right people. In academia much as elsewhere knowing the right people and making the right contacts gets you the job... \nsitting at home researching and not talking to people will usually get you nowhere fast. That whole thing about hiring a known capable contributor with a friendly face vs. a total stranger. \n\n>If not, is a lecturer position easier to obtain?\n\nYes, TAs can, and do give lectures all of the time. Graduate TA can \"help\" a professor give under graduate lectures quite handily... though in all honesty it will be the TA doing all of the work sans\nsome critical grading, and lecture specific stuff they are handed. \n\n>I\u2019m asking because I have a choice to either go into industry with my masters or get my Ph.D (and I don\u2019t want to commit more time to grad school if the job market is as awful as people say it is).\n\nHonestly, which do you think would make you more money and which do you think you would enjoy more?",

Depending on your field, getting a job as a TT is not as much of a long shot as many people make it sound. \n\nIt's also very field dependent. It helps a lot if you're in a field with a job market that competes with industry. For example, PhDs in data science, machine learning, statistics have no problem finding academic jobs right now, typically no postdoc needed.",

It doesn\u2019t sound like you are in one of those fields as you make it sound like academia is the only major employment option you would have. If that is the case, you are taking a risk. Specifically you could find yourself completing your PhD and then realizing that you don\u2019t want to be an academic. That happens a lot and you would have just wasted your time. That is problematic. Moreover, you don\u2019t seem all that motivated to get a PhD. That is also problematic. Lastly, you seem to have a rather negative opinion of many of the people who would be your future colleagues. That is problematic. Regardless of the academic job market, you should really think about why you want a PhD and work out all your potential options.",
