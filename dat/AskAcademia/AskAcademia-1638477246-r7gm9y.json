  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm currently finishing my studies on International Relations and i feel stuck with my thesis. I am procrastinating and after lots of thinking I've come to the conclusion that the reason why is fear. Possibly fear of failure and letting my professor down. \n\nI don't want to blame covid and quarantine for feeling unmotivated. Of course it has contributed to this situation, but I blame it entirely on me and my stupid fears. Moreover, this fear of the unknown has made me scared of writing something. Deadline is coming and i feel like sh**!\n\nWhat am I supposed to do? \nHave you ever faced something similar and if so, how did you overcome this obstacle?\n\nAny advice is more than welcomed. \nThank you!",

      "text": "Of course,  I think everyone has these fears.  It's basically why procrastination exists. What helps sort of depends on you/ your specific situation. \n\nWhat has helped me is separating who I am from the work that I do.  Your dissertation is not a representation of you,  it is documentation of the work that you have done. It is not going to be your only contribution to your field.  I think only one person has ever won a noble prize with a dissertation. If you write a \"bad\" dissertation (and I'm sure you won't) it will because the write up isn't complete enough,  or refined enough,  or detailed enough.  It's not because you are a bad grad student. Or a failure.  The dissertation just needs more work.  \n\nTake a deep breadth and start now.  Make an outline.  Write the methods.  Make a figure.  Whatever.  This is what you do,  for a living.  Be brave.",

      "text": "Hearing uplifting music and that inspires you or gives you energy, during or before writing (some people can't do both simultaneously ). In my dissertation, I named the chapters with the title of the main songs I heard while typing lol nobody commented on that at the time and things went smooth.  \nFor your fear: hey, you can do it! You are so far in the course, almost finishing it, you're much stronger than that self-sabotaging shadow! If your professor accepted to be your tutor is because he/she also believes in you and that you're perfectly capable. Everyone makes mistakes and that's why we show our dissertation to a professor and/or a very discerning friend before sending the official version - even those scholars with many decades of academic work do the same. Don't be too hard on yourself. Write everything you can first, then you revise and adjust what might be needed and then reach out to someone else.   \nBest wishes",

      "text": "Yes sir/ma\u2019am. Dealing with that right now. Writing is an art that allows you to polish turds of data and spin your own narrative. Think of it as an artistic exercise. When all else fails, turn off all distractions amd force yourself in your chair until you write. I rarely know how things are going to come out of my head until I sat there for a good hour or more. Just do it. Get it done.",
