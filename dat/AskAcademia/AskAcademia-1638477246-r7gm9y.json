  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm currently finishing my studies on International Relations and i feel stuck with my thesis. I am procrastinating and after lots of thinking I've come to the conclusion that the reason why is fear. Possibly fear of failure and letting my professor down. \n\nI don't want to blame covid and quarantine for feeling unmotivated. Of course it has contributed to this situation, but I blame it entirely on me and my stupid fears. Moreover, this fear of the unknown has made me scared of writing something. Deadline is coming and i feel like sh**!\n\nWhat am I supposed to do? \nHave you ever faced something similar and if so, how did you overcome this obstacle?\n\nAny advice is more than welcomed. \nThank you!",
