  "text": "Hi,  I am applying to grad school and I need 3 letters of rec and I emailed asking teachers from my undergrad that I knew the best during my time there. So far one wrote me a great letter but two others have not responded to my email at all and it has been a couple weeks. The deadline would be in a month and I understand they may be busy so in a week or so if they still do not respond I was planning on sending a follow up email but not sure what to say without sounding pushy or desperate. Any advice would be much appreciated :)",

      "text": "To be honest, you probably should have emailed them more than a month in advance (assuming your initial email was recent). Following up in a week is probably a good idea. You could mention that you sent a previous email but weren\u2019t sure if they received it, and repeat the text you sent last time. But I\u2019d line up another recommender or two in the meantime. \n\nWhen I was in grad school and going on the job market, I had a heck of a time getting my *committee members* to write letters for me. Even with 2\u20133 months advance notice.",

Unfortunately, it can be hard to know which is which. I\u2019ve made it a priority to be responsive to students because I had such a bad experience myself. But it\u2019s something you\u2019ll probably see a lot of if you remain in academia.",

The letter is due on X at Ypm and I've listed the website/contact at the end of this email. Additionally, I know we are all busy with the ongoing semester, so I've included my resume/CV along with a document that may help in writing my letter. Please let me know ASAP if I you are unable to finish a letter in time so that I can find an alternative letter writer.\n\nThank you again,\n\nFanEast289",
