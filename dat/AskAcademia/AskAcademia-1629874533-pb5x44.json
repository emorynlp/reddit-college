  "text": "Currently reviewing a paper and I can't for the life of me figure out which referencing style the author has used. What I do know is that this is not APA or CMOS.\n\nRowley, J.W., Campbell, N., and Hood, J.

Thank you so much in advance. :)\n\nEdit: Thank you to all who replied. Turns out the authors just slapped on whatever they felt like without conforming to a specific style. Journal website didn't have any info but I spoke to someone on the board and they need APA 7, so that's resolved. :)",

The question is if the author followed the guidelines of the journal you are reviewing for. (Some reviewers don't bother with this stuff, but personally, I am something of a stickler here. If I nag my students about this, I think professional researchers should manage as well.) I would just check the instructions for authors at the journal's webpage and take it from there.",
