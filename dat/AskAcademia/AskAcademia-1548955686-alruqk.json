  "title:": "When professors say things like, \u201cLet\u2019s keep in touch,\u201d what do they mean? What should I do?",
  "text": "I\u2019m not sure what they mean by this, or if it\u2019s only being polite. There are some of my professors I am/was close to and would like to stay in contact with, both for recommendation possibilities and because their work is interesting, but I also don\u2019t want to bother them unnecessarily and am not good at all at just chatting with people for the sake of it. For example one of my humanities professors did research on one of my favorite authors, and it had nothing to do with their class so we didn\u2019t really talk about it, and the semester ended but they said I was welcome to come talk to them in the future, but I don\u2019t think either of us enjoy small talk or unnecessary office hours. Another one of my professors knows a lot about places I\u2019d like to travel to, but again the class is over and we both have other stuff going on so there\u2019s nothing really relevant to talk about. Still, I\u2019d like them to know I still exist and care about their work and maybe ask for recommendations down the line. I guess my question is, how should I keep in contact with professors without taking up their time? Email once in a while?\n\nEdit: Wow this got more attention than I expected. Thank you everyone for all your replies and advice! ",

That could be in an email, or dropping by office hours. Makes me feel good, and should you ever want a recommendation, it keeps you in my mind. If you're worried about being a bother, you can keep those sorts of contacts to no more than 1-3 per year. I'm thinking about my most curmudgeonly colleagues and I don't know any who would dislike that.",

Staying in touch with a professor is like any other relationship. You need to pay attention to cues. \n\nBut we're truly interested in how some of our former students are doing, so if you judge that \"keep in touch\" was sincere, keep in touch.",

For me, keeping in touch means telling me about the work they're doing, whether they feel like their education has made a difference, what they hope to do in the future, really anything. I also like to hear about their families - do they have a significant other? kids? Really just hearing how they are when they write is something I always appreciate.",

      "text": "Literally keep in touch, as you would with any other person. Send an occasional email or connect on social media if you've graduated and moved away. If you're still on campus, drop in and say hello sometime. It's a social relationship like any other and requires some modest effort to maintain. It's fine to drop in and say \"Hey, I'm planning a trip to Paris for June and know you've been there often, what would you recommend?\" Or \"Hey, I finally read that essay you mentioned in class last fall, it was great!\" Keeping in touch can be a 30 second \"Hello!\" at the office door or coffee/lunch on or off campus. Or just an email.\n\nI have a former student from the late 1990s that calls about once a month to touch base and talk about life. Another from the mid-2000s that connect on social media maybe once a month. One from the class of 2017 that emails often with interesting stories from work (she's in a field I teach). And a great many that just drop by my office and say hey when they're in the building. Others just email when something cool happens: job, marriage, grad school, publications, cool trips, new dog, you name it.\n\nWhatever works for you-- it's not a requirement, but when I'm asked for a letter of recommendation or a reference a few years after a student has graduated it's certainly easier to write a good one if they've made an effort to connect beyond simply coming to class.",
