  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI am a researcher at a German Uni in climate physics, non-binary and neurodiverse (and not German not English). At last, I am at the point where I will be advertising my own PhD position. However, from past experiences and friends' ones, I noticed that there is a lack of diverse applications.   \nDoes anyone has some suggestion on how to improve it in the pool of candidates?   \nI am aware that removing the looked traits as mandatory, helps. But what else?  \n\n\nCause for myself the \"the university X strives for a diverse blabla\" does not work, it seems like prepacked front-words .. and I wonder if I am not the only one.   \nAny suggestion on how to improve it is welcome!! :) thanks!",

      "text": "Start with paying any undergrads in your lab. I believe this is the number one way to diversify stem. Undergrads of color or low income background are often disproportionately excluded from research experience opportunities because they are asked to do so without pay and they have to hold down another job to pay for their other expenses like rent, food, transportation, etc. this is what happened to me and made it really difficult for me to get as much research experience as some of my more privileged peers who had everything payed for by their parents and were able to fully volunteer their time to a lab. Paying undergrads levels that out so that more diverse students can gain the necessary research experience to apply for grad school. Even if they don\u2019t decide to do grad school with you you\u2019ll still be contributing to diversifying the phd student pool. \n\nWhen I was picking my PI was really appreciative of the diversity statement on her personal lab page which said \u201cin this lab we believe Black Lives Matter, immigrants are welcome, love is love, feminism is for everyone\u201d things along those lines. I think I was really drawn to their willingness to put those specific issues on their personal lab page rather than just the blanket diversity statements given on the home page of the university. It was more meaningful to me and attracted me there more. I also liked that my PI, while caring about diversifying her lab, also clearly appreciated my knowledge and experience and was convinced of my potential. She wasn\u2019t just trying to use me for a cover photo or to increase funding. I think it\u2019s important to lead with that attitude. \n\nAs an undergraduate I went to a minority serving institution. Try starting your recruitment efforts there. \nGood luck!",

      "text": "There is a lot of stigma against revealing some forms of diversity (disability, ADHD, autism...) and others (sexual orientation, socioeconomic class) are unlikely to come up in the hiring process. Gender might come up, if pronouns end up being relevant. It also might not.\n\nBut my point is that a lot of people who can conceal their minority traits during application will do so, for good reason. So even if they are applying to your group, you might not know until after they've joined and gotten to know you - perhaps not even then.\n\nI think there are ways to communicate that a research group's culture will be welcoming and supportive of diversity and of different accommodation needs (explicitly stating this is a start), which might make your group more attractive to a range of applicants, but whether you'll *know* you're succeeding may be harder to determine.",

For more traditional candidates around me with similar skills, they wouldn't even think of hesitating to apply for the same jobs. Apparently years of not being taken seriously as a queer female-presenting person in STEM by my very, very traditional society where women are still thought of only as \"office ladies\" and not taken seriously, has taken its toll. Yes, I'm intimidated by applying to the same programs that another person of similar skills would apply to without hesitation.\n\nI'm still privileged because I have money/time to spend on applying, but add a socioeconomically disadvantaged background to this, and I can easily see how a \"diverse\" candidate would try to save their time/money by not even bothering with the programs we think won't even give us the time of day.\n\nSure, as someone experienced in academia maybe *you* know that impostor syndrome is a problem for everyone - but as a beginner to academia who literally has no clue about how things work yet, I definitely don't know that - and for the reasons above have all the more reason to believe I just am not as competent as the other outwardly confident colleagues.",

It isn't so much merit alone but rather connections to prestige that gets people tenure, good postdocs, etc. Now while you do have to have \"some\" connection to people who are already established, I think people largely use brand name prestige as a proxy for quality.  But this tends to make academic culture stale, as only a few people are setting up the academic prohrammes for the rest of the fields, and the incoming people are copycats of their mentors.\n\nSo how can we avoid this? By actually looking for people on their merits rather than largely who they know... some publications and talks, communication of ideas, originality, clarity of thought and rigor, etc. But then you have to widen the pool when it comes to who you are willing to look at, and make the effort to find candidates from unlikely sources.   \n\nDiversity, in this respect, actually  optimizes for merit because it keeps academic work fresh. Note here that I'm not referring so much to the typical designated categories of diversity (race, gender, orientation, economic status etc. ), but by looking beyond the brand name feeder schools instead of using prestige as a proxy for merit,  you are far less likely to dismiss the applications coming from people in underrepresented groups anyway because they tend to be less connected than groups that were traditionally well represented.",

It\u2019s really sad to see so many people in stem follow these absolutely baseless narratives instead of formulating their beliefs around the actual overwhelming research and data supporting the evidence of institutionalized obstacles inhibiting minorities from stem. Weren\u2019t we supposed to be the ones using research and statistics to formulate our opinions? It\u2019s sad to see that so many people in stem are still dying on hills like this. Fortunately these fanatic ideologies are mostly dying off now but it\u2019s really embarrassing to watch people like you still defending claims like this with exactly 0 evidence and then claim to be a \u201clogical academic\u201d",
