  "title:": "Need advice telling a student \"no\"",
  "text": "(Solved) This is my first semester teaching. My students have a lengthy paper due Tomorrow at 11:59 p.m. I held an office hour on T,R,F last week. I received an email from a student asking me to read his final paper, give him feedback, and tell him what grade he'd receive. \n\nIt's Sunday, I'm not reading anything. But writing feedback at some point on Monday will probably be too late for him to make changes. How do I tell him \"No, you had your chance last week.\" without getting dinged on course evaluations?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the helpful responses and reassurance! As I mentioned, this is my first semester and have literally never had to tell a student \"I'm not helping you right now\" before.",

No extra work needed; problem solved!\n\n**Seriously, though**, while I agree with the boundaries others are suggesting you communicate, to soften it you could certainly write something such as \"Hi, X. I would have loved to have been able to give you some feedback on your paper before it was due. Unfortunately, I'm out of time! I really wish you had caught me during my office hours (t, th, f); I like to help students such as you who are motivated to do their best.\"\n\n(And if they've gotten decent grades thus far): \"Looking at your past work, I'd be surprised if it weren't a [grade]; you seem to be pretty consistent.\"\n\n\"Hopefully, you'll be able to catch me sooner next time during my office hours!\"\n\n-Best,\nDrMcSocralSac\n\nYou've set your boundary, made it personal (rather than coming off as a heartless a$$, which is how a young kid might read it, even if unintended), and kept the door open for future positive encounters. Only a d*ck would rate you poorly after that.",

It gives an explanation of why you couldnt even if you wanted to, but doesnt devalue the student or make them feel bad (especially if the situation is out of their control).

But I don't do that for most assignments; if anyone asks I simply tell them that I don't have time to do that for everyone so it wouldn't be fair to do it for one student.\n\nWhat I will do for students is agree to read and provide *brief* feedback on some small section of a paper-- the intro, conclusion, a set of footnotes, a body paragraph, etc. --as long as I get it at least 48 hours before it's due, not counting weekends. Not many take me up on that.\n\nSend them to your writing center in the future. It's too late now, but usually a writing tutor can read a full draft and provide feedback on areas of concern (thesis, argument, evidence, structure, mechanics, etc.) if you make an appointment in advance.",

I only read drafts of major papers only through 2 weeks before they're due.

From my perspective it also keeps me from having to read things slapped together at the last minute.\n\nAlso, are you sure that student evaluations are still open?

The student is a human who deserves respect. \n\nDo not sway on your boundaries. You also do not have to apologize. Starting with \"I'm sorry\" puts you at fault, when you aren't. You did nothing wrong to apologize for. Restate those opportunities that this student can take advantage of next attempt. I often encourage students for attempting to get help, just remind that it needs to be done within the timeline provided. \n\nThe second point is to write it when you aren't frustrated and when you are \"on the clock.\" Don't answer with spite or mocking the student. It's professional and firm, but never snarky or rude. This is just another human on the planet trying to get by. Not to imply you would be rude...but ego is a problem in educators sometimes.",

          "text": "OP: you should _never_ have to spell out to a student that you \u201ctook the day off\u201d on the weekend. These are your days off. Likewise a student shouldn\u2019t expect a response at 10pm - this is a completely unreasonable expectation that contributes to staff burn out. \n\nThis is your job, not your life. As for the response, I think you\u2019ve got some good templates elsewhere but I\u2019d reiterate the point that you should not apologise.",
