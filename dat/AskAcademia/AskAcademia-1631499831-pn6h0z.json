Respond to each part of the question then check that you have covered the overlap or relationship among the points (make an outline in the margin). Make an outline for each question as question 5 might remind you of something for question 2. \nYouve worked hard and absorbed more than you think.\nBest wishes.",

I worked in a group with three other classmates and we wrote essays back and forth, critiqued each other's essays, and kept building them back up. It helped me engage more deeply with the subject matter. We did a lot to just generally boost each other's morale too. Made such a difference.\n\nGood luck!!",

Have adecent meal the night before - helps with the sleep and hard to concentrate if you are hungry.\n\nIf this is oral based, check to see if you should dress professionally. \n\nSet your alarms. You don't want 6o be late.\n\nAnd remember, many others have done this and survived.  So can you.",
