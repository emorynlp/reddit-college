  "title:": "Research Gaps for SMEs and/ or digital transformation",
  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am currently in my first semester of a MSc. Operations Management and I got a course on qualitative research methods, which is really not my thing.\n\nAs a final examination I need to write a research proposal and am struggling to identify a research gap/ topic.\n\nI intended to do a multiple case study on how important SMEs find specific dynamic capabilities for their digital transformation. However, after deciding on that topic I found one paper from this year (one of only 10 total combining SME, dynamic capabilites and digital transformation) which did exactly this and thus renders my gap unusable (question mark?).\n\nTo this I have a question: so far, research examining SME digital transformation  have solely focused on the \"made in Italy\" industry and have called for research in other contexts for generalization purposes. Does this itself provide a gap strong enough or would my professor question the originality of my proposal then?\n\nOtherwise I am reaching out to ask this community if anyone knows about research gaps in the field(s) of:\n-SME\n-internationalization\n-digital transformation\n-digitalization\n-dynamic capabilities\n\nAny suggestions and/ or feedback on my idea is greatly appreciated!",
