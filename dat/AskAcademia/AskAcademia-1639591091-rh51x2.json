      "text": "> Do you usually do a standard 40 hrs/week, 9 Am-5 Pm kinda thing? \n\nLOL. There's no standard week as an academic. Regardless of whether you're in the lab or not. \n\n> Do you work during the summer when unis are closed (or also in other similar periods like over Christmas)? \n\nUniversities don't close in the summer. There are just fewer students. Lots of work gets done and many conferences happen in the summer. \n\nMy University shuts for 4-5 days over Christmas, but most people take two weeks. \n\n> Can you independently decide to WFH whenever you want as long as you don't have any pressing commitments in the office? How much flexibility do you have?\n\nCurrently, due to the pandemic, lots of flexibility. Ordinarily it's limited because there's still supervision, teaching, meetings, talks, etc to attend.",

      "text": "I'm in astro theory/computation in Australia. I tend to stick to a 9-5 schedule, with a bit of work done at other times when work is being done with international collaborators, deadline weeks or just to set up simulation runs. \nWhere I am, university tends to be open and running even when students aren't around, but close for about 10 days for Christmas and New year's. So I tend to stop working when it closes unless there's something urgent to be done. Aside from that I just take a full week off every few months with my partner. I usually plan those if I'm anticipating a rush of work to be completed, then I can take a good break knowing that I've just finished off a few projects",

      "text": "I mainly WFH when I am not teaching. Most people that I collaborate with are not usually on campus during the day anyway (the pandemic being one cause, and them working in  other places another one).\n\nAs a simple Software Engineer I really don't need much. Just my laptop/pc, some resources on the cloud/on remote servers, a few software licences, and access to literature through my library's online resources. Usually.\n\nHours are very dependent on the current workload. I usually try to work 8am-4pm. Mainly because that is when my toddler is in the daycare. I do everything in can to avoid working after 4pm. Which is extremely hard and usually 1 or 2 times every week my husband has to pick up our kid and take care of them in the evening so I can work bonus 2-4 hours.\n\nI don't work on weekends unless absolutely neccesary - like an important deadline. This happens maybe 6 times during the year.\n\nI sometimes also get slow days during the week when I can take it easy and simply relax. I think maybe 2 or 3 every month. \n\nDuring the summer I take a month off. I attempt not to work then. Which never fully happens (good luck telling a deadline to wait for tthe end of your vacation..). But that is not more than maybe 4 days of work (during my monthly vacation).\n\nI am not in the US by the way.",
