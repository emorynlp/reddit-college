  "title:": "Blackballed by department for reporting gender bias to the chair... should I stay or should I go?",
  "text": "This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons.\n\nI\u2019m a female PhD student in a leading department in my field.  I started my PhD in a lab that was a top choice for me and I was really excited about it.\n\nNot long into that lab experience, my adviser made direct comments about my ability to succeed based on my gender.  These were made verbally, just me in his office\u2014 so unfortunately, no witnesses.\n\nDespite the awful comments, I trudged forward thinking I didn\u2019t really need to change my adviser\u2019s opinion of all women\u2014 just me.  So I thought if I could prove my ability to stack up to the male students who already had my adviser\u2019s approval, then maybe I\u2019d be just fine.\n\nYou can guess that it wasn\u2019t fine and the bias continued no matter what I did, so I did the only thing I could and I left the lab.  The only other lab with an opening was one that was about as far left field from my interests as one could get\u2014 but it was my only lifeline to stay enrolled\u2014 so I went for it.\n\nYou can also guess that that experience wasn\u2019t going to last long term... and it didn\u2019t.  I simply didn\u2019t have enough in common with that lab to forge a path forward.  In a stroke of luck, though, a professor in a different department entirely took an interest in me and offered me a place in their lab.... complete with an offer to fully transfer departments, which I have pursued and is where I am currently.\n\nAt the same time, though, I also realized that if my academic path was so irrevocably altered by the first lab, it was the morally correct thing to say *something* to *someone.*\n\nSo I reported my experience in the first lab to the department chair in a private meeting behind closed doors.  Instead of taking the report gracefully, the chair responded by convening a meeting of the faculty\u2014 including the adviser in question\u2014 and telling them everything I said (including telling them it was me, by name).  The faculty subsequently ruled to ban me from continuing to work on ongoing research projects with my original adviser\u2014 projects that I was otherwise supposed to see to completion.  Specifically, the decision is going to cost me publication opportunities that were fully intended for me to write.  Given this response by the faculty, I involved a university office, which is investigating.  The investigation is ongoing, but a high-ranking university official has already indicated that the university position will be in favor of escalating this to a full Title IX complaint.  \n\nSo.... here\u2019s the rub.... I\u2019m in a new department, which is nice... but my original department holds a lot of clout in my field, and\u2014 even having switched departments\u2014 my adviser and I had always expected to include several of them on my dissertation committee and to ask to use equipment/resources in that department.  It\u2019s too hard to explain\u2014 and would make this post even less anonymous than it already is\u2014 but the intention is that I will apply for academic positions in the same departments as my former department, not my new one.  The former department will always be the best fit for me and my background.  The new department is okay only because of this one particular adviser, if that makes sense.\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far... the question is whether it\u2019s futile for me to stay in my current PhD program, knowing I\u2019m blackballed by my former program, which is linked in with all the programs in which I\u2019ll want to apply for jobs someday.  Also knowing I may not be able to use any of them on my dissertation committee.  Furthermore, my current adviser knows my former department... so it\u2019s not totally clear how all this will affect my relationship with them either.  I feel like I\u2019m stuck between a rock and a hard place.... and I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.  I want to get a PhD, but I also don\u2019t want to find out at the very end that I was screwed all along.  Help!",

So it\u2019s hard to say if everyone *actually* agrees. \n\nAlso, on a related point, all of this is actually written/documented in email chains, which I find even more shocking than the treatment itself.",

      "text": "I dont want to be a debbie downer here, just want to share my experience. I was in a very similar situation as yours, but it involved very blatant sexual harassment that was obvious to a lot of people and another professor reported it to the dept director. An ombudsman then became involved and HR. My dept director was pissed and HR totally tried to cover it up. Then the blackballing began. They took away my graduate assistantship and made life very difficult for me. \n\nI attempted to transfer to another field that could accommodate my interests and the professors there were awesome. I signed up for an advanced stats class with them and one day the female prof kept me after class and warned me that people from my dept were telling her chair bad things about me in an attempt to keep them from accepting me and it was kind of working. It was then that I finally got really pissed and decided that leaving may the only practical option. I had a few professors in my corner who spoke out for me, but the others who banded together held too much clout.\n\nSo then I got the OCR involved. They conducted an investigation and made a deal with the university. At the conclusion, the OCR attorney advised me to just move on and \"get on with my life.\" I was a year and a half away from my PhD. Needless to say, I was devastated. One of the good profs knew someone who dealt with sexual harassment cases and she told me I had a \"multi-million dollar\" lawsuit on my hands, but no one in this godforsaken state was willing to take on the university. So I left. \n\nI think the important thing to take away is that the OCR does not always do the right thing. They did not protect me from retaliation at all and just told me to move on. I dont know if it's just the area I'm in or what. I do think that consulting with an attorney is a good idea. The state I live in now is very pro-business and it is difficult to find lawyers who take on companies, universities, or government institutions. \n\nI wish the best. It is a terrible situation to be in. My lifelong dream was shattered, but I dont know if theres anything I could have done differently except perhaps found an out of state attorney to maybe offer some guidance. Hopefully the state you're in is better than the one I'm in.",
