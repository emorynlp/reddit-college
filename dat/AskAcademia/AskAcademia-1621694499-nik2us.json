  "title:": "Can you study Computer Science without being super passionate about it?",
  "text": "Atm I study philosophy at uni and due to some logic courses I took I remembered how I used to enjoy programming a few years ago in school and I wasn't too bad at it. Since then I've been thinking about switching to studying computer science. Like I said, I used to quite like programming and in general am interested in the topic as a whole but I am not someone who for example creates websites in their free time or does projects on their own and stuff like that. I feel like a lot of people who study cs are super passionate about it and know so much about computers (which I don't) and spend their free time programming. I'm not like that but still interested in cs, do you think it's a good idea if I still try? I'm also a bit insecure about switching to cs since I'm a girl and the subject is still widely male dominated at my uni (50 women and 250 men) and I don't want to fill out the stereotype of women not being able to do math or code.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I loved the logic courses I did in philosophy and want to switch to cs but I'm not too tech-savvy or do coding  projects for fun - is it a good idea if I still try? At school I was quite good at math and coding.",

      "text": "Software engineering != computer science. It really depends on how CS at your uni is taught. If it\u2019s more theoretical and mathematically rigorous (this is the real CS you do in grad school) then it sounds like you are more likely to enjoy it than those who study it just to become software/web developers. If it\u2019s more practical/industry-oriented then it doesn\u2019t sound like an amazing fit for you.\n\nBut to answer your question in the title: yes. CS is quite useful that even if you don\u2019t feel super passionate about it at first you might grow to like it for practicality alone. But if you don\u2019t care about projects and code development, why don\u2019t you consider studying math instead?",

I'm at the University of Basel (Switzerland) and as far as I can tell you do a lot of theory & math but it's also described as \"application-oriented\". I never thought about studying math and I don't think it would be the right thing for me. I did quite enjoy the projects I had to do at school (e.g. build a website from scratch only using code, make your own little adventure game) so I would like to have a more practical component in my study field :) and adding to that I think finding a job after studying CS is probably easier than if you do math (or philosophy).",

I think European math degree is generally quite pure, not much applied. CS now does sounds like a good path for you. Good luck!",

I was at a school that was a bad fit for me, and *that* hampered me quite a bit, but I found having a general interest but not a DRIVE for logic and coding to be the perfect balance to keep myself motivated in school, but not, for instance, demotivate me through disappointing course after disappointing course.\n\nI also eventually gave up on programming as a profession, but I think here is where I differ from /u/RaddishEater666. I really want my job to be where I'm passionate.

      "text": "I'll take a wild stab based on what you wrote and suggest the following. I know someone who switched from Philosophy to Math to CS because she loved logic and proofs. She graduated with a Ph.D. this spring. A lot of what I'm going to write is based on my discussions with her. I myself am a female Ph.D. student in software/network security.\n\nIt might not look this way to the outsider, but proofs and [formal methods](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/des_s99/formal_methods/) are a huge part of CS research. It's the same with [designing algorithms](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/) \\-- it's not just about programming; you have to think about the time complexity (how long it takes to run), space complexity (how much space it takes), and prove these things. Most machines today can handle algorithms that have polynomial complexity. For example, if the size of the \"input\" is N, then the runtime is proportional to N\\^2. But then there's this whole class of problems for which a polynomial algorithm hasn't yet been discovered! \\[I oversimplified a few things here to give you a flavor of the vast area of CS\\]\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that programming is a very, very small part of CS. I think the kind of intellectual stimulation that someone interested in Philosophy would seek isn't the kind of stimulation programming provides, but it is the kind of work that the [theory side of CS](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Sipser_2006_Second_Edition_Problems.pdf) would provide.\n\nThe downside is that some universities don't emphasize these areas at an undergraduate level. You might have to petition to take graduate courses if that's the case.\n\nRegarding the whole women in CS issue, yes, there'll probably be sexist jerks in your cohort. They're jerks because they're insecure and have weird complexes about a girl/woman being better at them in tech. Yes, it is an extra source of annoyance, but I can see that the field is getting better with the issues of sexism.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that for whatever reasons, there are more women in the theory side of CS (formal methods, algorithms, theory of computation)  than in the applied side of CS, and the representation of women on the applied side is getting better! I can PM you some details from the faculty list in my university if you want (I'd rather not share that in an open forum because it'll likely doxx me :))",

As a result, they often had a head start when starting in applied CS, leading to women feeling outcompeted. \n\nMeanwhile, CS theory obviously did not get marketed either way, and in addition you can enter it from the math side as well - math having a much more even ratio of men to women, that evens it out a bit.",

She says that discrete math, algorithm analysis and logic are her favorite subjects which are basically the foundation of CS so she is in fact passionate about it, just doesn't know it. \n\nSTEM fields are male dominated and even in the most egalitarian societies the gap is still huge and that is a fact. Now I'm pretty sure this makes it even harder to compete as a woman in these fields so that's why passion is a huge factor in my opinion.",

When PCs starting entering households (marketed mainly towards men), the percentage of women entering CS dropped sharply.\n\nIt's just one example, but it shows the influence of society on people's choice of major pretty clearly.",

For STEM it seems that the ratio is higher for men(once again that doesn't mean men are better at it or anything) and believe it or not your physical prowess has contributed a lot to that fact in a course of millions of years.\n\nHow has male physical prowess influenced their STEM ability? Again, you can't just state that as fact without backing it up at all.\n\n> Now tell me why do you think in a country like Switzerland the gap is still this high? Please give me something better than the marketing and patriarchical society. That hasn't been the case in at least a few decades\n\nThat's not true at all, marketing still differs *wildly* between men and women. For instance, if I go to the largest online shopping site in my country and look for gifts, I immediately get pointed to choice of \"[for him](https://www.bol.com/nl/l/cadeaus-mannen/N/4268053379+14033/filter_N/37910?view=tile)\" or \"[for her](https://www.bol.com/nl/l/cadeaus-vrouwen/N/4268053379+14033/filter_N/37911?view=tile)\". The former mostly consists of video games, gadgets, powertools. The latter? Kitchen gear, cleaning supplies, cosmetics. Which of these is more likely to influence people to have greater propensity for tech?\n\nMy guess would be that less gender equal countries are often less economically well off (the original study largely looked at eastern Europe). As STEM jobs are usually well paid, there's a greater incentive for women to join STEM in these countries regardless of traditional gender roles. By contrast, countries with high gender equality have less incentive to maximize earnings, so women (and just people, in general) are more likely to allow external influences to guide their decisions, rather than just financial considerations. If one of these less gender-equal countries had the economic stability of Switzerland, I think it's quite likely that you'd see far fewer women entering STEM than currently do in Switzerland.",

I also enjoyed a bit of cryptography.\n\nBut sadly, I still had to do web-dev, software-dev, networking and so on for my degree. It makes sense why as generalized computer science are aimed that way. But there are topics in or related to logic (like [Theory of Computability](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory)).\n\nThere is hope though! You can do a standard computer science degree which would give a taste of everything. If you aren't so interested in all the topics, then I would suggest taking a course in something you want to do or like. Most courses either tend to lead to programming in some way, or you can just self-teach it and apply it in your own way (my wife does anthropology and uses programming to help her with statistics and visualizations).",
