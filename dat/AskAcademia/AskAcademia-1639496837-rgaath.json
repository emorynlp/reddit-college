      "text": "For a two-year master's program, assuming you do not intend to continue through a PhD, the two biggest mistakes are basically the same as in undergrad:\n\n1. Not doing the work. If you don't do the work, you will not graduate. It doesn't have to be perfect or amazing, it has to be *done* so you can pass classes and graduate. In grad school you don't see quite the same (shockingly high) number of students who just blow classes off, but I do think you see a lot of people who let perfectionism and anxiety prevent them from just doing the work and moving on. If the latter kind of person is you, make sure you get on top of that early on (with counseling, etc. as needed) to avoid falling behind.\n\n2. Treating college as a beautiful intellectual adventure of roses and rainbows. I mean, it can be a beautiful intellectual adventure at times, but college is primarily career preparation and this applies as much to a master's degree as to undergrad. Make sure you are taking steps to set yourself up for your career, not just your degree. This can mean a lot of things - networking, attending workshops, doing internships (if applicable in your field), learning and improving hard and soft skills, etc. - but don't wait until the end of your last semester and then say \"well, I guess I should get a job now\" with nothing useful except your academic transcript. This will also help with (1) above, if you have a more clear idea of where you are going it is easier to focus on working in the present as well.",

I secured a job 4 months before graduation, it fell through, and then I ended up working at a random spot for $10/hr until I could find a *moderately* relevant position. It took a few years and a lot of patience to get where I wanted professionally (and then I ended up starting a PhD program because I wasn\u2019t already miserable enough \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23).
