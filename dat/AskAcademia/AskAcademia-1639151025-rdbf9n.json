  "text": "I'll probably email HR about this in the end but I was just wondering if anyone else has had a similar thing and knows how to advise me? I am a little confused because I got my contract for a research assistant job starting in January at a UK based university. the contract says \"I write to offer you the role of research assistant\" But later on in the contract it says \"you are employed as a research fellow\". Which one am I? Fellow or assistant?!",

An RA would typically earn between \u00a315k-\u00a340k depending on the job, they would be assisting in research, unlikely to have an supervisory responsibilities (apart from maybe a technician or junior RA), and won't be working independently.\n\nA research fellow would earn \u00a340k-\u00a360k, would typically have been awarded the funding for their role through a competitive grant process (but not always), they would be expected to carry out independent research either under the supervision of a PI or on their own, they might have a small team under them. \n\nI can't imagine you'd have accidentally gotten a research fellowship without knowing you were applying for one so you're probably an RA.",

It's 35k, I'm working under the head of department on a specific research project, I'll need to write annual progress reports as well as undertake additional report writing as required by the research committee. It's fixed term for four years with some potential teaching duties and I might have to work in other departments if needed. \n\nI agree Im probably an RA, as that's what I applied for, the contract has just confused me as it's a much higher pay band than what I applied for as well as the use of 'research fellow' in the contract.",

You'll have to pay it back which is an absolute mare because it also has all sorts of tax implications. It's possible they are offering you a better job but best to be absolutely clear!",
