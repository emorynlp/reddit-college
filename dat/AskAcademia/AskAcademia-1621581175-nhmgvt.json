  "text": "I'm trying to form a habit to practice academic writing regularly. My experience so far has taught me that I need to focus on following things:\n\n1. Grammar\n2. Critical Thinking:to form sound arguments and synthesize material \n3. Overcoming procrastination: because I'm absolutely terrified of writing. \n\n\nI'm brushing up grammar and studying about critical thinking through MOOC courses. (I can link it up in the comments, if anyone is interested). However I've come to realization that I need to practice alongside learning all this. If not, this goal will easily take a backseat for me. \n\nPresently I'm trying to follow Patricia Goodson's Becoming an Academic Writer. (I also intend on going though books by Paul Silivia and Helen Sword)\n\n\nWhat I need help with: \n\n1. I'm confused about what to tackle during these exercises (for example, setting aside time daily for writing). Should I work on some specific project or take on any random topic that comes to my mind? \n\n2. What other aspects of writing and practice  should I focus on? \n\n\n(About me: I'm a psychology undergraduate, looking forward to start MSc in Clinical Psychology. English is not my first language)",

Your mentor will tell you why your outline is trash because it does not flow logically; why each of your sentences make no sense and are ungrammatical; and why the words you choose are basic or invalid! You are trying to standardize it way too much -- writing is not a Science, you just have to write, then re-write, and have multiple audiences read your writing. Eventually you will have the audience's perspective in your mind and you will become a great writer!",

          "text": "This, and as many times as you can. A good mentor would tear it apart each time (and this process will help you learn to be critical of your own writing). Also, it really helps to start with an outline (something like a table of contents). It\u2019s much easier to write with a clear idea of what the main objective of your paper is, and how you plan to support it.\n\nImo, a good paper flows like a story. \nYour paper should include:\n- A brief introduction to your research topic (i.e.,  what is your research topic about? What questions does your paper answer?)\n- Previous studies: Write this section with the purpose of providing a valid reason for why you selected your research topic and question (supported by a summary of relevant research, its mission and significance, what is missing from the field/your research questions and why it is important to answer those questions)\n- Your research questions\n- Methodology: Participants, data, instruments if any, and method of analysis; argue and defend why your choice of the above is valid and appropriate in extracting and analyzing your data; contemplate whether your data will elicit results that sufficiently answer your research questions. Researching and contemplating about the methodology used in past research will help you draft this section.\n- Results (be descriptive and true, and do not make interpretations unless your research is a qualitative one).\n- Analysis (make interpretations of your results here; contemplate how the results may be influenced by the particular \nresearch method you applied; go ahead and make interpretations of your research results in connection to results of past research you mentioned in the introduction/previous studies section of your paper)\n- Conclusion: restate your research questions once more and answer them based on the analysis of results you made in the previous section. State the significance of your findings (how does it contribute to your field?), implications of your findings and the limitations of your study (usually methodological limitations).\n\nYour mentor will probably help you with refining the above. In addition to the above, you will have to work on your grammar and wording on your own (or have your paper checked by a tutor). \n\nI would not buy \u201chow to xx\u201d books. Instead, find a quality research paper in your field and analyze/imitate the organization.\n\nGood luck.",

As a reader/supervisor, I often have to work really hard to understand these sentences. Students will think, often, that I\u2019m trying to stifle their creativity, or I just don\u2019t get their complex ideas. But the problem is a total lack of clarity in their writing. If your ideas are strong, I should be thinking through and grappling with the concepts, not with the sentences.",

Should I work on some specific project or take on any random topic that comes to my mind? \n\nThese books are aimed at grad students and professors in my experience, so they assume you have some kind of ongoing project you are working on. I think for you what could be good is to take stuff you *have* written, for a class or whatever, and work on revising it.\n\nWhat is tricky, I think, is that writing is all about context and expectations. Grad students and professors are ultimately writing toward publication, and should ultimately have specific venues in mind. They can study how to write well by looking at examples of good writing of the sort they want to write. If you are an undergrad, I am not sure what your writing goal would be other than to get good grades-- but I think having one would help.\n\nI thought Paul Silvia's book was kind of dumb, fwiw. The key to writing a lot turns out to be, uh, writing a lot. Felt like an essay that was fluffed up to be short book.",

So, at various stages in my academic career (grad school and early faculty), I found a group of people in a similar situation and we'd pick a 2-hour block that worked for all of us and we'd meet in a conference room or coffee shop and focus on writing, this creates the accountability.  Some groups have been more formal about allocating specific times for asking questions and setting goals for the day and others were literally show up and put headphones in.  But the key to both was showing up and writing.",

Here's how I usually teach academic writing to undergrads:\n\nFirst, decide on a *theme*, a type of theoretic categorization that allows you to set up the framework for your text. A tentative title might be useful for this.\n\nSecond, find sources that fit your theme. You might have to reconsider your theme after this step.\n\nThird, make it painfully clear both in thinking and in writing why those sources fit your theme. This is the difficult part.\n\nFourth, turn this into a coherent text where you describe the theme, the contents of your sources and why it all fits together. Write your main part and conclusion.\n\nFifth, write a snappy and intelligent introduction.",

Should I work on some specific project or take on any random topic that comes to my mind?\n\nWhile you're getting some great advice from other posters, I wanted to stress here that _the act of writing anything, at all_, can be a good practice to get in the habit of doing regularly. There's a lot to be said for feeling comfortable sitting down and writing--for many just sitting at a keyboard can cause considerable anxiety. \n\n> What other aspects of writing and practice should I focus on?\n\nHow much academic writing in your field are you regularly reading? What kinds of arguments are you being asked to develop in your writing? It can be a valuable practice to get more familiar with the genres you're expected to engage in. Think about what the authors of a given text are doing in their work: how do they make an argument? how is it supported? how is it structured/organized? what kinds of discussion occurs re: included data, evidence, etc.? and so on. This awareness can help you approach writing your own documents that much more effectively, since you'll make better-informed decisions when you do so.",

I believe it is considered a standard.\n 2. Daily exercises do improve your writing. I am assuming that you are actively involved in research as a M.Sc. student, in which case a personal research journal is a great excuse to write every day. Try to keep it as formal (but simple) as you can. It helps to imagine that you are writing an article. You want your writing to be clear but not casual. That way you will be forced to polish your arguments and conclusions, and tie any loose ends, on a daily basis. It will also help you digest your own research while the outcome will constitute prose that can be transferred directly to a publishable scientific paper.\n\nI hope this helps.",
