  "title:": "Grad School Professor Telling People Not to Hire Student",
  "text": "Hello, I am in a strange position and would like to have some help/advice/insight.\n\nI recently graduated from a Master's program.  While there, I did well in my classes (3.9 GPA) and was well regarded by students, faculty, and supervisors.  Except one staff member (the department chair) and for the reason I will explain.\n\nThere was an issue where I felt like the dean of the department needed to be brought in on a conversation.  EDIT (added for clarity): *I sent an email to the department chair and cc:ed the dean as I felt like it was important for the dean to know*.  A faculty member had made a mistake that reflected poorly on the school and I genuinely wanted to help correct the mistake.  That faculty has since been let go (for various balls dropped).\n\nAnother faculty, the department chair, felt like I had gone over his head.  He threatened to not let me proceed in the degree program because he believe it showed I wasn't mature enough.  He also said that he is well connected in the field and that I should be aware of that in the future.  He told me that if I didn't acknowledge my mistake, then I would not be able to continue in the program.\n\nAt the time, I took notes but didn't want to go any further with any complaint for fear or reprisal.  I kept my head down and finished the program in very good standing.\n\nUnfortunately now I am applying for jobs, and I have been made aware that a job offer was not made to me because of intervention by this professor.  I interviewed, the employer liked me, went to the stage of getting reference checks (the ones I provided were all positive), and... yes, the professor was connected to this employer and he was able to stop the offer from being made to me.\n\nDo I just chalk this up to how life works?  Is the professor within his rights to prevent me from employment based on what he has stated to me?  Thoughts?\n\n*Edit: A few more details that have come up in comments:*\n\n1. *I am not the only student that has been threatened by this professor.  Another student was threatened in a very similar situation.*\n2. *While this professor is connected, (being vague) my fiend isn't one where one person really can ruin a career.  It isn't a typical business type career (sorry to be vague).*  \n3. *I appreciate the feedback (keep it coming).  I have learned a lot from you all.  I think a few take aways for me:*\n   1. *Academia should be treated like a career.  I have always gone to small, liberal arts schools where students are encouraged to speak out and dialogue is appreciated.  I guess I became too \"comfortable\".*  \n   2. *I still believe, even if I did act \"unprofessionally\", the professor acted inappropriately by threatening me.* \n\n*I'm still processing this so feel free to keep comments coming.  I really am someone that wants to learn but I also believe in fairness.*",

      "text": "You may want to consider both long and short term solutions.  There may be some way for you to actually stop this professor from doing what he's doing, though it depends a bit on the situation at that institution and how entrenched he is (or perceives himself to be).\n\nIn the short-term, though, you need to figure out how to minimize his ability to do this to you later.  You might consider letting future probable employers know that this person exists and that they are trying to sink you.  This means you need a very clear (and simple) account of what you did and the degree to which you stand-by your prior decision and/or the degree to which you'd do it differently next time.\n\nIt's certainly possible that this person is having their way with you because they have some actual power, but, more likely, it's that people believe his accounting of your character - that you're the kind of person who has no respect for the chain of administrative responsibility.  This is especially true if there is even a loose way in which your move contributed to the firing of the other instructor you mention.  \n\nIn my experience, people in hiring chains get really uncomfortable when they discover something they didn't know before - even when the thing is quite small.  (I've seen a hire almost fall apart because of a misunderstanding caused by a typo on a CV.)  This story, when it rears its head, is not small.  It's the kind of thing which all hiring committees fear quite deeply - that a candidate has carefully curated their appearance around some serious problem which everyone is too polite or blinded to discuss.\n\nIn the long-term (if this person is influential today, they will be influential tomorrow), you need to decide whether or not you want to pressure this person to stop or whether you just try what they said in the first place - apologize to them and satisfy their ego.",

Start with his head of department and escalate through to the dean upto more senior university officials demanding action. As an alumnus and graduate student of the university it's incredibly unprofessional for a professor to be actively undermining you.\n\nGather what proof you have about the professor screwing with you and reach out. What they're doing is certainly unethical and likely in violation of University codes of conduct.",

I'm not saying this to take you down a notch (when you are already down, to be frank) - I and others are saying this because not understanding what went wrong here can legitimately harm you if you end up making this mistake again.\n\nFrom your account it does sound like the chair doesn't think highly of you, but consider that, even if they thought you were otherwise a great applicant but still mentioned this incident in their reference, it still would have at minimum given your prospective employer pause. Employees who CC upper management on stuff that isn't upper management business or that isn't their business to report to upper management are annoying, and in some industries (say, management consulting) a liability. And when you are a young specialist going for your first job in the field - i.e. you don't have much to recommend yourself - you can very easily be passed up in opportunities because of a small flaw, especially if you're in a field where everyone's a top student. By the way, this unfortunately goes likewise for situations where you're totally justified in going over a supervisor's head - if the supervisor was sexually harassing you, for example. People can and will ruin your career just because they can, and it's important to pick your battles and develop good relationships with as many people as you can, so that a prospective employer can encounter a critical mass of people they know testifying that you are a strong candidate even if this one weird dude doesn't like you. It's really tough when you're starting out. Good luck.",

Like, I myself had someone out to screw me over when I was in my first job out of college because I also did something naive that pissed them off, and the only reason I'm still in the field is that they were fairly junior themselves and people with more clout stood up for me. That's firstly not OP's position, and secondly, in his position, rather than go to the dean, I would first go to all these professors who admire me so much, explain the situation and ask them for advice, because they know the lay of the land. ime people who advocate your type of scorched earth policy fall into two camps: inexperienced or lucky enough to never have been in this position, or exiled from the field due to a reputation as someone who is irrational and difficult to work with.",

In fact, when I was in my graduate program, I was not made aware that Title IX was anything other than a law governing women's sports.

Why would they have anything to do with a professor harassing students?\n\nIn grad school, btw, I did have a colleague who reported an onging sexual harassment issue. When she did, the response she got wasn't one of horror that a professor was harassing his students but that she didn't approach the exact specific correct person when reporting it -- a person that she didn't know existed in a role that no one ever told her had authority over her advisor. \n\nI'm also still not clear why the Dean is not the right person to report to.

I certainly wasn't, and this was five years ago at a very good R1. I was not told I had a Title IX rep. I didn't even know that such a person existed until very recently. We also didn't have HR since we were students, not employees. All we knew was that we should bring concerns to our advisors or to other faculty members we trusted. If our advisors and faculty members were enabling or causing serious problems, however, what then? No one knew. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd btw, this was not only at my school. I have another friend who just finished her PhD another prestigious R1. Her advisor treated his female students differently from his male students, asking them to get his dry cleaning, pick him up from the airport, and make coffee. Did I mention that he was the department head? She told other faculty members she trusted; they shrugged their shoulders. She did not know that Title IX applied to this situation or that there was anyone to even report him to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's also interesting that your issue is not with the entire department enabling sexual harassment but rather that a sexually harassed grad student may have followed the wrong protocol in trying to address the situation?",

It wouldn't be pretty unless there was a ***REALLY*** good reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nu/GumOnMySeatGUM, your original intentions don't matter now. You have two basic options to directly address this: 1) Contact the chair and say whatever you need to in order to get them to consider the matter settled (apologize), or 2) try to bring them down so they can't hurt you any more. Do note that while it may feel satisfying, #2 is probably the worst thing you can try until you have a job. Even if you take them down, they can portray you to others as being vindictive, untrustworthy, and petty. As others have noted, this *can* still get worse.\n\nAlternatively, keep doing your job search and don't engage and hope they lose interest. I'd either apologize or ignore them myself UNTIL I had a job I planned to stay in for a long time. THEN I'd happily set about exposing how crappy this person is, and see if I can't return the favor.",

You're paying the university, who is them paying the professors. You're treating this like it's a business where you are a customer as a student, as if it is \"unfair\" that professors have power over you if you're a customer.\n\nHonestly, you need to suck things up. You say you're willing to learn, but you're not even accepting what anyone is telling you for such a small thing as academia being a career/job.\n\nEDIT: Didn't read the last half of your comment carefully. But my point still stands. You're not paying the professors as a customer.",

That being said the chair is overstepping their role entirely and wasting a lot of time being an asshole (regardless of the cluster fuck that ensued behind the scenes). The way I see it there are two ways to move forward:\n\n1. Reach out to the chair and tell them that it was never your intent to jump the ladder. You apologize for any inconvenience it caused him with the dean (who when he received the email assumed the chair wasn\u2019t doing his job). At this point you should mention that an employer has let you know that the chair (someone who is not listed as a reference) has effectively prevented you for gaining employment. (Side Note: this is an incredibly stupid move on his part because it reflects poorly on the school\u2019s employment statistics. It\u2019s also incredibly stupid because it opens him up to a lawsuit if he continues to prevent you from gaining employment.) Ask him why he has chosen to intentionally harm your ability to get a job at (name the place) and ask him how the two of you can resolve the matter without it escalating. \n\n2. Do all of the above in a meeting with you the dean and the department chair. \n\nSince this is a pretty serious issue, talk to a lawyer (family friends typically are willing to offer some advise  off the record). In addition keep records of absolutely everything - check if your state allows you to record conversations regardless of the other person\u2019s consent (I think it\u2019s a one party consent law or something along those lines) so that you would have records of your in person conversations. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this has happened to you.

              "text": "Think of it this way:\n\nThe role of a dean is to take care of the administrative functioning of a college (ex. The business school of a university), promote the faculty and hail their achievements, and fundraiser like hell.\n\nThe role of a department chair is to take care of some of the administrative stuff for the department, advocate for the faculty, serve as the second layer for student complaints (immediate professor is the first layer), and still handle all the normal responsibilities of a professor.\n\nTypically a dean is involved in student issues when there the department chair cannot handle the issue (based on university rules), or if the department chair is dragging their feet or is otherwise being ineffective. By CCing the dean before the chair has a chance to rectify the situation OP inadvertently creates anger and confusion. The dean is (should be) busy and will only know that there is a problem and the chair has not solved it. This results in the chair having a less than pleasant discussion with the dean. The dean wants the issue fixed, but the chair may still need to talk to the problem faculty member. This results in a cluster fuck of clueless anger - the dean doesn\u2019t know why the chair hasn\u2019t fixed the problem and the chair doesn\u2019t have enough information to effectively enlist the support of the dean. As a result, the chair has to play defense for a faculty member that has a complaint out against him that the dean now knows about - this is a lose-lose situation for the chair. Now the dean is pissed and knows there\u2019s an issue and can use it as a weapon in future discussions (exaggeration: Look Mike we all know you don\u2019t know how to handle student problems maybe it\u2019s time for a change in leadership within the department). \n\nBasically OP created a fuck ton of problems for the chair by CCing someone before they actually needed that person\u2019s help. This translates into the business world as well in a much more extreme way. Faculty have tenure which provides some protection. In the business world OP\u2019s boss would begin being an ass and try to get rid of him (to another team) ASAP. However, everyone knows OP doesn\u2019t understand the role of a hierarchy and doesn\u2019t want to deal with him anymore. This means that the only way up in the world would be out of the firm.",

Neither is remotely right.  You were supposed to see yourself as a professional colleague, and conduct yourself accordingly.  You didn't, which royally pissed this guy off, and if your posture here is anything to go on, it's pretty easy to see his side of things.  It's quite clear that you thought you didn't have to respect this venue.

It's very easy to misconstrue how something is being said in writing vs. having it as a conversation, feeling like the tone of a message is accusatory, etc.\n\nWhile it's good to escalate situations before there's a firestorm, don't escalate to someone else's supervisor/boss lightly, especially before giving them a chance to correct whatever the issue is. If I have negative/needs improvement feedback for my boss, I absolutely want him to know about it personally rather than airing it to our co-workers/team, to other supervisors, or to his supervisor. I expect the same from my co-workers, or people who are indirect managers/supervise my work in other contexts. It's better that I get feedback from them directly. Wait to give it to my manager until it's a severe/repeated issue or if it's something good. Good feedback needs to be timely, actionable, and can't be anonymous. In this case, it's perfectly possible that you put the department chair in hot water with the Dean because you didn't give sufficient notice to resolve the situation before roping in his superior, and he's right to be upset about that.\n\n[A couple relevant AskReddit comments from today about similar situations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cb3ieh/what_bs_are_you_dealing_with_at_work_right_now/etd0i58/)\n\nOn the one hand, many companies don't even go through all your listed references. On the other, 'backdoor' reference checks aren't uncommon, depending on industry and your listed experience/education. More often than not (in industry), listed references are nice but not *extremely* valuable, since you'll only list references that have good things to say. It's normal to reach out to shared references even if they aren't listed. If I were to hire someone from my alma mater in my major, where the graduating class is in the ~50-70 range, it wouldn't be weird to give a passing call to my professors/academic advisors/references there. Or if I see they have past experience at a company where I have a friend/old work colleague that I trust, I'd reach out to that person to see what they think.\n\nFor an industry analogue, it's as if your boss did something bad, but rather than going to his manager about it, you jumped straight to the VP or CEO, which reflects very poorly on that manager.",

However, if this is the only thing that the department head has against you then he is being a bit too vindictive. We don\u2019t know the full story so you could have done other negative stuff and this was just the icing on the cake. \n\nAssuming this was a one time incident and this person is just holding a grudge, I would try and contact him directly. Make it clear you are apologizing for going over his head and try and repair bridges wherever they are broken. Despite what other people are saying, you shouldn\u2019t come in guns blazing with a team of lawyers. Only bring in the legal system if it becomes clear that this is directed unjust treatment. \n\nEven if you do hash things out you may still have to accept that it will be hard for you to find a job in your field. People talk so if negative information about you is already out there then there may not be much you can do. I personally wouldn\u2019t include this story in any correspondence with potential employers unless they ask about it explicitly.

      "text": "I'm an undergrad student working through my bachelors and a military contract right now, with aspirations to head toward a graduate degree one day. Although I'm far behind you academically, I've had my fair share of lousy people try to interrupt my plans.\n\nI have to say, this sounds grossly unethical in any walk of life, be it academia, a minimum wage job, the military or wherever. If someone is actively trying to undeservingly sabotage your prospects in an already barren job market, I would have to act. \n\nFirstly, meet with them face to face and confront them directly, try to understand why they feel justified acting the way they're acting. Dont go in swinging, be reasonable. Try to level with them and let then know how this affects you. If it's something you can handle civily while looking them in the eye, that's the best way to cut the problem off at the start. I'd imagine another email chain would only infuriate them further at this point in time.\n\nSecondly, if the confrontation works, awesome! Case closed. If not, and you feel they're acting in a brash and unethical/immoral manner, tell them exactly who you're going to escalate this to. No one is the king of everything, everyone answers to some department chair, dean or supervisor of sorts. At the very least, they have a human resources department that forbids certain actions and behaviours. This may make them change their tone and want to settle it with you peacefully. Alternatively, it might peeve them of further. If it does, all the more reason to escalate. \n\nMost crucially, however, you need to assess the risk involved with all this. Is it worth it to go to such lengths to maybe get this professor reprimanded, or furthermore, fired? If this professor is a bull-headed, \"I'm always right and have no room to change\" type of person, confronting them may make their effort to ruin your prospects even more nefarious. Should you choose not to go after them and let it happen, can you live with the fact that you didnt stand up for yourself, or will it be a regret you carry into your later life?\n\nAll questions you need to ask and answer before proceeding. If it were me, I'd walk into that professors office and do as I suggested above. In a world where everyone's at each others throats, and in a job market where literally thousands of qualified applicants chase the same one job opening, you've gotta take a stand.",
