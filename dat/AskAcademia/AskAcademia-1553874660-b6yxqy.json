  "text": "Hello, perhaps you all could help with this problem that I am having. \n\nCurrently I am a junior in college, and I'm taking a class with a professor who I am sure incompetent. The semester has started in January, and as of March we still have not received a syllabus. I do not know what we're supposed to be doing in this class, other than its is a statistics course. For instance, we have had no tests, no homework assigned, and regularly he mixes us up with his combintorics class before us.\n\nBesides that, this semester he thought that it was an extension of last semester, so he gave us other students tests to take home and think about because he thought that it was us. Moreover, sometimes he forgets that we are even in class, and last week he went to get in the couch that is in the class room, but before he did he took his pants off. \n\nI think he has alzheimers or something, but I'm afraid that this is going to be like the last time I had him and hes going to just give me a B- without ever giving homework, tests, or a finale.. \n\nI dont know what to do. I've been to the head of my department to tell them about this, but they havent done a thing about it. The only advice inwas offered, was this is what graduate school is like and to just get over it.

Go in person, but send an email detailing your concerns on which you CC the ombudsman, the department head - hell, the VP and the president as well. Be extremely polite and professional, but lay out everything that's happened - emphasizing the pants removal - and make it clear that you have already spoken to the department head but, since you do not feel that your concerns were adequately addressed and since the behavior under consideration is so egregious, you feel the need to escalate. Handing out other student's tests *has* to be a FERPA violation, so I would stress that as well.  The syllabus and lack of homework stuff is more easily dismissed; I'd mention it, but you need to stress the pants and the test thing. ",

The most significant problem is that people are unwilling to properly care for this person.  What's happening to you is inexcusable and really bad, but if the professor has dementia what's happening to you is really being done by the chair, the dean, etc.  If the professor has dementia, then probably the professor is not taking off the pants - the dementia is doing it.\n\nI say all this not just because it's true, but also because you're probably more likely to get help from other people if you communicate the issue with them in this way.",

Second, it sounds from your message that maybe you're trying to carry this by yourself? \nEveryone here has said go to the next level up- I second that but want to add: maybe consider approaching them as a group. Other students in the class must feel the same way. I would either make an appointment with the dean with multiple classmates on your side, or maybe articulate what you've shared with us in a petition for action to be taken- have people sign their name and email etc. Just an idea! I wondered if it wouldn't be soothing to not be carrying the issue all on your own.",

It's not a get-out-of-jail-free card but if he didn't do something legally dubious, I doubt anything would happen at all. \n\nAnd even in this case, I'm not sure if anything will actually happen.\nAt my university, it took 10+ years for anything to be done about [a tenured professor](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/uw-researcher-michael-katze-fired-after-sexual-harassment-investigation/) that had many documented incidents of sexual harassment, which is decidedly far worse than just taking off your pants, so color me skeptical in regards to anything happening with OP's prof.\n",

          "text": "While tenure protects from dismissal, failure to tender grades can be overridden or at least pressed from above, because after a certain amount of time those grades default (at most schools) and must be grieved. It is potentially a legal liability for the University as well, if it damages the prospects of a student or alum. If the dean or chair gets no results, talk to the ombuds, and/or start preparing a formal grievance by collecting your extant work and talking to whatever office handles student grievance or judicial matters. I've seen very few cases like yours, but when I have, we have ways of pressing compliance by getting the provost and general counsel involved. Your institution may vary, but I'd suggest you start this process before a full year has elapsed. Do so with a group, if it helps. ",
