  "text": " Hi everyone. I'm applying for Masters in Computer Science in US Universities for Fall 2022. One of the key elements of my profile is the amount of research experience I have. However, none of my 3 papers have been published and this is making me super anxious as my deadlines are right around the corner.\n\nPaper 1: Accepted in conference, presented at conference, publication in 2022\n\nPaper 2: Accepted in conference, presentation in 10 days, publication in 2022\n\nPaper 3: Accepted in a journal, publication in 2022\n\nI had a few questions:\n\n1. Do papers that have been accepted but not published carry the same weight as papers that have been published?\n2. How would I go about writing about accepted but unpublished papers in my CV/Resume?\n3. Should I include a manuscript or something because my papers have not been published?\n\nThank you :)",

Give all the bibliographic data you already have, most importantly the specific conference / journal name, and just put something like \"(in print, expected 2022)\" instead of publication year for the conference papers and \"(accepted for publication, expected 2022)\" for the journal paper.\n3. You are generally allowed to self-publish the preprints of your papers, and you can include a link to the preprint to the bibliography you are submitting in your application.",
