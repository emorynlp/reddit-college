  "text": "(Crosspost from r/labrats)\n\nI'm a freelance science journalist doing an investigation on the exploitation of foreign postdocs for Nature.\n\nI realise that postdocs are often under a lot of pressure, work long hours, and often have a tough time generally, however I'm looking at early career researchers have moved to a country in which they were not born, and believe they have been treated worse that other \"native\" postdocs, perhaps because they are expected to work harder, they are paid less or other forms of discrimination.\n\nI'm aware this is a big issue in the US, and there have been a number of well documented cases. I'd like to hear from anyone who can tell me whether this is an issue anywhere beyond the US, especially any postdocs who believe they have personally been discriminated against in a foreign lab outside the US because of their nationality.\n\nI'd also be interested to hear from anyone who has personally experienced this in the US, as my article will hopefully includes cases both in the US and elsewhere.\n\nThank you,\n\nA Nature freelance",

Other things that were common were differences in salary, ex if a foreign post doc had prior post doc experience outside of USA, the PI would ignore it and place them on a NIH (0 experience level) while US nationals would follow the salary recommendation. \n\nAlso on H1B they will not allow you to teach.",

To be totally candid, I have very little to lose if my supervisor decided not to renew my contract. I even managed to squeeze a raise out of my supervisor, despite him saying that he would never be willing to do this. Other than finding faculty position or another postdoc, I would either have to return to Canada (fine) or go into industry in the US on NAFTA status that I get instantly at the US customs desk at the airport if I bring a job offer.\n\nThis is very different from e.g., my Indian and Chinese postdoc colleagues. It's very difficult for them for them to stay in the US if their supervisors let their contracts expire, and they would likely have to return to their country of origin. Many of them do not wish to return to their country of origin, especially if they brought or started families in the US.\n\nThis results in a great power disparity between the supervisors and postdocs. However, I believe that this is also very common in different (non-academic) workplaces in the US. In my opinion/experience, it's more a problem of supervisors taking advantage of the US' strict immigration laws to exploit workers rather than inherent nationalistic or racist toxicity in academia. The latter totally exists, but isn't the main thing going on here.",

So the expectations may be ridiculously high across the board, but postdocs from some cultural backgrounds may have an easier time pushing back against those expectations and setting reasonable boundaries whereas others may not. There are definitely labs which do seek out postdocs from those backgrounds because they know these postdocs are more easily exploited but what I've more frequently seen is that there is no such intention but the outcome is never really questioned because it is simply perceived as high productivity and motivation.",

The reality is that the most competitive research institutes depend on this for their research output. If your university can't acquire the best people (most of whom will statistically come from abroad), it will fade into the shadows of the mega research institutes, which will lead to a snowballing effect, i.e., exodus of its top faculty members, etc.\n\nShould collaborative science take a hit because domestic citizens feel that they're above the hustle? Absolutely not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Getting a visa in many European countries (eg the UK) as a foreign postdoc is much harder, for instance.\n\nEvery serious research group I know in Europe is loaded with talented international postdocs.

                          "text": "I think thats not true for quite a few reasons.\n\n1) The hyper-competitiveness of modern academia means that its no longer. a serious career choice for many of the smartest people, which is not socially optimal. Fields like (e.g.) lab science are not sensible career paths these days and many of the best people who would previously have considered a scientific career now end up going into finance/tech/etc instead. \"Foreign postdocs\" obviously aren't the only reason for this, but they are part of a general trend in modern academia which has made it a far less desirable option for smart people who have better options. The irony is that making things more  competitive doesn't necessarily mean you end up with better people, since a lot of the best people will just decide it isnt worth it anymore and do something else.\n\n2) Even for those who do choose academic careers, the hyper-competitiveness of modern research is not good for science since it leads to a  \"publication at all costs\" mentality that results in cutting corners and shoddy research practices. The current scientific replication crisis is a direct result of this. History shows that the fastest scientific progress was made roughly between 1700-1960 back when academia was far, far more chilled out than today and when there was much less pressure to get immediate results. Again cheap foreign labor is not the only (or even the main) cause of this, but it adds to the problem.\n\n3) Its not obvious that the best people will \"statistically come from abroad\".. The main attraction of foreign labour is that its cheap, which is good in the short run but the long term result is that it may end up driving out the best people (see above points). If universities didnt have the option of recruiting cheap labour from undeveloped countries then they would need to pay more to attract domestic talent into academia which may increase quality in the medium-long term.",

I don't see any services or community groups for post docs at my large R1 public university.

      "text": "Speaking as a US citizen in the US. Biomedicine. Can't speak to how US citizens are treated in other labs as a post-doc.\n\nA few years back where there was a foreign, Chinese graduate student in a lab. They were outstanding and highly productive, and the PI was pre-tenure. The PI held onto the student much longer than they should, but eventually the student was forced to graduate. Not because the department cared for the student, but because they cared about their metrics. The student was told by the PI that they wouldn't receive a letter of recommendation until the student did a two year post-doc in the same lab. What could the student do? They were bound by their visa status. The student did the two year post-doc, but the ESI status took a hit. In fairness, the PI did help the student get a very good post-doc position. Some colleagues were appalled, but it wasn't their fight and they had to work with the PI long after the student left. Uncommon for sure, but I've also seen several domestic students held hostage by junior PIs who can't afford to lose a trained pair of hands (either delayed graduation or 'asking' for a year or two of post-doc). At least domestic students have more flexibility to leave for non-science careers. Not to rip on junior PIs. They tend to be better mentors.\n\nI haven't see any difference at the post-doc level. People are equally quick to cut foreign or domestic post-docs. For higher caliber labs, foreign post-docs often come with their own money, while domestic post-docs have to get a grant within 1-2 years or be cut. I've known several foreign post-docs who were paid less (and a few more, but rare), but that was because their salary was tied to their funding and there were restrictions on what we could pay. You'll find heterogeneity in domestic post-doc pay depending on funding support as well, depending on the source of funding. In my experience, foreign vs. domestic post-docs supported by the same mechanism get paid the same. Stavrogin8, my experience is that there isn't as much flexibility in pay scale as you suggest, including the ability to reward absolutely outstanding individuals.\n\nInstitutions can get equally screwed by foreign students / post-docs. Undergraduate MD degree from India or China? So many will take the USMLE as soon as they get to the US and jump ship leaving the institution or PI hanging. Many people won't pick up MDs from those two countries for that reason. I've also seen many foreign students institution hop to an institution with a \"better name\" using the \"my significant other is moving, and I'm following\", only to have that significant other nowhere to be seen once the person moves to the new institution.\n\nWhen hiring, one needs to ask what is it that they're looking for in a post-doc. Sometimes you're looking to create the next generation of scientists. To help them develop a project and leave the lab with it. That's not always possible though, but most domestic post-docs, and foreign post-docs who got their Ph.D. in the US, come into a post-doc position with this in mind. However, sometimes you're just looking to hire an experienced set of hands (whether that should be a post-doc's role is a discussion by itself). For that, it's more common to hire a foreign post-doc direct from their home country as many are looking for a post-doc position for reasons other than starting their own lab.",

      "text": "Academia and university policy put foreign staff in vulnerable position. If the PI has never realised the issue, they can easily make their postdocs miserable financially. \n\nI stayed in a shitty lab in the UK because I was not in a financially stable position to leave. This university gave me the paperwork too late so I had to pay a lot of money for the fast track application. I used the relocation allowance to cover my visa. And the reimbursement was taxed because visa is not qualified for tax free expenses.   On the contract I have to pay back my relocation allowance if I cannot stay for the full term. Unfortunately, my current PI cares a lot more about the procedures. He could have just paid it through grant but I had to go through the much more tedious procedure. Intentionally or not, he got me into a very vulnerable position by not stepping up. \n\nThe visa will be terminated 60 days after the last day of job in the UK. Leaving that lab meant, in the best case scenario, I would have to pay back relocation allowance, get a new job, and apply for a new visa. \n\nIf I could I would have quit on my third months, but I stayed for a long while. I simply don't have the money to pay back for my relocation allowance. I would say my lab being terrible and the bad university admin are two separated issues.",

      "text": "You must make a point about the visa situation. See the F1 Visa is great when getting the degree. But after that there is 1 year of OPT and then for STEM fields, another 17 months OPT extension. These visa conversions from F1 to OPT to STEM extension takes all the joy out of life. The allowed gaps in between the different visa status is small and there is a constant fear of what if I don\u2019t get the visa in time, what if I don\u2019t have a job by this time. The added stress of all the city change, apartment hunting, drivers license renewal etc  is too much. This leads to exploitation by employers. And even sometimes by the PhD advisers who keep you as PhD student until you have a job lined up. After we get the job, we can\u2019t move as freely to different employers because employers are linked to the whole OPT process. \n\nAll this USCIS bullshit killed my America dreams completely and I realised that the bureaucracy and delay is worse than in My country. At least here I can escalate the matter up the administration chain as a citizen. As a foreign national in USA you feel wary of raising too much riot or employers may think you are too unstable/radical. Our dark skin colour doesn\u2019t help either. Plus, I am sure we get tracked by the homeland security stronger (which is fine). \n\nI felt Obama USCIS was the worst. I even heard of people with poorer degrees than mine getting nice H1 visas because their employers happened to be connected. There is definitely huge corruption in the area of visa for foreign nationals and the US citizens don\u2019t care about this matter enough. \n\nEven my PhD degree couldn\u2019t help me get a better visa easier/faster. While another barely educated immigrant from my country who came as a visitor, started working in his uncle\u2019s Indian restaurant as a cheap labor was living life king style. I just had enough and came back to my native country and I am doing okay here.\n\n\u2014\nAdding: I think for high degrees like MS and PhDs (even if in certain fields) the F1 should allow a few years of employment of choice just as for US citizens. There shouldn\u2019t be any need for getting OPT and such. The visa process needs to simplify and employment should be on free-market basis. Otherwise why is USA even trying to give these foreigners education, if they can\u2019t efficiently convert them into the labor force.",
