  "title:": "Who decides paper hypotheses direction?",
  "text": "So this problem has come up several times now with my current postdoc mentor. I will write a paper,  the coauthors will make their suggestions, and I address the suggestions . Then,  my PI says there's no hypothesis here or too many hypotheses are tested or has some other non-quantifiable or non-specific, but fatal flaw he says he has identified,  but can't suggest any solution. Is there anything I can do? Does he have ultimate authority even if he is demonstrably incorrect? \n\nThe only specific and egregious example I have of the is a couple of years ago when he stated that the bonferroni correction depends on the sample size and not the number of statistical hypotheses tested. And after individually asking each other person in the lab meeting if he was correct or I was correct (by correcting him that bonferroni correction is determined by the number of statistical tests or hypotheses). Then end result after 4 phds said I was correct was that he stormed out of the meeting and was inpatient for the next 2 weeks getting his lithium levels adjusted. \n\nIs there any reasonable way to deal with someone who refuses expert opinion when it doesn't fit their (sometimes delusional) opinion when they are the PI on the grant? Even when ALL other coauthors disagree with them?",

Honestly, it won't matter longterm. While he is not quite retirement age, most journals and agencies actively do not seek his advice or review and 70% of people he has worked with won't work with him again. The department head has informed me if I need a letter of recommendation from him for my next position the department head and vice chairman of research will mediate a positive recommendation. I doubt I will be able to work on the data I collected in his lab without a departmental agreement, but I have enough data from my dissertation to move on without that data.",

      "text": "If you have a draft ready to submit at the click of a button then it's going to be a lot harder for your advisor to say no. If the reviewers agree with your advisor then so be it, but often times reviewers can see the value in what you're doing and help you communicate it better. \n\nSometimes professors get so used to providing \"constructive\" criticism that they can miss the bigger picture that sometimes you just have to get a manuscript out and move on. And your advisor seems like an, uh, *extreme* example of that.",

For a little more context he was in trouble with the department for unprofessional conduct about a year ago for a semi-public review of a grant written by a junior faculty member. But he brings in 2 R01 grants right now. I honestly don't need the paper as my publications are 2:1 in both frequency and impact factor compared to his.",
