      "text": "Alcohol. Jk, jk, don't do that.\n\nIn general, I would say it's important not to be hard on yourself for reacting to stress. It's normal, and in many cases probably healthy to react to stress in some way that helps release it. If that means crying in the bathroom, well, then that's what you do. Don't get caught up in comparing yourself to other people who *look* like they waltz through the day working for 16 hours straight without a hint of stress, they're all hiding it in private just like you. Furthermore, everyone manages stress differently and accordingly also manages their workload and habits differently, so it's okay if your personal work cycle is alternating between being highly productive for a while, and then releasing that stress for a while in the bathroom. Try not to be hard on yourself, just cycle back and forth and let things get done as they get done.\n\nThat being said, if stress is getting to you enough that it *significantly* interferes with your work, consider seeking counseling or other assistance depending on what resources you have available to you. Even if there's nothing \"wrong\" with you, a good therapist has the training and education to know about helpful and healthy coping mechanisms which they can pass on to you, or they may just be a needed outlet for you to rant to about the horrors of academia.",

While it's nice that people are realizing that we shouldn't shame the secret crying, question is, does the crying help in any way? Because for me it doesn't. The crying is just a symptom, not a \"stress relief\".  I cry because whatever I've been suffering from has reached a certain degree. But if I can't function, the crying is not going to make me more functional. It's like you faint when you have extremely low blood sugar, but does the fainting help raise your blood sugar? No.\n\nSorry about the rambling. I've been having a couple of bad weeks lately.",

      "text": "Quit. Seriously. I took a very long time to reach that conclusion while trying to finish a PhD as I got very ill with fibromyalgia. I slowly realized I simply didn't have it in me to finish the dissertation, it was a terribly difficult and painful decision but I took an MA (my second...) and left. Fortunately, I have nearly a decade of independent teaching experience - but I won't be 'in academia'. \n\nI don't regret it.\n\nI do regret not taking certain actions earlier that could have allowed me to finish - but after nearly a decade, marriage, bills, age, illness... it just wasn't worth the pain and suffering academia caused me. I\n\nI can adjunct to sate my love of teaching, I work in the education industry writing questions for standardized tests and checking them for quality and content. I'm happier. The stress is largely gone. I'm not worried about the next application for a grant or post-doc. \n\nThe pain of the job market in this era of scarce positions in my field (political science) meant a bleak outlook while my spouse reached salaries that were better than what I'd earn. Tenure track positions are becoming rarer and rarer. Private, small liberal arts universities are going bankrupt and folding (St. Josephs recently did this near here) - and those would have been my ideal. \n\nOnline teaching is going to replace a lot of university faculty, reduce students.... it has its upsides and downsides. For PhDs though, getting online teaching positions are hard. An MA is all you need - especially with teaching experience. Hell, having two MAs (International Studies; Political Science) may be problematic. Universities wanting adjuncts and the like are hiring MAs. Online teaching is largely being done by MAs. PhDs 'cost too much'. but there is a lot out there. \n\n**If you are emotionally exhausted**, then it is time to seriously consider quitting and what it would entail. You'll have to get over a lot of self-pity and pride (anyone would) - you'll feel like a failure at first. But quickly you'll realize you can get all sorts of positions with an MA, some teaching and/or research experience - and I bet you'll find something that doesn't leave you crying and emotionally broken down. Remember, a PhD isn't about intellect - it is about stamina and ambition. \n\nI found that my love of teaching was... less impressive than those who loved regression models. Ultimately, that environment proved toxic - and the entire discipline is the same - insular, not engaged with policy makers, talking to small audiences of others doing similar research with little effect. Always rushed to publish while teaching well... there isn't a reason to put yourself through that if it is doing this to you. It doesn't make you any less intelligent, it just means you weren't cut out for something 99%+ aren't even remotely cut out for. Hell, just making it to an MA puts you in a small category of people, being ABD with an MA is damn impressive. \n\n**Some bittersweet advice**. If it isn't what you need - if you really are committed to seeing it through, see a therapist and get a psychiatrist. Depression is a major problem among graduate students, as is extreme anxiety (due to our archaic system of higher education). Talk to other grad students, talk to a therapist, get on some medicine. You have to take care our you before you can worry about finishing a research project or editing a dissertation chapter. But open your mind to the possibilities if you simply take an MA and leave. How would you market yourself - what opportunities would there be? You'd be surprised!",
