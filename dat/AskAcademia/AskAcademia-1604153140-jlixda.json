  "title:": "Anyone else depressed about defending their thesis online because of COVID?",
  "text": "For YEARS, basically since I started my PhD, I have been dreaming about my thesis defense. I was going to invite all my friends and family and have a giant party afterwards. I have been working so hard for months now and I haven't seen most of my friends for ages, so I was really looking forward to my thesis defense to see them again at last. And now... all that is gone. I have to defend online, alone at home, and maybe have an at-home dinner with my boyfriend afterwards rather than the giant party I always dreamed of. I also had to leave the university quite quickly after my PhD contract ended because of a job opportunity, and I was counting on my thesis defense to properly say goodbye to my research group + everyone else in the department. Not going to happen now... and I have to leave the country for a postdoc in January 2021 so I can't postpone the defense to next year. I am kind of devastated.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? I am so sad about this but I don't think there are any other options for me.",

There were like 60 people watching the stream, and I had relatives and friends watching that wouldn\u2019t have been able to otherwise. You\u2019ll be able to celebrate with your friends and family in person next year, and you have a job lined up which is awesome. Just be proud of your accomplishment, and make sure you practice your talk beforehand to get used to the format. When I did my presentation, I just got into a nice zone of focusing in on my slides and talk and not worrying about the audience. Anyways, at least in our department, most people end up scuttling off to their meetings and to do work afterwards anyways, and we just have an awkward celebration after.",

It was a great defense, and a pretty moving zoom party afterwards where everyone got to introduce themselves, congratulate her, share memories and encouragements, and just have a good celebration.",

Plus, I get nervous during presentations and being able to minimize the audience video and just focus on my slides helped calm me down. Make sure to practice and have your timing down so you don\u2019t speed through too quickly. I also had an open zoom link for a few hours the evening of my defense...not quite a party, but people could pop in to celebrate and catch up! Highly recommend! Congrats on the job and good luck finishing up!!",

Usually this presentation is a layman-friendly one with pictures of the lab, pictures of friends and family, etc; it's a thank you to the people in your life for supporting you during your PhD and they finally get to see what you've been doing and enjoy a beer together afterwards. It's a really nice tradition my uni has and I was so looking forward to it... Oh well. Both presentations will be on-line. I'm not so bothered about the hardcore technical one being online at all, and I'm beginning to accept the family+friends one being online.",

The defense also is not that long, it has a 15 minute presentation just for the audience, to explain in plain language what you have done (this part is without the committee). Then the defense is 45 minutes for the 4 opponents to ask you questions. After that, committee retreats to discuss and there will be a graduation ceremony when they come back.\n\nNote that the thesis is already approved by the committee beforehand, so the defense is mostly a formality. It really is a nice way to close the PhD chapter with friends, colleagues and family. In my uni the defense was always broadcasted online as well, so with an online defense you don't necessarily get more viewers. I feel sad for the PhD candidates right now who have to defend online and cannot have a party. I think we will have a couple of late parties next year...",

The biggest benefit by far was that I was able to invite people to watch online who never would\u2019ve been able to make it to an in-person defense. I had really old friends as well as folks who had finished before me, who lived hundreds or thousands of miles away, and who were able to be an important part of that final step. That ended up being a big deal for me, and it happened because the online format opened it up so that I could invite whoever I wanted.\n\nRegardless of the format, and like others have written, you\u2019ll soon be done!!

If so, see it as a chance to invite friends and family that otherwise may have been unable to come by.  \n\nI defended in March, still in person but already with reduced visitors and no real celebration, we couldn't do all traditions we usually do. My plans for the reception afterwards were cut short (especially since we moved the date forwards to avoid the impeading lockdown, which made the small celebration I could have super improviced). I would lie if I would say that I wasn't disappointed. *But* I also felt extremely relieved to be done, especially in these times. Looking back I rather would defend like that again, instead of waiting longer and not knowing when and how I might be able to defend. Sure, you could aim at 2021, but who knows when in-person defences will truely return? Early next year, late or not at all? And once they do, can you do the real-deal right away or only a smaller version?  \nI am sure once you are done you'll feel similar. A bit sad how it went but overall relieved and happy that you are finally done. Make sure to plan a small celebration as possible and make the best out of that day.  \nYou can be extremely proud that you didn't have to move your defence but managed to finish this year.

The stress of it all triggered an autoimmune disease and now I take immune suppressants... and I can't relax on weekends because I have to work on my research articles which have been rejected from every journal known to man after 1743876+ changes (no wonder, the labwork wasn't fully done!), and also prepare my thesis defense. Everyone has their struggles. I just needed to vent online/hear rants from people in similar situations. COVID has fucked everyone differently, I guess. The defense made it all ok and now it's gone. Sorry. I just feel really down and can't gain perspective right now. I really, really wanted the party after all this shite, it was the only ray of light I had. Why did I even do this?!",

I did get to say thanks and goodbye to my lab group, because my advisor had a small, socially distanced celebration the weekend after I defended.

I didn't want to because it was a big school and none of my friends were walking (Dec. graduation), so I would be alone and I knew I was going to grad school. But they made me sign up, and I did... and then my dad got cancer and they couldn't make it. (He's doing much better now!)\n\nThen, instead of walking for my master's, I got married, so ok, whatever. The defense was a blip and I had good friends and I was headed for my doctorate. There would be another chance.\n\nI was slated to defend this semester and \"walk\" in December. COVID and lack of jobs decided for me, but my school is also talking about canceling May graduation, and it's doubtful that the pandemic will be over by then in my state anyways. The restaurant that I wanted to have my first \"Doctor's\" reservation at has closed permanently, and I haven't been able to keep up on networking because of conferences. I know walking is a silly thing, but it's what I wanted. It's the point I've been looking forward to. \n\nI THRIVE on audience feedback/engagement, and presenting online just isn't the same. I feel you. \n\nBUT! You're a doctor! You did the work! You have a job! People are proud of you even if you don't get to do the big party *right now*. Have a post doc finishing party. Or a \"real job obtained\" party. Or just a super awesome birthday bash once we can celebrate. (Birthday because that's the day to celebrate YOU and everything you are.) Have a party just because. \n\nEverything sucks right now. I'm sorry. Sending big hugs.",

I was lucky to have had an in-person defense just weeks before all the lockdowns began, when the virus was already spreading in Wuhan, and it is a special event - it was one of the greatest moments of my life really (my defense went really well, wrapped up a full 30 min ahead of schedule because the Q&A from the committee was so easy, and my adviser took me out for lunch after that). Of course, I didn't have the fun of defending in my boxers in a Zoom meeting, but yeah, it's definitely a loss for a lot of students.\n\nHowever, my commencement got \"postponed\" (and I don't think it will ever happen). I was just so disappointed, I didn't have a commencement for my lower degrees and was looking forward to one big celebration for my entire higher education. Instead I got some pre-recorded videos and a postcard from my university (which I still appreciate). I'm kind of over it now, but I'll keep telling everyone for the rest of my life that I never had a commencement because of the pandemic.",
