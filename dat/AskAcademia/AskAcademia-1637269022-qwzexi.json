  "text": "Hi all! \nThis might be a bit off-topic for the group, in which case I apologise. \n\nI have my first \u201creal\u201d academic job interview tomorrow. It\u2019s for a permanent teaching position at a university in my homeland (Sweden) and I really, really want this job (English language). I know it\u2019s a highly competitive business, so just getting invited is very exciting, but I was hoping someone out there could give me a sense of what to expect? I realise that different countries may have different approaches, of course, but nonetheless, I\u2019d much appreciate any advice on how these things tend to go in your experience. \n\nAny advice or insight is most welcome! Thank you!",
