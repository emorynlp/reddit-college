  "text": "I am doing my MSc in wastewater treatment. My dissertation  underwent 6 revisions before it was submitted for external review. I also have a paper that has been submitted about the same work which has been through many reviews.\n\nI just got back a lot of reviewer comments on that paper and I cannot bring myself to address them at all. It feels like torture continually revising the same work over and over. I would rather drop out at this point than read one more sentence. I burst into tears everything I think about having to do it.\n\nHow do I force myself to work when I would literally rather have my teeth pulled out than open my laptop?",

A second reading after a few days is less emotional.\n\nPlan a strategy how to go about responding.  Which ones require simple text edits, which more reading, and if any which require experiments.\n\nRemember that the reviewers aim was actually (and this is often forgotten) to help you bring the work to publication.  They gave their time freely to make this manuscript better.  They are not your enemy, just people trying to help.",

      "text": "This is the scientific process, so you will need learn a way to deal with this. A revision of your paper was requested so the reviewers and editor liked your paper well enough to take this step rather than rejecting your paper. I see many junior scholars go through this before they learn how science works. Extensive revisions are frequent. \n\nScientists need thick skin.\n\nIf this type of work is truly torturous to you, you may need to rethink a career science, but you can probably get through this and if the paper is accepted after revisions you will feel more positive. I recommend talking to your advisor and asking them to put your revisions in context and help you with strategies to address them. Good luck.",

      "text": "I feel this in my bones, for sure. And although my (recent) PhD is in education, my background is in environmental engineering (mostly wastewater and groundwater, some air pollution control), and I also did an MA in education, so I've been through the endless-revision cycle twice now. \n\nI had some real break-downs, just like you're describing, in both my MA thesis and my PhD dissertation. As stupid and shitty as it is, I think that's actually what the credential is all about: earning this credential means that you're not only a very capable engineer or scientist, capable of solving problems that very few people can solve, but also able to communicate those solutions to a variety of audiences, some of whom may be genuinely malicious. \n\nFor me, getting through my dissertation required seeking support from my physician: she prescribed an anti-depressant which helped a lot, and I'm about to start talk therapy this week. Because my doctor is based at my university, her immediate response to my mental health crisis was, \"You're in the right place, we see this from grad students *all the time*, and we're going to help you.\" \n\nThere's nothing unusual about what you're feeling, or what you're going through. Find the supports you need to help you push through this really awful moment in time, and then know that you *don't have to keep doing it*. Once you've earned your credentials, if the utter bullshit that is academic review doesn't feel worth it to you, it's absolutely and totally fine to go make a career out of running a municipal water treatment facility somewhere. You'll make a good living, and be responsible for ensuring that a community has safe drinking water and/or that the environment is protected from industrial pollution. In the decades to come, practical work in that field will almost certainly be more important than anything that anyone reviewing your work right now will do, if we're honest...",
