  "text": "I receive review requests by email, not even always open them, let alone reply promptly. Then read the abstract, decide if I care and if I have time, get the whole PDF, write down what I think etc.... And we know in the end how freaking long reviews take.\n\nHow did it work before the internet was widespread? Did they send around letters to other nations asking people if they wanted to receive a manuscript, and in that case send out a whole package of printed stuff?\n\nHow long did reviews take then? Like two years from submission to publication?\n\nAnd when did they switch to online?",

But email has been standard since the late 90's.\n\nMy first paper was done all as hardcopy proofs and reviews.\n\nWe have a journal in our field that *still* does hardcopy proofs at the pre-print editing stage. And it's awesome. They have proofing editors who actually care about en and em dash, and all the other nuances of correct formatting. Their hardcopy mark up is beautiful, and it actually forces you to consider edits in a way that track changes doesn't. It's a bit more time consuming, but it's a nicer process.",

We would assemble the manuscripts into a pile and the Editor would come to the office once or twice a week and assign two reviewers to each paper (assuming it was within the scope of the journal--but desk rejects were rare at the time). We had an office full of assistants that would then make copies of the manuscripts, type a letter to the reviewers, and then send them off. When the reviews came in, we created a pile for the editor, who then made a determination--accept, accept with revision, not acceptable in present form, or reject. We had four or five Editorial Assistants who would then take the reviewer comments plus the editor's decision and craft a letter to the authors.",

(more postmen, faster delivery, more mail-room sorters, more secretarial staff to open and triage mail, multiple deliveries per day, etc.)  \n\nA letter in 1970 could easily get from East Coast US to West Coast US in 3 days.   (which, realistically, is about how long it takes me to get to reading an email someone has sent!)\n\nMail delivery within a city was almost always overnight. \n\nThe BEST thing about professional life via mail was that, because it's not easy to write a letter, and it cost postage, most of what you received was *actually significant*.  (!)  Today, with email, even after spam is filtered, maybe 80% of the email I have to read is just stupid ccs that I don't need to see, or vapid pleading from the Under-Dean of Extracurricular Outreach or whatever.\n\nAnd students.  If you ever got a letter from a student, it was an older student requesting a letter of recommendation...  But you never got 30 or 50 emails a day like \"i dont understnd the assmt, prof.\" or \"i'm sick heres my sikc note can i take a makeup for exam today, PLEASE RPLY BEFORE EXAM.\"\n\nAnd because professionals had only 1/100th of the shit to wade through, they were quicker and more responsive with actual mail... i.e. with significant items, like agreement to do a peer reviews!\n\nBut, yes, of course all of the communication by mail (including sending typewritten ms's back and forth) probably added about a month to six weeks on to the peer review process.  not more than that, though.  \n\nAnd, because professors were less swamped in mindless b.s. (like answering student emails) they had more time to get to the peer review more quickly and finish it more quickly... so maybe the same amount of elapsed time?  just guessing here.\n\nThat's my $.02, which used to get you a WHOLE PIECE of licorice at the soda fountain.
