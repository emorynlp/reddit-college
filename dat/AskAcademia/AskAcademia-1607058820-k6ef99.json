  "text": "I just turned 18 and im senior in high school in the United States but im really not doing good in school and im still very lost on where I wanna take my life but the only career path I can see myself enjoying is a career associated with space and physics. I truly want nothing more than to live my life exploring and understanding these concepts of progressing science. I\u2019ve always tried to ask my family what I could possibly do to head down that path and they kinda just told me it\u2019s too late for that road and to give up on it but I can\u2019t stop fantasizing about being able to dip my toes into a career in science. I just wanted to know if even have a chance and if I do just how I could go about doing this \nand im very sorry if I sound ridiculous coming into here asking for too much im not very fluent with Reddit and how it works but i feel very constricted trying to figure this life stuff out",

When I started taking grad classes, we would get assignments that were advanced enough that there were virtually no materials to help us complete them and it was not uncommon to receive a problem solving some small proof from the professor's research. Something I noticed about the PhD students is that, while all smart, they were extremely hard-working and had a singular focus when working on a problem. They would spend hours and hours just inching along a proof even if it took several days. They would prove special cases; try to apply techniques/proofs from other fields; or would often go on long walks trying to work out the problem in their head. That's what I mean by persistence.\n\nThere are certainly geniuses out there (we had a 13 year old kid in my graduate classes who would always have the highest scores) but what really stood out among the best students was their ability to persist on a problem.",

      "text": "A couple of thoughts:\n\n1. It's not too late. On the one hand, I don't want to give you false hope that if you only try you will be assured of a career in your chosen profession. If after much effort math remains a difficult spot for you, a career as a physicist may not be in the cards. On the other hand, I do think that the fact that you are struggling now as a high school senior does not mean you will never succeed at these endeavors in the future. Sometimes, a different learning environment, new study skills, or heckuva a lot of persistence helps a person to get better at things they struggled with.\n\n2. I agree with u/aggressive-teaspoon's advice that you might consider careers that involve your passion for physics and space in one way or another without becoming a physicist/astronomer. A lot of students want to become a doctor, for example, not because a becoming a doctor is the career that makes the most sense for all of them, so much as they are passionate about healthcare and serving others and doctor, along with nurse, are the two careers they know of in the healthcare field. The suggestion of science writing is great, and you might see what other opportunities there might be. (Science teacher? Working at a museum? Something with art or graphic design that ties in physics or astronomy? Etc.)\n\n3. You say you're lost on what you want to do in life, and I just want to note that that's normal at age 18. The part of your brain that is involved in long-term planning isn't done developing until around age 25, so there is an irony that we ask 18-year-olds to make these kinds of decisions. Allow yourself to continue exploring the areas that you are interested in and passionate about, and be open to the possibility that other things may spark your interest, as well. If you can now at your high school, or once you arrive at a college, consider taking a career or vocational assessment such as the Strong Interest Inventory. These kinds of assessments can help you identify careers that you may not have even known existed that are a good fit for your interests.\n\nGood luck!",

You don\u2019t need to have your whole life planned out right now.\n\nSince you\u2019re not sure what you want to do, I recommend starting out at a community college. You\u2019ll get some of the basic classes done (english, math, some social sciences and humanities\u2014the things that are required for basically every major) at a fraction of the cost of a university. And it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll be in a much smaller class than if you took the same one at a university. (For example, my intro physics class has a maximum of 48 students; the equivalent class at the nearby university has 400. You\u2019d better believe my students have more of an opportunity for individual attention.)\n\nI got into physics because I took an astronomy class as a general education requirement as a freshman in college (I was a music major at the time). I liked it, so I took another one, then another...one thing lead to another and I double-majored in physics and math. If you\u2019d told me when I was in high school that I would do that, I would have called you nuts!

      "text": "You were probably never motivated to learn math before. Now that you have a reason to learn it (i.e. that it's the gateway to a life path to want to choose), I'd bet you could become quite skilled in math in a pretty short time. It's definitely not too late. I went back to college when I was 25 for an engineering degree even though I didn't at all like math and dragged my feet through it in middle and high school. I got all As in all my college math courses, because I was motivated to learn the stuff (and I love math, I just wasn't ready for it when I was learning the basics in 6th grade etc., so I disadvantaged myself for all later middle and high school math courses).\n\nI recommend you go on khan academy and start at the very beginning of the algebra Playlist. Watch every video through algebra 2 and trigonometry and precalc. You could learn some Calculus there too, if you want, but all you really need to do well in calc 1 is strong algebra and trig (they're \"precalc\" for a reason). Work problems along the way. \n\nAbsolutely definitely ignore anyone who tells you it's too late to pursue your ambitions.\n\nHere's a general idea of a typical path to engineering work: one would usually get an undergrad degree related to the field, either an engineering degree (aerospace engineering, for example) or a science degree (astrophysics, etc.). Science degrees are good if you want to work in academia as a professor doing research to discover new knowledge. Engineering degrees are good if you want to develop new technologies/ apply the knowledge gained by scientists (whether in academia or industry). Do a lot of research in undergrad, try to get a publication if possible. Make good relationships with at least 3 professors (go to their office hours, ask advice- one of these will be who you're doing research with, so you'll have a stronger relationship with them). This is because you'll need 3 good recommendation letters from professors to help you get into grad school (also helpful for industry jobs). Next, either go into industry with a bachelor's if you're ok working not in a leadership role. Or, get a Phd if you want to work in a leadership role (whether in academia (like becoming a professor running a research lab) or in industry).\n\nRealize also that every major is quite broad compared to the actual work you'll end up doing. Every step further you get in your career will see you drilling down deeper into a particular topic. Undergrad is most general, the research you do as an undergrad in lab will be much more specific, then grad school is very, very specific. Keep your options open as much as possible while still making concrete progress towards your goals- I say this because you may find out two years from now that you're even more interested in bioinformatics, or coding, or mechanical engineering, or whatever!\n\nAs you're looking into schools realize 1. There's no rule that says you have to go to college the minute you finish high school. You could take a year off if you want to or more with basically no penalty. 2. It's a perfectly viable path to go to a small/ lower tier school at first, especially if your grades are low, then transfer to a better school after a year or two to complete your degree. The first year or two of college is more or less interchangeable between any given university (it's a lot of prereqs before getting into the specifics of the major). It's easier to transfer into a good college from a bad one than it is to get into a good college out of high school (because by going to a few semesters of college and getting good grades, you prove you can pay for college and not drop out).",

I include myself in that category. Almost everything you wrote was true for me as an 18-19yo, but I now have a math PhD and apply math for a living.\n\nAlso, 18 is very young to be so worried about not having everything planned out. Go to college, take some astronomy and physics classes, see how they go. You may find that you're good at it or you may find that it's not your cup of tea after all. There's only one way to find out.",

I wandered and fucked around until I arrived in university at 22 years old in economics and switched to a major in maths at almost 24. Today at 30 I\u2019m in a PhD program with a big component of statistics and programming. I love what I do, I just had some terrible teachers in high school, and a very very shitty teenage period making me very unmotivated for school. Now that I do what i love, I can say (when I put impostor syndrom at off) that I am very good I what I do. My family didn\u2019t supported me neither, I come from conservative family that wanted me to get married and have children instead of wasting my time at school.\n\nDon\u2019t lose hope! Find what makes the fire in your belly burn. What makes you wake up in the morning every morning, even the mornings when you don\u2019t feel motivated at all but you know that what you do is for you higher good. Trust yourself, trust the process. \n\nAre there counsellors at your school that can help you ? Also, people would say I \u00ab\u00a0wasted\u00a0\u00bb two years of my life in economics. But i don\u2019t call it a waste, I needed to go through this to discover what was passionate for me in my heart. I would never have known I had passion for statistics if I never went to economics. \n\nThe only time you waste is the one where you live for others. If you do what you like, or try things to find it, you won\u2019t face failure : the universe will redirect you in the direction you need, but you need to take the leap in order to find it. \n\nIf physic is what passionate you, then go for it ! If you need some math prerequisite before entering the program, do them. No knowledge is a waste of time. \n\nOnly you knows deep inside what is meant for you. Good luck \ud83e\udd70",

It might be more of a case of not having a desire to learn and possibly bad teaching that led you to your situation. In the end it might  be that math just is a roadblock you can't overcome but personally I don't believe high school maths sets you up well for university since the bar for success isn't actually properly understanding it but just applying the right methods. I'd also recommend [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown/videos)and look for topics you're familiar with.

American high schools would be a joke, if only they were funny.\n\n2. See point 1: you haven't done any real math, most likely. If you've had *great* teachers up to this point, what you've been tested on is how well you can memorize a process and regurgitate it on command. This is useful only up to a point. If you've had mediocre or worse, you haven't even gotten that. \n\n3. Go to college. Take Physics 1 (which you probably would have to take to fulfill General Education requirements anyway). To do this, you'll need to take calculus. Take calculus in college, not in high school, and for the love of God avoid anything dual credit. Again, it'll satisfy your general education requirement for math, so it's not time wasted or anything, and you don't even have to tell your family what you're aiming for (DO tell your advisor when you meet her on campus). You'll need a background in algebra and trigonometry to get through calculus-- this is doable through a variety of means. \n\n4. Talk to your physics prof (or recitation leader) about this. She'll have a better perspective on your abilities. \n\n5. Go to the biggest and best university you can get into. They have more money, and in lab sciences, money matters a lot.\n\n6. You're young, so give yourself permission to change your mind and explore. As far as life goes, no one knows what he's doing. We are *all* just making it up as we go along, and you'll do fine. Aim for happy, or at least content. And if physics is where you decide you want to be, then that's great! \n\nPS. If your family doesn't have a background in science or academia, then they don't know what they're talking about. Practice nodding your head, smiling, and keeping your mouth shut.

Now I\u2019m best-known for developing statistical methods to answer interesting questions in my field of study, and have a pretty good academic career. \n\nThe difference for me is that I needed a reason to care and a problem to solve. I don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass about lines intersecting infinite planes or about how fast a stupid car goes up a perfect slope. And, frankly, I didn\u2019t get it. At all. Give me some juicy multi-dimensional sparse data from an experiment and I\u2019m all over that stuff. Turns out, I learn by doing, and by solving problems.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy, or that I\u2019m a genius. I have to work extra hard to pick up ideas everyone else learnt in high school or undergrad, and half my colleagues are very clever mathematicians - so you can imagine the gap. I have never taken a class in calculus, for instance - had to learn it the hard way. I couldn\u2019t learn in the system I was in, and I\u2019ve had to play catch up. I have enough motivation - because the problems I work on are interesting to me - to do so. \n\nThis also means I came to my current field from a different slant than most people: math-light undergrad in my area of study, then picking up math in grad/post-doc as required to solve problems. I\u2019ve found that many people in research have non-standard backgrounds though, and they often bring more interesting perspectives because of it. \n\nYou may find that your path to what interests you is also meandering.

I haven't read it, but I took her Coursera class \"Learning How to Learn\" which is partially based on the book. She grew up thinking she was \"bad at math\" but well after high school she learned to study it differently and now she's a professor of Engineering. The idea is that *how* you study and learn is as important, if not more important, than \"aptitude.\" \n\nAnd even if you don't get better at math, there are many many careers in science that don't involve heavy mathematics. Science education is one. I have a friend getting a degree in that after he failed his qualifying exams for his physics PhD, and he actually likes it much more. He still gets to enjoy his love of physics in his work. \n\nAlso, you're still in high school! It's absolutely not too late! My cousin is a bit like you- didn't get great grades in high school and feels bad at math. She actually hated science when she was young because she didn't understand it. She also did poorly her first year of college, so she switched to a community college for two years and then went back to four year college. Now she's getting her masters in a social science field and it seems she's totally found her calling. I have another friend who flunked his first year of college and did the same thing- community college, then back to four-year- and got his degree in computer engineering. \n\nIn college or community college, or even online in the mean time, I would recommend taking some introductory classes in physics or astronomy. At the same time, try to re-wire how you study and learn. See if you really like doing these subjects, and shadow some people in related careers if possible. If it seems like it's for you, go for it!
