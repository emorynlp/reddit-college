  "title:": "Finished highschool and dropped out of college (no bachelor's degree). I want to do my master's and then a research to get a PhD. Is a bachelor's degree mandatory?",
  "text": "After finishing highschool, I dropped out of college in my first year due to personal issues (depression, no interest in subjects, etc). I'm currently doing a course in animation and I'm also doing several other courses online and offline, but none of them give me a bachelor's degree. I don't wanna remain a college dropout though, I wanna get into research and hopefully get a PhD, but for that, a master's degree is necessary. I'm not very interested in getting a bachelor's degree course and \"wasting\" 3-4 years of my life there. I'm 20 already, so I must take decisions quick. Since I'm not interested in getting a bachelor's, can I directly get into a master's course with my other course certificate and work experience? Is it even possible and does any college even allow that?",

All those internet gurus telling you school is a waste of time fail to realize that the first two years of the bachelors are basics to read the upper divs. General Education is boring, but by not having a degree I have 0 faith that you can interpret engineering analysis that utilizes Ordinary Differential Equations as representations of real objects, or knowing linear algebra to utilize the power of state-space.

      "text": "A master's student is expected to, the day they start the program, to read, understand and communicate what primary research articles are trying to communicate.  Which means having a broad and moderately deep understanding of the general field.  Also, you are expected to be able to be moderately self directed.  So if your project deals with a new topic you should be able to use primary literature to teach you enough to be functional in that topic.  For PhD students the same expectations apply, just with twice the work being expected since it's a fully supported position (ie no TAing).\n\nAn applicant who couldn't be bothered to complete a bachelor's would be rejected immediately.  A bachelor's not only means you have a basic level of understanding in a field but have some degree of motivation and follow through.\n\nAsk yourself this: if there what a question you wanted to know the answer to how many hours would you dedicate to learning how to ask the question, then how many hours to actually ask it.\n\nAt the PhD level the answer is, \"however many it takes damnit\"",
