  "text": "I\u2019ve seen so many articles and posts about the negative aspects of getting a PhD and finding a decent job in academia (particularly the humanities). All of the struggles and downsides seem completely valid, but surely there are those out there who have more positive experiences. Anyone willing to share?",

If I convinced you that they are not irrational, I'd also be happy, even if exhausted. The only unpleasant outcome would be if we got angry at each other for no reason.\n\nI like transparency, and I think it's an important step towards fairness (or rather, kindness). Unions are better, but transparency are a first step.\n\nTo put the actions where my mouth is, I'm paid about 80k now; it was 70k when I started 5 y ago, but we're unionized, and the union fought for that. It's all on glassdoor though (and, I heard, Chronicle), so hardly a secret anyways :)\n\nSorry if I offended you with an offside remark!",

In my smaller college it's also not too bureaucratic; I know all the administrators well, have good working relationships with everyone from the president to the plumber, and we all seem to share a common commitment to educating young people. We are on a 3/3 teaching load and salaries are around the 75th percentile on the AAUP scale for BA schools, so pay if fair and workload reasonable.

Pretty much a standard pattern for liberal arts colleges, which is creating challenges for staffing/enrollments in traditional liberal arts majors. But we're committed to *not* simply following the market of 17-year-old demand, as we see about 2/3 of students change majors at least once  after they enroll and the pre-health fields lose almost 75% of their incoming majors within two years-- lots of opportunity for other departments to attract them.",

But far too many students come in-- men in particular --unsure of what they want to do and aware only that \"business\" is a field in which there are jobs, so they default to that as a major. It's unfortunate. \n\nWhen I was in college (1980s) career services was a complete waste of time; they literally worked only with business and a few government agencies and had no idea how to advise students seeking other career paths. Things are different today. Career services on my campus routinely does things like panels on \"careers for English majors\" that are quite good. The problem is really at the other end of the pipeline; too many years of the STEM circle jerk has left families believing anyone who doesn't major in computer science will end up living in a box under a bridge. The media don't help either, even though many of them were presumably humanities majors as well.",

BUT ALSO that this kind of forum elicits many more negative experiences because people having a good time rarely go post about it on reddit. \n\nAnyway, I joined a lab under an advisor that I was literally warned about on the first day. Another grad student (who didn't make it through) told me he had a reputation for being difficult and disagreeable. And that was true, to some extent, if you didn't get things done or had bad ideas. I worked hard, I learned how to function, and I ended up publishing a lot and getting an excellent CV that earned me a SLAC job that has been extremely rewarding. \n\nNot to say that everything is perfect, but in general I regarded both my PhD and current job as \"easy\" because I learned and follow a good system of getting things done on time/early, and applying for grants/awards/conferences using the work I've already finished. I've been able to buy cool stuff that I always wanted but could never afford (with research money, so within reason) and travel to places that have been amazing, with people who are enlightening and wonderful. \n\nI would seriously hesitate to give advice or say how I got there while others have trouble. Part of it is DEFINITELY luck. I was lucky to get admitted, having majored in another discipline. I was lucky to find an area that really interested me, and more importantly some key aspects of it that I could really focus on. I was lucky enough to have friends and family (and a personality) that either supported me or left me alone. And I was extremely lucky that a department where everyone just happened to have similar but not too similar research interests had an opening during the narrow window when I was marketable (i.e., between the last year of grad school and the first 2 or 3 years after). \n\nStill, the non-luck part was learning not to procrastinate and to throw your whole self into your job. A PhD and professorship is something you should pursue because you want to dedicate your life to research and/or teaching (and I guess college service, but yeah right). If you don't want to do that, that is FINE, just look for other jobs.",

Or, sexist/misogynistic, senile, etc. They could die on the job, could totally change priorities, have personal problems, have departmental problems, etc. I've seen all of those things happen. \n\nBUT, I've also seen a lot of grad students who were in it for the wrong reason. You can control your own goals, you can reflect on whether you really want the job or just the title. Whether you'd be happy as a professor or whether you'd enjoy some other aspect of college or industry, or maybe you don't really want your career to dominate your life at all. \n\nMuch (but not all) of the stress I see on here comes from people who just have a different priority, and can't reconcile that with the reality of grad/professor life. And worse, some people keep going with it and end up as miserable professors!",

Yes, there are things I could complain about, but that's speaking from what I recognize is an extremely privileged position.\n\nI have had insomnia and other mental health issues since I started my PhD. I had a very supportive PhD advisor (I did have friends in my cohort who didn't).

In some cases it\u2019s that they\u2019re not great instructors, to be honest, and often haven\u2019t done much to intentionally become better.  Many have also done little outside of teaching such as curriculum development, committees, student clubs, department meetings, outreach, etc., which even at the CC is important. Of course, this is hard when you\u2019re a freeway flyer traveling between three schools every week, as I know from experience, but it\u2019s often necessary to demonstrate that you\u2019re a well-rounded instructor, especially when TT positions are so competitive. Sometimes it also comes down to personality and their inability to work well with others. It could even be that they don\u2019t interview well or submit poor applications that don\u2019t clearly outline why they\u2019re a great candidate and how they meet the desirable qualifications for the position, including what they\u2019ll bring to the college beyond teaching.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely a numbers game at times as you can tell from the numerous stories on here of people applying to 100+ schools over several years before they finally land a position. But there are definitely things you can do to enhance your odds.",

I often lurk on this sub not wanting to say anything because I get that this is not everyone's experience in academia. I feel quite lucky with even just the premise that my job is to get smarter everyday, and I basically get paid to read, think, and write. All the much better that I am also in a wonderful environment. I think these definitely exist.",

There are a few things that are adjustments, for example the service load, but overall nothing that would ever make me want to leave.\n\nI'm currently on a hiring committee for 2 open positions in our department and it's very eye opening, especially given that I was on the market just last year. Given the vast amount of unqualified or tangentially qualified people that apply it's not hard to see where the complaints come from.",
