      "text": "Im going to assume that what you mean by best are those who hold TT/tenured jobs at the Ivies/top tier schools.\n\nIt's complicated, and I am speaking here from knowing these people, not from being one of these people myself.\n\nIt takes a lot of publications in great journals, book publications with great presses, and a continued publication pipeline (I'm speaking mostly about humanities, but if STEM also lots of grant funding). All of this means long work hours and dedication/obsessiveness that leads to many sacrifices in your family/social life. This also often requires an area of specialization/topic that is both fruitful and hip/cutting edge/etc.\n\nIt also sometimes requires having already spent time at one of these schools--PhD from Ivy, Post doc from amazing school X, or having famous well connected advisor from one of these places, etc. There are certainly politics involved, as well as a lot of luck. In some fields it's much harder to move up into these jobs if you didn't already come from these schools. But in some fields people write their way in.\n\nI want to also add that there are top people in their field that work at many types of research universities (and sometimes SLACs too), not just Ivies or top tier, and they have amazing and cutting edge publications that are well respected and widely read.",

      "text": "In addition to what gggggggggfffffffff said, most great academics have something about them that makes them uniquely amazing. Some X factor. It's not always raw intelligence. Sometimes it's an unparalleled work ethic, sometimes it's brilliance, sometimes it's having a nack for efficiency, structure or organization. Sometimes it's passion, sometimes they just got lucky to be handed a very important line of work so much so that the funding comes easy. Sometimes it's charisma to the level that people bend over for them for no good reason.  Whatever it is, most successful academics have their \"thing\". Some cognitive asset that they rely on like a crutch to get by. It's their tool for success, and not everyone has the same thing. Whatever that X factor is, they are usually amazing at it.",
