  "text": "I am at my 3rd year of teaching high school and I really wanna get back to studying advanced courses again. I have a degree in biology with major in cell and molecular biology and I feel like if I went further to my work I'm gonna be dumbed down. On the other hand, i need to have enough savings to pursue grad school. Will this kind of arrangement be detrimental to my chances when I apply to master programs?",
