  "title:": "When does it make sense to get a grad degree and if you do want to get one then which type of degree is better?",
  "text": "I feel like I have to ask this, because I'm very unsure of what I want to do with my future after I finish my master's in computer science. I know I want to head out into industry and go back to having a job like I used to before. I know I want to run a startup and build something, I know I want to delve deeper into mathematics, in particular from an economics/optimization standpoint and I know whatever business I build I want to focus on these things. \n\nBut I've thought about getting another master's degree, perhaps a course based master\u2019s degree in economics or an MBA of some sort, hopefully with a strong mathematical component. However, I talked to a friend about this, he's said that a degree might not really do me any good if I'm not looking to switch to another career  or that if I want to go into startups it might just not do anything for me. \n\nI think he has a point, but I'm confused, and I don't know what to do. I guess at the end of the day it's like the title says, when is it worth it to pursue a degree? And if you do go for another degree, but you're always planning to go into industry anyway, is an MBA a better choice than some course based degree on some other field?\n\nI don't see myself doing a PhD or bothering with another degree that is just going to throw me deeper into the world of academia. I already don't like that or doing research at all, I think the academic world is a bubble and that a lot of people here don't really understand the real world or know how to exist in it.",

Referring to the \"weirdness\" of academia is ingrained in our culture and just something people say. I'm kind of just shouting into the void.",

But for the meantime, I'll just do it through books. I've always thought about doing it if I can pay for it, but otherwise, nah, no way. At any rate, this is a simple of way of thinking about it, and it kind of takes off the pressure.\n\n>As an aside, I always find it so bizarre when people refer to academia in opposition to the \"real\" world.

Do they think we have servants and get our food cooked and delivered to us?\n\nNo, I don't think that, but academia is a bubble in my opinion and now that I've actually delved into it and seen it first hand, a lot of people hype it up like it's some sort of different world. I think it's as full of issues and screwed up as the business world. Nonetheless, in my opinion this world does a better job of hiding that unlike the business world.\n\n>I know some people say this to mean \"academics don't have a perspective on the practices of business.\" But like...ok?

It's not that weird for people in one field to not know the details of how another field operates.\n\nIt doesn't happen to everyone in academia, I agree, but I think it's more about how academia sometimes seems impractical and far away from the real issues of the world. I guess the reason I see it this way is that I've seen many PhD students that barely seem like they could function in any capacity outside their lab. I just don't understand how some of them don't seem to capable anywhere outside their fields, especially for some of the more theoretical PhD students. I don't know what to think of that, or about the conversations that I've been a part of when it comes to PhD stuff. Like some people think that because they are getting a PhD, they are guaranteed a job. That couldn't be more removed from the real world, and it's a horrible example of a fallacy. It's wishful thinking and a complete and utter misunderstanding of how the world works. Nothing guarantees you a job, nothing at all. The business world is not going to hand you a job because you did a PhD. A lot of businesses do look for PhDs, but I'm willing to bet that even the people that participate in that job market will be better served by being well-rounded individuals with soft skills rather than people that have been stuck in their books forever. \n\nMy cousin went to MIT for his undergrad and then to Stanford to get his M.Sc. and PhD, he doesn't have a job and this is someone with an engineering degree with high demand.\n\nMaybe my world has come crashing down, it's my fault and idealized this world because of my cousin, but this has been a shock to me, and I am completely and utterly disappointed about many of the things that I've seen in academia.\n\nIt just seems like a lot of people put in a lot of effort into getting into this. We claw over each other trying to get selected to do this, and after getting in here and actually doing this, I don't feel like this really warrants that effort or that it deserves that kind of focus.\n\nIf I do go for that econ degree, I'll want to do it at a top university, but I wouldn't really mind doing it somewhere that isn't at the top. I just care about the knowledge, and not really about where I get it.\n\nI'm sorry if this is a pessimistic view, but I just can't help but be disappointed in academia. I just don't think it deserves the pedestal it has been placed upon. Education is important, and it contributes greatly to society, but I think it is overhyped, and I would have been fine if I hadn't gone to grad school.",

Look around at most of the posts on this sub. \n\n>Like some people think that because they are getting a PhD, they are   \nguaranteed a job. That couldn't be more removed from the real world, and  \n it's a horrible example of a fallacy.\n\nSome of my undergraduates think that because they're getting a bachelor's degree, they are guaranteed a job. I don't see this particular attitude as being more common among PhD students.\n\n>The business world is not going to hand you a job because you did a PhD.\n\nCorrect. A PhD is training to be a researcher, period. Few businesses are engaged in the type of research that requires them to hire PhDs. The majority of research work is done in universities, labs/institutes and similar settings, not in businesses. There are huge exceptions of course-- like pharmaceutical companies and some arms of tech giants-- where the business is engaged in real research. But regardless, unless your goal is to work as a researcher, I wouldn't recommend a PhD to anyone (an MBA is totally different, it's a professional degree).",

      "text": "Graduate degrees are mostly a means to an end, in that you get them because you have some end goal in mind that requires them. This is particularly true of expensive professional degrees like MBAs. With a master's in computer science, you can easily head out into industry and get a job - why bother with an MBA? You could choose to just take some additional economics and optimization classes as a non-degree student, if you want to augment your knowledge in that area. Or you could start working in the field and learn more on the job.\n\nIt sounds like you are ready to leave school and go to work. What has you contemplating getting another degree?",
