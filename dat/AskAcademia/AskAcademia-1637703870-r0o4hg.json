  "text": "Hi!\n\nI am currently making a list of texts from various disciplines of social sciences so I could get started on theory and develop a thorough multidisciplinary understanding.\n\nHowever, I am unable to figure how to take notes. I would prefer doing so on paper and not in a digital format. Any and all advice will be greatly appreciated.",
