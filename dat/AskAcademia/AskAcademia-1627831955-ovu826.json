  "text": "Hi everyone, I am submitting my paper to Elsevier Pattern Recognition journal. I use Latex to prepare the manuscript and it includes title page, highlight, author biograph. In the web portal, it asks to upload manuscript, title page, highlight separately in editable file so I guess I need to copy these contents out in Word docs and upload them. What I'm not sure is whether I need to remove these from the manuscript pdf or not ?\n\nThanks",
