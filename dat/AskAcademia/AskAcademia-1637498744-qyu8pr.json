  "title:": "[Advice needed] Got a job offer during PhD (final stages) - do I quit now?",
  "text": "Using a throwaway account.\n\nI am a 5-th year PhD student in a US University in the field of computer algorithms and optimization. My PhD funding will stop in some months from now (by the middle of 2022), and I am about 2/3 rd way into my dissertation as on this date. \n\nI received a job offer from a company that wanted me to work as a research scientist in my area that pays well, and they would like me to join very soon. They didn't seem particularly interested about whether I had a PhD or not at the time of joining since other employees in similar roles in this company do not have a PhD.\n\nWhen I told my advisor about this, he told me that me leaving at this point would practically be the end of my PhD program, as he would not be able to make it convenient for him to work with me on the rest of my dissertation if I joined the company.\n\nWhat do *I* think about it? I've been working on algorithms of various kinds for my dissertation during my PhD, and I like this kind of work. However, an infuriating thing about academia is the extent to which you need to satisfy a reviewer's/advisors whims and fancies. Papers that I send to conferences/publications are rejected because they want something more. Projects that I am working on need constant revision because my advisor always wants more results.  At the rate I am going, I am not sure if I will be able complete my PhD successfully before my funding ends. \n\nThis has made me disillusioned with academia, and I really want to start something new with my life instead of beating up old horses (my dissertation projects) hoping to squeeze out more results. Industry roles in my field seem a lot more forgiving than academia, and they pay really well.\n\nBut I also hear from my colleagues and friends that I might as well stay a few more months and complete the PhD after trying harder, given how long I have been in the program.\n\nI would like to know from you these:\n\n1. What are your views on my situation?\n2. If I am not interested in academia any more, and only want to make my future in the industry, is having a PhD on my resume worth it? \n3. How can I talk about an incomplete PhD on my resume? I am at an ABD stage. Would this impact future job prospects, or will my job experience help me out later on?\n4. If you believe I need to stay on in the program, why would you think so?\n\nYour insights on this will be greatly appreciated.",

      "text": "Without saying too much on a public forum, I have experience with being a PhD student and working in industry\u2026 so I have some thoughts for you. \n\n1) My experience has been that jobs never sound better than when they are first offered. Meaning, they paint the job and its roles/responsibilities in the best possible light at the offer stage. Not to mention the surprises you can run into with people and personalities beyond the offer stage. So I\u2019d offer a few food for thought questions: Do you know someone who works in this role at this company? If yes, how well do you know them and how much can you trust them to give you the full truth? If you do know someone and you trust them, I\u2019d advise getting this input. If you don\u2019t know someone, ask yourself\u2014 how will my feeling about killing my PhD 2/3 of the way through a dissertation change or not change if this job ends up being a disappointment for whatever reason? It\u2019s easy to glamorize industry when you\u2019re only seeing the warts of academia compared to the rosy picture of the industry job at the offer stage. \n\n2) Will this job wait for you to get your PhD? Have you asked? If the answer is no, why won\u2019t they wait? Is it YOU they really want, or is it a hard market in which to find employees and they just want someone qualified? If they want YOU, they should be fine waiting for you to finish a dissertation. \n\n3) How rare is this job? Is it so competitive you couldn\u2019t get it or a similar job after your PhD?\n\n4) Even if you\u2019re over academia, does a PhD open doors for industry advancement once you\u2019re in industry? The answer here is almost always yes regardless of field. Sure, you\u2019ll start in the same place in industry as a non-PhD, but when they look for advancement potential, you\u2019ll almost certainly look different with a PhD than without. \n\n5) Does a PhD, in general, open doors for industry jobs in your field? Will you have an easier time finding different and varied options, negotiating salary, and generally finding positions that interest you with the increased prestige of a PhD?\n\n5) Somewhat repetitive but bears repeating\u2014 if you become somewhat disillusioned with industry down the road, how will you feel about having closed the door on academia when you\u2019re so close? And knowing you literally can\u2019t go back unless you want to truly start over (and you don\u2019t). \n\nMy opinion here is that if you were 1-3 years into a PhD, you could justify leaving for industry. 2/3 of the way through a dissertation? Don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not a good idea. You\u2019re at the stage where you\u2019re expected to be totally burned out and frustrated on the PhD. The fact that having an industry job feels like freedom and having a life again is expected for the stage you\u2019re in\u2014 but given a few months of that freedom, I would worry that you\u2019ll be saddled with enormous regret for killing your PhD when you are truly so close. \n\nThe sunk cost fallacy is often a fallacy\u2014 but not when you\u2019re 2/3 of the way through a dissertation.  This includes having a semester or two unfunded to finish up.\n\nBottom line, if this company wants you, they\u2019ll wait. The fact that they don\u2019t care about your PhD is more of a red flag than anything else that the job just needs people and they don\u2019t really care about your advancement potential and your ability to do more than non-PhDs in the same role. I say this as someone with some industry experience in my field\u2014 I\u2019m not just spitballing on this one. \n\nFinish your dissertation\u2014 then decide where you want to go.",

      "text": "Don't quit, go to the chair and if you don't get a positive response go to the dean. I was in my 6th year when I was offered a job and was ready to leave. I worked with the chair and dean to specify what milestones needed to be met, how, and when. Due to the financial requirements of tuition, which is normally covered by TA or RA, I got the dean to cover it. I now put this on my resume as a prestigious Dean's Dissertation Fellowship. \nMy job didn't require a PhD but the opportunities it has opened has been life changing. Sticking up for yourself will show others you are ready. \nThe following year was hell, working 40 hours a week at a new job, working 20 hours a week at the university 60 miles away, and writing 4 papers that became my dissertation, but is a great story to tell during interviews. \nAlso pursue options with your future employer. Maybe push your start date back 3 months and WFH 3 months of orientation which could give 6 months to knock out few key experiments, train colleagues to take over, and write a few chapters. \nA PhD is a degree in problem solving and looking at problems creatively. The past 5 years you've gained the skills, now put them to use! Good luck!",
