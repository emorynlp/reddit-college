  "title:": "New Master's after PhD? How dumb is this?",
  "text": "I have a PhD in Political Science -got it 5 years ago this Spring. I'm also now 41 and thinking \"now-or-never\" with career shuffling. I've been picking up a bunch of adjunct work and doing small consultant contracts, like building academic programs/certificates, course design, survey construction and administration. I also have a metric ton of service and I am very active on campus. However, I've published \\*nothing\\* academic since my dissertation because . . . well, I find it excruciatingly dull and slowly but surely turning into a bunch of wankery in many fields. Yes, I should have known I'd grow to hate academic research/writing, but I THOUGHT I loved it. So, downvote away. \n\nAnyhow, I was thinking of going back to school for a master's in some more applied policy work, perhaps in GIS/Environmental Planning/Economic-Urban Development. I LOVE teaching, but the way things are in my market (Boston metro) securing a stable, full-time teaching job is extremely difficult, especially when I'm openly curmudgeonly about publishing. With that in mind, I can continue to adjunct at least a couple of courses to scratch that teaching itch. Has anyone thought of this, or have friends/colleagues who have done something like this? Thanks!",

If it\u2019s the first then I don\u2019t know if a masters will make you more competitive at this point. If it\u2019s the second wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to try to get your foot in the door somewhere at a similar but probably higher pay as a masters to get a few years experience? Have you tried applying for these types of jobs, you might already be more competitive then your realize. With your PhD you\u2019ll likely be apply to learn quickly and will be competitive for lateral movement once you get some practical experience under your belt. I could be totally wrong here, just my 2cents!",

There is absolutely no reason for you to get any other degree in the fields you list when you have a poli sci PhD. A masters in GIS is overkill; you can take a few GIS-focused classes, the kind that many working professionals take in their free time, and you're done. You will get very little value-add, both in terms of what you'll learn and in terms of what it'll add to your resume, from a masters in any vague policy field, environmental planning and urban development included. If you want to work in policy, get an internship. What you urgently need is non-academic work experience.",

I really don't want to take classes or pursue a degree if I don't have to, so, I like your idea of grabbing a few courses, at the most. The internship thing feels weird, tho. Not necessarily bc of having a terminal degree already, but just being some \"old\" bloke skulking internships.     \n\nFWIW, I have had at least one friend get a new masters after PhD.

It's hard to make it in the policy field if you don't have relevant work experience. Your corporate experience may put you in good stead, depending on what it is, although if you've been out of the workforce 5+ years it'll still be a hard sell. \n\nI mean, there's nothing wrong per se with getting a masters (or 10) - it's just not going to add much to your profile if you already have a PhD, you're not going to learn anything in it, and it's more or less going to be an expensive waste of time. I personally love expensive wastes of time and engage in them regularly, though.",
