  "text": "I have a PhD interview coming up and I can't seem to think of an impactful question that I may ask at the end of the interview. As an applicant, I think that I would need to ask something that may showcase my readiness and motivation for the PhD position. The questions I have in mind feel a little too basic. I would really appreciate some suggestions.\n\nThank you :)",

      "text": "I don't think that you should worry about a single \"impactful\" question to ask.  Instead, aim to be engaged and asking thoughtful questions throughout the interview.  A few examples:\n\n* the department and system: what requirements are there for graduation; are you required to publish and if so how many papers; what is the average degree length in the program; where do their graduates typically go; do you have to take courses; do you have to teach; where is the funding coming from and when does it run out; is the PhD a fixed duration\n\n* the individual supervisor: what is their style of supervision; how much contact do they have with their grad students; how and how often does the group meet; how hands-off vs hands-on are they; how much self-direction does their ideal PhD student have\n\n* the project: how much is the potential project already defined or is it flexible (and not just the project as a whole, but the approach/method, the end goal, the timeline and deliverables, etc; will you have time (or a requirement) to work on side projects, and if so can you pick them yourself; are there people in the group with experience working on aspects of the project which you're inexperienced on or are you expected to independently become the expert in the group\n\n* how this fits to your own goals: if you want to work in research afterwards, then find out how much their students typically publish, if any of them get experience with grant writing, how often they go to conferences; where did their past students end up.  If you want to work in industry, then ask about whether they work with industry or would support you working on some specific relevant skill development once your core work is moving along well.\n\n\nOf course you could spend an entire interview asking the important questions, but you can't, so you'll have to prioritize based on what you already know (or can find online, e.g. departmental policies or guidelines), what you're most concerned about, and what is typical or fixed in the country you're applying in.",
