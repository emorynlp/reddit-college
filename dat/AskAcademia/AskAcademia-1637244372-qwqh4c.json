Does anyone have any recommendations on how to include R code as part of a larger word document?\n\nETA: Thanks SO much for all the helpful suggestions! I\u2019ve managed to crack RMarkdown after these helpful comments and will use that to put into my thesis :)",

If I remember correctly, it comes out in a grey-ish type of format and in the font that R uses so its easy to distinguish from your overall thesis document. If you'd like some help you're more than welcome to sboot me a DM!",
