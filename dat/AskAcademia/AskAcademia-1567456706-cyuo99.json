  "title:": "Labour Day thread on precarious labour in post-secondary education:",
  "text": "Polemically put: post secondary educational facilities thrive on precarious labour. \n\nSome of this impacts our graduate students (as teaching assistants, research assistants, and people training to get a job one day), adjuncts, VAPs, non-ladder faculty, and postdocs. This precarity can then increase the workload of everyone higher above them (more letters of reference to write, more job applications to read, more work to supervise \\[if they do it\\]). \n\nPrecarious labour in the academy has been suggested to impact the [quality of teaching](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Conditions-Imposed-on/125573) (caveat: this article sparked a lot of controversy), [the production of hostile work environments](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2019/02/14/how-bias-toward-adjuncts-plays-out-among-students-other-faculty-and-administrators), and mental health crises (CW: [suicide](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/04/adjunct-professors-higher-education-thea-hunter/586168/)).\n\nPrecarious work extends far beyond the academic staff of a university found in the invisible labour that keep these institutions afloat: [food staff](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/11/huds-strike-retrospective/), janitorial staff, and part-time administrators. \n\nThe consequences of precarious work extend far beyond the quality of life issues associated with economic and job security  ([example 1](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2019/08/hefty-university-fees-are-sending-some-grad-students-food-banks), [example 2](https://tenureshewrote.wordpress.com/2014/01/16/succeeding-in-graduate-school-despite-poverty/), [example 3](http://neatoday.org/2017/11/01/homeless-professor/), [example 4](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/28/adjunct-professors-homeless-sex-work-academia-poverty), [example 5](https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/april-may-june-2019/how-college-professors-turned-into-uber-drivers/)) as well as issues of health insurance and retirement plans (for those not working in social welfare states). Included, but in no way limited to the plethora of sexual harassment cases (CW: discussions of sexual harassment and sexual assault): [example 1](https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/04/penn-sexual-harassment-in-academia-graduate-students-panel), [example 2](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/07/how-women-are-harassed-out-of-science/492521/), [example 3](https://medium.com/@UAW5810President/short-term-appointments-make-uc-postdocs-vulnerable-to-sexual-harassment-ccaeed532512), and [example 4](https://entropymag.org/a-refuge-for-jae-in-doe-fugues-in-the-key-of-english-major/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn this labour day I am wondering what other academics of reddit have done to help protect the precarious workers we labour with.",

      "text": "I'm part of a voluntary union (sadly and unsurprisingly, professors in the business and medical schools sank the union vote) and, as I've moved up the ranks within my university, I've worked to create pathways for non-tenure track faculty that include security and opportunities for promotion.\n\nPerhaps a bit more controversially, I've been a pretty stalwart advocate against increasing the expectations for our non-tenure track positions. Some in said positions feel as if this means they are somehow viewed as 'less than' their colleagues; rather, I support the distinction because I do not feel it fair to increase the amount of labor placed upon them without a requisite increase in protections, stature, and compensation. In other words, it's a pretty transparent attempt by higher administration to weaken the protections of tenure; I want everyone paid for and protected in everything they do.",

This is not very complicated - they just need to be able to explain what they do in a different way. \n\nAlso, in our current system, adjuncting is not a full-time job, and should not be expected to lead to one. I don't think this will change, so we'll need to be open about it. If someone wishes to try full time adjuncting, they are free to, but it should be mainly a side gig, especially for those who need it for their cv (post docs and stuff).",

      "text": "As a doctoral student, I've tried to convince other students in my research group that unpaid labour does *not* improve their CVs enough to warrant  more than a  bare minimum  number of hours, and  I've said as much in group-wide meetings.  The retiring head of our group was a big fan of the idea of \"contributing to the field\" with unpaid labour, without drawing a distinction between  more useful types of volunteering, like helping run a conference, and less useful kinds like running workshops  for Masters' students  (which is teaching and should be compensated) or running social media platforms for the group (very time-consuming,  limited upside). Meanwhile, our Faculty has  cut the number of admin positions in half, claiming that doctoral students can pick up the slack (for free), which none of us have time to do even if they *did* pay us for it.  The culture here is ridiculous, and many of my peers buy into it, to  their detriment  imo.",
