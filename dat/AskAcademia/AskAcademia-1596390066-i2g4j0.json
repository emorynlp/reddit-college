  "title:": "How do I tell my supervisor I want to do a PhD somewhere else?",
  "text": "I'm a year into my 2-year Master's. I like my field a lot but I want to move to do a PhD somewhere more central where I could get more experience. I consulted a former postdoc about leaving the lab and they said they had a really hard time leaving, with my advisor trying to manipulate them into staying for another year + until the very last moment, even sabotaging their search for a faculty position. Another former master's student told me that my advisor tried to delay their defense and get them to do more work even after their thesis was already written.\n\nThey both told me that the best approach is to frame me leaving as beneficial for my advisor. So...\n\nHow can I present me leaving the lab as a good thing for my advisor, and still get their support and do good work while I'm there?\n\nSo far I have:\n\n* I'd like to continue working with the lab, even collaborating from a distance (which is true but not something I can promise since I don't know where I'll end up and my advisor is already well-connected)\n* Leaving the lab to a more renowned university will improve the lab's track record (which also doesn't hold that well since my lab's alumni have a pretty good track record)",

      "text": "I broke the news to my advisor last week. They took it very personally. Even though I have not yet graduated, I have been cut from all meetings and I'm not allowed in the lab. In fact, I have zero interaction. If he could fire me, it would look exactly like this. I am also not gonna be able to secure a reference letter from him for PhD applications.\n\nSo, my advice, be very careful and don't give him any excuse. Break the news to him very carefully. Ultimately, it's your life and you should make the decisions.",

You could consider framing your move as an attempt to maintain the possibility you can regularly collaborate following completion of your PhD elsewhere. In other words, staying at your current institution with the same advisor may mean you cannot work with them (at least not regularly) if they advise/mentor you. Of course, this may not be the culture for your field/discipline, so this angle may not be viable. But if so, it might flatter your advisor while also sounding reasonable enough to obtain their full support. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in a difficult situation. Advisors ought to prioritize their student\u2019s best interest rather than their own career. In my opinion, supporting talented people is part of your reputation. People usually know what researchers neglect or otherwise mistreat students, so if you have to burn a bridge, people will probably understand.",

I think my advisor understood that for a PhD, it is crucial that you select a topic that you are completely sure you want to work in.",

Every single time I see something about stress for grad students it seems the onus is put squarely on the student to do anything and everything to minimize conflict to survive, or to just find another program.
