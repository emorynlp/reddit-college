  "text": "Hi guys, I'm a product designer in the US researching the preference of reading ebooks vs print books to explore a potential market I'd like to build an app in. \n\nThe survey should only take 5 min. It's mostly multiple-choice, few required questions, and no identifiable information unless you choose to share your contact info. \n\nBest of luck! And thank you!\n\n**Survey :** [**https://forms.gle/wvms8XAu7M1TfYsz9**](https://forms.gle/wvms8XAu7M1TfYsz9)\n\n\\---\n\nFor those who don't want to take the survey, you can optionally answer the question below; \n\n**Do you prefer printed books over ebooks? If so, why? And what could make ebooks better?**",
