  "title:": "Would you continue in academia with extreme mental illness? Would you care if a cohort was mentally ill?",
  "text": "In a few days, I\u2019m going into in-patient treatments for schizo-affective/schizophrenia. Right now, we\u2019re still in the process of ruling out other reasons for my psychotic symptoms but it\u2019s definitely within the psychotic disorder category. For a long time I wanted it to be psychotic depression or psychotic symptoms of something else. But my mood and outlook have improved dramatically since I\u2019ve started therapy. And that therapy is already quite intensive with different sessions 2-4 days a week. Yet my psychotic symptoms are increasing. And idk. \n\nI\u2019ve published a book, a few articles, helped jumpstart a lit magazine, worked on pedagogy and education research projects, and now I\u2019m in the first year of a PhD program.\n\nAnd it\u2019s been one semester and I have to take a leave to get in-patient treatment. I may not even complete the semester because I didn\u2019t submit any of my finals. They aren\u2019t even readable (*Edit just for clarification: I have this paranoia that they aren\u2019t my essays b/c I\u2019m not the person I say I am. And that I\u2019m about to be caught lying. But I\u2019m not even gonna get into that. I\u2019m paranoid but I can acknowledge that it\u2019s ridiculous. But it\u2019s getting harder to not instinctively hide, delete materials, withdraw submissions, run away for days.*) But believe it or not, this is the clearest I\u2019ve felt in months so I can *finally* attempt to start fixing my finals material but with in-patient starting in 2 days I\u2019m not sure.\n\nAnyway, I am going to be there for a while and while I\u2019m there\u2026I have to really consider if I want to continue in academia. I really want too. I don\u2019t want this illness to take away the one thing I\u2019ve always wanted. And giving up would meet just letting that mental illness win. But at the same time, I wonder if it\u2019s fair that cohorts and departments could have potential problems with me? Is it fair that I have students? \n\nI\u2019ve never ever been violent or anything but I\u2019m prone to just disappearing and suddenly talking very slowly and not making sense. Usually there\u2019s exacerbated breathing in between and looking in different directions, but I\u2019m not scary or anything. There\u2019s a lot more going on but I just wanted to point out the external effects. And say that I\u2019m not dangerous or even weird, you would just think I\u2019m rude or not very bright. But I\u2019ve never been medicated and maybe that will fix it. I want to clarify that I\u2019m not an immediate threat.\n\nI\u2019m posting to ask what other academics would think about mentally I\u2019ll scholars? Would you work with them? If you are mentally ill? How do you navigate? If you don\u2019t mind me asking, what should I think about while in therapy?",

You can take a leave of absence for mental health and decide how to proceed later. Your advisor and/or the faculty will understand.\n\nFinally, there are so many people with varying levels of mental health issues in every profession. It's very common, and academia is not the exception to this. I know a number of people that were in my PhD program that dealt with mental health issues. Some took time off and returned, some got help while in the program. My guess is that nobody will know unless you tell them.\n\nGood luck with your treatment program, and I'm sending good vibes your way.",

          "text": "Echoing this. Many of my coworkers with used to have a colleague with schizophrenia. I didn't know her and they are not at the same institution anymore, but they speak highly of her. So maybe don't rule it out yet. \n\nI think that this\\^ commenter is right about taking time to prioritize getting healthy right now, though. If you haven't done meds before, then there is actually a very good chance that they may help! especially if you're prioritizing psychotherapy alongside meds. so that is promising. \n\nFor what it's worth, I have bipolar 1 with psychotic features. I am very lucky that I haven't had issues since my first (and so far, only) psychotic break, but it still freaks me out to think about what would happen if I ever got sick again. My coworkers have no idea, and I don't really plan on telling them. \n\nAnyways, it's hard to know what will happen. But tbh, it seems like you have a lot of self-awareness about your symptoms, are working closely w your treatment team, and still have a lot of options with meds to try, so all of those factors are working in your favor in terms of possible prognosis. Hoping that you're able to stay strong through this. Psychosis can be absolutely terrifying and awful, but it sounds like you're doing all of the right things to take care of yourself <3",

On telling your program, I get this is very scary for you and I can't promise they won't be prize shits and handle this badly because God knows academia can be crap sometimes. However, the best way to get a good response is to take ownership of the problem, explain things as early as you can, be clear about what you want and also what your limitations are etc. This not only will give them confidence in you but it will also give you more time to deal with any issues in their response. Leaving stuff very late makes it harder for everyone.\n\nSecondly, you may need to be more selective about universities in future as you move through your career. There are good people out there and they will welcome you and you can flourish there. Find that place. It's not fair but not everywhere is going to work for you but don't let anyone ever convince you you deserve bad treatment, that you've done something wrong by being ill or that you don't deserve to be in academia because you have mental illness. \n\nI hope your recovery goes well and good luck with everything.",

Is it fair that I have students?\n\nRegarding this question specifically: it's totally fair, because cohorts/departments/students could (and do) have problems with literally most people that join them. Academia is chock full of people with mental disorders (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) and people that are just plain tough to get along with. This is just part of working with other humans, so it is absolutely fair for you and your potential challenges to be in that mix. You are just as worthy as them, no matter what name (plus social prejudices) is attached to your disorder.\n\nIn fact, you're at an advantage here because you will have a label for your issues, so there will be scientific studies regarding how to cope with it, and you'll also have plenty of tools for navigating the world with your condition. Many people with similar challenges won't have those, and that puts them at a disadvantage in social contexts.",

      "text": "This is not advice, but only my own experience as an answer to your title question. \n\nI began my Master's as an older student, fully intending on going PhD to faculty, much like many others. But even though I succeeded/excelled in my program, it was all in spite of several issues which made my experience *extremely* challenging. \n\nAfter failing a round of PhD applications, returning home to no job besides the toxic bakery I had worked at prior to school, a raging case of carpal tunnel syndrome which I ended up in surgery for, a lot of family issues and illness, a horrific falling out with my best friend of 22 years, and a rapidly deteriorating state of controlled depression, I suffered a \"break\", resulting in my checking in to an inpatient facility and being diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder.\n\nIn that moment my life completely changed, and it has all been for the better. After leaving the hospital, I spent several months in daily out-patient therapy until an opportunity came for work that I was finally ready for--returning to my school to work for the library. Not as an academic, but as an archivist. I've now transitioned into another role at my university, thanks to following the best path forward not for a job or some grand goal of tenure, but for my mental well being and ultimate happiness. \n\nI've given up the dream of a PhD. They're letters behind a name that I would love to have, but what I have is more than enough. I've found work *beside* academia in a support role--not doing the work but invested and engaged. I've never been happier. \n\nMaking these decisions were NOT easy and resulted in a lot of pain along the way. I wrestled a lot with my choice not to pursue a doctorate, and got a lot of unexpected pushback. And though I know I would have finished my degree with as much success possible had I entered into a PhD program, I also know that my mental health would have been irreparably harmed. I could probably have a much better go of it now, with my years of therapy and mood stabilizers, but the fact is that I don't want to. The pain, frustration, and hard work it takes to succeed in academia just isn't worth it for me. But again, that's my opinion from my experience. Happy to talk more.",

For me, it feels a little like saying... \"It would be an honor to have coworker share their diverse perspectives as a sexual assault victim\" ? or some other trauma? \n\nFor paul lodge from the philosophy article, it sounds like his manic and hypomanic experiences were maybe mixed with some positive parts. For some of us, though, psychosis is hell. For me, paranoia is like being trapped in a permanent state of panic attack for days/weeks at a time. I am suspicious of all my fam and closest friends who are trying to support me. I genuinely believe ppl are putting thoughts into my head or changing my thoughts around or spying on my every move, even when I'm at home by myself. I can't relax, I can't make the fear go away, I can't stop feeling like a trapped animal.  The first time I was catatonic, i lost \\~4lbs per week from not moving and not eating. my best friend had to be like... these are scrambled eggs. Can you eat them? nod yes or no? pls? cognitive processing was alllll gone. And I can only imagine how much worse it is for ppl who have command hallucinations where voices are constantlyyyy telling them to hurt themselves. It seems like many bipolar patients do get that postive/shiny \"the world is different now!\" thing, but esp for folks w a SZ diagnosis, I think it tends to be more common to have just the shitty dark terrifying stuff without the euphoric mood. \n\nAnyways. I really hope that things will be better for OP than they were for me during my first psychotic episode. I guess all I mean to say is that... if it was me, I would just want me coworkers to think like \"jesus christ, those experiences sound horrible and i wish she never had to experience anything like that.\" and not like \"we are glad to have your diverse experiences\" \\[that happened as a result of a brutal and traumatizing illness\\]. Like I said though, I know that this is coming from a very good place (!!!!) and that some ppl with psychotic disorders have very, very different experiences from me (and would probably feel super supported by this comment tbh)",

I got an academic permanent position so I'd say that I'm one of lucky few.\n\n Every discipline is different but the institution are roughly the same in terms of attitudes. The pressure of the job, the lack of resources to do it, have taken a toll on me. Many of my friend and colleagues have (are) going through very bad mental illness because the job. The reality is the academia is not prepared for dealing with mental health. Is a taboo that nobody wants to talk about, and when is the time of evaluating  you in terms of performance institution generally don't care (they say that they do...). \n \nIn any way I ain't trying to disencourage you on doing a PhD but be aware that you might be alone dealing with it. I'd say, you should try of getting all the tools that are going to  help you with any condition that you need to deal with. Also, try to surround yourself with people and groups that help you and make the best of you. Don't expect that institution do it.",

      "text": "Based on my personal anecdotal experience, there are quite a few in academia living with severe mental illness (schizophrenia, bipolar, severe depression with psychosis, personality disorders, etc.), myself included. But being open about it because the acceptance of it drastically varies from university to university, department to department, and cohort to cohort. Severe mental illness also tends to face more lateral violence, even inter-communally, when we talk about sanism and ableism. \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t stay in academia after you finish treatment and reach a place of stability. There\u2019re many support groups forming online for academics with mental illnesses, and that includes more unique spaces for academics with psychotic illnesses. Honestly, we will face challenges (personal, professional, and health-related) no matter what profession we are in, and the way I see it, continuing to work in a field that brings us joy and builds resilience is vital to our long term survival and stability! In the meantime, I\u2019d truly focus on your recovery and needs for recovery in the moment, and think about your long term goals and if academia fits into those needs once you\u2019re in a place of stability. If you want to be in that space, then start thinking about how you would need to adjust your life in academia so you can make it fit your needs. It doesn\u2019t need to be a \u201cno,\u201d but it might need to be a \u201cI will need to make some adjustments to the way I live my life to make this work.\u201d More explicit bedtime hours, less conference travel, work that doesn\u2019t change on the daily as much any more, who knows. I wish you the best and I hope you have a healthy recovery.",

My program has someone who has a mental disorder and is incredibly disruptive -- incredibly rude and offensive comments, inappropriate behavior that made other students uncomfortable and probably would be considered sexual harassment otherwise, etc. That level is not fair to students, colleagues, etc no matter the cause. \n\nBut, I will say, we also have a ton of people who have or had serious mental health problems (depression, anxiety, ADHD, bipolar, ASD, etc) who are getting help, managing it well, and are absolutely phenomenal colleagues. You're doing the right thing by getting help and taking time off to figure it out and it's absolutely possible to continue once your health is in a better spot. Put your health first and then career will work out.",

Nobody else has the right to make it for you.  And if you don't present any kind of danger to anyone, they have no right to judge your life either. \n\nValue the fact that you have a perspective on life that nobody else does.  And use that perspective to generate compassion for others, and especially yourself.   If you're really concerned about others, reducing yourself or walking away from your talents doesn't help the world at all.",

I\u2019m glad you are.\n\nEdited to add: I am medicated, which I didn\u2019t really want beforehand and am now so very grateful I tried. I have two close friends who are utterly trustworthy (as I am for them), and also seriously fun. And I dip in and out of therapy as needed. Not always with the best timing, but with no discernible effect on how others see my job performance, just how I do.\n\nAnd therapy is utterly, totally personal, so it\u2019s hard to give advice. Before you leave, make a post-break plan. (That\u2019s pretty much a requirement, anyway.) I do best when I spend a lot of time thinking about peace, rather than success or what other people think.

I had to go to intensive outpatient treatment and do bunch of other things. Once I got treatment, I completed my dissertation in a couple of years after coasting for a few years. I attend AA meetings regularly and there are several professors in my AA groups. I was completely open ONLY with my immediate PhD mentor and those people I worked closely with. However,  they were very supportive and extremely happy I was getting treatment. I know professors at Ivy league schools with bipolar disorder. I think you will be fine with treatment.

You deserve time to take care of your health, and it's okay to need that time away.\n\n\nWhether you continue is a personal choice, as far as what you feel is right for you and what you consider your limitations to be once you are undergoing treatment. Speaking personally, my mental disorders certainly place limits on what I can do or how I navigate academic spaces, but I also know I'm capable of producing excellent work when those symptoms are managed. It may be like that, where you unfortunately have to work around your own brain, but develop more tools to do that with your diagnosis.\n\n\n\nAs far as other academics, I think it's like any career; you have people who are understanding, and you have people who perpetuate the stigma around mental disorders. As a grad student, I have zero problems as long as the person communicates that there's an ongoing medical thing that could impact their functioning, just so as far as disclosing, I'm of two minds. There are some things I would never disclose just because I don't think it's worth the potential stigma for me. On the other hand, what I have disclosed has been met with a lot of empathy by my mentors and colleagues. I have met folks who aren't great at accommodating neurodivergence or who exhibit some casual (and my guess is unintentional) ableism, but sadly I believe that will be a problem for as long as we live in societies that won't prioritize mental health awareness.",
