  "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nMy partner will be starting a PhD program in DC this August and I wanted to put together a care package for things he would find useful for his first semester. So far I have a \"Lego Grad Student\" calendar, a bunch of gift cards for restaurants within walking distance to campus, a Spotify premium subscription and new headphones for commuting on the train, and a bunch of snacks and a new water bottle with the school logo. Any other ideas of things or tools you used a lot? \n\n\nThanks!",

These are oldies but goodies. They are relatively cheap and you can sometimes catch a deal in best buy.\n\nFor display I would recommend dell matt finished 4k display.\n\nIt also depends on what do your partner do, if your partner spends all day in the lab studying samples, then I guess you can forgo all of the above.\n\nSome other things I really enjoy is a very large desk, and small on-desk bookshelf, they make books-organizing really easy.\n\nAlso, high quality coffee and tea are always welcome.",

For me, my notes (both handwritten and typed) have historically been scattered all over on printouts, pdf, notebooks, etc. Having an iPad and apps to house those notes really streamlines the entire process. If I have my iPad, I know where I'll be able to find anything. All my literature notes are directly in the new Zotero beta app on iOS, and all my class/misc notes are in my OneNote. The new apple pencil is phenomenal, I don't miss writing on paper hardly at all. Also, I'm a lefty and now don't have smudges all over my papers and hands during writing. It's just really easy and it all syncs perfectly.\n2. I usually do a pretty good job with keeping my distraction level pretty low, but for me starting to read a new paper isn't always the most fun thing and having my iPad I have many fewer distractions since it's basically just for work. I can find a quiet place with a comfy chair, put on my headphones, and really get some good reading done with minimal distractions like email/Reddit/etc.\n\nIt's definitely not necessary, but for me personally it was a game changer. It finally feels like there are actually good ways to take both handwritten and typed electronic notes that I can actually use at a later date.",

I saw a phd coloring book online that may be good for evening stress relief.  I think self-care is crucial and it\u2019s important that you encourage that, even when they are too stressed.  A yoga class near campus or other type of exercise class - I recommend a punch card class over a scheduled block, the flexibility is really helpful to be able to switch it up.  The social of a workout group is good for the soul.  I also enjoy my monthly therapeutic massages.  There are also stores here in Buffalo that sell take-home healthy meals that win a lot of points for convenience and health, I\u2019m cheap and do protein shakes instead.  As others said, I live on my iPad.  I also recommend the books: how to take smart notes (it\u2019s about how to take notes on thoughts in a way that lets you build on them over time and have a conversation with your past self.  Destination Disserta was a nice one that augmented dissertation planning and understanding what a dissertation really is.  How to write a lot is a short, snarky fun book with tips to be a better writer.  All three of these were easy reading, enjoyable and helpful.  I have others that are great pro development too, but these are good for any field.  I\u2019ve been using origami paper to make corner page marker bookmarks for the chapters I often refer too.  I also use my iPad with stylus for all my journal article reading.  \n\nOther little things I enjoy are my essential oil diffuser to help scents support the mood I want, and bookends to hold my books where I stick them.",

Literally three novels a week, every week for fifteen weeks, and then during breaks, I could \"relax\" and only read/notate two a week. One of the things that saved my bacon was having a subscription to get audio books so that I could listen to books while commuting or doing other things like taking showers or folding laundry, even just lying quietly in a room with my eyes closed trying to rest. \n\nAlso, upgraded parking would have been amazing. My biggest stresses was finding a spot to park at the parking garage that was only two blocks from my office, versus the other parking garages that were anywhere from half a mile to a mile from my office. The fear of lugging books for a mile twice a day forced me to get up super early and spend most of the day on campus to ensure I could find a spot in the close-ish parking garage. However, there was \"reserved\" parking that would have given me a dedicated parking spot literally outside my building -- to the tune of $750 a year (opposed to the $149 a year I was already paying for the gamble of finding a spot in student parking). If I had to do it again, I would have lived in a cheaper rental and gotten this reserved parking instead of dealing with that stupid added stress that decreased my quality of life and literally tripled the amount of time I spent on campus paying for crappy campus food (because again, life management skills and doing things like grocery shopping or packing a lunch fell to the wayside).",

I had never lived more than 2 hours away from home for more than 3 months. The idea of moving across the country for an indeterminate amount of time was terrifying but exciting. Knowing when I would see my mom next helped a lot. It is just me, my sister and her so I really really appreciated that.
