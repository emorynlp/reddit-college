So in that sense you can't \"bomb it\"--they're trying to convince you to come, not make you convince them to admit you. \n\nBut it is important in the context of setting yourself up for success as a doctoral student. This is your moment to take what you said in your application about the fields and research subjects you intend to study and turn it into something real in terms of the people you will or want to be working with. It's important to know how to read the departmental information to identify who the people are who work on what you want to work on. That's a key survival skill. If that isn't just one or two people but quite a few, then that list they're asking you for becomes more important still--you can use these meetings to get a feel for your potential supervisor or supervisors. There are some things to consider that you might be able to tell: who seems the most dynamic or active in your area of study, in terms of publications or active research programs? who is maybe on the edge of retirement (avoid, simply because they might retire part way through your doctoral program)? who is brand-new or untenured (don't necessarily avoid, but keep in mind that that person has less influence and may of course also not get tenure)? who is maybe so famous or popular that they might not be able to spend as much time with doctoral students? \n\nBut what you can't tell just by reading up on people is what they're like as people--are they nice? are they interesting to talk to? do they have interesting ideas about the things you want to research? do they read drafts of work by students? do they seem to know how things work behind the scenes or have institutional influence? If you go to recruitment day, try to find some time to talk to other grad students who work with the possible advisors you would be working with and see what they think. (Or even better, talk to some grad students who don't work with your possible advisors--they may have less invested and be able to tell you what the real deal is.)",

This thread is very insightful and quite interesting to read.\n\nThe system here (at least the countries I have worked at) follows an entirely different \"protocol\".\n\nHere, the PI announces an open PhD position in his/her lab (just like an open position in a company), often with a specific project in mind. Applicants then apply to that specific position and the PI interviews prospective candidates that he/she finds could be a good fit. When the PI has decided on a single applicant he/she wants to employ, he/she writes up a summary for his decision and present it to the faculty board that can either accept the PI's decision (and the applicant will get offered the position) or decline the applicant and tell the PI to propose a different applicant.",

Like they say, pick 3 faculty who match your close research interests or seem like they will be good mentors, and enjoy the experience.",
