      "text": "To add to what /u/OKswimmer2684 has said, many journals have stated policies on how affiliations should be handled. For example, this is from the Nature group:\n\n>\"The primary affiliation for each author should be the institution where the majority of their work was done. If an author has subsequently moved, the current address may also be stated.\"\n\nI think in general, this is good practice -- listing where the work was done, and also a current address. But if you're unsure, check the journals website and if you can't find a policy, check with the editor.",

My former institution is where I was a PhD student, and I had funding, so I guess yes I should add a note, if requested. I have checked the journal guidelines, but they have nothing on this topic. I will ask the editor. Thanks for your wisdom.x",
