      "text": "I would suggest looking into what research centered clubs your college might have. You might be able to find a \u201cjournal club\u201d that reads and discusses research papers. Or you might be able to find a club that has outside speakers come in to talk about their research. It\u2019s much better to get used to the format of research papers in a group. It\u2019s also better to articulate what you\u2019re learning to someone who knows what they\u2019re doing to make sure you\u2019re on the right track. If your college doesn\u2019t have either of these clubs, it might be pretty easy to start one with the right faculty member.",
