  "title:": "How long is too long for a journal review?",
  "text": "I submitted a manuscript to a moderately prestigious journal in my field (public health/social behavioral sciences) on Sept 1. It's now Oct 5, and the status still says \"reviewer assignment pending.\" This is my first ever submission to this journal. I've published in other places and never had reviewer assignment take so long-- usually a couple weeks, max. Is this normal? Or a COVID phenomenon?  I guess what I'd really like to know is at what point I should consider pulling the manuscript and submitting elsewhere?",

      "text": "In my field (also social science), one month for reviewer assignment is very common. Especially during COVID. I would hold out. \n\nAs a personal anecdote, I recently got a rejection after my paper had been with a journal for five months. The reviews I got back were barely a paragraph, and did not substantively engage with my research. All the editor said was basically \"sorry but this took longer than we would have liked because COVID and it was hard to find reviewers\". It sucks, but, unfortunately, a lot of journals are operating incredibly slowly right now and can't find decent reviewers in a timely manner.",

But my wife is a historian and one of her papers was rejected after 1 year. And many journals do not bother to answer at all. That is very strange to me.",

I have invited 20 to 40 only to get one taker on multiple occasions recently.  Covid has sucked in people from even what would be normally quite remote fields and so there is a knock on effect across the board.  \n\nMy normal expectation (when I submit) is that I should have heard something by around three months.  After that time I will try to find out what is going on.",
