  "title:": "I flunked someone for plagiarism. I just discovered they hired a PI to investigate me.",
  "text": "Does anyone have experience with this? I\u2019m in a tenure track position in the social sciences at a school in the Midwest. Last semester, I flunked a student for plagiarizing part of a paper (it was a clear case of copy and paste from an obscure source). The student did not take it well. Things are winding their way through the administrative process. \n\n\nIt has come to my attention that this disgruntled student has apparently hired a private investigator to follow me and look into my life. I feel extremely violated. However, it has unfortunately also come to my attention that this PI has learned that I am in an open relationship. I suspect this would not be well received by my department and would likely jeopardize my ability to get tenure. \n\n\nIt has been strongly implied that details of my personal relationship will be leaked to the department unless I stop pursuing internal discipline against the student. However, it\u2019s not clear to me that I could stop the proceedings even if I wanted to. What exactly am I supposed to do in this situation?",

Actually they have proven that they're very vengeful and they're ready to cheat and break the law, so it's quite possible they would tell the department about your relationship even if you decided to bow to their demands. Anyway it would probably look suspicious to your department if you suddenly decided to change your mind about the student after you provided evidence of their plagiarism.\n\nNow what can the student do? If the student goes to the department with the evidence they got from the PI, they'll look exactly like what they are, a cheater who tried to blackmail a professor for doing something that's not against the law. If I were in your department, I'd be pretty disgusted at someone who would invade a professor's privacy like that.  Defending the student would mean admitting that blackmailing staff is ok. This is not the image the University wants to have. You, on the other hand, did your job like you were supposed to.\n\nNow, one way or another, you're in an unfortunate situation where it's likely that your department will learn about your relationship. You need to mitigate damage. I don't know your department, and it's easy for me to talk as I'm not the one to suffer the consequences, but it seems that the best way to do this would not be to fall to blackmail. If you trust your colleagues to have a bit of decency, you'll have a better outcome telling the student to f... off and coming clear if you need to.",

I'll assume that you have NOT dated any students or other university employees, and thus your private life is separate from your work life.\n\n1) The plagiarism disciplinary case. Assuming you've already submitted the evidence, this must continue. To withdraw it now would raise the biggest red flags of all for your department. Talk to a trusted senior mentor about whether to let the academic conduct board know about the blackmail attempt.\n\n2) Legal action. Definitely consult an attorney to see if QUIET legal action can be taken, like a cease and desist. But bringing charges will only attract unwanted attention, like press attention, that will force your department to confront the issue, even if they don't want to.\n\n3) Whether your personal life becomes an item of interest to your colleagues or the administration. The best way to keep it under the radar is to treat this like a minor thing - a \"can you believe this student?\" tidbit at best. Voluntary disclosure should only happen if the story is about to come out in a public way anyways, like a press story - otherwise it's best to treat it as not part of your professional life and this not relevant to your work colleagues.\n\nBut DO check with a trusted colleague about how the school may have handled professors with unusual personal lives in the past. Do not go into detail about your own situation. That should give you some guidance on how to talk about this, if at all.",

One would hope that the School wouldn\u2019t want to be featured in a New York Times article about the pressures professors face from aggressive attempts to get away with cheating by hiring PIs...and the schools that let them get away with such behavior by not punishing the student for extortion (which is what this is). \n\nI get that this is a difficult call, however, and if I saw any way to get out from under this, I\u2019d probably take it.

Profiles that haven't been logged into in years and even profiles that have been disabled by the user (looking at you, match.com) show up as active, some apps with access to your GPS location will automatically update your location in the app even if you don't log in, etc. Distressed SOs showing up worried that their SO is cheating on dating apps only to find out that it's the apps pulling shenanigans is a meme on dating reddits.",

I understand that you believe you won't find another job if you don't get tenure, but think about it this way. If this student is successful in getting what they want from you by blackmailing you, other students may realize that you can be blackmailed just by telling you they will snitch to your dean that you are in an open relationship. And frankly, there's no way to stop this particular student from telling your dean regardless of your actions. They may still decide to retaliate against you. You're giving all the power to this kid.\n\nYou keep saying that you're at a catholic school, but from what I understand, some schools are more liberal than others. If it was ultraconservative, I'd guess that you being in a (nonmarital) relationship alone would be an issue. Which it is apparently not, which makes me think that maybe it's not such a big deal. Are you 100 % certain that your school forbids open relationships? If the school does explicitly forbid it, pretend that it was never a secret and go public with everything. You report that student to the police for blackmailing, send an open email to the whole school, post about it on twitter (@academicchatter and maybe other channels relevant to social sciences and PM me on reddit, I'm willing to retweet). Start an effing twitter storm if you have to.\n\nSo let me rephrase this: It is absolutely unacceptable that a school would accept their professors to be abused in this way! This student should be expelled immediately. You did nothing be ashamed of!",

A lawyer can also help you to determine what, if anything, to share with your department about the PI and their threats.\n\nI'm so sorry that you're experiencing this. You clearly did the right thing, and this student's actions are entitled and seek to get out of the consequence they deserve for their action.

Here, [I googled it for you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_commit_adultery#Catholic_Church).\n\nSecondly, it's nice that you're so #woke, but most of the world isn't. People who belong to the religious establishment of a church that is so behind the times that they prohibit birth control in particular are unlikely to be woke. I'm glad you are privileged enough to not live a life where you are confronted with this reality every day but - please, for the sake of everyone who isn't clueless, educate yourself.",

In my opinion, your uni should take stand against blackmail and protect their staff. If the student cheated via plagiarism then thats that and all subsequent actions are not relevant to the staff anymore - doesn't matter what the PI found. If I was HoD and someone sent me a PI file on one of my staff, I would chuck it in the bin. If it isnt academically or criminally related, its not my business to begin with.\n\nI realize this post is a bit old now. I hope this worked out for you.

OF COURSE OP is worthy of their current position. They\u2019re concerned about what this bully may be able to do to them \u2014 and they should be. It\u2019s a valid concern, and saying otherwise is possibly the most arrogant thing I\u2019ve read here. \n\nAs for the rest of your statement suggesting that if this is really a deal-breaker for the tenure committee, it\u2019s time to move on, I couldn\u2019t agree more. OP doesn\u2019t need the hassle of trying to keep such people happy for an entire career.",

We serve two primary functions: reporting findings and teaching students.\n\nIn both cases, if we are shown to be dishonest, none of our work holds any value any longer.  Every result becomes unreliable and every student we certify and graduate would have to be regarded with suspicion.  Did they learn, or did they succeed at blackmail?\n\nSo no, a compromised academic must be an academic no longer.",

Fortunately, u/pngwen doesn\u2019t likely sit on your tenure committee. You can safely disregard their opinion and slander of your worthiness to teach.",
