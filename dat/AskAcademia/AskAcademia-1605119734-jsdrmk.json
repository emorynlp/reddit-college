  "title:": "How common/effective is it to play different PhD offers off of one another?",
  "text": "I'm an MA student currently in the process of applying to PhD programs (philosophy, Canada). One of the PhD students in my program told me that he applied to several different programs--around seven or eight of them--got acceptance offers from most of them, and then proceeded to play the rival funding offers off of one another in order to get more money from the school he eventually chose to go with.\n\nIs this something which is commonly done, and if so, how does one go about it? If, for example, I were to be accepted to the University of Toronto, McGill, and Queen's, and wanted to go to the University of Toronto, would I literally just e-mail them notifying them of my rival offers and ask them if they're willing to offer more money to entice me to accept theirs?",

      "text": "I've been a Director of Graduate Studies for a humanities department for a number of years. \n\nTwo points (which might seem contradictory, but aren't if you pay attention to the nuance):\n\nFirst, what you describe is NOT common.  At all.  When PhD candidates are accepted into our program, they get a nice letter for me, with a description of the offer, and then make their decision from there.   (Note:  we sometimes offer two different \"levels\" of packages, one for most incoming PhDs, and then a better one for those really stellar applicants who are competitive for University-wide fellowships, which would allows us to access scholarship money from outside the department for these stellar students, so we can offer them more than normal.   But this is all decided beforehand.)    \n\nUsually, then, I'll write to applicants to try to get a sense of how interested they are in attending (i.e. are they definitely heading to another program, are they thinking seriously about coming to us?) because I have to shape the incoming class, and it's helpful to know as soon as possible that someone's NOT coming, so I can send out offers.  (I'm not fishing for negotiation here...!  Just trying to get information.)   \n\nSecondly (and here's where the nuance comes in):  some programs and/or DGS's *do* have a little bit of discretion on what can be offered.  (note, it's not huge.)  So, if there is an applicant that we would *really really really* would love to come to our program  (for any sort of reason, such as an exciting project, a really strong application, a great fit with an enthusiastic advisor, to balance out fields, whatever), and in my contact I get a sense that that applicant is being unduly swayed by a \"better\" offer from a program where I don't actually think is a better fit for them, I have several times offered a small addition to the usual package.  (note, we are NOT talking huge amounts here....) \n\nHowever, if I thought for a second that a grad student was actually trying to \"play\" me against another school or vice versa, then that is a HUGE RED FLAG (no one wants to deal with an entitled entrepreneur-wannabe for 6 years), and I would likely send them to the bottom of my mental \"we want them here list\" (but would never revoke an offer, of course;  i'd just stop trying/caring with them.) \n\nIn short, the main reason why there are different funding packages in our PhD program is actually because, for the STELLAR applications, we can access funds from outside the department.   But this was not \"negotiated.\"  And there have been a few (3 or so) cases where I've decided to add to an offer, mostly to keep a great applicant from shooting themselves in the foot by going to the wrong program for them just because the other offered an extra two thousand a year.",

I can tell you that funding packages are strapped and fairly standardized across the School of Graduate Studies, especially for programs that don\u2019t involve labs or research teams.

The second offered me maybe 60% what the first one did. I was very annoyed at this, but didn't show it other than a frown or two. Nevertheless, I kept the interviews professional and didn't complain nor let slip my other offer.\n\nThere was a grad student after-party for the new applicants that night at this second school. I went and had a few beers with the grads, one of them who was working in the advisor's lab that was recruiting me. We made some small talk, got along, and after another beer or two I let slip I had another offer and my frustration with the school's stipend. I didn't ask him to tell the advisor I had another offer, but because of the alcohol I let him know I was frustrated with the pay. Sure enough, and without my consent or planning, he told his advisor.\n\nA few weeks after that, I received an email with a moderately higher stipend, one I could actually seriously consider. Apparently the advisor at this second school was really into me, and wanted me at all costs. I told my advisor I was currently with what had happened. He looked incredulous, and said I had done something very risky, and that the school was just as likely to turn me down. I got very stupidly lucky, basically.\n\nIf you are really considering this, I suggest:\n\n\\-Make sure you a strong applicant and your advisor recruiting you is pretty into you.\n\n\\-Make sure you are A-OK with this play backfiring in your face and you getting no offer at all. Is your backup acceptable?\n\n\\-Do not tell the advisor or any professor there point-blank, to their face or in an email that you want a higher stipend. It may be seen as disrespectful. It shouldn't, but this is academia and students are treated more like serfs than employees.\n\n\\-Find a way to hint you have another offer on the table you are considering, without being so blunt and direct about it. The best way may be to nicely mention to another grad in the lab you trust about your situation over lunch or somewhere away from their advisor, but don't aggressively demand anything.",

      "text": "This is uncommon, but not unheard of, in philosophy. I personally know a small handful of philosophers who have done this successfully. In each case, they paid a social price -- bad vibes from the programs whose offers they leveraged for more money. No one likes to feel used. Was it worth it? For the truly badass golden wunderkind students, probably yes -- they'll have plenty of opportunities down the line even if a few Directors of Graduate Studies think poorly of them. For anyone else? Probably not.\n\nThe anecdata I'm familiar with suggest that negotiation is most likely to succeed for programs at wealthy private schools in the USA with university-wide fellowships that pay beyond the usual graduate student stipend. A DGS who really wants you can nominate you for one of these and in this way secure additional stipend money and \"match\" a competing offer. But if the DGS does all this and you end up going somewhere else, you may be closing a door forever.",

I've seen it work out for quite a few people but it all comes down to to what extent the graduate/admissions director has extra funding they can allocate for this purpose.",

You can always find external sources of funding later on.\n\nAlso, if you try this with my PI at UofT, he will tell you to suck his balls. We have way too much supply for PhD students to be able to dictate their pay.\n\nAgain, this is engineering. Not sure if other domains can pull this off.",

I seriously doubt you will get much from negotiating.

He didn\u2019t talk about other schools paying more or anything like that, he just acted like he was on the fence in the years leading up to his application.\n\nEnded up with an extra $10k p.a. and all travel costs covered at his preferred uni. This *only* works for superstar students though. He got those perks because the university wanted him that badly. Very few people can pull it off.\n\nI have also *kinda* done it but only by accident. If you ever tell a program, after receiving an offer from them, that you are still deciding or still considering your options, then you have done it too. \u201cStill considering my options\u201d means \u201cfunding and other perks are important in my decision making\u201d, which they should be because you\u2019re a sane human being. But they know that their offer isn\u2019t *clearly* the best because you\u2019re still on the fence, and if they like you and they have extra money or perks to offer, now is when they offer it.\n\nI was offered an extra $6k p.a. (a \u201ctop up\u201d scholarship) and an apartment on campus. Still didn\u2019t put them above the program I chose.",
