That could happen for a variety of reasons. But having a mental breakdown or emotional meltdown should not be the norm in your PhD program.",

I don't think it was your intention, but this sounds a bit \"shaming\". Grad school is hard, and most of us do it at a time of our lives where a lot of other major life changes are happening. Maybe this woman was simply devastated because of her B (I would be too--in my program a B is a failing mark), or maybe she's dealing with other things too and it was the straw that broke the camel's back. To anyone reading this, never feel ashamed for reaching out to a therapist or counseling services. If you're emotionally distraught or struggling with your mental health, take advantage of that service. It doesn't mean that you're weak or cannot cope or that you don't belong in grad school.",

          "text": "This is so timely for me, thank you for posting it! \n\nMy last grad program was traumatizing. It was also slim on academics; it was essentially two years of being profoundly overworked while also being told not to take any more classes than the bare minimum required by the degree. I was even told not to take electives that, when I went to apply for graduation, it turned out I HAD to take to finish. I felt like cheap exploited labor and learned very little. I also thought I hated grad school, because people at my institution kept telling me that it was \"just how grad school is\".\n\nI started another program before I finished my thesis, and while it's been really hard making time for edits while I'm also balls-to-the-wall in my new program, I love it. It's HARD. Not in the \"you're teaching three sections and I need you in the lab feeding animals, cleaning cages, and supervising undergrads at least 50 hours a week\" kind of way that I'm used to, but in the \"Brain better be in high gear because you're gonna learn HARD this week\" kind of way. I'm excited. The academic standards are higher and the demands are very real; the weekly assignments are easily more intense and time-consuming than the finals were in my last program, and that is, if anything, an understatement. It's challenging, well-structured, with tons of scaffolding and support, and even though I'm in classes, studying, or working on assignments 10-14 hours a day, I'm not constantly exhausted, overworked, and demoralized like I was in my last program.

Avoid toxic situatons; but the truth is that especially in the bio field, you're throwing yourself into a completely new experience. Most students, in the country where I reside, come to a PhD program as very bright people who always had the certainty of being able to advance in their studies if they put enough hard work on it. When you enter a PhD program, this phase is basically over. When in a bio PhD program, long hours of study and hard work are just the basic premise; but then there are so many things you can't control and that can jeopardize your progress. Your experiments failing for some obscure reason, and you need to figure out what it is or you won't have any results. Cell lines getting contaminated and lost. Experiments whose results just go against the initial hypothesis. The spectre of competing researchers publishing similar results before you. In bad environments, even the paranoia that a labmate could be sabotaging your results. That's a lot of \"new kinds of problems\", unfortunately, and these are just the few off the tip of my tongue. And supervisors and professors are already numbed to it because... that's more or less as challenging as any working environment outside of your comfort zone. So, it's hard to notice when lines are being crossed. It's complicated.",

EDIT: I think a lot of it depends on what your crying threshold is.  Some people only cry under extreme stress, whereas the crying barrier is much lower for other people (like me).  It's a physical manifestation of stress, and for one person crying is a signal that something terrible has happened, and for another it just means they are tired and drained.",

      "text": "I have cried a couple times during my first year and a half of my PhD program so far. But there\u2019s only time that really stands out. I got home at like midnight and got into bed so exhausted. I told my partner that I wasn\u2019t sad, I just really needed to cry. And I did, a lot. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t say that grad school is overwhelmingly challenging. It\u2019s more that, especially in your first two years before your Qualifying Exams, it\u2019s a constant slough of work. Coursework, research, seminars, journal club, meetings, outreach/involvement so you can get grants, etc.\n\nThat said, I mentioned in passing to my PI that my first year was challenging and that I hadn\u2019t cried in my second year, he seemed genuinely concerned that the first year made me cry. So at least in my program, it\u2019s not designed to traumatize you. ",

It depends on who you are, how you handle failure, and how you handle stress. You will inevitably fail at things, and if you internalize that it can lead to crying, but that's also a generally unhealthy attitude that you should try to avoid developing.\n\nIf your PI is telling you this off the bat, I wouldn't call it a red flag necessarily, because it depends on how they mean it. It's definitely a pretty bright shade of orange, though. Have you asked any of their other students/research group members about it?",
