  "title:": "I left academia after grad school because I was bad at it, but now I\u2019m heartbroken. Please tell me I shouldn\u2019t try to go back.",
  "text": "I just finished my master\u2019s degree in literature in May. At the time I was burned out, though not from coursework, but from teaching. I really, really don\u2019t like teaching. I\u2019m a very shy person and teaching almost every day drained me so bad I thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown around March or so. You can\u2019t move forward in the humanities in academia without teaching, right? And the job market is so bad anyways I figured there was no use in continuing. \n\nFurthermore, when it came to coursework, I just wasn\u2019t that great at it. I\u2019m not being humble \u2014 I tried really hard all the time, but I was still one of the weakest students in almost every class I was in. Did all my reading, put in the time to really try and grasp some critical theory concepts, but often I just couldn\u2019t get a handle on anything well enough to discuss it. I was raised in a really strange community that often discouraged any kind of critical thought, so as an adult I usually feel like I\u2019m always trying to play catch-up. \n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m heartbroken that I\u2019m not studying literature anymore and working through it in grad seminars or in essays. I feel like a rudderless ship. I\u2019ve been applying to jobs I\u2019m vaguely qualified for, which are primarily administrative assistant jobs and copy editing (though if no one bites soon I\u2019m going to have to take it back down to customer service jobs again). Reading through these job descriptions and thinking that that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to be doing 40 hours a week for years literally makes me cry at night. I even enrolled in a library science MS program and withdrew at the last minute because I had a big, weeping breakdown at the thought of working that hard in school for something I don\u2019t love and then getting poor pay on the other side of it to boot. \n\nI feel stuck. The one thing I\u2019ve always loved and grown up feeling I was meant to do turns out to be something I\u2019m not good out or cut out for in the end. Does it sound like I made the right choice? It doesn\u2019t make sense to try and go back, does it? I know I can\u2019t be a student forever. \n\nIf anyone has left humanities for industry and ended up happy with the decision, what did you do?",

      "text": "I have a few thoughts for you.  First, literature is something that anyone can access at any time, in whatever way they want.  I haven\u2019t taken a literature class since high school, but I made it a part of my life and have read many classics on my own over the years.  Leaving academia does not mean leaving literature.\n\nSecond, have you considered therapy to address your anxiety and performance issues?  It sounds like those things are holding you back from doing what you love.  With some work, you may find that you can work through them in a way that will allow you to resume pursuing an academic career.\n\nThird, don\u2019t give up.  Working a job you don\u2019t love is a rite of passage.  Sometimes you have do that to live while you continue working toward what you really want.  It\u2019s not a dead end for your hopes and dreams, it is just a waypoint on your journey.  Keep moving forward and things will work out.",

          "text": "Just wanted to second this as the first point is really important. Some fields are fairly arcane and not easily explored without the aid of a research institution + very expensive equipment. Fortunately, literature is on the opposite end of the spectrum - there are many free resources, classes, groups and seminars that one could attend/utilize to continue their pursuit, so a change in trajectory doesn\u2019t have to spell the end of something you\u2019re passionate about.",

      "text": "This is not a direct answer to your question, but in a group of people, some people will be weaker compared to others. Everyone has a different skill set and that's really OK. Additionally, you'd be surprised how many people feel like \"catching-up\" constantly. I don't know if you made the right choice, but I think it's important to clarify a couple of things. Do you enjoy studying or do you feel like \"it's meant to be?\" Overall, it comes down to whether \"you want to but can't\" or \"don't want to and can't really.\" If it's the latter followed by \"but really should,\" I think pursue a different option. \n\nAcademia is something you can endure only if you actually enjoy it. I don't think it's doable if you are not attached to it on some level, because the imposter syndrome is very real and I don't think it ever goes away. I deal with it by telling myself that I only need to be good enough because I love the idea of \"raising speculative problems for the sole pleasure of resolving them\" as Bourdieu put it very nicely. If you love it but can't enjoy it because you feel you're not good at it, I think you might consider going back. If not, then find something you love because life is hard as is. \n\nIn case it's the former (you love it, but feel like you're not good enough) in my cohort (social anthropology, phd), we had this dude who seemed like he knew it all. He'd name drop like there's no tomorrow. And I wouldn't understand a word he said. Despite having read those people. Over time, I came to realize I didn't understand a thing because what he said didn't make sense. He wasn't able to answer a single question when asked what he meant. During the first year, he convinced everyone that he was going to be a superstar, after the second year, he just dropped out.\n\nAnd teaching is hard. And yes, you probably can't exist without it in the humanities. But you can get help. You can identify what it is that makes it a torture for you. Is it that students will challenge you? Is it that you feel you yourself haven't gotten an enough grasp to be able to convey it to students? Is it that you have a difficulty in engaging students? I know it's hard, but it's also OK to ask for help. If you have close relations with a professor, you might also talk to them.",

I can also relate to your issues, I am very introverted and have had to tackle that when teaching, I am very shy, but I have somehow made it work, because I ended up teaching and doing research, but I always could see myself as a librarian too. Teaching institutions and specialized libraries need people who are knowledgeable about specific subjects, some librarians do research, not much teaching involved but definitely service-oriented, so you need to talk to people quite a bit. I know it's not working with literature directly, it's also a tough job market, but it's worth thinking about. Here's an interview with a librarian, she talks about how the profession can be very different from what we were used to before regarding librarians. Hope any of this helps and good luck.\n\n[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/07/research-librarian/492911/](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/07/research-librarian/492911/)",

      "text": "As someone else said, literature is always accessible.  Find a good book club to scratch that itch.  And if you hate teaching, this is a hard area to remain in academics. \n\nWith your master's in literature, you can look for jobs in anything that requires writing, editing, or content creation.  Public relations, marketing, website creation, journalism, etc.  Of course, working for publishing houses and the like is also an option (not just copy editing, there is content creation).  I had a friend with a literature degree that worked for an appliance company writing instruction books.  She actually liked it.  I had another friend that worked with a non-profit that created free educational materials for under-served schools. \n\nYou also have a master's degree which can open you up to jobs at colleges and universities in academic advising, student life, career services, residence life, course development, etc.  It also opens up jobs working for all levels of government.  There are intern programs you probably qualify for that would get your foot in the door of government.  I'm on a search committee for a lead IT person at my university and the CV's have degrees from computer science to biology to MFAs, so you don't have to necessarily have a particular masters for all jobs.  For example, many of the grant proposal writers I have worked with had master's in literature or similar degrees, and they have generally been better to work with than those with science degrees. \n\nBe very open with the type jobs you look for.  I knew a guy with a masters in ancient literature that got a job at a tech startup developing some type of language processing technology and they needed an expert in language stuff to work with the people doing the technical stuff.  \n\nYou can also do a 180 and do something very different.  A friend of mine with an undergrad in literature went to med school.  Law school is another good option with your degree.  As someone else said, computer programing is another option to retrain in. \n\nBest of luck!",

Libraries are sometimes flexible on that requirement for things like science librarians, but almost never for liaison positions in the humanities).   Come talk to us over in r/librarians about the realities of the work.  And look at the skills we're asking for in our job ads.
