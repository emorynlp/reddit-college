  "title:": "Applying for a Lecturer position in the UK Universities",
  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI completed my PhD in the US, and I am familiar with how to apply for faculty positions in the US universities. I am planning to apply for lecturer positions (social sciences) in the UK. What resources are there to guide me in my application? I know that even the cover letter is quite different from what we use to apply for faculty positions in the US. Would appeciate it deeply if you share how I should prepare my application dosier. I looked for resources online but could not find much. Thanks so much!",

      "text": "I\u2019m a US PhD in social science, teaching in the US. But I did interview at a few places in the UK, and received some offers. Honestly, my application packet wasn\u2019t really any different from what I sent to US institutions. I think that UK universities place more of a premium on existing publications, while the US is more about potential. The big difference is at the interview phase. Job talks are shorter and in front of a smaller group, and you\u2019ll often interview alongside your competitors. Though it\u2019s not as awkward as it Might seem.",

      "text": "There will be some sort of person specification document that will list essential and desirable criteria. This will be used to systematically weed people out at the shortlisting process, often using an HR-approved checklist that keys directly to the job documentation. It's therefore crucial that you use this person specification to structure your application materials. You want your cover letter to clearly address how you meet all of the essential criteria, as well as applicable desirable criteria. I've seen people use bold, bullet points, or even tables in a cover letter to make sure it's clear that they meet criteria. Be succinct, but include details, as well. If they say 'experience teaching large groups', say 'I regularly teach groups of 100-150 students'.\n\nTypical range of shortlisted candidates could be anywhere from 4-8.\n\nIf you do get shortlisted, for the 'presentation' portion of the interview, you will be expected to prepare a PowerPoint and possibly to send your slides to HR in advance. You will almost certainly be given a prompt for the presentation, though it may be generic, e.g. 'How my teaching and research will contribute to the university'. The presentation may last only 20 mins or so, so it would be much shorter than anything you'd do in the US.\n\nInterviews will also probably be relatively short, and the questions will be fairly generic and more keyed to the ad than specifically tailored to your profile.\n\nIt's entirely possible there will be no shared meal/hospitality at all.",
