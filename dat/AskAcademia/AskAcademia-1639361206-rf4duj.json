  "text": "Hi all. I have recently obtained my MSc in molecular biology with a focus on microbiology and bioinformatics. During my thesis study, I have developed a strong interest in immunology, so now I want to pursue a PhD in this field. \n\nFor the past couple of months I have been applying for several PhD positions in Europe (through official job advertisements and sending out my CV and cover letter to PIs). I am aware that I lack some experimental/technical research experience in this field as I only have theoretical knowledge of immunology, so I am underqualified for many PhD positions due to my background. \n\nI want to pursue a PhD eventually. So, to be able to gain more research experience in this field, I am now thinking about working as a research assistant for 1-2 years. \n\nThere are some research groups/PIs whose work I\u2019m truly interested in. I want to send out my CV and cover letter to them even if I have already sent one for a PhD position. Mostly, they either did not reply or said that they had no available (PhD) positions at the time.\n\nMy question is, how do I backtrack from sending out cover letters for a PhD student position to research assistant position without drawing any more attention to my lack of experience and sounding like \u201cHi, I couldn\u2019t find a job even after all this time. Because I know nothing about this topic, so nobody hired me. I need to gain experience. Here is my lack of skills. Hire me.\u201d How do I approach this?\n\nThanks x",

      "text": "No problem!  If the folk you were in touch with think this will make you a better candidate, they may well be happy you are taking the initiave and willing to do something less prestigious in order to be a better qualified applicant.\n\nGive them a call at their office number or visit.  If they are not there, do not leave a message.  The difference between an email/letter and in person/phone is you actually have them there.  \n\nHi Dr. Fleen.  While I was doing my Master's in microbiology, I became very interested in immunology.  I'd like to get some lab experience to back up my book larnin'.  Does this seem like a useful step on my way to an immunology PhD? Do you have any *entry level* internship, lab tech or research assistant positions I might qualify for?  oh.  Can you suggest someone who might take me on? etc.\n\nAlternatively, you can take classes in the methods you missed.  Or both.\n\nIF YOU CAN GET A GRANT, do.  It will help a lot.",

      "text": "Why would you want to? If you don't have enough experience to do a PhD your applications won't go anywhere. If you do, you could land a place on a PhD program and why wouldn't you want to do it now rather than later? \n\nThe fields you've worked in and want to transfer to aren't miles apart and lots of people do general biology degrees and get into PhD programs so you're not wildly under-qualified, although you may need to explain the change in direction and why you think you can handle it.\n\nPersonally, I'd leave the applications you already sent out alone and if they don't work out try for some RA positions. There's no need to explain anything or withdraw any applications.",
