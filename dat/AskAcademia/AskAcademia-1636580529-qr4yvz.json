  "text": "I know reneging is super frowned upon but I have a weird situation that I need advice on...\n\n**I signed a postdoc offer from a reputable national lab which would require me to move out of state.**\n\n**Then I got diagnosed with cancer a couple weeks later.**\n\nI'm currently a patient at one of the top cancer centers, which is in my current city. My family is also here, and they've been an amazing support network. So **I want to stay in my current city until the cancer is treated** and surveillance is less frequent (doctors estimate 1-2 years).\n\nI told my postdoc manager, and he said the postdoc is not a work from home position, but he'll contact higher ups to see if that's a possibility.\n\nSo I started looking for other opportunities and I got an industry scientist offer in my current city.\n\nThe industry job pays significantly more than the postdoc and the research is still aligned with my goals.\n\n**Then my postdoc manager came back and said work from home would be fine in my situation.**\n\nI don't know how I feel about this, however, because I would be the only person at the national lab working from home.\n\nI'm therefore thinking about reneging my signed postdoc offer to go for the industry job...\n\nI know it's frowned upon, but I need more money (I've learned insurance doesn't always cover everything) and I don't feel comfortable being the only person at the national lab who is working from home.\n\n**I want to tell my postdoc manager that long-term I want to be at the national lab, but I'm not comfortable working from home and I want to work in my current city until the cancer is treated.**\n\nI don't know how this will be handled... **Will I ruin my image at this national lab? Will my reputation be tainted?**\n\nI feel so bad about even thinking about this... But at the same time I know it's the best decision for me.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n* Accepted postdoc position at a national lab.\n* Got cancer.\n* Lab offered to make it work from home postdoc, I'm not sure how that would work out.\n* I got a scientist/industry offer in my current city that I'd like to take instead.\n* Will reneging on the signed postdoc offer ruin my reputation or something?",

      "text": "I am so sorry for your diagnosis. I am 7 months into cancer treatment myself. Having a good cancer center, nearby family, and a good salary and benefits are all major factors for your treatment and wellbeing. One other thing to consider is stress level. Which job will give you the least stress and most flexibility around your cancer treatments? That might also be a factor.\n\nYes, it is frowned upon to turn down the postdoc after signing. But your situation is unique and most people will understand. I think you need to write a sincere letter explaining what you have explained in your post. The higher pay and maybe also better health benefits were something you were willing to sacrifice for the postdoc, but your situation has changed dramatically since signing the contract. Tell them that you hope they understand and will consider you in the future. There is a slight chance that a bridge is burned, but what matters most is your health and wellbeing.\n\nGood luck with everything. Sending healing vibes your way \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79",

Things have changed big time since I signed the offer.\n\nI wish you the best with your treatment as well.",

      "text": "I\u2019m not entirely sure what you want to renegotiate for. National labs usually allow postdocs only for up three years and there\u2019s not much wiggle room on salary because federal institutions and their love for brackets.\n\nSo your options really are to either work remotely for most of your time at the lab, move in and then probably move out a year later once your contract ends and you look for a different job. Or take the other job which sounds like s much better fit in every way possible, given your circumstances.",

Even if the contract said that the PI has legal right to hunt down OP and the rest of their kin and execute them in cold blood, what is OP supposed to do? Keep a temporary, almost guaranteed to be dead-end job that they know doesn\u2019t cover their medical expenses out of fear of burning a bridge or two?\n\nAs much as the circumstances suck, this is a no-brainer decision.",
