  "title:": "Publishing Expectations for Lab Techs?",
  "text": "Hi everyone. I am looking for some advice and insight on typical publication expectations for lower level folks. I\u2019m a research specialist (lab tech) at a university owned forest. I have a BS in forestry and I make 36k. Though I love my job, there seems to be a lot of pressure on me to work toward publications of my own and it\u2019s giving me the big stress.    \n   \nSince I started (undergrad internship led to full time position) I have put a lot of effort into a large data set that will lead to some neat publications. This was first suggested by my PI and it has been 100% me the rest of the way. I\u2019m currently sitting on about a third of a manuscript.    \nMy main issue is that my PI expects me to almost entirely take the wheel on this project. I have learned new software, labored over data, struggled with writing, and I feel a bit in the dark. He even made a passing remark about how he recently had to cover for the fact that these pubs have been in limbo for a while now.    \nIn addition, there is another faculty member who\u2019s manuscript I will be contributing to (closely related topic) but he will not return any of my emails. This is somehow my problem though as my PI regularly gets on my ass for not following up (we\u2019re 6 emails deep here, and I\u2019m getting radio silence).   \n   \nIs this just the name of the game in academia? Should I be carrying more weight and trying harder? I want to contribute to science, and I\u2019m passionate about the work I do. BUT DAMMIT I don\u2019t get paid enough to care about how many papers we publish every year! I realize that I have a fantastic opportunity to get some publications under my belt without a grad degree, but I barely know what I\u2019m doing and it\u2019s giving me palpitations.   \nThanks!   \n   \nTl;dr - I don\u2019t have a grad degree and don\u2019t make much money but my PI is expecting me to independently work toward publishing papers. I just want to collect data and keep our site up and running.",

          "text": "My position involves many hats, and publication was not one that was listed on any official documentation. This is a project that began during my undergrad internship and has continued on to this point.   \nIt is relatively uncommon in the field of natural resources, but not unheard of for non-graduate folks to publish. Sampling and measurement can be relatively straightforward processes so the barrier to entry isn\u2019t high.",

      "text": "While it's not entirely common, it's probably helpful to remember that a lot of people take lab tech roles because they want to get research experience to get into grad school.  This is a great opportunity to set yourself up strongly for your next position, whether that's grad school or a more senior lab assistant role with higher expectations for publication.  You don't have to take this opportunity, but it's probably worth thinking about the longer-term benefits before you dismiss it.",

      "text": "I think your PI is being unreasonable.  Techs do come in different flavours, but generally they are in routine/supportive positions, and are (elsewhere) generally not expected to \"lead\" research.\n\nThis does not mean that they cannot be supported in developing work, but, personally, they should not be forced into it.  \n\nDo you have a job description?  It might be a starting place if you do.  Not that it would be wise to stand on that, but it might give you some reinforcement as to what  was expected of you when you were hired.  \n\nI would probably be thinking about having a quiet chat with you PI about how you are starting to feel overwhelmed.  If you get no support/change, I would probably start casting an eye elsewhere.\n\nLastly, for a technician career, publications are nice - but like you say you really do not get paid enough to worry about them.",

      "text": "I say he takes advantage of you massively. Why? because what you do would normally the work of a PhD or even Postdoc people who earn way more than 36k. So now he gets a researcher for the price of a labtech.I would consider leaving or demand I get payed appropriately.  \nEdit: In addition without a degree and not the wish to get one no one cares for publications, so its not like this will boost your market value enough. Its a bit like asking artists  to work for \"exposure\"",
