  "title:": "Do universities have insurance which reimburses COVID testing costs?",
  "text": "I am a lowly peon on the university food chain, but getting a separate charge for my costs in the university's testing program seems odd to me. I am a fan of everyone getting tested, just to get that out of the way. Shouldn't the university's insurance cover testing? I had thought that there was a mandate that private insurers were required to reimburse for testing done in labs? (as you can tell I am confused) I am having difficulty finding relevant information from an institutional insurance perspective on the web.",

I work in a public university in Latin America and here every employee has a mandatory health insurance paid in part by the university and in part (a very low amount) by the employee. \n\nIt works fairly well and it covers free covid tests. It's not as fast as the private option but it works.",

Here the public health system also provides free tests with a waiting time of maybe 30 minutes. But those are rapid antigen tests. The PCR ones cost around 70 USD in the private sector.",

And as a university the number I have heard that we are paying is 15 per test.\n\nDoes university insurance (health, general, otherwise-institutional) not cover the costs incurred by PCR testing?",

If it's done efficiently, I'll take any day over the free but burocratic option I have here. \n\nIn fact, 2 times I went to the private lab paying full price (70 USD) just to not go through the burocracy of the unversity's insurance.\n\nIn the big picture, I'd say you have it fairly good with this compared to other countries or sectors.",

I'm not sure about the insurance but regardless, you should NOT have to pay for that at all! If you tell them you are NOT getting tested because you can NOT afford to, see what they say. Or contact your Human Resources and tell them that as well. I don't think they are allowed to require testing for COVID, if you can't afford to pay for it! Please let me know how this turns out. Don't get yourself fired! I couldn't pay for testing either. Take care!",
