My suggestion would be to aim for fewer higher quality proposals, investing more time in each one and increasing your odds that each one you submit will be funded.",

She ended up negotiating a \u201creset\u201d with the department which was something like 6-8 months. She didn\u2019t have to submit any proposals during that time, so she was able to really dig in to the data she had already collected, try different approaches and work with her mentors to develop something compelling. Needless to say it worked, the first grant she submitted post reset was funded, and she\u2019s done pretty well since. This was at a small independent non-profit so YMMV but sometimes you just need a break so you can try something different.",

      "text": "16 grant submissions to the NIH over three years is a lot - much higher than the norm.  14/16 ND applications is also quite high and should raise concern.  It's tough to assess without looking over the summary statements to look for reoccurring themes, but I have to wonder if you're spending an appropriate amount of time on the applications.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the ND and success rate depends on the FOA and mechanism.  For RFAs, the initial ND cutoff can range from 0 - 70%, though anyone can rescue applications (which tends to occur more for RFAs and IC reviewed PARs than for standing study sections).  For the parent R01 and R21, the ND rate is set at \\~50%.  In an analysis I presented at a conference two years ago, at my IC the success rate for new A0 applications submitted to the parent R01 is \\~10%, but jumps to \\~30% for A1s - no difference between NI and established investigators (I believe Mike Lauer also reported on his blog awhile back that A1s have a better success rate than A0s).  Competitive renewals have a much higher success rate (\\~30% for A0s, 45% for A1s).  The annual success rates were pretty consistent from 2015-19.  This data is consistent with what's reported in the [NIH Data Book](https://report.nih.gov/nihdatabook/), though they use a slightly different algorithm for calculating success rate (A0s and A1s within a fiscal year are counted as one grant application).",

          "text": "Forgot to mention - I recommend that you reach out to an SRO to see if you can serve on a study section.  If your funded grant was not an R01 equivalent, you may qualify for the [Early Career Reviewer program](https://public.csr.nih.gov/ForReviewers/BecomeAReviewer/ECR).  If your funded grant is an R01 or equivalent, then the SROs can pick you up though the normal process.  If you qualify for the ECR program, definitely apply using the link on the page.  If not (and even if applying for the ECR program), reach out individual SROs expressing interest in serving as a reviewer, briefly mention your expertise, and include a copy of your CV.  The best time to reach out to SROs is in early July, November, and March as that's when they're putting together that round's study section and are actively looking for ad hoc reviewers.  I've worked with several people that once they served as a reviewer the grant writing process clicked, where they then better understood how to present a story, the importance of the significance section (e.g., how that project moves the field forward, and not the importance of the field in general), and what it means when the summary statement says that the project is lacking rigor or details.\n\nI would also recommend that you reach out to your program officer.  Some are better than others, but many will sit down with you, review your summary statements as a collection, and discuss strategies on how to improve grantsmanship.  Unlike colleagues, who are sometimes hesitant to offer criticism to a coworker, a program officer typically doesn't have the same reservations.",

This also is a high number of R grants to write in 3 years, so slowing down and really refining a smaller number of grants can be a good strategy. I highly recommend The Grant Application Writer\u2019s Workbook. It takes you through step-by-step the formula for writing an NIH grant. I also recommend becoming a reviewer.
