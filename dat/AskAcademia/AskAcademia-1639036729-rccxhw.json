  "title:": "Letters of Recommendation from Professors I don't know well?",
  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am a grad student applying to a hefty scholarship that is requiring 2 letters of recommendation. Normally I have not had an issue receiving letters, however this past semester has been tough on me as I have had several health issues (COVID, tumors,  sinus infection, etc) causing me to often stay home from class very often. My classes are all small, with no more than 25 people per class, so they're pretty intimate and the professors generally know everyone quite well. \n\nI am nervous to ask my professors for a letter of rec because I do not know them well. I am in great academic standing, have completed all my assignments on time and gotten good grades on them, but just haven't really developed a relationship with my professors to where I feel they would be happy to write me a letter.\n\nAlso-- I was a TA and worked and internship at a international tech company, I have strong relationships with the professor I TA'ed for and with my internship's manager-- should I ask them for a letter of recommendation instead?",

      "text": "It depends on the focus/originator of the scholarship is. If it's focused on you as a student, then I'd have at least one letter from somebody who has been your instructor in a class and the other from the professor who whom you TA'ed. If it's more focused on your professional development then I thing the TA/internship letters would be fine.",
