      "text": "I am in the process of failing!\n\nI did a great Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics in a top worldwide institution. Had fun, it was amazing, I 100% enjoyed it, did great research, my advisor loved me, I totally would do it again. \n\nUnfortunately, my advisor was in the transition period between two areas, and I was, in a way, the last student in the first area. So towards the end of my Ph.D. research topics, I was kinda left on my own. Not bad, I love to work on my own, but it had consequences that now, after 3 years, I could understand.\n\n After the wonderful period that is a Postdoc hunt, I landed a 6-year term position in an ok-ish university. The trade-off? 4 hours of teaching. \"I can certainly do it, it will be a piece of cake\", I thought. \n\nWell... I did not. In these last 3 years, I have in total published 2 papers, and currently, I have nothing close to finishing. I have worked my ass off in this time, but the teaching load was much more than expected (for many reasons, between learning a new language, and the culture of my host country, it could some weeks take 120% of my work week), also external circumstances changed (During my Ph.D. I was alone and I could work 12 hours non-stop without noticing, now I have someone in my life who gets angry if I work too much, among other things.).\n\nFurther mistakes from my side:\n\n \\- I did not build a collaboration group. Since all my \"Ph.D. siblings\" were from another area, and my advisor too, after my Ph.D. I ended up without any collaboration network. Afterward, I got too focused on working hard and hyper-focused on a single project in my new institution, that I never build such a network.\n\n \\- In my solitary research path, I have started many many many projects which I have later abandoned to be not good enough. In hindsight, I should have tried to make the most of these projects, but I am unsure if I would be happy publishing only mediocre-value incremental research. \n\nOverall, as the saying says. \"Work smarter, not harder\". I think I failed at this fundamental principle.\n\nOn the positive aspect, I was never completely blind to the possibility of moving to industry, and I diverted part of my efforts in these years to master programming (luckily, very useful as an applied mathematician). So currently I am in the job market seeing the options. It does not seem so daunting, at worse, I can take an entry-level programming job. But before surrendering to that fate, I'm hoping to land a data scientist job.\n\n On the sad part, my area (medical imaging), got eaten alive by machine learning, and unfortunately, I have no research in that area. So it is unlikely that I will land a position in this topic (and most of the big companies that develop these things have laboratories in the middle of nowhere. ) So likely most of my true expertise will be lost in this transition. But I gotta say that I am ok with it.\n\nI think the harder step is regarding my own identity. I have been identifying as a researcher, and a mathematician, for years. I have based my life objectives in this direction and suddenly I am starting to wonder what will my future objectives be. I am sure I'll sort it out, but I gotta say that this is what has hit me the hardest.",

I managed to get some material but also \"the material should not be the same every semester\"... The worse part is that these master courses barely have 1 reference book, which has no exercises, so searching for adequate problems has been a permanent pain. Furthermore, many of the courses I had to give were ones I did not have in my own universities, so not only I have to prepare material, but I had to learn and study a course before doing so. (and don't get me started with course rotations, getting prized with new courses when I finally managed to hold a conversation in this country's language, coronatimes, etc) \n\nWhat makes things worse is that since these are exercise courses, they do not count as \"true teaching\" for an academic curriculum, so essentially, it is time thrown into the void. Somehow, one has to compete with postdocs with no teaching duties in an extremely competitive environment with much less available time. \n\nI really had a love for teaching, so I would divert more time to prepare good, well rounded exercises. This is something that I completely regret. Once I came to realize that every minute spent teaching is a waste of your research time, I decided to throw my perfectionism out and have a full careless approach of it. Ultimately, this made me hate teaching and currently I despise every minute I waste in it. \n\nOn the good side, I no longer see a future as a professor as a dream job.

      "text": "15 years ago, my spouse entered a top 10 PhD program in his field, because he didn't know what else to do, he thought it sounded fun, and he felt honored to be accepted into such a prestigious program. It took him 10 years to get his PhD. His PhD program was super toxic, too, but I won't get into that right now.\n\nIn the five years since, we have moved twice, to a new state each time. He has had some interviews here and there for tenure track positions, including a couple of on-campus interviews, but he has never gotten an actual tenure track offer. He has only held lecturer and VAP positions since finishing his PhD. In fact, he's very lucky to be employed at all right now - a school where he knew people needed a VAP last minute and that's how he got his current position.\n\nMy spouse is currently looking into transitioning from faculty to staff, and has been trying to build his network accordingly. A year ago, he came fairly close to getting a decent staff job at a state school on the East Coast, but the school implemented a hiring freeze due to COVID, which took away that opportunity. My spouse has never had a job outside of higher education and he fears that his PhD would be a liability when applying to industry jobs (because \"overqualified\").\n\nUntil this school year, my spouse and I made the same amount of money, despite the fact that I only have a liberal arts BA. Even now, he doesn't make much more than I do. I'm currently working on another degree in something more employable, so that I can get qualified for a better job with a salary that can support both of us.\n\nI get a lot of downvotes around here for discouraging people from going to graduate school, especially PhD programs, but the truth is that grad school isn't always the right decision and the vast majority of PhDs will never get a tenure track job. So many people, including my spouse, think that if they work really hard, get a PhD from the right program, have the right advisor, and get the right number of publications in all the right journals, that they will certainly beat the odds and get a tenure track position, but (while those things are generally helpful) that's not quite how it works. There are literally hundreds of applications per TT position, at least a few dozen of those are everything the department is looking for and more, it's a total crapshoot. Not to mention that the frequent moves (from one post-doc or temporary teaching position to the next) make it difficult to settle down, buy a house, and/or have a family, if that's your goal.\n\nTL:DR my spouse entered a PhD program without much understanding of what he was getting into, he got his PhD but it hasn't worked out very well for him career-wise.",

The grade minimum was 75 for this program, and I failed Anatomy with a 68 and Biochemistry with a 70. This was just the first semester! I sat out a year while I worked at a pizza shop. Many of my former classmates would come in to get food and I had to act excited like I was fine but I was dying on the inside. I was given the opportunity to restart the year. I did well the semester I failed. Turning those failed classes to a 82 in Anatomy and 90 in Biochemistry. However, I become overwhelmed again in the second semester and failed Physiology with a 72. I was dismissed completely from the program for failure to make progress. Crying in my advisor\u2019s office, she recommended I join dental hygiene. I did so and completed the program in grand fashion. While there though I avoided my old classmates around the building and lied about why I was still there but my success spoke for itself. I had the highest grades in the class and I received numerous awards within the school and nationally. My picture was posted on the school website and on corporation websites so my cover felt blown. Immediately after graduation, I received a salaried job working for city government and was able to buy a house within 6mos. I used the pandemic to study for my entrance exam to get back into dental school. I took the exam and score 6 points higher then my first attempt years ago. I submitted my application and was accepted back into dental but this time around I deferred my accept for a year and plan to start on my own accord in 2022. Ill check back in a few years to let you know how everything turned out but yeah, that\u2019s my story.",

I want back in at another institution, had the same thing happen, but this time filed a Title IX grievance and fought for a year to graduate with my PhD.  \n\n\nSome might consider that a success since I graduated, but I missed out on so much experience and learning because faculty refused to act in mentoring roles. I see people 10 years younger than me graduating with multiple publications  while I essentially have none. My advisors didn't connect me to peers and to this day are more detriments than assets when it comes to references. I got the piece of paper, but not all of the other things that were suppose to come with it. No post-docs for me. I'm a 'failed' PhD because I didn't go into research or teaching, which are the career paths the a PhD is suppose to prepare you for. Currently employed at an entry level position for a fraction of the pay I should be earning.  \n\n\nBut when it comes down to it I am happier. The work is nowhere near challenging to me so I can breeze through the day. It gives me time to think and plan about the future. My position is stable and supportive enough that I could make a career out of it, although I will never have the comfortable pay or professional challenge. I could jump ship and do something else or I could do a little something on the side.   \n\n\nI don't know if my story is a good one; in many ways things would have been better if I Mastered out earlier and started in industry from the bottom, but I wouldn't have been satisfied with myself. My advice? So many people in academia act like there's only one path: degree, post-doc, professor or research lead. There's so much more than that. Find your local professional organization and network with them, they represent a more diverse spectrum of careers than the faculty at your institution. Location matters a lot too, you might find more success in moving around. The city I was in 10 years ago had a fraction of the positions compared to where I am now.  \n\n\nGet sleep and therapy.",

                  "text": "Oh gosh \ud83d\ude15. Honestly I find myself in a somewhat similar situation - my dissertation hasn\u2019t moved forward (some things out of his hands, some are in his hands), for the time being he\u2019s asking me to work on things that don\u2019t have much to do with my own dissertation except that they help me learn the methods but what I actually do makes no sense other than that. Would have been fine to do something that makes no sense for the sole purpose of learning but I\u2019m 4 semesters into a 9 semester program . To top it off he\u2019s asked me not to use the computers during office hours so im stuck working after hours - meaning I can\u2019t mingle with my cohort, can\u2019t meet people and I\u2019m general I\u2019m very isolated. If I have questions about what I do.. can always message him but since it\u2019s outside office hours he sometimes takes hours to reply (but he has shown my lab mate how the methods work - in person not via chat). I\u2019ve asked multiple times to be involved in other projects for the time being (both to learn but also to meet the rest of our team) but I\u2019m in general given the cold shoulder and told to work on what I\u2019ve been given (so continue working after hours). My dissertation itself - 2 pilot studies , and a funded project which for various reasons has to be cut short (also because my clock is ticking) so I won\u2019t get to learn everything I was hoping for and I won\u2019t get to do the number of experiments I was hoping I\u2019d do. He recommends stuff (for example he was telling this student about all the possible scholarships they could apply for - in front of me while ignoring me completely) to my lab mate who is practically involved in every funded project he has but I get no recommendations. Even when I ask whether he will help me with xyz scholarship because he\u2019d need to submit a letter, he kind of ignores the question. \n\nIdk whether I\u2019m negative or whether I\u2019ll be in your situation in a few years. A part of me wants to scream and leave.",

It all sounds, weird. The professor did seem understanding though and I did mention that I understand that my supervisor has kids and the pandemic might be difficult for him but it isn\u2019t fair that he has 2 PhD students and they just get treated so differently. And I know he means well with providing me with old data to play with but the fact that I use the computers outside office hours and cannot mingle with either my cohort or the other people that use the same software I do is isolating... anyway whatever, she said that she will reach out to the other 2 profs and they will try to schedule a meeting with my supervisor as they are also his mentors and they do that stuff anyway.

He's being an arse and they need to understand this (this may be difficult, it will feel like you're going behind his back, but these people get away with their bullshit in the dark - part of the point of a thesis committee is to give the student a chance to resolve this kind of thing). Let them know that he has essentially decided not to cooperate in improving the situation. Make a list of your previous problems with him to refresh their memories if necessary. Try to get them all together for this, if possible - you want to lean on their collective responsibility, it will push them to be more responsive. It may mean mediating with your PI (if they are mentoring him they may be able to pressure him to behave better), or it may mean helping you explore your other options (how to complete the work more independently, perhaps finding collaborators or projects to complement your other work to help you get to the line as quickly as possible, even switching PI if really necessary).\n\nYou will have options. Even gritting your teeth and pushing through the work with this guy as quickly as possible will be better with the advice of your committee (and remember, a dissertation doesn't have to be perfect. It's a big piece of coursework. If you can get the work done, get some data out then you can write the dissertation). You have plenty of time to resolve this. I know people who saved their PhDs with data in their last couple of semesters. You might be able to find some collaborative projects to take the pressure off your work with the PI.

I need to give myself a day or two just to process that email. \n\nAs of now (but I want to sleep on this), I\u2019m thinking of emailing him and saying thanks for this email but here are some challenges I\u2019ve been having over the past 6 months: 1) not getting keys to the places I need to access . 2) working outside office hours , this early in my training - I miss on the opportunity to mingle with the personnel (he mentioned in the email that is there to facilitate my training) and I\u2019m left on a figure it out on your own mode (with chat messages from him). 3) discussing tables and figures during lab meetings in a different language 4) being provided with an opportunity to work during office hours especially if I have language classes that I\u2019m taking in the afternoon after work (my course work will be done in this language so I need to learn it) 5) having a more equal workload around journal clubs instead of consistently making presentations and not have the workload be somewhat more evenly split between the lab 6) being asked to move around equipment for projects I\u2019m not involved in. Yet have skills (and again benefit from the entire team that he mentioned in that email) I could gain from being involved. Not to mention the added benefit of collaborating with my fellow lab mate on something 7) being provided with old data but not being told what data files are called; when I wanted to double check stuff in the data and asked for the original files I was declined because he had no time to share files with me . This miscommunication caused a delay in analysis 8) lack of communication. Not sure how to phrase this or whether to but a few months ago he said he would split some samples between me and my lab mate but he never said which samples I had to analyze. I obv asked and he would say \u2018I\u2019ll let you know\u2019, but at the end of it , he never did. I had to message my lab mate only to find out that he had already talked to her and she was surprised that he didn\u2019t mention anything to me. Not sure if I should add this . 9) .... so on and so on \n\nI don\u2019t know whether this sounds rude or not, maybe I\u2019ll try to provide solutions to these problems so that I seem a bit more solution based but yeah. This is preferential treatment and to me it\u2019s obvious.",

That's why I think the most important thing is for you to build a strong rapport with your thesis committee (even if that is also a frustrating path).\n\nSadly, lots of people have shitty PIs. It's a role which requires a lot of skills that most researchers just don't have and/or aren't interested in acquiring. The bad news for you is you've clearly got a shining example of that. The good news is that a lot of people still get through the experience with a PhD. You can do this. Use your resentment for him to motivate you to finish, knowing that this was through your own power not his, and put a heavily sarcastic thank you in your acknowledgements as a fuck you. If you make it out the other side with any will to continue in academia, you can then do what I do: spend half my time giving advice to the master's and PhD students in my lab (and strangers on the internet) about how to survive the worst bits.

She ghosted me for weeks and when she read my progress she never said anything to help me improve my work. Then, a couple of weeks before actually turning my Thesis in, she sent me an e-mail basically telling me it was awful, made no sense and that I had to completly change it. She also proceeded to tell me she wouldn't be able to read it again before it was presented publicly.\n\nI was in panic due to that. Spent a couple of days with insomnia and with severe anxiety trying to change everything but it ended up worse.

      "text": "I've been in academia 25 years and my failure narratives could form their own subreddit. Where to begin? \n\nProbably the failure with the biggest net positive impact was in my previous job at a SLAC. It was my second job; left the first one after four years for a lot of different reasons. For the first 7-8 years, the new place was great. I did good work and received tenure and promotion to Associate Professor. But then,  around the 7-year mark (circa 2008-2009) everything went completely to shit. \n\nThe institution itself was pretty much the same as before, and I didn't make any radical changes to my work post-tenure. But somehow, something changed between my students and me. I was trying out some newer teaching methods (IBL, flipped classroom) and maybe that was it. Students started to complain and a narrative started to form about me. This made work miserable, and to my discredit I used my blog and social media to hit back. (Big mistake.) It got to the point where, if was scheduled to teach a class with only one section, students were paying extra to take it from the local community college and transfer the credits rather than take it from me. (Not kidding; I learned about this second-hand.) \n\nI didn't get a ton of support, despite how much I was struggling. At first my dean pulled me into his office to ask about what was wrong, but as things \"progressed\", eventually I was threatened with dismissal, despite tenure, if I didn't bring my course evaluations up. My dean told me, literally, that I was a liability to the institution. The attitude was \"Fix yourself or you're out of here\". From there, I spiraled into depression and anxiety. \n\nUltimately I decided to go on the job market and look for a place where I could just start over, and try to build on successes and avoid mistakes. I applied to four positions, and got hired at one of them, and I've been there 10 years now. I earned tenure, again, four years ago and was promoted to full Professor; and generally speaking I've been very happy here, fully accepted, and had a really successful career (including writing a well-received book about flipped classrooms). \n\nI learned a lot from this failure: \n\n- It's possible to start over even if you're mid-career.\n- In fact, it's better to jump into the unknown and try to start over, than it is to languish in a place where you're just depressed and anxious all the time. \n- \"Grow where you're planted\" is among the all-time worst career advice. \n- You can avoid misspending 10 years of your life/career by paying more attention to the relationships you have with other people.\n- There are some seriously shitty deans out there -- don't be one of them, and don't put up with them.",

              "text": "It was a while back, and I can't remember all the details but basically:\n\n- I started using teaching techniques that were not just lecturing. IBL involves students working through guided discoveries of (mathematical) concepts, making conjectures about what they discovered, and then presenting proofs of those conjectures on the board and being open to criticism. Flipped learning involves students learning basic material independently prior to class and then building off that in class. Both of these are a _big_ culture change from what my students were used to. \n- I instituted these changes but did not have a corresponding plan to support my students or communicate with them. So they were struggling to adapt and I was sitting there thinking _What's wrong with you guys? Why don't you want to do the work?_ (Which would be great questions if I'd not asked them rhetorically.) \n- So class time turned into daily standoffs between the students and me. Students were angry and blamed me for not teaching the class (= lecturing) and would not do their work. Meanwhile I failed to reach out and try to understand what they needed and how I could help. \n- Some of the complaints were \"He doesn't teach the class\", \"We have to teach ourselves everything\", \"He doesn't help us\", and a lot of comparisons with other profs (\"Prof. G always helps us, but Prof. Rtalbert235 never does\"). Students would talk to other students (it was a small college) and although they'd never met me before, they'd start the semester with an impression of me that was super negative. \n- Hitting back -- a couple of times I live-blogged an exam session, not naming any names but making running comments like \"This one guy in the back is turning in his exam after 5 minutes, I bet I know how this will turn out\". Or I'd tweet angrily about what students were saying about me. It was all stupid and unprofessional and I had to take a hard look at myself afterwards. \n\nWhen I left, it was a complete leap into the unknown for me. I had no idea even if I was going to be able to reset my career --- maybe I really was just an asshole and I'll be just as bad off in the new job as in the old one. But I will say: I was committed to making the new job a better situation. I had uprooted my family from our home and social network and moved to a completely different state in the US where we knew nobody. My kids were just 1, 4, and 6 years old at the time and the move was scary for them. My wife had to find a new job. We almost went bankrupt because our house wouldn't sell. So it was such a huge change and sacrifice that I felt like I couldn't afford to F it up, and I did everything I could to fix the problems I had before. \n\n**Especially, I was much more intentional with my relationships with students.** Listening to them, asking them what they need, being sensitive to how different modes of teaching affect them, thinking about how to work _with_ them and avoid antagonistic relationships where I am working _against_ them. I just really committed to having a totally different mindset about students, and I followed through on that. My new students responded really well to this. My old ones probably would have too. \n\nI hope that helps.",

At schools where you also need to do research, teaching is treated like a chore, and even if you would like to experiment and try new techniques, the need to focus on research means that you just don't have the time or mental energy to invest in it. It's easier to just follow the standard lecture-exam model. The response from your department shouldn't have been to fire you; it should've been to connect you with better teaching resources.",

So I think it's pretty great. \n\nIt's good that you use group quizzes and other active techniques. [Those are pretty well understood now to be the best platform for actual student learning](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8410). Direct instruction, as you say, is also helpful. But the thing is, direct instruction can be done anywhere now through recorded video; the value proposition for doing it live in a class is not as strong as we might think. But active learning in groups can only be done when you have groups around to work with, and that's during a class meeting. So it makes sense to make active learning the primary focus of group meetings and to minimize everything else, or relocate it. That's the basic (oversimplified) idea of flipped learning. \n\nStruggling students might find flipped classrooms frustrating. They might also find more lecturing to be frustrating because they don't understand what you're saying or doing. Or, even worse, they could come away from a lecture *feeling* less frustrated but then crash into a wall of frustration later when they sit down to work and realize they don't *actually* understand the material. It's better IMO to confront the frustration head-on during class, through active learning in groups, when help is 100% available.",

This does vary country to country though. In the UK, salaries for doctoral students are infamously low, but you are given them as a stipend so they are mostly tax-free. In France, it is now the law that a doctoral student has a contract and salary; they aren't super high paid but you get the benefits of being a contracted worker, and can't (normally) end up working for free as can be the case elsewhere. In Germany, again as a doctoral student you are generally contracted to the university and treated as a public servant which means a fairly good salary, much more than most people I knew were getting back in the UK (this may vary by state, mine included a very tasty christmas bonus!)",

They push themselves through graduate school on the belief that landing a dream job will somehow \"make it all worthwhile,\" and a title and salary will fill any emotional void in their life. It will not. Work is still work, and most of us are only there because they pay us to be. And you'll still have days where you feel depressed, unfulfilled, ignored, and aimless. Being called \"Doctor\" or \"Professor\" (and only in a few settings by a few people) is just part of a job. It's not a magical life booster that will justify the years you spent earning a poverty wage and reading dense books you've long since forgotten.\n\nPart of why people who have \"given up and moved on\" seem happier in their other careers is arguably because they have discovered contentment in life that doesn't come from their workplace. And part of why so many academics are perpetually unfulfilled is because they have cemented their entire self-worth into their career prospects. \"No job = I have failed at life.\" It's nice to have a job you love, but it's a better goal to have a good life all around.",

I\u2019m lucky I guess because I ended up realizing how unhappy graduate school was making me early on. The grad school I went to was very toxic, and I wish I\u2019d been more careful to ask students about their experiences before I ended up going there. The four other women in the program with me dropped out too; I never got to see any women pass the math qualifying exam while I was in the program. It\u2019s tough, because I wish I had done more to change the way things were done in the department, but I just decided to leave instead. I am soooooooo much happier now though! I have my dream job working in operations research! Please don\u2019t stay in graduate school if it\u2019s ruining your mental health.",

This came to a head and I switched supervisors, only to realise that the narrative was represented as me being the problem- despite supervisor #1 having multiple PhD students who had or were in the process of failing to complete.\n\nI limped along for about three years when I  should have just left - I submitted my patchwork thesis at the end and didn't even receive a masters, and when I read it back I can fully see why.

My partner got a TT job at a SLAC, where I adjuncted. I limited my job search to this region (obviously a bad move but you know, responsibilities) and tried for to find a TT job for several years, coming close a couple times but never landing a full time position. Then came the 2008 meltdown and the ensuing evaporation of already scarce humanities jobs. I was deeply depressed personally at this point and pretty disillusioned professionally. So I completed a totally different graduate program (Communication Sciences and Disorders) to become a Speech-language Pathologist. This profession has its issues for sure (that\u2019s another post) but I\u2019m always glad there\u2019s plenty of work and I\u2019m able to be at least partially self-employed. My employment struggles in academia and the stress of years of precarity have definitely made a mark on me. I juggle 3 different jobs (my own private practice and 2 per diem hospital jobs) by choice because I need my independence and don\u2019t ever want some search committee of randos determining whether I can feed my family, and I try to avoid putting all my eggs in one basket; if one employer implodes, I need to be able to flex to the next thing and keep the ball rolling money-wise. I miss academia, but the sacrifices were too much and it was just unsustainable.\n\n*Edited to add just saw \u201cSTEM\u201d heading as I posted.

      "text": "A lot of the comments here seem to indicate that one either 'succeeds' or 'fails' in academia, but there are actually many smaller mistakes that, if left uncorrected, can lead to issues somewhere in the middle that are even more problematic. For instance, publishing in predatory journals can lead to bad research practices in general, bombing an interview can lead to diminished self-confidence and/or a poor image if in a small field, joining a doctoral program when you don't actually want to do research (or don't yet know that you don't want to do research) can cause existential angst, not diversifying your portfolio of skills can make you look like too much of a niche-candidate, adjuncting for far too long (particularly at community colleges) can make you seem 'unworthy' of being hired full-time, and even preventing yourself from applying to positions that you believe are 'beneath' you can limit your employment prospects greatly. These are far more commonplace than most of the examples provided in the other comments, and they're generally the result of poor advising, limited academic support, etc. Truthfully, though, I think the biggest mistake that most graduate students make en route to a Ph.D. is not to enjoy the journey and engage in self-discovery. The odds of getting a TT position are incredibly low, and we're setting ourselves up for genuine failure if we believe otherwise.",

Failure from outside is the difficulties in the relationship with advisor, hunting a faculty position, and other relationships. Advising graduate students is the major duty of a professor.  If the professor dislikes the student or will not provide advise about the dissertation, it is the failure of department or the professor instead of students. You can not expect every student is genius to know everything without learning from professors. If the professor provided bad reference about the student who has no cheating or lying behavior and destroyed his/her career life, it is professor's career and reputation's failure. But no student dares to complain about that even though in America. Research world is small. One professor dislike you, which means your academia career is dead.",

The next year, the number of jobs in my area of expertise vanished for reasons I've never understood (trends come and go). I had also struggled to publish that year, which in hindsight was a major contributing factor, but it had been difficult to find the time alongside teaching responsibilities. I didn't secure another visiting position or postdoc. In my field, a C.V. gap in your post-Ph.D. career path is a death sentence, and I was wise enough to avoid the adjunct trap, so after the standard period of grief mourning my academic career I instead moved to a heavily populated metropolitan and stayed with generous family until I secured a job to pay the bills. Just under a year later I really \"shifted\" into research industry.\n\nBest decision of my life, never regretted leaving. Very much enjoy working 9-5 for a company that treats me well, compensates me well, and has great benefits. I also have much better career security - my company could disappear tomorrow but I could probably find a similar job in a couple months without the need to relocate. I miss teaching but if I ever want to do it again, I can probably get a weekend/evening adjunct job teaching one class.",
