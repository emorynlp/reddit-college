  "text": "Hi! I'm a law student and recently got granted my first funding for a research project about biofuel policies. The project is supposed to extend trough 15 months. The thing is I've never undergone such a long project and nobody teaches us how to manage this things. The longest I've planned before was 1 month prep for exams.\n\nI already have defined the problem, hypothesis and my objectives with the activities I have to do in order to reach them. I've set due dates on the objectives based on a work plan that was defined in my request.\n\nI think the main problem is that I'm not required to produce an article or monography (just report on what I did), as I had for other small projects, so I don't have a specific goal to look at and progress toward (maybe this is making me anxious?). \n\nThe funding is supposed to incentivize grade students to start their first steps in research so its overall goal is just learning how to do academic work. Maybe I'm overthinking this but anytime I start to work on some activity I set up for myself I end up looking at other things that are related to the subject but not to the current activity I'm trying to do at the time. Maybe I just have to force me to do one thing at a time? \n\nI know that these things are mostly learnt by just doing them but I was wondering if there are some tips or bibliography that helped you set up a system to work and manage projects in order to keep things going smoothly. I already read some of my supervisor's recommendations on research in general but I haven't found anything related to this specific problem. \n\nThanks in advance for any recommendations.",

      "text": "Are you looking for something to manage the literature or the project? If you\u2019re looking to manage literature/citations use Zotero, or ReadCube papers or something (lots out there). In terms of project management, there\u2019s also lots out there. I personally use Notion as my main project manager/PhD manager, as it\u2019s super flexible and I can customize it just how I want. If your clarify what you are looking for specifically I may be able to provide a better answer.",

          "text": "I already use Zotero and Obsidian, tried Notion but got wind up on the different configs. What I'm looking for is more like the principles that people follow on setting up systems for tracking, monitoring and keep momentum on different projects. I found some systems but they were mostly for industry project and product management. Sorry if I'm not making myself clear, English is not my first language.",
