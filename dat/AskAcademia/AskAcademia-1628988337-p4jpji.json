  "text": "Hello,\n\nI have a colleague who had a CNRS position for a few years and is now a staff scientist at a lab in another country, they say they can go back to their CNRS position after this staff scientist contact ends.   \n\n\nWhat are the rules in CNRS that allow for extended periods of leave to work elsewhere? If this is possible, my partner and I could live together until I get a job in France.",

This career mobility is possible in the CNRS and most UMR (join lab between French Uni and CNRS).\n\nIf you are a CNRS (or UMR) technician or researcher, terms of secondment are described below :\n\n>The secondment allows the agent to leave his or her original body while continuing to benefit from his or her rights to advancement and retirement in that body.The secondment can be for a short period (six months maximum) or a long period (five years maximum, renewable). The secondment for the creation of a start-up company is pronounced by a maximum period of three years within the limit of 10 years. The remuneration of the seconded employee is paid by the host organization. When the secondment is carried out within a company or a private organization, for the creation of a private organization, for the creation of a company company (start-up) or for the exercise of a liberal activity, a deontological control is exercised beforehand. beforehand.The employee is evaluated by his or her direct superior in the host organization. The report of the professional interview is sent to the CNRS. Researchers may continue to be evaluated by the sections of the National Committee if they so wish.After a short-term secondment, the employee is reinstated in the functions he or she previously held. previously.In the case of a long-term secondment, if the officer does not wish to renew his or her secondment and wishes to return to the CNRS, he or she must send his or her request to the regional delegation (DR) to which he or she delegation (DR) to which he or she belongs, by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt, at least three months before the expiry of the expiry of the secondment. He or she is then reinstated by right in a position corresponding to his or her grade.\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>Translated from French to US English with [www.DeepL.com/Translator](http://www.DeepL.com/Translator) (free version)\n\nSource: [https://www.cnrs.fr/sites/default/files/pdf/DRH2020-11\\_LDG-mobilite.pdf](https://www.cnrs.fr/sites/default/files/pdf/DRH2020-11_LDG-mobilite.pdf)\n\nI hope it answered your question.",
