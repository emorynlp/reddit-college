  "text": "I've been collaborating with my labmate on a manuscript we're hoping to submit soon, and it's been rather frustrating when we had to compare changes. He's been using comments on Latex to keep old text available and it's not very readable in the editor anymore.\n\nI'm thinking of proposing we use a github repo for figures, bibliography and the .tex file for future manuscripts, as it will resolve the need to preserve old texts, and will also allow us to resolve conflicts when editing the same lines.\n\nIs using github for such a bad idea, or is it fine?",

If each line only has one sentence, then fewer conflicts. \n* Commit early, commit often. And make edits in discrete, modular branches. This also limits merge conflicts, and will make it easier to track down past changes\n* Store figures and other binary files on dropbox or some other cloud service. On your computer, create a symbolic link to the cloud folder, and use this path in your Latex file for referencing figures. Keeping binary files on git is bad practice. \n* Maintain a consistent and sensible scheme for naming the keys to bibliography keys, something like \"author\\_year\\_descriptor\", like \"smith\\_2020\\_mRNA\". \n* Be sure to set up your .gitignore to ignore all of the files LaTeX generates. You really only need the .tex file",

With this \"di\" alias in `~/.gitconfig`, with a `git di` you get only words, not lines(/paragraphs) highlighted in your diff:\n\n```\n[alias]\n    di = diff --color-words\n```",
