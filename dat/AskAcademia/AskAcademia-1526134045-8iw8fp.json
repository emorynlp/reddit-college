  "title:": "Why are academic papers so difficult to read?",
  "text": "This year was my first year working in a bio-statistics lab. I'm an undergrad with aspirations of pursuing a PhD in biostatistics. During lab meetings this year, we were required to read a paper once every two weeks or so, and I greatly struggled with understanding what was even trying to be said in most of these papers. When we spoke on the papers in meetings, the points seemed very simple and made the papers seem convoluted and full of jargon. Is this a common style in academic writing? Did any of you feel this way when you first began to read academic papers? I can't tell if I'm frustrated because I like to write in a simple style so most people can follow what I'm saying, or if I'm just not cut out for this kind of work. \n\nAny opinion on this? Reading so many papers has kind of discouraged me from writing my own papers in the future. I know I'll have to do it, but as of right now, I feel like I'll be awful at it.",

      "text": "(STEM based answer)\n\nI'm currently reviewing a paper using a lot of concepts slightly outside of my area of expertise and I feel you. Some terms need me to read other papers to understand. My usual process involves following the references down several levels and traversing these levels until I understand completely what is being said, it's exhausting.\n\nThere is an intense level of detail required in research. While the general points can be given simply, speaking generally can get you in trouble as it introduces ambiguity into what you say. If reviewers misinterpret what you are trying to convey it will be very hard to get published. \n\nJargon may seem confusing initially but it is needed to *concisely* describe things. There needs to be a high density of information as authors are not given a lot of space.\n\nThere is a difference between broadly understanding what an author is saying and being able to recreate it. I can tell the paper I am looking at now is of sufficient quality as I can recreate the results of the research (theoretical not experimental thankfully). \n\nThe good news is that once you get used to an area is that you can read papers faster as jargon is reused. \n\nWriting and reading are both difficult and important skills to develop as they form cornerstones of research. Your work doesn't exist in a bubble, it is based on other's research which you must read, and if you want others to appreciate your work then you have to learn to communicate it effectively. It's not easy but it's worth it if that's what you enjoy.",

Everyone has a hard time reading primary literature when they try reading in a different field, no matter how good they are!  As you get more and more advanced and detailed in your field of study, using jargon will be the most concise way to say what you precisely mean.  Yeah, of course there is plenty of writing out there that is extremely verbose and unnecessarily complex, but you will come to see jargon as a useful shorthand for complicated concepts that you steadily master.  For example, consider these two sentences, one with jargon and one without (taken from the title of a recent Science Report paper)\n\n**Inflammatory monocytes** regulate **Th1 oriented immunity** to **CpG adjuvanted protein vaccines** through production of **IL-12**\n\nI have bolded the \"jargon\" terms.  Here is a rough translation if I were to use less jargon: ~~**A type of white blood cell that becomes active during inflammation** controls **a type of immune response that is characterized by the production of Inf-g, IL-2, and TNF, and is the type of immune response that will protect you against viruses** to **a protein vaccine that is linked to a region of DNA with a specific molecular signature** through the production of **another protein that wakes the immune system up**.\n\nYou can see that without the jargon, I am saying~~\"this white blood cell makes a protein that helps another type of white blood cell respond to a specific type of vaccine in a way that would make the vaccine effective\".  This explanation would be fine for a lay person, but if I want to communicate the actual identity of the cell and proteins, I have to use jargon to do so.",

What type of white blood cell?  I can sit around for three days and argue with you about classifying different types of white blood cells.  There have been fist fights and multi-million dollar grants thrown around over how to define white blood cells. The first unpackaged sentence is how I might explain it to an upper level undergraduate who is starting to read primary literature (so, teaching someone who knows jargon the next level of jargon).  The original sentence very succinctly summarizes a ton of detailed information with little ambiguity.  All of the things I've bolded in that sentence refer to very, very specific things, and the level of specificity this sentence conveys is absolutely the type of detail that experts need to communicate to one another.\n",

      "text": "I work in computational biology, so related field, and I completely agree that a lot of papers are really unapproachable to people without a strong background in the field. However, I think this both is and isn't a problem. Its a combination of factors:\n\n1. First, research is complicated and ideally a paper should be precise and detailed enough that you can reproduce the analysis gives enough detail that you can reproduce the analyses performed. This means that there's a lot of information that isn't important for gaining a broad conceptual understanding, but scientifically its important.\n\n2. Second, and relatedly, papers are written to a particular audience of experts, so a certain breadth of knowledge is assumed, which often makes papers seem jargony. Obviously, to the extent that you can, you want to avoid this, give the required background in the text itself and define any \"jargony\" language. However, its also unavoidable to some extent. There's the Carl Sagan quote that comes to mind: \u201cIf you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe\u201d. We can't walk you through the full background and scientific history of the field, at some point, we cut it off and assume you know it. \n\n3. Finally though, a lot of people either (a) are bad writers or (b) do not put the required time/effort in to make their papers accessible. There are papers out there that take really complicated concepts and explain them in a way that is really beautiful and intuitive without dumbing them down. There are also papers that take the simplest concepts and present them so poorly that it takes hours to tease apart that they're doing something really simple.\n\nI'll end with good news for you:\n\n1. Reading papers becomes a lot easier as you read more papers. You start to gain the necessary background and see connections between papers that you read. \n2. Writing good papers that appropriately balance technical detail and intuition is hard but its absolutely learnable if you value it (which it sounds like you do). Importantly though, I think its something that's rewarded in academia. Yes, there are a lot of bad papers out there, but in my experience, the people that get the most citations, the most hype about their work, etc. are the people that are doing great work *and* present it in a way that is understandable.

It\u2019s not your imagination; there\u2019s a lot of bad writing out there, whether on purpose or not. But like people have said, the best thing you can do is practice. You\u2019ll need to learn the technical terms and the underlying assumptions in these papers. To do that, I recommend reading textbooks that explain these ideas in simple ways, or find the very old papers where the basic concepts were first established. These old papers are often much simpler and shorter simply because the technology and body of knowledge wasn\u2019t as sophisticated back then. Also, don\u2019t be scared to go to the more experienced people in your group and ask questions. I can assure you most if not all of them felt the way you do now. See if one of them can explain these concepts in a simple way. Heck, I spent something like three full meetings with my advisor just asking really stupid, basic questions about a few key papers, and he was happy to help. And as a final point, not all academic papers are dense and confusing. Once in a while you\u2019ll find something truly well written, that explains concepts clearly without simplifying them; I find those moments pretty exciting ",

There were certain areas where I struggled to concisely explain something for which a specific term exists, but said term isn't used much outside the field and the average person likely wouldn't understand it. It's so *useful* to have those terms because it encapsulates more meaning and more nuance than any of the \"synonyms\" I could come up with. As an undergraduate, I can almost guarantee that some of your difficulty with academic papers is just that you are new(ish) to some of the terminology, and I can promise that will get better with time.\n\nOn the other had, some academics are, quite frankly, jerks. I have a list of people whose papers/books/reviews I absolutely *loathe* reading because I swear, they sit down to write and consciously make the decision to phrase things in the most convoluted, impossible to understand ways, just so that they can feel superior. For some, writing papers that are difficult to understand is a form of gate-keeping: they believe their research is only for the enlightened few who are in the field, and they write with the intention of locking out others. I genuinely know academics who have expressed that they intentionally use convoluted language because it weeds out the \"unworthy.\" \n\nBut, I also have academics whose papers I love reading because they are clear and concise, they use the technical jargon to enhance their paper, not to obfuscate. I'd be willing to bet that these exist in your field as well, you just have to find them.

      "text": "There are several ways to look at academic jargon.\n\nIn its best usage, jargon is a way to get to the point extremely quickly. Without jargon, the amount of explanation would be huge. It's very compact to say, \"the greater the probability of the interaction of a neutron with a nucleus, the smaller will be the distance the neutron travels before interacting.\" To someone who does not know what a neutron or nucleus is, or what \"interaction\" means in a subatomic context, this sentence will seem like hopeless gobbledegook. But for someone with the right background, this is a very useful sentence that explains a key point very concisely. Furthermore, it allows an expert to see what is _novel_ or _interesting_ rather quickly \u2014 if every scientific paper approached its topic as if a non-expert was reading it, it would mean all would be very long and there would be huge amounts of redundancy. So this is the positive function of jargon \u2014 those technical terms are _clarifying_ to an expert.\n\nIn its worst usage, jargon is a form of a _shibboleth_ (a social means of signaling expertise) or a form of _obfuscation_ (a way of limiting understanding). Shibboleths can be useful by communities as a way of signally in-group and out-group (and this is common in expert communities of all sorts, as a way of figuring out who is worth talking to and who isn't; it is a time-saving device at best, a form of social exclusion at worse), whereas obfuscation is something of a subversion of the point of academic research (it seeks to limit analysis, not improve it \u2014 the function of doing so is presumably making the writer of such text look more informed than they really are, or preventing critique of their work). \n\nWhen academics decry jargon, they are decrying the latter. When they defend it, they are defending the former. Both are possible in all types of research, though typically the stereotype is that the former is present more in STEM and the latter more in humanities, though there are cases of both in both (for a classic example of deliberate obfuscation in a STEM field, look up the Bogdanov affair; I feel it is not really necessary to give many examples in the humanities, alas!, because they are rather common). To put it another way: if you are struggling with jargon, and you don't think it's bullshit, then it just means you aren't fully an expert yet. Learning to read all of that is part of the job of becoming an expert. It's just language and concepts; keep at it, and you'll get there. If it's bullshit, though, no amount of learning will reliably help you crack it (but you may learn how to write bullshit yourself, so there's that!).\n\nSeparately is the issue of whether the writing is good or not. Scientists have different rhetorical expectations than humanists do, for better and worse. A scientific paper for specialists is written in a specific idiom: passive voice (\"the experiment was performed,\" not \"I performed the experiment\"), de-humanized (human action by the scientists is basically written out of the story \u2014 part of the passive voice thing), deliberately terse, minimal explication, and so on. There is an interesting history as to why this became the standard idiom of scientific writing in the 20th century (this was not universally the case in the 19th century, when most scientific fields were professionalizing), but in any case it is how things are done. It adds up to the high bar of entry into a scientific field, for better or worse. And of course, some papers are better written than others, even within the standards of the discipline.",

Sure, agreed with many above posters it's important to have concise language relevant to those who use it most, but it's a trap to think you're going to continue getting funding - and more important, support for future funding - without being able to allow laypersons to have at least a very simple outline of what's being written about.",

You work your way through different parts of the paper... what were their conclusions, methods, etc.\n\nPlus on one hand, some people do not write well at all so it's hard to read what they write.  On the other, for brevity, especially in fast-moving fields, papers jump right into assuming you know everything that's going on.. the jargon, principles, current theories, etc and they don't spend any time explaining those.\n\n\nIn that same class, we had to read and present papers to the class.  We were asked to use the below format to structure the discussions:\n\n> Here's the discussion preparation format that I'd like us to use. ... Think about them long enough to have something worth writing down, and bring that in. ... You'll pick it up quickly once we go through it a couple times.\n> \n> **Terms**. Note any unknown or unclear terms while you're reading, and collect definitions for them. Copy & paste or paraphrase as you wish, aiming for clarity in this context. If there are a lot, don't worry about getting them all.\n> \n> **Summary**. Summarize the author's message in your own words, suitable for sharing with the group. A few sentences is fine.\n> \n> **Themes or subtopics**. Can you identify any themes (or other patterns) that run through the work? Or, can you split the material into a few subtopics? If this seems too obvious -- section titles or subheadings -- consider whether there is another way to break it down.\n> \n> **Connection**. Do you see any interesting relations between this material and other course materials? What about connections between this and your other areas of interest or expertise?\n> \n> This is adapted from a book called _Learning Through Discussion_ by William Fawcett Hill. I used this format in another class, and found it surprisingly helpful for facilitating things. We'll see how it works for us and modify it as necessary.\n\nI'm trying to find the \"How to Read\" my prof used and if I can find it, I'll post a link/reference here.",

      "text": "Because of two reasons:\n\n* They are not meant to be easy to read, they are meant to convey the maximum amount of (relevant) information within a restricted number of pages. So if you were to write a paper in a 8 page double column format, you would have to choose between removing content and making the paper easier to read, or maximizing the amount of (relevant) content in order to please the reviewers, who are likely to be experts and therefore not too sensitive about the ease of reading. \n\n* I only speak for my countries here (France and UK), but besides a few writing clinics for postgraduate students and early career researchers I haven't seen much in terms of \"writing education\". Academics are just expected to improve by themselves, and since the timetable of your random researcher is already going to be packed with teaching + admin work + research + supervision, it's unlikely that they'll take the time to work on their writing.\n\n\n\nA set of good practices is to read a lot, because it helps you learn the linguo and navigate future papers way faster, discuss a lot, because it helps you understand points you may have missed, and read some books about writing (I personally enjoyed Stephen Heard's [The Scientist's Guide to Writing](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10769.html) but there are probably better ones out there that specialise in your domain, like Justin Zobel's [Writing for Computer Science](https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9781447166382))",

There is some increasing pushback against this style, but it takes time to change norms. I think people sometimes want to confuse peer reviewers into accepting (or to intimidate them with impenetrable prose). \n\nLess charitably, I would say that some authors explicitly use bullshit, and unclear writing, to hide bad science. \n\nAlso: some level of jargon is unavoidable, and if you're new to a field it can make reading very slow. It will get easier in time, both as your knowledge grows, and you become better at recognising and deconstructing bullshit. \n",

It took me several months of reading an article every other day to get used to the formatting and way of speaking for articles within my field.  For my thesis I was doing interdisciplinary research and getting used to reading articles from other fields took some time.  Once you get used to the formatting, style of writing, and common jargon, reading speed and comprehension increase.  It's similar to learning to read in a foreign language (if you've never tried it, see if you can find a kid's book for ages 5-6ish in a language you think you know well and be prepared to feel ridiculous).  \n\nThe reading you're doing now is good practice and being able to talk about the article with peers gives you the opportunity to pick up on things you missed (and they get to pick up on things they missed from you).  Learning that skill now will serve you well in the long run.  It will also prepare you to write these papers in the future.\n\nRegarding being able to say things simply, in some fields that's easy, but in most fields explaining highly nebulous concepts in layman's terms is tough.  If that's something you're good at naturally, that will serve you well in writing grant applications, communicating your research to journalists, and developing public support for your research in the future, so keep practicing that as well.  And if you get good at breaking down the research of other's into easily understandable bites (while maintaining the integrity of the research) you may have a side gig as a freelance science journalist in your future because doing that well is a rare skill (which is why you see articles about scientific research frequently blowing the scope of the research out of proportion - everything's a cure for cancer or obesity).",

For an extreme example, in one work, \"Magic\" can mean magic tricks. In another work, \"Magic\" can mean actual arcane arts. Some papers may include necromancy as a Magic, while some papers don't.
