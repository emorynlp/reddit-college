  "text": "I came here a few years ago because I wanted to read about people's experiences in academia and talk about my own too, specifically in humanities. But I feel 90% of what gets posted here doesn't concern me at all because it's STEM-related. As a matter of fact that's primarily why I don't even go on /r/gradschool (also because most of people's experiences are clearly unrelatable to what academia is like in Canada).\n\nSo where else can I go? Is there another discussion board somewhere that is more used by people in humanities? \n\n\nThanks!",

All throughout the pandemic, those who I sought support and advocacy from told me that I was dealing with a personal problem. Additionally, a lot of my financial woes came from being forced to be poor from receiving the NSFGRFP. Meaning that I could never afford to save money throughout the academic pipeline, found myself in insurmountable debt to the point that at the start of my TT job, I was looking to file Bankruptcy. The pandemic hit, my university spit in my face and told me to go fuck myself, so I left -- moved all the way to the other side of the country after selling off most of my property, to begin life anew. The university only tried to get me back after they'd realized I left and moved to the other side of the country. Now, on this end, my wife has a job that pays more than she's ever made, and I'm only one step away from making nearly triple what I was earning in academia, plus sign on bonus and stocks.",

Most people, I would come to find out, either had a spouse making a decent living that could afford to support them, or they were borrowing money from their parents. For me, not coming from deep pockets and being an underrepresented minority....it just kept me poor. Then came the time I needed to leave my university to take on a post-doc on the other side of the country. Except no post-doc provide relocation assistance, so one would have to move their 6-8 year graduate school life to wherever their next stop is -- and mine happened to be on the opposite side of the country I was originally in. How did I fund that? I took my advisors advice that I would be able to afford to pay off my loans when I got the TT position, so I took out a loan. Got to my post-doc and other post-docs of color, with similar accolades and histories were going homeless. Instead of going homeless, myself, I opted to skip meals where I could and skim them off of campus events. I ended up losing 35 lbs that year. I aggressively applied for faculty positions in the hopes that my life would get better, because I was close to homelessness in my postdoc, landed a TT job, but didn't have the money to relocate. Even though relocation assistance is an institutional norm in academia, the university that hired me refused to provide it, and instead offered a two month salary advance that I had to pay back over 6 months. When I was trying to file bankruptcy, I called my former advisor to ask him why things were turning out the way they were because I was overwhelmingly successful and did everything right. His response: \"I remember when I was living out of my car, but when I finally got tenure, I knew I made it\"\n\nI was baited into a broken system that took me for every dollar I was worth, and spit me out when I didn't have any more money to give. The income I earned never afforded me the ability to pay off any of the loans I took out, so my credit score tanked, I was no longer eligible to find financial assistance elsewhere; and then the pandemic hit, and my wife lost her job.",
