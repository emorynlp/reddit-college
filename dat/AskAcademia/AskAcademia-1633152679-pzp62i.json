  "text": "I recently obtained my PhD and am applying for academic jobs.  I am personally pleased with my accomplishment, but I consider myself to be average in the field.    I am curious about whether I should apply to institutions that are probably looking for more elite candidates.   Should I just take my best shot and apply to them all or skip ones for which I think I'm not likely to be competitive?   I've put this question to a few friends and they are split.   Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks  \n\n\nEdit: it seems the consensus advice is to apply for any position regardless of institution, provided I do meet the qualifications as listed, with some priority towards those I perceive as most likely that I would be successful.   I appreciate everyone's comments, you have all been very helpful.",

You can't apply for every job on the planet, so you'll have to do some optimisation no matter what.\n\nI'd suggest looking at the CVs of the recent hires in the departments you're applying to.  If, for example, every recent hire has had postdoc experience and a solid track record of funding and you don't, then it makes sense to put that place lower on your priority list.  However, if they're looking for a very particular expertise which matches yours very well, or if your proposed research program is an excellent fit with the existing specialities of the department, then go for it regardless.",

Also it\u2019s fair to note I teach at a liberal arts college. We need to be more MacGyver like.)",

As a general rule of thumb, go ahead and apply for positions you want but do not think you're competitive for (unless you clearly do not meet the qualifications, e.g., they're looking for an associate or full professor). Sometimes, people have received offers for positions they did not believe they were likely to be competitive for.\n\n2. Recognizing which positions you are more or less competitive for, spend more time on the applications for positions you are competitive for. Don't spend hours working on details to tailor your application for a position that is a long shot if you can spend that time on applying for positions that you are more likely to be offered.\n\n3. If you are overwhelmed and need to cut out applications, cut out the ones that you believe you are less competitive for.\n\nGood luck with your applications!",
