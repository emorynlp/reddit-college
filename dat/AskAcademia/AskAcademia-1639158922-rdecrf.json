  "text": "I'm trying to get a sense of how much it costs to have freelance copy-editing done for articles. I have already done some research and found lots of information about rates and ranges, but I'd like to round this out with some anecdotes of *prices actually paid* by either authors or copy-editors.\n\nIf you're willing, feel free to mention discipline and currency with your answer.\n\nEdit: I'm helping an academic unit develop a budget for copy-editing. I'm not actually looking to hire anyone myself.",

USD.\n\nI'm an academic myself and former journalist/copy rim chief, with a specialty in science journalism, so well versed in reading scientific papers if they're in the life sciences. Physical sciences, I'm less experienced with.\n\nSocial sciences and humanities are no problem, as long as there's not a lot of statistics to work through. I'm not going to check your stats or math for you.",

That's going to cost you. Many thousands. \n\nSomething where you are a pretty proficient writer but just need another pair of eyes? Not that much.",

              "text": "A 20 page article is about 5000 words. That comes to about $200. Longer articles cost more. Certain disciplines cost more. Non-native English costs more.\n\nAnd this is copyediting. I suspect any department funding article-level editing is actually looking to hire for line or developmental editing, which runs at least 50% more than copyediting. These kinds of editing would be more likely to take place before submitting an article (getting it ready to go out for submission). Copyediting is most often done after the piece is accepted and as it is ready to go to layout.",
