  "title:": "Confused about referee professor's response after I asked for recommendation letter- can he write sth negative?",
  "text": "Hi, \nI asked one of my professors to write me a recommendation letter for my dream graduate school. He said he'd be glad to write the letter but that he \"hopes the letters are to be submitted online, doesn't feel comfortable sending me a copy\". \n\nI'm a bit confused here because I never asked for a copy in the first place. I worked on my undergrad thesis with him, and at that time I once had to cancel a 1-1 meeting with him because of unavoidable circumstances. He was very mad about it, following which I apologized multiple times. Also, he seems to have a negative impression about people from my country. However, I have good grades from his courses and have not done anything serious during my time as a student. \n\nShould I go forward and send his recommendation letter to my dream uni? (He needs to submit it directly to the university online). I'm concerned that he might wrote sth negative because of the aforementioned, but at the end of the day, I worked on my thesis under his supervision, which could be a factor for grad school application. Pls help :)",

This person may reveive a lot of requests and busy and is just covering their bases. If you do go forward, just say something like: Absolutely, I understand. Here is the link to send the letter directly to the uni.",

      "text": "Here's my impression:\n1) The moody important recommendation letters are the ones from people who worked with you. You said you worked with him for your undergrad thesis, was he your supervisor? If not, which type did he had? Is he was your supervisor, it would be quite weird not to have a recommendation letter from him, and i believe it would impact you negatively, if not... Well, it depends on a lot of factor, i.e. how much you worked with him, etc... As a rule of thumb, a recommendation letter that says \"i worked with op, they are really good\" is worth much more than a letter that says \"op attended to my class, they are very smart\", but, of course, it would depend on what your professor would actually write in the letter...\n2) regarding the comment about the copy of the letter: it's definitely weird, but not necessary so suspicious. Indeed, many years ago it was quite common to send the letters via ordinary mail, so if the professor is old he could be refer to that (or he could be cover all his bases, as someone else mentioned). This said, it is still a pretty weird comment, and I'm not able to tell you if he meant something more with that, i just wanted to point out that there are other possible explanations (how likely they are, that's a completely different matter...)",
