  "text": "With Brexit causing us EU students to be pushed into Int'l category, I am asking what y'all's experiences are like for future planning.\n\nI'm currently planning on a crossroad.\n\nAfter getting my PhysChem/AnalChem MSc, go for:\n\nA) Industry in UK  \nB) PhD (Physchem/Theoretical/Computation chem) in UK  \nC) Industry in Republic of Ireland  \nD) PhD in RoI  \n\nMain reason for wanting to move to UK is due to knowing people there already to help with living space/rooming. Ireland OTOH is for going to a place with EU immigration laws and English as the local language (am Hungarian). Ireland though has no living space arrangements/contacts.\n\nI'm wondering if the resolved living space in UK might compensate for internationals getting lower funding and stuff.",

      "text": "If your position is funded, then it's the same as for a local student.\n\nIf it's not funded, then you have to find a way to scrape together probably \u00a31000 a month as an absolute minimum depending on location. As a general rule in STEM you shouldn't take an unfunded PhD: if there's no funding to pay a PhD student, there are probably not many career prospects inside or outside academia on the other end of it, and you will not have access to materials, equipment, computer time during your PhD.\n\nIf you're not eligible for any funding schemes in your discipline (many are only open to local students) then you should look at doing a PhD in another country that does provide full access for international students.\n\nIt's not uncommon for PhD students to not speak the local language at the beginning and have to learn. English is the working language almost automatically for masters and post-masters academia in many countries\n\np.s. look on [findaphd.com](https://findaphd.com) for specific opportunities in your field even if you're not applying yet, just to get a lay of the land and see what opportunities there are.",
