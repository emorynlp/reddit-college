  "title:": "Handling Mental Health with a Professor",
  "text": "Hello!\nI\u2019m currently a first year PhD student. This semester has been pretty rough for reasons unrelated to my program. I have a chronic illness that flared halfway through, and I am in the process of distancing from my family. My professors have been very supportive, and were flexible when I had to go to the hospital, but currently everything is mentally catching up and I am in the midst of a mental health crisis only a few days before a final presentation. Does anyone have any experience navigating something like this with their professors without seeming like I\u2019m intentionally missing assignments? Thank you in advance, and stay well.",

      "text": "If you haven't already made contact with the disabled students department at your university, do so. They can arrange for assessments and permanent accomodations to be put in place but this can take months! \n\nHowever, They may be able to assist you in getting an extension (or other accomodation) at short notice.\n\nSpeak to your professors again as well, the sooner the better. I know it's going to be hard to ask again (have my own MH issues and have been through the mill with less understanding teaching staff) but it's much better to make the attempt than to bury your head in the sand.\n\nGood luck.",

      "text": "I'd always say, I'm not a mental health expert, nor your therapist, friend or family member. I try to be supportive but I'm not thr best person to speak to about your mental health specifically but rather how to mitigate the impact it is having on your work. There also may be formal processes you need to go through with the student support office (or whatever it is called at your institution) in order to make use of things like extensions or leaves of absence. That said, it is worth talking to your professor but bear in mind that telling them everything is neither necessary nor necessarily appropriate.",

I will definitely be vague when describing things in the future. \n\nAlso, your writing style is incredible and you should know.",
