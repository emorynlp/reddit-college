  "title:": "The fragility of academia and when to jump ship",
  "text": "Currently finishing up a phD in theoretical physics in Australia (in photonics). After covid happened, hundreds upon hundreds of professors and lecturers in STEM got fired from their jobs here. The reduction in positions for research fellows or postdoctoral researchers in physics and math went down by over 50%. My supervisors won't be here after I am done, they are in fact moving overseas this year. The professors I had originally envisioned working with in areas such as electromagnetic engineering, data science for astronomy or photonics got fired recently and are unemployed.\n\nWhat this pandemic has shown me is the fragility of academia. How people who have worked for decades in a field, mastering everything about it, publishing dozens of papers, teaching and coordinating subjects and supervising student projects basically mean nothing to the academic institution unless they are bringing a lot of money. \n\nIt feels really disappointing to have gone down this career path. Physics has no future in Australia. And given my personal circumstances, the only country I could move to is Japan but finding a job there in academia is extremely hard especially when you don't speak the language.\n\nAfter working 60+ hours a week in my phD for the last 3 years, including weekends and public holidays , for literally no reward (my degree is as useless), I have come to the conclusion that I don't have a future in academia. \n\nHaving said that, I would like to know if anyone here switched to industry after their phD, and how it went for you? It's very hard to sell what I have done, so I am thinking of applying for jobs in maybe finance (quantitative) or telecomm (no idea what) but I honestly don't know where to start. Do I need to go for entry-level?",

So my experience may only be tangentially helpful to you. I shifted over to an entry-level healthcare IT position, but I also got one job offer in consulting and one in the medical device field out of the ~6-8 or so job applications I sent out. \n\nHaving actually attained your PhD, you should be in a much better position than I was. I know people who left my lab after competing their PhD who got jobs in the aerospace industry (obviously an industry that's been hit hard by Covid), consulting, defense (lots of lasers and photonics work there), and even in FinTech. Some people obviously went into biotech. Obviously an exceptional case and this was back in ~late 2018, but one person from my lab got a job at Goldman Sachs with 180k starting salary after her PhD. Practically speaking, depending on how much programming experience you have or how quickly you can pick it up with (presumably) a strong math background, you should definitely have a path in the finance realm even when competing against people who have direct experience in the industry.\n\nEdit: We do have a fair number of people with PhDs working at my company, but they mostly started as entry level software developer positions, just with a ~10-15k increase in starting salary compared to fresh CS grads in the same position.",

Similar things can happen in industry, for example when a company gets taken over and they close sites/fire people. I would even argue it\u2019s much more likely in industry than in academia.\n\nWhy is Japan your only possibility?

Use these strengths to your advantage. The comments/suggestions about \"non traditional\" jobs for PhDs in Physics are excellent suggestions. I'm not familiar with your exact field so I'm not sure why Japan is your only option, but surely your skills could be utilized in the US, especially in the physics-heavy California or New England.\n\nAlthough I agree theoretical physics is a very difficult field, it is definitely not one of great importance in modern times, especially when you compare it to things like AI, machine learning, data science, health, biotechnology, computer vision, and others. This is self-evident from the lack of positions globally that are specifically in the area of \"theoretical physics\". \n\n>I'm only in my second year as an independent academic, so I'm still very fresh \"to the way things are\" in academia. My advice, is that unless you're willing to continue the 50-60 hour work weeks, then academia isn't for you. Don't get me wrong, I love my job, but the perceived \"prestige\" of academia is wildly overblown. You still have all the intraresearch group drama/bullshit but now it's *your* responsibility. Pay is not as great as most industry jobs. Grant writing is a nightmare. You still don't get a lot of your weekends just like graduate school. I recommend to my students that you should pursue academia only if the most important thing to you is carrying out your own ideas and learning new things, regardless of the pay and bullshit.\n\nI agree with the advice, I honestly don't feel any excitement from publishing research or conducting it, so I feel my life will be miserable if I try to force myself into it forever.",

You can also ask about experiences on r/LeavingAcademia.  \n\nIn Germany the recently was a survey of \"pre-docs\" and postdocs that I found rather interesting. About half of the people who did not yet have a PhD already planned to leave academia. This number was lower in postdocs which makes sense to me since a lot of people who intended to leave obviously did so after finishing as doing a postdoc usually doesn't bring any benefit towards industry and might even harm your chances.\n\nI personally finished my PhD in Neuroscience in March and started my industry job last week.  \nWhat really gave me the motivation was finding a job offer that would be perfect for my background and interests. Before that it felt like I need to settle for something and would have to make sacrifices, like not working in a field that actually interests me. So my advice would be to just start looking at job offers. Check out what they offer and what they are looking for. With a bit of luck you too will find a job you'll be excited to start at, which makes the transition out a lot smoother since you'll not easily get over the feeling of giving something up.\n\nI now took a permanent position and I must say, being able to actually make plans for the future because I finally know where I'll be for the next years felt great. Like, if my husband and I now would want to buy a house we could do that because we know that we'll work here.

An employer will see your experience and know that you are smart and capable of solving complicated problems. They might need to be convinced of other things, depending on what jobs you are looking for. E.g.\n\n* That you can communicate and work well with non-technical people,\n* That you are able to work collaboratively, and\n* That you can complete projects with short turn-around times (i.e. weeks, not years).",

I have never seen one that claims their university is adequately funded or resourced. \n\nBefore jumping into another field, investigate what about it is important to you.

But if you know all those diff eqs, the stochastic processes, and wave guides, you can apply those to other problems in industry for sure.  If you were in US I would tell you to look at Navy jobs.   Make a linkedin profile ( I did it like a month ago and had 5 pretty substantial job offers ).",

Things only get worse for postdocs and assistant professors.\n\nThey have to look for grants all the time, and then making the impossible to abide by its productivity requirements. Academia takes so much of your time, as you mentioned. For, I'm sorry to say, peanuts.\n\nLooking for jobs, I saw there is opportunities for PhDs in the industry here in Europe (BTW, maybe look for positions around here). Where I'll work 36 - 40h a week, make more money and actually contribute to society.\n\nWorking as a Quant in finance will make you a lot of money, with less worked hours and better mental health. I say go for it.\n\nEdit : typos",
