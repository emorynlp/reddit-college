Developing mental illness in a culture that praises unhealthy levels of work. Screw those people. That last sentence is what you need to consider. Many in academia have a problem. They sacrifice their health, relationships, and wellbeing for their job and expect others to do the same, especially grad students. The question is, do you want to be a part of that? It is NOT normal and it is NOT healthy. Set boundaries on your time. Give tactful honest feedback the best you can to those supporting you about your struggle. If that doesn't work... get the hell away from those workaholics before they put you in an early grave.",

You feel challenged and hurt and so you\u2019ve made an incredibly  judgemental and adversarial characterization of *other people\u2019s* priorities.\n\nSome people are deeply passionate about their subjects and research \u2014 and we *want* to devote our lives to it.  We *enjoy* spending our time thinking about it.  It is challenging \u2014 so is being an ultramarathoner or an explorer.  But it is only *unhealthy* if it\u2019s not compatible with your own wants & beliefs.  \n\nIt is absolutely true that (high level) academia is is dominated by people that dedicate the majority of their person to their work.  By people who are *deeply* passionate about discovery and feel privileged to push back the veil of ignorance even a little bit.\n\nThis makes it a very difficult space to navigate for people that *like* science/other knowledge disciplines but don\u2019t feel a deep, fundamental calling to it.  Much like being an uncertain crew member on a ship of explorers who left their home lands and threw themselves into a lifetime of challenge in exchange for new horizons. \n\nScience isn\u2019t a 9-5 (at high levels).  The number of people who are deeply passionate about it relative to the amount of funding it gets means that it\u2019s almost all dedicated explorers \u2014 willing to leave their homeland and venture.\n\nIt *is* a problem that there isn\u2019t the funding to expand so that many more people of more moderate passion can have 9-5 jobs in science. (Though those certainly exist.). I think the world would benefit from more resources in science and more ways of people professionally engaging with it, certainly!\n\nBut please, for your own sake, health, and perspective: don\u2019t confuse something not being what you want or requiring unhealthy behavior from *you* with being \u201cunhealthy\u201d in some objective fashion.  You\u2019re implicitly saying what others *should* want or *should have* in their lives.  And that\u2019s deeply prejudiced and destructive to diverse society.  And a spit in the eye of people who dedicate their lives to benefitting all of us.\n\nI sympathize very sincerely\u2014 funding in academia is paltry relative to its contributions and this makes it hard to find positions for people that want to balance science as a job and more traditional home lives, for example.  But don\u2019t turn that ire toward the people that work hardest and care most.  It\u2019s not fair to them or you.\n\n_____\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth (just as perspective) a similar situation exists in for example professional dance (ballet in particular) and many professional arts that are underfunded.  And you will hear aspirants in these areas sometimes say that the culture forces  people to work too hard.  But this is largely **backward**.  The people who exist in the small space allotted for professional ballet, for example, are the ones who\u2019s  passion and work ethic mean they would put that much effort in largely regardless of culture.  They care deeply about their art and honing it to perfection.  The problem for the others is that there is so little funding that only dancers of that sort are able to persist.  It\u2019s not the culture that is a problem it is the resources available to the discipline.",

(https://www.webmd.com/men/news/20050817/illness-injury-tied-to-long-work-hours) There is currently a significant mental health crisis for graduate students (https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/11/anxiety-depression-mental-health-graduate-school/576769/). Something about the way the system works in the USA does this to a significant number of people. Just because you had a good experience, does not mean it subverts the data. Do not accuse people who struggle with the hours to be people without deep passion. It's a strawman and a \"not a true Scotsmen\" fallacy. Objectively there is a problem in academia and funding is only one facet of how it can be fixed. Too much load is put on graduate students all over the place as a source of cheap labor. To the point where some feel they are under duress because if they say no or cant get the work done without an unreasonable level of sacrifice, they wont be able to continue in graduate school or be able to get a recommendation or job afterwards. These are real, objective problems in academia and no amount of telling people that you really have to want it or be passionate about it is going to fix that. Be realistic. That mentality feeds directly into imposter syndrome.\n\nEdited to include some source material.",

The school itself also shouldn\u2019t matter too much as long as they offer the direction that you are interested in. Your advisor matters a bit more. There are few grad students who are overly happy with their advisor the entire time. It is important though that you can respect them and that you have a somewhat functional relationship. A PhD is a struggle but it should be the right kind of struggle. If you do not at all care about the research that you are doing (aside from the covid blues) then it may be time to explore different options. There are no wrong decisions per se, only decisions that inform you to go a different route going forward.",

I was sold on academia because I was told it would offer more flexibility and a better work/life balance, etc., but that information was incorrect.\n\nI work more now than I did at my previous job, and for less money. The work day expands to 12-15 hours sometimes by no fault of my own. Service work and committee work thrown at you at the last minute interferes with family time or other plans. I have always had to take my laptop with me to do work while on family vacations.\n\nWe are increasingly made to feel as if we should be available to students 24/7 as if we are medical doctors on call, and that every student email is of utmost importance. I never feel relaxed. I have many colleagues who are very anxiety-ridden, depressed, etc. I suspect my ability to appear calm and composed will manifest in a heart attack or stroke one day.\n\nOn top of that, universities--or individual departments--keep changing promotion and tenure expectations to make things more and more challenging and difficult.  You cannot assume that the conditions you were hired under will remain that way.  I did not go with an R1 out of grad school because I wanted less intense publishing requirements because I had kids, but the department changed publishing expectations right after I receive tenure and now we are pressured to publish like an R1 even though we don't have grad students, we teach a 4:3, and we get paid far less.\n\nIf I had realized that a university or department could suddenly decide to try to change its identity in this manner I would have gone with the R1 offer.  It was a stupid mistake on my part. Now I teach during the summer to make up for my lower salary, in addition to doing course design work as a consultant--and doing research, of course.\n\nIf I had it to do all over again I would not have gone into academia at all. There are way, way too many people who get to have a say in your career path, expectations, etc. Every job has its negative aspects, but academia is a field where everything is always up in the air and very little of it makes sense.\n\nAcademia is the only place I know of in which no one has to be qualified based upon their degree and experience to lead anything--it's just whether the dean or provost like you.\n\nImagine that a French professor is in charge of reviewing every department's assessment and evaluation plan, yet the French teacher has never conducted an evaluation of anything in his life because he writes French literature.  People with biology degrees will argue with political scientists about how to draft and analyze policy.  English professors will be chosen to lead social justice initiatives over the faculty who teach social justice in the curriculum. None of it makes any sense.\n\nDamn it, now I'm depressed.",

      "text": "The first ever mistake was doing a PhD while my college friends are earning 6 figures and buying homes. \n\nDuring PhD, working 45 hours a week, including weekends is how we will improve humanity and save the world from stupidity and impending danger of global health crisis. Your sleepless night is every bit worth of someone else life and death. It's a total bullcrap loaded unto young aspiring graduates by those tenured PIs who own 2 or more houses, one for summer vacation, each with more than 4 bedrooms. Their monthly mortgage necessitates them to keep lying the prospect of the academia while recruiting more and more youth to pay off their mortgage debt. \n\nDuring postdoc, you're on your own. Your career entirely depends on a thinly stretched one year postdoc contract unless you secure 3-4 years fellowship. Everything you do must produce something. Now that you're a postdoc, everything you touch should become gold. That's what postdoc PI wants. But the reality is everything you touch, you need more study and more expertise to continue the project. Postdoc PI won't help you. All they do is regurgitate every bit of old memories and yet expect you to come up with a grandiose idea of making the project work. Of course, they also own 2 or more houses, one of their houses at least cost $1 million and they only come to the lab by driving while you yourself rely on your old chap 4 L 1998 Ford motor and hope it will last until you finish your golden years of postdocing.",

      "text": "Being in a subpar program does not mean you have to be a subpar academic. In my program mentorship was sort of ....rare. Many of the profs were outright abusive. Not very many people finished, and of those that did, most still adjunct at the University. \n\nThe people that were successful mentored each other. They went with one another to conferences, teamed up on research, found outside mentors from other programs, and didn't let their professors' problems get in their way. \n\nThat's hard to do alone, but it's not AS impossible in a little group of like minded students. \n\nI don't know what your specific situation is, or what your goals are, but you can definitely overcome other people's failures if you need to.",
