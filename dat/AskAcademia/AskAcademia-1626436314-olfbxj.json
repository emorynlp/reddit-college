  "title:": "How do people find out/search for post doc positions?",
  "text": "As per title, I'm in STEM, finishing a PhD working in electrochemistry. \n\nJust how do people find out about post doc positions in othe laboratories/countries? I only personally know very few groups in my own country, but I would prefer to try and do a post doc in another country, both for the experience of going abroad, knowing a need lab/work environment, network, etc. \n\nWith this in mind, just how do people know when/where these opportunities are known? I don't know anyone in a foreign group so I have no friends to ask for. For EU countries I know about the erasmus mundus program, but that doesn't include all of their universities. For north america and asian countries, I have no idea really. My best idea so far, besides posting this question here, was to search on twitter to see which authors/groups (that I know by name, from reading their work) are present, and if they have posted a message about there being a post doc position available.",

      "text": "Speaking for the US, many faculty have a lab website where they will have an \"opportunities\" section or something similar where they list whether they are currently accepting applications for undergrad/grad/postdoc researchers. Of course this requires being familiar with some names in your field so you know where to look. Hopefully this is also something you can ask your PhD advisor about, and/or your university has a career resources center for grad students?",

My uni has nothing similar to a career resources center for grad students (my country has a lot of problems concerning the \"usefulness\" or \"validity\" of pursuing MSc or Phd), but I will try to talk with my PhD. I have never looked for group website of the US-based groups whose research I'm interested in, but I will keep note of this and then I will dedicate a day or two to search on this",

              "text": "Interesting - in the US the humanities/social sciences fields have that stigma sometimes but usually not with STEM fields. My only advice when reading lab websites is to actually read up on the research and individually tailor your email to the professor if you reach out. We get a ton of emails from foreign students who are clearly just spamming every US faculty email address they can find looking for a research position. Everyone I know just ignores and deletes the emails. I'm a lecturer and don't even have my own research lab - I still get the emails because my address is on the department website - but clearly someone who did their homework would know not to bother contacting me. Point being, make sure you read up about the individual lab's research and write a custom application/cover letter, don't just copy/paste a generic line about wanting to do research in their lab.",
