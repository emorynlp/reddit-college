  "title:": "\"Nobody reads dissertations after the defense\" - is this still broadly true?",
  "text": "I remember hearing that dissertations are rarely read after the defense even before going to graduate school and, baring some field specific exceptions (e.g., mathematics), continued to hear the same thing. However, since finishing my dissertation I've noticed that the metrics from the library and sites like Research Gate seem to demonstrate the opposite - people are reading the dissertation as well as others that I know. Hundreds to thousands of views and downloads doesn't seem to be that uncommon.\n\nIs it time to retire the presumption that nobody will read the dissertation after the defense, or is something else going on that's tricking the stats? Off hand I would presume that digital archiving has actually make it easier to retrieve a dissertation  so we might be in an era were people actually read the things.",

I review humanities book proposals for academic publishers sometimes and many of them are obviously dissertations because the intro is a huge lit review/theory piece intended for their committee. Not the sort of thing a general reader ever wants to read. Smart authors will revise/eliminate those before sending in a mss for review. But if you have a good committee that is open to you writing a *book*, rather than a formulaic dissertation, there may be much less revision to do.",

I have been told by editors that they want a book that is at least 60% new material, especially now that dissertations are published on open-access databases\n\nI'm a humanities scholar and my diss was published as a book. It was attractive enough that I had several editors interested based on conference papers, and had an oral agreement with an acquisitions editor to give her press the first chance to review once it was done. None of those presses-- all university presses in the US --were at all concerned about the origins of the book as a dissertation, in part because it was *conceived* as one from the start. Ultimately I probably retained about 2/3 of the original mss verbatim for the book, and most of what changed were additions written in response to the blind reviews and the additional time I had to access archives once I had a real job.\n\nGenerally speaking what I've often heard from editors is that they really don't want to see more than one chapter in a book published as a stand-alone article these days, so that 60% figure is quite low based on my experience. Over time I've personally just looked at projects as either books or articles; if there's enough for a book then I won't publish *any* of it elsewhere. But I have the luxury of being a tenured full professor so I can work on something for several years without suffering any consequences of not turning out smaller pieces all the time.",
