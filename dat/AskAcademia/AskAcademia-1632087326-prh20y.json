  "title:": "Notice period for lecturer interview (UK)",
  "text": "Hi folks,\n\nI just got an interview invitation from a college I applied to. The interview will be in the next 5 days, such a short time for preparation though. I'm supposed to prepare teaching session, assessment and the formal interview on a same day.\n\nIs it normal to have a short notice for lecturer interview? Mine is based in the UK. I have interviews for postdoc before and they usually gave me about 2-3 weeks to prepare. \n\nBy the way, anyone is on the hunt for a postdoc/lecturer job now? Could you share your journey in looking for an academic job?\n\nCheers.",

All my UK interviews (similar arrangement - presentation, teaching session and fit so interview on sane day) have had very short prep times. The longest amount of prep time I had was a week, the shortest 2 days!",

I prepare for the interview part (in case I get through the teaching task), but I have never taught in front of a panel before. Should I spent sometime to introduce myself and my background or jump right into the lesson?",

              "text": "I would say it depends on what they\u2019re asking you to do (feel free to DM me) \u2026 if it\u2019s a specific topic, I would generally dive right in\u2026 I would include things that demonstrate how innovative you are with your teaching (eg an activity). Another option is to talk through your lesson (like I said, it depends on what they\u2019re looking for) \u2026 in these cases, I\u2019d talk a little about your background and explain why that\u2019s relevant before going through and explaining your lesson structure",

      "text": "When I was a chair we'd usually set up interviews for 2-3 weeks following. But, if we interviewed the top 3 and just weren't quite ready to offer a position to one of them, we'd interview #4. That interview would typically be scheduled for a very short time to allow the process to be finalized. Perhaps that's the issue here.",
