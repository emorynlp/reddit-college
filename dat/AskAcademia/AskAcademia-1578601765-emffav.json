  "text": "For background, I'm in engineering.\n\nI'm looking for advice because I really want to be a professor at a smaller teaching university (with less emphasis on research), but I have 2.5 years left in my PhD program and I hate doing research.  \n\nI have had teaching and advising roles (teaching assistant, recitation instructor, tutor, academic mentor, grader, graduate student instructor) for 5 years and I've enjoyed all of it.  Teaching and advising are definitely what I'm passionate about.  And I'm pretty good at it, too.\n\nIt's not that I don't like my research topic, I just don't like being a researcher.  I have tried to motivate myself with the mindset of \"suffering for 5 years so I can have my dream job for the next 40\" but it's been getting harder and harder to motivate myself to do the work and I've gotten to the point that I'm behind where I should be in terms of my progress.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this?  What did you do?",

Defining \"excellence\" in the context of tenure is basically the whole game - it's a peer review system of peers from your institution. It's sometimes very carefully clarified (\"Two publications a year in a peer reviewed journal\"), or sometimes there is a list of \"acceptable forms of evidence\". Sometimes it includes grant writing, or advising students, or conference attendance. Basically, other members of the faculty have a sense of what \"excellence\" is, and they should be communicating that to you, either informally (conversations at the bar) or formally (annual reviews).",

      "text": "Hey, I had the same feelings as you, and got a tenure-track job at a teaching-focused university this year! I was surprised by how many faculty jobs are out there that are primarily teaching, but it makes sense if you think about it -- most universities (at least in the US) are not PhD-granting institutions, and thus by definition are going to be more focused toward undergraduate teaching. I'm not in engineering, but many disciplines have job post aggregator websites -- definitely ask your advisors if your field has something similar and start scouring job ads! Any ad that mentions higher course loads (3+ courses per semester) is likely going to be a teaching-focused job with lower research expectations.\n\nStrangely, most of the internet advice for applying for teaching jobs is focused on the humanities, but I found that it was general enough to be pretty applicable to my situation (I'm in the social sciences though, so still quite different from engineering). For example, Karen Kelsky's blog The Professor Is In has tons of great advice about applying for these kinds of jobs ([here's an example post about teaching statements](https://theprofessorisin.com/2016/09/12/thedreadedteachingstatement/)).\n\nFeel free to PM me if you want to talk more!",

NCSSM, SCGSSM, MSSM, and IMSA are the ones I'm most familiar with, but there was 27 the late time I heard the stat. I went to one and all teachers had to have at least a masters degree in their discipline or a bachelors in their discipline and a masters in education, but half of our faculty had PhDs. Engineering was a required course; there's a robotics lab (and team) and a fabrication lab; and there was massive latitude for academic creativity with labs, assignments, and tests, especially outside of the AP courses.\n\nThe one I went to was truly a magical place and most people who got jobs there stay until they retire because your classes are filled with super smart kids who are thirsty for knowledge because they were plucked from high schools that they had academically outgrown. And it's a boarding school, so if there are discipline problems (very rare in classes), you can ground them as punishment!!!",

I've spent my career in an SLAC and 2/3 of my load (sometimes 100%) are upper-division courses in my specialty or research seminars, which I really love teaching. But I don't particularly like teaching the 100-level intro classes, so have always assumed I wouldn't have liked a CC position.  I've developed and taught over two dozen different courses over the last \\~20 years as well, while most of my friends at CCs teach the same four courses each semester.  Do you have much variation?\n\nNot a critique, just wondering about the differences and if OP is aware of them.",

There are also honors versions of several that allow for a change of pace through additional readings, scholarly research, presentations, etc. I\u2019ve also created online versions of existing courses, which are their own challenge and involve significant, novel work. On top of this, I have a second new course in the works, with plans to also develop a certificate program for a career that doesn\u2019t require a 4-year degree.

I like creating new courses and while I have a few (two, really) that I've taught almost every year of the last 25, I've done many one-offs and others that have been connected to a short-term collaboration, or grant, or honors, or learning community, or whatever and I've really enjoyed that.  We do, as you suggest, also have people who literally teach the same courses every semester forever...all in STEM and really a mix of burnouts and people who are simply really good at teaching pre-med courses (in particular).\n\nWhat I think I'd miss at a CC though would be teaching senior research courses. Every year I supervise a range of thesis projects and it's such a delight (usually, with most of them) to see students I've worked with for four years turn out series scholarship that will springboard them into graduate school or an entry-level professional position. But of course my friends at CCs have similar stories about their students, so I'm sure see progress is always welcome at whatever level.",

They are so intimidated at first, but by the end of the semester their sense of accomplishment is huge and they realize that  perhaps scientific research really is something they can do (and should consider)! (I\u2019ve had numerous students win awards for their presentations at local and regional conferences, which is also pretty cool!)\n\nAnd while I don\u2019t get to work with seniors just before heading off to graduate school, professional school, or a career, I do get to work with them on transferring, often to extremely competitive schools.

They would have done posters at least once as sophomores, but those were group projects so this is usually the first time they've done a full lit review and a poster on their own. It's fun to see for sure. \n\nI also teach our freshman seminar quite often, so get the first years in the fall gen ed program. They grow so much by the send year it's often like they are different people. My oldest kid is now a freshman in college (2,000 miles away though) so for the first time in the 25+ years I've been teaching college students it's begun to parallel my own offspring, which has also been interesting.\n\nI'm working on my syllabi today as classes resume Monday.

                                  "text": "> My courses have no college-level Reading or Writing pre-req., although they are real college credits, yet they are state-assessed for writing and critical thinking. A class of up to 37 students, any number of whom may not be able to read or write [English -- don't forget the high population of international students!] at a high school level, with required writing assignments and no TA, is some bullshit.\n\nYeah, that sounds incredibly challenging. I've been fortunate (or so it seems in retrospect) to spend my career at selective liberal arts colleges, so with a few exceptions (mostly Chinese international students) I've always had students with strong ACT/SAT scores who were college ready. We aren't equipped for remedial education at all in fact, so can't admit students who need it...they wouldn't make it through the first semester. I had different experiences adjuncting/VAP in the 1990s at big public institutions though, where the range of abilities/preparation was much wider. Also taught a few classes of 150+ entirely on my own, which I would never want to do again as that much grading is overwhelming. That said, the other end of the class size spectrum can also be a burden...I had a class last fall with only 15 students but they each wrote 20 page papers (three drafts to read) and there were ~15 other graded assignments, so the net volume was fairly high page-wise.\n\nThe many different models for higher ed in the US are interesting. I have colleagues/friends at pretty much every type and am always interested in hearing about people's experiences. A few years ago I spent the summer in an NEH workshop that brought in faculty from all over the US, from CCs and public comprehensives and SLACs and Ivy R1s alike. We lived in dorms together so had a lot of free time in the evenings to compare workloads...lots of inspiring tales from every kind of school, but most of us agreed we'd rather not switch institutions with anyone else!",

      "text": "I was in the same boat as you when I graduated in 2016. Everybody I talked to where I got my PhD said I needed a post-doc to get a tenure track position. However, I attended a SLAC for my undergrad and saw them hire tenure track fresh out of grad school. The trick is that you have to be very selective about where you apply. \n\nWhen I went through the job postings I ignored any school that asked for a research statement. Honestly that narrowed the search a ton but it showed where their priorities were. I applied to a handful of tenure track postings but didn't land any. I then opened my search to visiting in the hope of just having something. I applied to a few visiting positions late in the hiring season and got an offer pretty quickly with them promising that it would open for tenure track the next year. It did and I got the position because I fit in well and knew how to teach. There is no expectation that I will publish for tenure though it is expected for full professor. I love being able to focus on teaching at the college level.\n\nHonestly the type of position you want is limited to a small number to institutions and many of that type of institutions are facing a shortage of students. Pay attention to the places you are applying to make sure they focus on teaching and if possible see if you can find anything about their financial position. There is hope but it is good to have realistic expectations. Good luck!",

I'm not in chemistry, but generally speaking my SLAC requires a book or 3-4 papers for tenure, and that again for promotion to full. On top of \"excellence\" in teaching and a heavy service load. That is about the same for all of our peers with which I'm familiar, so basically schools ranked between about 50-125 in the US News liberal arts college category. Research expectations are higher for top 50 schools but teaching loads are often lower than the 3/3 we have so it's more doable. \n\nI'm really surprised to hear *any* SLAC will give tenure with zero publications actually...our junior faculty won't even make it through third year review without a publication record.",

It was founded primarily on a degree in education and the culture has always been teaching focused. All full time faculty are teaching 4/4 with a heavy load of service too. I'm doing an independent research project with a senior this semester and I'll get a couple hundred bucks extra for the course by appointment so the system doesn't give much incentive for research.
