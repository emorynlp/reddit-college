  "text": "[Original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/8y0m22/left_off_of_author_list/)\n\nIn my last post I told a little tale of being left off of a publication recently that involved several years of my life during the beginning of my PhD. People offered a variety of perspectives and opinions about how to proceed, which was super helpful and thank you all for taking the time.\n\nHere's a quick update - The committee member who left me off of the author list reached out to me to inform me that the paper had been published. I didn't immediately respond, and instead I consulted with a few folks involved in the paper to determine if I was somehow missing something that I had done or not done and it seemed like they were more or less sympathetic and on my side. And of course, I posted on reddit, because why not get the opinion of internet strangers - most people had suggested keeping things diplomatic and investigating authorship corrections with the journal. A week or so passes before the committee member reaches out to me again to see if I want to chat (I think spurred by my primary advisor) and we end up finding each other in the hallway. We chat for about half an hour outside where I lay out my reaction and she promises it was an honest mistake and that there was absolutely no malice or politics involved. She was working as hard as I was to keep things diplomatic and to keep bridges unburned, there was a hug involved, which I appreciate, so I took what she said at face value. She apologizes and accepts blame, which is heartening except that she views the additional steps to be limited (basically, \"move on and sorry!\"). I bring up that author corrections are a thing (thanks for the suggestion AskAca!!) and she seems very doubtful, but willing to explore the possibility... the least she can do to make things up is to have my back in exploring the idea.\n\nFast-forward a month or two and she has reached out to the other lab group and the main author has taken the lead on contacting the journal to initiate a correction. Every author eventually agrees in writing and now things are 100% copacetic, I'm on the author list! So basically long story short, things turned out well after a few hard conversations. Just wanted to write a quick update and thank everyone for offering some opinions and perspectives. I'm honestly shocked and disappointed that not a single person in my department thought that author corrections were possible, so now I can tell my advisor that my reddit addiction has had a tangible positive impact on my career.
