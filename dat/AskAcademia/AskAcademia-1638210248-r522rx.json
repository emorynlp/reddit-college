  "text": "Hello,\n\nI presented at a conference two months ago. After the conference, I was invited to submit my full paper to include in an \"edited book\". I have submitted it, and it is awaiting some approval process that I assume is essentially a peer review.\n\nThis work is currently listed on my CV as a conference presentation, but the fact that since then a full paper has been written and submitted seems to merit moving it from the presentations section of my CV to the publications section.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Should I move it to the publications section?\n2. How should I characterize it? (\"Under review\"?)\n3. Should I wait until it's accepted to list the name of the publication outlet?\n\nField is psychology.",

      "text": "I list that as an \u201cinvited chapter\u201d and name the book, editors + publisher and say it is under review. It shows that you have a network, but I don\u2019t think it really counts as an article. You can keep the conference presentation on the presentation list, after all, it is a different genre! Ps: if you have work you want to be read widely, don\u2019t lock it away in a chapter. They are often more difficult to access online!",
