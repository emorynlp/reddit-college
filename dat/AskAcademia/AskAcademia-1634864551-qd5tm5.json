  "text": "Two of my fellow manager coworkers are arguing. We work in a public health org. One is defending that her two master\u2019s, MBA and MSW, are terminal degrees.\n\nThe other says no because there are higher degree levels, ie, PhD\u2019s and Doctorate\u2019s in Business, and PhD\u2019s and Doctorates's in Social Work. She also says JD is not terminal even though most say so, because there are law doctorates.  \n\nIs a terminal degree the highest degree needed to practice in your field or the highest degree available?",

      "text": "Oof, that's messy. I agree that a terminal degree is the highest degree awarded in your track, but that for many fields the academic and professional tracks should be regarded differently. In that context, indeed neither an MBA or an MSW are terminal degrees because there are DBAs and DSWs that are also practice-oriented, but a JD is terminal because there is no higher practice-oriented degree. \n\nThere's also the separate distinction of \"terminal master's\" to distinguish from a master's-in-passing awarded to doctoral candidates, which might also be where your co-worker is tripping up?",

There is not an additional licenses available only to those with a doctorate (unlike, say, psychology which has an LPC for MA level and LP for PhD/PsyD level).  I have a friend that works in a mental health setting and when they are advertising for a manager level person, they will advertise that the person should have a MD/DO (psychiatrist), PhD/PsyD (psychologist), or MSW (social worker) because they say each is the terminal degree for their field. \n\nThe social work faculty at my school have also told me that PhD in social work are really only for those that want to be professors (but there is degree creep in the field).",

      "text": "I understand the prevailing definition of terminal degree to mean the highest degree achievable in a domain. That's almost always some form of doctorate, a doctorate being a scholarly degree unlike the others.\n\nBut is it still proper to limit the definition of terminal degree to the scholarly convention? Universities and their degrees have already expanded beyond their roots in pure scholarship into the practical realm. Plus, what's even the purpose of using the term \"terminal degree\" if it's always a doctorate?\n\nDegrees like MLIS and MFA considered terminal degrees in their domain, despite there also being doctorate degrees. I think it's lazy just to write them off as exceptions, without considering whether it's the definition you're using needs revision.\n\nMy own functional definition of terminal degree is the degree with which one's education/training in the domain can be considered complete/finished such that they can be considered an expert (which doesn't necessarily qualify them as a scholar) in the domain.\n\nAs such, I would consider MSW and MBA terminal degrees, but of practice but not scholarship. They're generally considered in their domains to be terminal degrees anyway, I'm inclined to defer.\n\nThat said - quibbling over these distinctions isn't really useful as they don't really matter... In that manner, it's quite an \"academic\" exercise haha",
