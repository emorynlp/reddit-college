  "title:": "Nightmare scenarios where one might NOT get their PhD despite all best efforts",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently writing a screenplay that involves a character who is working towards their PhD and could use a bit of insight from people who are familiar with this world. I have little experience in academia, so I want to make sure what I\u2019m writing is plausible.\n\nThis character I\u2019m writing is very passionate about their field of research, but ultimately fails or is unable to get their PhD for some reason. I know this is highly unlikely or very rare in the real world if you put in the work, but want to think about what some nightmare scenarios might be where the unheard of becomes reality. \n\nThe thesis topic itself is not yet defined, but will be something incredibly niche in the Humanities. \n\nThe tone of the film is meant to be semi-comedic/absurdist, so doesn\u2019t have to be completely true to life. But for example, some ideas I\u2019m throwing around that would cause this to happen:\n\n\\- a new piece of information emerges that completely invalidates the thesis  \n\\- the thesis undermines/invalidates the life work of the advisor (or someone on the panel), and is failed because that person cannot accept this  \n\\- the character\u2019s advisor didn\u2019t bother to read anything the entire time and when it gets to the panel, he is failed  \n\\- the advisor dies/quits and the topic is so niche that no one else in the world can advise him  \n\\- something happens in the world (eg. some kind of scandal or change in public perception) that makes the topic of research a complete no-go  \n\\- the department is dissolved due to lack of funding\n\nAny of these seeming completely nonsensical?\n\nThanks for the help in advance",

The prof and his bestie forced the choice of the new employee, it was an ex employee of the startup, and their guy never showed up in the lab, instead still worked 100% at the startup where he was not supposed to be anymore. So basically, the prof was organizing a fictive employment to funnel public research money to the company of his bestie. My friend complained to the prof, the prof started to retaliate, friend complained to the university, prof was raging and tried to fail his PhD. That was after 6 years, and the guy was the most gifted genius in the goddam department, extremely hard working, with game changing results for their field. University did all they could to bury the affair, which outrageously meant they let the prof get away with just a confidential warning letter, but fortunately also forced the prof to sign the PhD validation to let the friend move on.",

(Sometimes that is a conscious decision and sometimes it is not.)\n\nSome reasons: \n\n* Financial\n* Medical\n* Mental Health\n* Family reasons (birth, death, need to care for loved ones, etc.)\n* Other life circumstances\n* A change in priorities (i.e., it no longer seems worth the effort)\n* They get offered a great job and choose to leave\n* Etc.\n\nThere are other more unfortunate reasons:\n\n* Their advisor dies or becomes incapacitated in some way and no one else is qualified to supervise their dissertation\n* They take too long and funding runs out and they must quit\n* They are not qualified to do the research and ultimately fail\n* Someone else scoops them and publishes their key results before they can, after they have spent years doing the research, and they are unable to reframe their work in a new way. This could happen coincidentally or through unfortunate or nefarious circumstances.\n* Dysfunction in their lab prevents them from progressing appropriately\n* Their advisor chooses to leave for another university or industry or join an ashram and they are unable to follow or choose not to for any number of reasons.\n* Stress and disputes with their advisor become toxic to the point where they cannot finish. \n* Etc.",

You'd need to do a lot of work to come up with something that, if true, could actually do this as few theses really hinge on any one particular fact. It'd need to be something massively absurd like them being a religion major and doing their thesis on something in the Bible and Jesus comes back to earth to deliver a revised bible that omits the part of the Bible they were writing about.\n\nAll the things about a single person derailing things are also avoidable because you typically have 3 people on your committee and not just 1, all members of the committee have to approve the proposal and review drafts before the defense and they are ethically not supposed to let a defense happen if they know the student will fail. Even if it's a department issue, most departments are merged rather than fully dissolved.\n\nSome things to consider would be something like their advisor losing funding and the student having to teach too many classes to pay for their studies/living and having no time to do their own research. Or visa issues if they can be an international student. Or a death in their family that requires they drop out to go back home or drop out to get a better paying job to support the family. Or if you want to be super realistic (and dark), could have them be the victim of a sexual assault/harassment scandal and have the school sweep it under the rug and retaliate against them for reporting, pull their funding, and force their advisor to make them \"master out,\" but that would be like the entire plot and I get the sense that this is intended to be at most one \"act\" of your character's story.",

They could continue their writing remotely but couldn't get financial support as a teaching assistant.\n* They decide that academia isn't for them, so they leave ABD (all but dissertation), having completed all their formal requirements but choosing not to defend their dissertation.\n\nIn most situations I can think of, someone would take a leave of absence rather than drop out entirely. From what you described, you want a situation where someone *fails* unexpectedly. In reality, this is unlikely because there are several benchmarks to ensure someone is on track. Instead, I would consider some unforeseen event that disrupts their work, and they can't get funding to continue for another year.",

There are some things one can play up a bit for drama and comedy's sake, and IMO you have some good hooks there. I will second the 'Thesis undermines advisor's work' as being pretty funny.\n\nThe reality from my experience is that students advance in programs because their advisor lets them. In a healthy working relationship, if the advisor *doesn't* feel like a student is ready yet they'll tell them well ahead of time. A few academics still seem to cling to this old-style idea of the defense being an actual point of failure, but in my opinion thats pretty old fashioned. If a student would 'fail' their defense, 9 times of 10 they simply wont have it. Instead many months ahead of time (typically) the advisor will have 'the talk' with the student and either put them on the right path, or in a kind or less-than-kind way ask them to leave. You would think there would be a lot of drama about it, but not in my experience. Actually in my experience struggling students know how much theyre struggling and have dropped out on there own rather than go through 'the talk,' let alone some kind of defense.",

Most committees will not allow a candidate to get to defense if they aren't capable of passing, with or without revisions. I'd say that it's exceptionally rare (relative to the number of successful defenses) for someone to actually fail at the defense stage unless they're that special kind of person that is both incompetent and cannot take a fucking hint, and the committee sees them failing their defense as the only way to finally get rid of them. If your protagonist is supposed to be competent and likeable, you may want to stick to the more structural or structural/personal reasons why people are prevented from finishing--financial constraints (need to work full-time instead and have no time for writing), familial issues (having kids without childcare support, eldercare, divorce, death in the family), immigration issues, homelessness, health and mental health issues that the department refuses or is unable to accommodate, or simply a realization that the candidate has different career goals and a PhD would no longer be useful or necessary.",

Or, did circumstances force the character to leave before getting their PhD?**  \n\nIf the character is in control, there are plenty of reasons to leave.  \nIf you need the character to be committed, there are a lot fewer realistic reasons that the world would prevent them from finishing.  \n\nMost of these seem unrealistic to me. Two stand out as possible:\n\n>the thesis undermines/invalidates the life work of the advisor (or someone on the panel), and is failed because that person cannot accept this\n\nThis or some variant of this could highlight how petty academics could be. Maybe not the advisor, but someone on the PhD Committee. \n\n>something happens in the world (eg. some kind of scandal or change in public perception) that makes the topic of research a complete no-go\n\nThis I could see happening in our world in 2021 or at least being less unrealistic.  \nHyper-progressive people have a lot of loudness, especially in university settings, and weird things have become taboo. It is not inconceivable that a topic that was acceptable 5\u20137 years ago (at the start of a graduate program) would become utterly taboo by the time the person is finishing. Realistically, this wouldn't necessarily mean they are kicked out or anything, but it could undermine years of work and result in no more funding and a solid reason to quit.  \nNaturally, though, this choice would have huge implications for your fictive world because the topic would have to become taboo in your fiction.\n\nI can give you one that is 100% real, would allow for commitment, but would require a different character flaw: \n\n# Plagiarism\n\nPlagiarism can get you kicked out of a PhD program. It doesn't have to be plagiarism in your PhD or research, either. It could be relatively unimportant and careless plagiarism in some useless course you take. \n\nThis happened to someone I know. It was stupid to do it, but it was also relatively meaningless and not related to anything of importance. It was like copy-pasting an email. Still, this person did a lazy job of it and the department brought the hammer down on this person. This person had documented evidence that several people in the class were doing the same and they were all working together, but the department only went after this one person. Their supervisor also abandoned them when this happened, which imho was the nail in the coffin. If the supervisor had backed up this person, I imagine they would have been fine. Instead, gone.\n\nNaturally, this only works if your character might do this to half-ass an unimportant course.\n\nOther realistic reasons could be:\n\n* Ran out of time because of other commitments  \n* Ran out of money  \n* Realized that they don't need a PhD to do what they want so they leave  \n\nOr, in my case, I got sick. I'm all-but-dissertation, but I got sick and cannot work right now so I'm on medical leave. If I don't get better, I guess I won't finish. Even if I do get better, I'm going to be 2+ years behind where my field was at when I was last able to work so I will have to catch up on a huge amount before I can write and defend. It also isn't entirely clear how long I am allowed to be on medical leave before I'm not able to return. I know it is at least 2 years, though.",

Now there are some miscommunications and some various troubles, but at the end he get the extension and the day of the defense is fixed to be July 25. He arrives in Rome that day (from Canada, I guess) but... in the room where he was supposed to defend his thesis there is no one... \n\nHe contact the members of the committee, a new date is fixed, August 7 (which is well within the summer break, in Italy usually the Universities are closed in August), he defend his thesis but the committee decided they would not award him the title of Ph.D. This decision cannot be appealed (even if Aliaga will try, unsuccessfully for what I know, for many years to have it overruled), and Aliaga is not even be able to attempt to defend his thesis again in the future, i.e. there is no way he cannot get his Ph.D. in Italy.\n\n[Here](https://bulletin-archives.caut.ca/bulletin/articles/1999/04/italy-a-%27trial%27-worthy-of-kafka) you can find a brief summary in English about the story, [here](https://www.dmi.unipg.it/mamone/univ/ABUSI.htm) you can find (in Italian) the decision of the National University Council (\"Consiglio Universitario Nazionale\", CUN), who examined the case in 1999 and supported the decision of the 1991's committee (so, denied Aliaga's appeal) and Aliaga's reply",

Even though she met the education minister who mandated that the supervisor be changed while the complaint is investigated, this could not happen as the same supervisors permission was needed for the change which he just refused to give. Fast forward to today and she's without a phd, which doubly sucks as she was the first person in her village to even get an undergraduate degree.\n\nHappy to provide news articles on the story if you DM me",

If it's a niche field, it's even less likely. Much of the innovation in these fields come from a creative and new way of putting things together, and it's very unlikely that something new would come up and invalidate a thesis. Moreso if you consider the thesis first a sort of proof that you know the handiwork and second a piece of research proper.\n\n- the thesis undermines/invalidates the life work of the advisor (or someone on the panel), and is failed because that person cannot accept this\n\nSlightly more likely because temperatures and egoes run high. But 1) for the same reason as the former point, this is not a very realistic scenario, but 2) even if this type of conflict were to happen there are bulwarks set in place to avoid this and what would happen is probably that the committee member would be replaced for not doing their job.\n\n- the character\u2019s advisor didn\u2019t bother to read anything the entire time and when it gets to the panel, he is failed\n\nMight of course happen, but the student has ample opportunity to rectify this over the course of their stipend period. Switching advisors is painful but it happens.\n\n- something happens in the world (eg. some kind of scandal or change in public perception) that makes the topic of research a complete no-go\n\nAgain, in the humanities this is not a likely scenario.\n\n- the department is dissolved due to lack of funding\n\nNot likely that this would disrupt the completion of a PhD, at least not here.\n\n\n\nA handful of more likely scenarios:\n\n- A personal crisis of any kind happening, impeding progress\n- A failure to plan the progress properly, ending funding before the project is finished. Often, the result is that the candidate keeps working at a decreasing pace until the project is abandoned altogether.\n- A legitimate but unfortunate misunderstanding of the scope and/or subject of the project, leading to several dead ends before the candidate understands what their job is, unfortunately too late to complete the project.\n- Mismanagement of energy, working so much it's detrimental to project progress (the humanities are a creative type of research and demands some energy surplus to make something good happen)\n- Completion anxiety and/or imposter syndrome, leading to academic paralysis.

With unlimited funding (as long as it is decent in the first place) and no term limits, being an eternal PhD would be quite doable :) \n\nI.e. there are ways to resolve any of the causes you list (and often universities do), but it might take more time or means than the prospective graduate can or wants to invest.  \n\nI think this could be a good opportunity to include some bureaucratic absurdity into the story - the unwanted interaction of rules that lead to bad results; Catch 22 like. E.g. \n\n\"My advisor died, and I can't get to work with a only possible replacement because I can't renew my student visa - that would require a letter from my advisor.... \" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for a single cause, plagiarism would be a pretty hard academic stop, with (often, in theory) zero-tolerance policies that end with being fired for academic missconduct.

There are different points where a student may fail - they may not pass upgrade, fail at viva or fail post-viva. It's not uncommon for a supervisor to move to a different uni and the student go with them. If the student stayed or supervisor was no longer working at all, another member of staff would usually supervise the subject. It may not be their expert area, but this isn't uncommon. What would be a challenge is finding an examining team for something so niche.\n\nThere are cases where projects cannot be completed due to funding being pulled - but in humanities, at least in my experience, this would be rarer because usually funding covers tuition and living expenses - most students would take out a loan in order to continue and uni would also usually try to offer some financial support. In science subjects it's a little different as equipment might be impossible to get etc.\n\nResearch also advances quickly so it's possible a research project could become moot. Hope this is of some help to you.",
