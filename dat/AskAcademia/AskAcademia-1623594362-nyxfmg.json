  "text": "Hello all.\n\nMyself and a group of faculty and students are trying to get together a group of signatures from faculty, postdocs and trainees in multiple institutions in the USA. \nOur goal is to ask NIH to make public the names of PIs that have been found guilty and fired (or asked to retire) after being found guilty of harassment (sexual or not). \n\nThere are too many stories where PIs move from institutions, repeating the toxic behaviors and maintaining their reputation and ability to keep NIH dollars. \n\nIt's time the NIH takes a bold approach at stoping toxic environmemts. \n\nIf you want to be part of this movement, please send me a private message. \n\nWe plan to make calls for media attention, get in contact with NIH leadership (we have already started this), make a web page and use social media. \n\nWe need as many signatures as possible to make our voices heard. \n\nWe look forward to hear from you!",

They are too likely to give a benefit of a doubt. So if you\u2019re publicly reporting this, I bet people will be less likely to report it at the institutional level. And what level of harassment will constitute discipline? Theoretically any, but truly there\u2019s a difference between someone who has implicit bias they need to work on and someone who routinely harasses trainees and young faculty. Harassment is too often ignored or swept under the rug in the \u201cfaculty club\u201d. \n\nThat being said hiring institutions could potentially be able to ask NIH if there\u2019s reports against a faculty member.\n\nMaybe the NIH could bar any PI accused of certain types/levels of harassment from obtaining a trainee supplement to an R01 or an R35? They should also just incentivize great mentoring. So often the good mentors can\u2019t make it to the top because great mentoring is not incentivized in granting R01s.\n\nAt the end of the day institutions are there to pay the bills and if their reporting will chase off a high grant earning PI, I bet they are less likely to do that. If the NIH prohibits those PIs from obtaining certain types of funds like R35s, maybe that puts the pressure on. \n\nI just saw NINDS has a mentoring award that comes with an 100k supplement! What a great start at lifting up the good mentors.",

So knowing that people cheat and get away with it is honestly a little crushing. \n\nThat said, I agree that the punishments are harsh. In a way, they seem to punish a few people hard to make up for the rest that don\u2019t get punished at all, and I agree that that\u2019s a problem.

Why the NIH out of all of the funding agencies out there?\n* If they've been found guilty and removed from their position, isn't that the problem solved? Why taking this extra step?\n* What steps are taken to ensure (to the extent that that's possible) that this doesn't become a mechanism to enable witch-hunts?\n\nI would also point out that I would view \"found guilty of sexual harassment\" as being very different from what I would consider \"toxicity in academia\": the difference coming down to competitiveness versus an actual crime.\n\nThis feels like a problem better solved on an institution-by-institution level. Of course, there already are policies at that level, but it sounds like in your view these aren't sufficient. What makes them insufficient? I'm asking that more as a general trying-to-understand-the-problem thing. Perhaps putting together a more universal set of policies, and then pushing an initiative to have institutions get on board to enact them, might end up being more effective?",

From the first institution's perspective, this solves their problem and there is no incentive to actually remove these folks from academia. There's many documented cases where this has happened, many are linked by others above or a quick google search could find you more.\n\nSo OP's proposal is one potential way for a body that gives money to many institutions to monitor the situation. If a serial harasser was \"blacklisted\" by NIH (or any funding body) it's unlikely they would be able to find a cushy high-profile place to land after being pushed out of their first institution.

I know that the astrophysics community has had to take quite a few measures in recent years because of issues in their field; I'm not at a proper computer right now so I can't efficiently search, but if you wanted to have a google yourself that would be a solid place to start.\n\nEdit: I did it anyway. A good example is [Christian Ott](http://live.iop-pp01.agh.sleek.net/2018/02/23/job-offer-for-disgraced-astrophysicist-revoked/) who resigned from his professorship at the California Institute of Technology following a suspension for harassing two female graduate students, and got a new post at the University of Turku in Finland. This was revoked after backlash from people in the astro community who knew about his situation. I think what OP is proposing is a way of making that kind of information more formally available.\n\nAlso [Timothy Slater](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tylerkingkade/a-professors-sexual-harassment-case-came-out-in-congress) is an example of someone whose career flourished elsewhere after being found guilty of violating the sexual harassment policy of his university. The same article mentions Geoff Marcy who didn't have to move institutions because his harassment of students was never taken seriously, until a few years ago. He was (I think) really the case that kicked off the most recent push in the astro community to address harassment.",
