  "text": "Revisiting a manuscript after not using Endnote in some time and each time I insert a citation instead of just appearing as the reference number in-text (for example: (23)), it appears in curly brackets with the author and year ie  {Lau, 2021 #53}) and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to change this or convert the in-text citations to numbers. Please help if you know how to fix this issue!",
