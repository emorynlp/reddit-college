  "title:": "Which recommendation letter would be better?",
  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am a PhD student, and I am applying for an internship with the top superstar researcher of my field. I made it through preselection, and in the next round I would have to add two recommendation letters (I would add two emails, that would receive recommendation requests, so I wouldn't see the recommendations). \n\nI am planning to ask my PI for one recommendation. For the second recommendation, this is where I have my question, as I can have my program director in my Master give me a recommendation, which would be moderately strong content-wise, but I also am on a slightly distant but good acquaintance-ship (dunno if the word exists) with an old PhD student of the superstar researcher. He's doing his postdoc currently, I knew him on a slightly personal level before he did his PhD. He is also open to write a recommendation letter.\n\nSo I'm wondering, as there is a possibility that his recommendation letter might be weak content wise, as we didn't know each other much research-wise, but that it might still hold more trust value in the eyes of the superstar researcher (maybe), which recommendation letter would be better for my case? \n\nIn case those details are needed, both my PI and my Master program director are tenured professors and have a good reputation in our field, not famous, but they are slightly above the median of what a very good researcher is like worldwide.",

Since there are only 2 on the form, add the friend and one of the professionals. This will make you look more rounded as well. The 2 professionals would probably have similar things to say and the friend would be more apt to know what they are looking for and hype up these qualities that you have.",

I've seen top researchers offload some responsibilities in hiring to postdocs and other professors in the lab. In that case, a somewhat weak-in-content letter from an old student might hurt your chances.",
