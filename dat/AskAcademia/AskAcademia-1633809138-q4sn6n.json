  "title:": "Reference Contact in Volunteer Application",
  "text": "I'm filling out an application for a volunteering organization, and it asks for the contact information of one reference. This is my first time applying for an organization (and I also have no prior work experience), so I'm not sure who to put and what the etiquette is. What kind of references do volunteer places generally look for? \n\nI found this organization in the list of volunteering opportunities on my department's website, so I thought of my academic advisor. Would asking them to be a reference be appropriate? \n\nThank you in advance!",

      "text": "Probably. These kinds of references are usually used to confirm that you're reliable, an effective communicator, able to work independently, able to meet deadlines, etc. A professor or advisor can often speak to those kinds of attributes.\n\nAlways ask before you list someone as a reference. Tell them what you're applying for and ask if they could provide a good reference.",
