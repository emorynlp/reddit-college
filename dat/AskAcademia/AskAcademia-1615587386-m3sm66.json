[Bad news](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/m2qner/bad_news/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nI didn\u2019t realize this would get so much attention. Thank you all for your kind words and advice. I figured that eventually I was going to have to disclose this to my boss. I talked to her and she was really supportive. I figured it was the right time since I will probably be in and out of my lab a lot. I will do an update soon.\n\nOnce again, thank you all!!",
