This is how we narrow down 10-12 highly qualified candidates to 3-5 for final interviews/campus visits. \n\n1.\tMake sure your connection is stable and reliable. Plug into Ethernet. \n2.\tWear headphones and use an external mic if you have one. \n3.\tPractice your responses to commonly asked interview questions. You want to be conversational, but practicing your answers allows you to remain clear and concise and shows that you are prepared. \n4.\tHave a short list of questions ready to go. The questions you ask tell us a lot about you. Are they insightful questions about our program or are they things you could have found by browsing our website?\n5.\tKnow the program. Know the faculty. Know what their objectives are and how you fit in with those/how you can contribute.",

I think it\u2019s just an art of be yourself, don\u2019t ramble on too much or be too short. IMO and hour is the perfect length. Make sure you have good questions.

      "text": "So, I'll add my experience. I have been on two hiring committees in which we used this step to find our 3 to invite on campus from about 6 or 7. (Where as we had another search where we didn't use this at all.) We had several candidates who all got close to the same review scores, but for different reasons. So we used our 5-6 questions during the zoom meeting to find the 3 to invite in. It wasn't just a formality. \n\nThat said, what ultimately put the three over the edge was (1) they knew about our university and asked good questions when we turned the time over to them and (2) their answers to our questions were inline with our mission. They all qualified for the position in one way or another, we were looking for fit. Essentially, they understood to whom they had applied and they showed us that. It sounds like you know what you want, so let them know this and how you fit with their mission and goals.\n\nThis may not be why you are being asked to participate in a Zoom interview, but something to consider.  My experience is pre-COVID, so the reason for yours could be much different.\n\nOh and make sure your Zoom works (and your background is clear or academic). We had one who couldn't make Zoom work and it does make a difference. It was hard to make an equal assessment when we couldn't see the candidate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck!! Hope you get it!",

I did a zoom interview over Thanksgiving break from a Starbucks and had to sequester myself in a corner with blank walls... I felt *worse* about all the background noise (even with noise suppression turned on). \n\nBut the committee was super understanding (it was also a *very* quickly scheduled call, and they knew I was on vacation), and I just had the campus visit this last week! So it's definitely about **fit** more than anything else. I know I made it to the campus visit stage because I showed I am (a) excited about teaching at an SLAC and (b) aligned with the school's vision for higher ed. So whatever it is about the position that thrills you, be open about that!\n\nYou've probably done plenty of question prep, but they asked me to:\n\n* briefly describe my dissertation/research\n* talk about how I generally run my classes\n* talk about a specific success/challenge with a student\n* talk about my teaching philosophy as it aligns to the school's mission\n* talk about institutional service/grant-writing experience\n* talk about LMS/tech experience\n\nGood luck!!

              "text": "I think we all understand that life is different still, but if you have a messy background it could be distracting. You want them focused on you and all the good things you have to say. Keep your cats and dogs (and anything else that might interrupt) out of the room. An office on campus would be best (and sure that can be messy, but that's work messy). It just shows the interviewers how much care you have to make your background clean and appropriate, even if we are \"coming into your home.\" My home camera faces a white wall. I know that sounds boring (when I'm in a non-formal meeting or class I have a cool virtual background). When I have interviewed or had important meetings, all you see is the white wall so I'm the focus and nothing is distracting from our conversation. \n\nJust my thoughts - others may disagree and say - show yourself, be natural. SO, it is up to you. But I know what I would appreciate looking at (or not looking at). I also see this as, this is my house and even if we are \"in each other's houses\" on official business, my house is my hiding place. No one needs to see my house unless I do the old fashioned thing and invite them over. I helps me separate work life from personal life in this odd time.\n\nGood luck! Just own what you choose, and be authentic to you :)",

A candidate completely f'd up his 2nd round zoom interview with the leadership team by being 10 minutes late, walking around his CURRENT WORKPLACE the entire time, kept asking about benefits and vacations and rates (pro tip ask HR not the Electrical instructor), and literally ducked into a hallway to hide from a coworker who was visible in the background.

This means scores were operationally defined and, even if we knew background about a candidate that filled gaps in their answer, we had to go with what they said.  We also weren't allowed to respond, as each candidate had to be treated uniformly.  We would have 5-7 questions asked in sequence with no follow up.  Be prepared for the awkward silence if they can't respond, and don't take it personally. \n\nThat being said, be specific and comprehensive in your answers.  Answer the question that is asked.  If a question has multiple parts, it may help to take notes to make sure you hit each note.  Provide specific examples from your work when you are able.  Keep an eye on the time.  The worst interviewees I remember are ones who just droned on and on.  Search committees suck, and members appreciate it when you respect their time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBEST OF LUCK!",
