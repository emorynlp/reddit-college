  "title:": "My real passion is history, but I\u2019ve been deterred from pursuing graduate education because of how terrible I hear the job market is in the US. Is it as bad as they say? And if I\u2019m willing to move abroad, are there other places with better opportunities?",
  "text": "I already have my BA in history. But I graduated three years ago and I have a job in a completely unrelated field, (healthcare administration, and I\u2019m still shocked how I managed to spin a history degree to get my foot into the door for this industry) where I make well the above average income, and far above average for my age, comparable if not a little more than the average for tenured professors in the US. This field seems to have far more upward mobility for higher administrative roles. But I make enough now, so I don\u2019t really need the higher pay if it means I\u2019m in a field I don\u2019t care for.\n\nI have a family of four, so while a pay cut from what I make now isn\u2019t ideal, I\u2019d be willing to take one to pursue my passion as long as I could still provide for my family. \n\nMy wife is currently a stay at home mom. She\u2019s not opposed to working, but I\u2019d like if I could still have the income for a comfortable living working alone if possible just as a safety net. We\u2019re comfortable enough that without her working, I don\u2019t really need to even look at my paycheck or check my bank account. I just know I have enough time to cover the bills anyway and for whatever smaller personal spending I want. I like this peace of mind a lot, but if this isn\u2019t possible with history, I\u2019d be willing to change that as long as it isn\u2019t too drastic.\n\nI currently work 50-60 hours per week, salaried so no overtime, and while this is doable, I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to work anywhere with more hours. I don\u2019t want my work life balance to suffer because I love my kids and want to be with them as much as possible.\n\nFor unrelated reasons, we are already interested in moving abroad anyway, because we feel like our kids might have better options somewhere in the EU. Portugal, Germany, Austria, Ireland, and Sweden are already places we\u2019ve been interested in. So the need to move abroad for better odds in the field doesn\u2019t bother me much.",

      "text": "The job market really is as bad as they say it is. The other thing to keep in mind, especially given that you have a large family with a non-working spouse, is that moving from a PhD program straight into a stable, long-term job is basically unheard of nowadays unless you're coming from one of the absolute tippy top programs in your field. What most people end up doing is spending years (upwards of a decade in some unfortunate cases) bouncing between postdocs, visiting professorships, adjunct gigs, and so on, none of which pay well or are all that predictable or reliable. Realistically, until you get a tenure track job or at least a full-time lecturer position, it's very unlikely you'd be able to support a family of four on the money you'd make. Grad school and pre-tenure academic careers also aren't exactly known for their good work/life balance, which is another thing to keep in mind.\n\nThe academic job market is also, for most people, a global market. It's not uncommon at all for US PhD graduates to apply overseas and vice versa. So you're chances don't increase that much if you're willing to apply outside of the US, because most of your peers are likely doing the same.",

Honestly at this point I\u2019ve been even considering the idea of getting my PhD online during my off time, and then just starting a YouTube channel or something. Plenty of amateur historians with no degree at all make a living on YouTube, so hopefully I could provide something a little better. Plus, the period and topic I\u2019m interested in has basically no one covering it so I feel like I wouldn\u2019t be competing against anyone.\n\nJackson Crawford went from professor to professional YouTuber so why couldn\u2019t I make it work? Plus I could do that on a side while keeping my current job until it kicks off, or I could just end it if it doesn\u2019t.\n\nMy job provides education stipends if we want to continue our education, so I could basically get my PhD for free anyway.",

University of Edinburgh has one program, only a master\u2019s, but you don\u2019t even need to take classes.

                  "text": "I\u2019m interested in the French Revolution and the landscape that brought it about in the first place. Enlightenment philosophy praising the natural rights of humanity and the scientific method. The early Romantic movement, social relations of the lower classes and how they bargained with the lords and wealthy merchants, the start of the industrial revolution and the upheaval of the urban working class, rising literacy, the widespread use age of the press, news, and \u201ccafe culture.\u201d \n\nAdditionally I\u2019d want to cover the less pretty side that Revolution would later lead to, those being the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Other important topics I\u2019d need to cover are the earlier Seven Years War and the development of more advanced military tactics, like the gradual decline of linear tactics, the rise of individuality in the military, mass conscription, professional military schools, modern staff and organizational structures, etc. Rather than going broad on one subset of society over a long period, I just really want to go deep on all the aspects of what it would be like to live through such a turbulent time.\n\nThere are some channels that almost get there, either going deep into topics that come close, or channels that are broad enough to kind of encompass my topic but unsatisfactorily. Those that tend to go as in depth as what I plan to don\u2019t really exist for my topic, and those are the ones that are most successful for other periods from what I\u2019ve seen and watch. \n\nTownsends does a great job of culinary history of roughly the same time, but slightly earlier around the time of the American Revolution, and he\u2019s focused exclusively on America. He covers to some extent homestead living, but it\u2019s absent of what society was actually like, and doesn\u2019t cover at all what other nations may have been like. He\u2019s by far the most popular, but since he\u2019s interested in roughly contemporary America compared to the European history I\u2019m interested in, I think we\u2019d supplement each other far more than compete with each other.\n\nThere\u2019s a channel called Napoleonic Wargaming that talks about how to play a tabletop game based on the period, so it kind of covers military history. But as a result of it being based on a game, it\u2019s not always true to history, and it\u2019s very focused on the \u201ctactical\u201d rather than the larger strategic overview, or the lived experience of being a soldier. Again being based on a game he has his niche in that game, where I\u2019m more interested in the actual history. From the comments, it seems that those who go to him for actual history rather than the game do so because there just isn\u2019t anyone else for the real history, which is where I\u2019d step in.\n\nThere\u2019s one last one I know of from a reenactor named Brandon F. He does a good job, but he tries to cover everything from the American Revolution to at times as far as the Second World War, so he\u2019s not able to really go deep enough for my tastes. He goes so broad that even reading just a little bit on any specific period makes his more overview-like videos no longer that educational. As a reenactor he\u2019s understandably focused almost only on military life and again not really on how the society that supports such a military functions, or the rapidly evolving industry that supplies it. He also has a tendency to rant about topics and go off script which leads to incorrect information or just ranting about a topic he doesn\u2019t know about at all which to me is unprofessional, but even more in my opinion it hurts his credibility to teach me something new. If I can pick out errors in the things I know about, I have a hard time trusting him in topics I don\u2019t. I had to stop watching him when I\u2019m a recent video he speculated for 45 minutes about a subject, never used sources, and then came to the wrong conclusion, when any decent historian would look for primary sources, and sure enough there is a very well known primary source that discusses that exact question that he ignored, and I\u2019m assuming he didn\u2019t even know existed. He would be my only \u201ccompetition,\u201d and while I feel bad just saying it, to me he\u2019s just not putting out good history which makes me want to do it more to fill that gap with proper research.\n\nAnd even still, all three of these completely miss the majority of what I\u2019d want to discuss, those being social relations, philosophy, the romantic movement, industry, etc.",

They\u2019d give me a paycheck in fact so I\u2019d actually get paid to get it. I don\u2019t need further education in my field, so why not get it in something I like?\n\nI also feel like if I ever wanted to publish books, I\u2019d need a PhD to be taken seriously as a history author and have any chance.\n\nPlus, to be totally honest there is a personal pride element. If I am going to put myself out there and try to educate, I want to be seen as actually qualified, and I\u2019d want to feel like I\u2019m actually qualified. I also just grew up poor and I\u2019m the first in my family to even graduate high school, I\u2019m the first to go to college, imagine also being the first to go all the way to a doctorate? That would just mean a lot too.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m 100% convinced I\u2019ll get my doctorate in something, again since it\u2019d be free, it would be silly not to. It\u2019s just whether I follow my passion and get it in history, or if I do get the edge on peers and stick with healthcare administration, or even transition over to the provider route and go to medical school, which I have the grades to be competitive for.\n\nI honestly hate healthcare administration. I make a lot of money, but oh my god it\u2019s so boring. So if not history, I\u2019d probably definitely lean toward transitioning to be a provider, whether it\u2019s med school, vet school, physical therapy, or something like that.\n\nI am fully aware that all of those healthcare careers on average pay more than a history degree, work fewer hours, and have a massively better job market, but I just don\u2019t love those things and I\u2019d feel a certain amount of guilt taking care of patients if I\u2019m not fully passionate in what I\u2019m doing.",

Because of where I'm located and what I study, between half and two-thirds of my PhD students are using some form of GI benefits, and they're great to work with. \n\n(Your profile sounds a little like one of my students who just advanced to candidacy: born and raised in rural Alabama; Army straight out of high school; got an AA at the community college here after he got out, and liked it; transferred to my university and got a BA, and liked that, too; joined the MA program here, and liked it; and applied to our PhD program and got in. His wife is great and has some kind of high-powered executive job, and they just had their third kid last year so he's sort of a stay-at-home-dad/PhD student. He's an awesome guy and I love working with him, so it definitely can be done. But having a spouse pulling down a large salary certainly helps the equation. The family does not depend on him for financial support.)\n\nI don't mean to sound discouraging--it's just that I've been doing this a while and I've developed a sense of how different paths play out. A doctoral program will bleed a lot of the passion from even the most enthusiastic students, since a lot of it is boring (and a surprising amount is bureaucratic.) If you're going to pursue some career path in history, you may need to relocate your family to attend the best program you can get into. I spent 70 hours a week working during my first three years as a grad student--that's a lot of time to be away from your kids. You're interested in French history--are you ready to be away from your kids for months at a time while you're visiting archives? I your partner OK with that? I field a lot of information requests from prospective students this time of year, and while I try not to be discouraging I *do* want people to go in with eyes open.\n\nI have no idea what the economics of a YouTube channel are, but I would want to have a very good idea before I attempted to support my family on the platform. It is certainly possible to write books--good books!--without a PhD (Rick Atkinson is among those turning out high-quality popular work at a good clip.) Doctoral study may also ruin your writing for the general population. Academics are not exactly known for being highly readable. \n\nAnd while it is very, *very* difficult to publish with an academic press unless you have a doctorate, the economics of academic publishing are terrible and are only getting worse. Many academic presses are shuttering, and the ones that remain are not churning out best-sellers. My first book came out a decade ago with a top press in my field, and it got a lot of support from the marketing department, which put it on the cover of its catalog. It got a glowing review in a national newspaper and peaked at #818 on Amazon for about ten minutes. It was, by academic press standards, a big hit. My total royalties for the book to date are about $1,800. And I had to spend $800 out of pocket to have the book indexed. My last check covered five years of book sales and was $138.13. It's not the kind of thing you can support a family on.\n\nSo: My universal recommendation is to investigate all of the outcomes and have fixed goals at the other side (public history? teaching high school?) while you're weighing whether to apply. Pursuing a PhD mainly because \"I've always wanted a PhD\" has not, in my experience, sustained most people through the long slog of a doctorate. And while the financial costs of tuition are eased by GI Bill benefits, the opportunity cost of those hours and years--time you will not spend with your kids, with your spouse, pursuing hobbies, and so forth--cannot be replaced. So the degree is not \"free\" in that important sense. \n\nThat's not to say you shouldn't do it, just to say you should keep your eyes open. Good luck to you!",

                                              "text": "My advisor is a lot wiser than me, and here is the advice he always gave: \"The only reason to get a PhD in history is if there is only one job that you can imagine making you happy, and if that job absolutely *requires* a doctorate.\"\n\nTo be honest, it's very difficult for me to recommend a PhD in history at the moment. It's too early to tell what the long-term effects of the pandemic will be on higher education, and on history in particular. Things were not good before COVID, and there are some people who argue that the pandemic is the asteroid-hitting-the-planet moment. It's hard for me personally to recommend someone with a family depending on them *Close your eyes and jump! Things sometimes work out!*\n\nBut I have accepted a new student in each of the past few cycles, so there's a short list of people for whom I think the degree makes more sense: \n\n--People who have a pretty broad set of professional goals (working in public history, working for the government) and are not hoping to win the PowerBall lottery of a tenure-track position, which increases the odds of finding a job you can support yourself with on the other side. The government hires a significant amount of historians, and from what I can tell COVID is not affecting those positions. It sounds like you have the veterans' preference, which carries a *massive* advantage in hiring. The advantage of those positions is that they are steady, and that they are comparatively well-paid. The disadvantage is that you will not be pursuing your own research passion: Instead of writing about the years following the French Revolution, you'll be writing a series of short-turnaround pieces on, say, the history of military quarantines. The upside is that your work will actually be read, and be read by people in a position to act on it, unlike the vast majority of academic history. \n\n--People who are already working jobs in history (public history or teaching positions) for whom a doctorate opens up possibilities for promotion. That's about a third of my advisees at the moment, and I feel less nervous about their chances in the program because they are not bearing the opportunity costs of the degree (most are still working in those jobs and completing the degree part-time), and because the concrete benefits of a doctorate are pretty well-established for them. My two most senior students are both working full-time while completing their dissertations. (Both have the veterans' preference, by the way.) The most senior is rocketing up in the field of public history; he took a new job a few months before the pandemic started, and then got hired to a director position early in 2021. He's already having a great career and the doctorate will light the afterburner for him. (It's also a pretty nifty and well-timed dissertation project, which just turned out to be lucky.) The other decided to leave the Army after 11 years while ABD and got himself hired at a really neat organization in a job he says he'd love to stay in permanently. (Though I think once he completes the degree he'll be able to write his own ticket at a lot of places--he's extremely good.) I have a lot of confidence that the program is going to do very well by both of these guys. (Both have a young kid, too, if that helps.)\n\nSo it *is* possible to make this work. I would start thinking now, as you're considering applications, how much you're willing to disrupt your life, and whether your partner is completely on board. You'll lose your current income, and the raises that would come if you stayed in your field; and you will likely have to relocate your family at least once, and probably twice--once to move to the area your program is located, and once for your new job. You will likely be spending a lot of time working, and some away from your family; are you OK with that? Is your partner? From personal experience, I can say that the work involved in getting a history PhD is not always easy to explain to people outside the field. My girlfriend in grad school was a med student, and it was easy to explain why she was working such punishing hours: *I diagnosed a rare spinal condition today and helped save a toddler's life*. It was harder for me: *I read nine mostly-similar books about labor reform in the 1840s and then wrote a 22-page paper pointing out the very small differences*. \n\nIt sounds like some of the things you're interested in doing with history (writing, starting a podcast or YouTube channel) don't require a PhD, so why not start with those for now, and reassess whether a doctorate makes sense later? Would you be interested in teaching high-school? Is that a transition you can make now? Is there a part-time (NOT online) MA program you can use to dip a toe in the water without making a full-time commitment? MA programs are famous for not offering funding, but if you're bringing GI Bill benefits that's not a worry. If you uproot your family to begin a PhD program, you've already crossed the Rubicon. I always suggest to prospective students that they explore lower-stakes ways of testing out the field before placing a massive (and massively risky) bet on a doctorate.\n\nLast piece of unsolicited advice: I hear from a lot of former students who graduated three or four years earlier, who found entry-level work in a field unrelated to history, and who hate it and want to get back to their passion. I always spend a little time trying to ascertain what it is they don't like about their work--sometimes it's the field that is a bad fit, but half the time what they don't like about their current position is that it's entry-level rather than the field itself. A lot of lower-level positions, whatever the field, sorta suck. Things get a lot more interesting as you move up, get more responsibility, get more autonomy, and get better compensated. I'm not saying that's you; you seem to have a good handle on that. Just something I see a lot. \n\nI was one of those people who couldn't imagine doing anything besides being a historian, and I had a miserable two years during my run-up to tenure. That's an all-or-nothing proposition; you either get tenure, or you're basically chased out of the profession. My first thought every morning during those two years was *This is the only job that will ever make me happy, and I'm going to lose it, and I'll be forever haunted by the knowledge that I had my dream job and couldn't keep it*. It was, as you'd imagine, a miserable couple of years. In the end, I got tenure, and kept my job, and I'm extremely good at it. But looking back I can see quite clearly that the idea that this was the *only* thing I could do and be happy was just a failure of imagination.\n\nAnyway, free advice from an internet stranger. Take it for what it's worth. Mostly a very sincere *Good luck!* whatever route you decide to pursue.",

I think a masters in public history, plus my veteran status should probably make many government jobs in cultural resource management, state or national parks, or state or federal museums fairly open to me.

What I\u2019m hearing you say is you work 50-60 hours a week, your wife stays home with your two kids, you make a comfortable six figure income, and you want to move to several possible countries in EU, all with less stability, weaker currencies, and MUCH SMALLER (and even shakier) economies (because it\u2019s all based off the USD). \n\nThe job market is tough here but there are many more opportunities than where you just named. Also, if you turned a BA in what many consider a no-pay field into a great paying job in a another field and your wife doesn\u2019t even work, why would you think you won\u2019t be able to bust your ass to get a dream job?\n\nI question why you\u2019re not happy? Honestly, I think you work too many hours and would be happier spending MORE time with your family or pursuing hobbies. Healthcare administration is mind-numbing. You probably aren\u2019t challenged but would do well with the same job, less hours, and a fascinating hobby. \n\nI make six figures too but I work a government job, 35 hours per week, with a pension etc. But it\u2019s not my dream so I\u2019m in a PhD (my passion project) and believe I will land a good job one day because I want to teach. I may have to eat some crow for a bit (associate spots) but I\u2019ve got 12 years applied experience in the field that I can bring into the classroom. \n\nI dunno. I just don\u2019t see uprooting my family for so much instability and uncertainty. Jesus look what happened to England with Brexit. And Ireland???? Half my family is there, I\u2019m second generation American. Ireland is beautiful to look at (in many places) but is in big trouble economically and brutally poor for many.\n\nYou have what many would consider a dream. Many would kill for what you have. Have you truly done a deep dive into your restlessness? Are you tying your title to your worth as a person, husband, dad etc.? Just my two cents and a questions that come to mind.",

I have a PhD in the humanities and couldn't find a full-time job that requires all the skills I worked hard to gain, and that kind of killed my passion for my field. But I did have a wonderful time when I was a doctoral student. While I don't regret getting my PhD, I wish I had used those seven years on something else that can lead to a satisfying career. However, I do understand the desire to learn more, and, if I were you, I really couldn't let the education money go to waste. :)",

If possible I\u2019m learning more toward trying to eke out a living in more unconventional public education like YouTube or publishing books geared toward the general public, kind of like other academics like Jackson Crawford has been doing with linguistics after he ended his career as a professor to pursue those full time.",

              "text": "I think that is an excellent goal. I think more people (students and adults) should study history and learn from history. Public education reaches more people, and you already know your research topic. I will check out Jackson Crawford's videos. If you ever made YouTube videos, let me know and I would love to watch them!",
