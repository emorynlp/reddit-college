      "text": "With a background in industrial engineering and a skillset in data science, there are lots of ways you can go, and I don't anticipate you having trouble finding a job. The question is - what do you want to do?\n\nOf course there are data science jobs in tech and finance; those are going to be highly paid and tend to value PhDs. Some of your skills (heuristic evaluations, behavioral coding, cognitive walkthroughs, qualitative methods, use case scenarios, user interviews, contextual inquiries) indicate that you could alternatively go into UX research, if you have an interest in that field. The project management skills could feed well into a program manager job. Then there's the fact that your PhD is in industrial engineering, and that's an entire career field as well. All of those fields are going to have competitive salaries and a job market in your favor.\n\n\"Industry\" is broad and is usually used to refer to anything that's not academia; you're going to have to get a little narrower than that (quickly). Start reading about these fields and trying to imagine whether you'd like the day-to-day work involved. Looking up job descriptions in the field will help.\n\nYou'd be competitive for a consulting firm, more so if your PhD came from a prestigious place. If you went to a fancy university for your PhD, your career services office probably has connections with consulting firms that come recruiting on campus - reach out to them, (quickly, as consulting hiring season begins very early). But your skills would be valuable to a consulting company; it just depends on what kind of consulting you want to do.",

          "text": "Awesome, thanks for the edits!  I do not think it will be hard for you to get a job, but time is short if your postdoc will end 1/1/2022.  I would suggest immediately:\n\nMaking a list of the types of work you want to do, and the types of places you might want to work.  Then, begin reaching out for informational interviews to people (e.g. alumni of your Ph. D. program, friends, LinkedIn connections, etc)  that do the work/work in the places you want.  You should ask for 15 or 20m of their time, and come prepared with a list of questions to ask each.  You want to get a basic idea of what the work is like, what challenges exist, what typical compensation looks like, and what it takes to get the job they have.  There is a massive difference between the day to day and year to year experiences of a consultant and an in-house data scientist.  This is the biggest thing to figure out, IMO.   \n Also, don't be afraid to say that you're on the market. Ask for connections to people inside and outside their organizations that might be willing to talk with you.\n\nSimultaneously, you should begin examining a large number of  jobs that seem interesting/in your wheelhouse. I would pay attention to how the opportunities are described (especially in terms of desired qualifications, job titles, etc).\n\nBased on this research, figure out how you are going to brand yourself during your search.  Just based on what you wrote, it could be as a data scientist with solid technical skills, exceptional research experience and broad subject matter knowledge.  Then, craft your resume, LinkedIn page, etc to reflect this brand.  The whole point is to spin your experience into something that will be attractive to the types of employers you want to work with.\n\nI suggest approaching applying in a coordinated fashion.  From your research, you should have a pretty good idea of dream jobs, acceptable jobs and so-so-jobs.  Apply simultaneously to many jobs in the first two categories, at least.  The reason for doing this is to (hopefully) get many interviews that allow you to compare jobs/cultures/etc and also (hopefully) to have multiple offers on the table.\n\nKnow that data scientists with the skills you mentioned are in EXTREMELY high demand in most parts of the U.S. right now.  You should not settle for a job you don't really want, and you should negotiate respectfully but with firmness to get a fair or better-than-fair offer.\n\nAnyway, that's my $0.02",
