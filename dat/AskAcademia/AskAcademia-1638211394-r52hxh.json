  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently a PhD student in my first year and I've basically been on all of my supervisor's research projects from the summer (pre-PhD, post-acceptance). \n\nIt's been really stressing me out because while they ARE paid and really helpful onboarding to some areas of my own research, it's not going to contribute to my publication record in any way and takes up a lot of brain space & time for a pretty small amount of money. \n\nThe biggest problem is that I get constant emails at odd hours/days for these projects which come with bite-size, immediate-action style tasks which is not at all how my brain works. I'm one of those 'plan your days in 5-minute increments' people and become extremely agitated if things are suddenly asked of me which deviate from the big picture of activities I've mentally prepared for in advance.\n\nI'm a high functioning person and very task oriented, I also like being out of the house most of the time and am not usually at my desk checking email unless at certain intervals. I get the sense my predecessor was more chill and had the mental space to focus on fewer things at a time.\n\nMy supervisor is very helpful and active in supporting my grant applications and academic directions, which is why it's hard for me to take up the issue with her. Also, is this just how RAships work? Hoping for any advice.",

      "text": "In my experience it is very common to be working on projects that aren't related to your thesis in the early stages of a PhD, particularly if you get hired as an RA before you start (I also did). It is a great way to get introduced to the lab and the type of research they do(Note, this may be dependent on the country, program, exact lab etc.). My one question though, is why won't this contribute to you publication record? It seems like you are doing a lot of work for the projects that would warrant authorship? That was one of the main benefits of working on projects before starting my thesis work, as I was able to get a number of publications (first and middle authorships). I am not really sure what exact topic you are looking for advice on, but this has been my experience with being an RA, particularly in the early components of my PhD.",

Think of all the other skills and experiences that make up the academics you admire. Working on projects beyond your core provides learning opportunities and is key to a successful PhD (and post-PhD).",

      "text": "Hi! Yes, it is a general idea that you will have some so-called side projects besides your main PhD research as well (I am doing it too). However, it is assumed that you will be published for these side projects as well. This is the reason why you are doing this as a student: it grows your network, improves your skills and puts your name in the paper. If you cannot work with the style like your PI does : mails in the \"weird\" time and etc - it is better to tell to her but in a kind way. So next, she knows that you do not check mails 24/7  and so on. I hope it will be good for you!",

      "text": "Others have already mentioned that the work your being asked to do is within normal limits.  To balk at doing them is not a good idea for many reasons which I won\u2019t go into because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the crux of the matter. \n\nThe real issue here is that you and your supervisor have different work styles.  In part, you need to manage the manager.  That is work the way that you work best but meet expectations.  If those expectations are unreasonable, then that\u2019s another issue.  But I suspect that is not the case and the primary issue is that the expectations don\u2019t allow you to work effectively (which both you and your supervisor want you to be able to do).  To the extent, that is the case you may have to talk to your supervisor about how the two of you can work together most effectively (it is a shared endeavor).  But first, I would try to meet the expectations within the constraints of your work style.  Your work style sounds effective (it almost certainly is for you) but it may also be overly rigid.  That is merely to say that there is probably some give and take up he had here.  \n\nIMHO, that is the source of the issue.  It\u2019s very common.  People have wildly different work styles and academia allows many different work styles to be effective.  There is no right way to go about it.  Having said that, people with different styles have to effectively work together and that can be a learning process for both.  But it\u2019s not outside of the norm.",

And if you can do that job in your own way, that *usually* won\u2019t be a problem. \n\nAlso worth mentioning: emails at odd hours do not require responses at odd hours. If I happen to be awake and working at 3 or 4 AM, I may email a coauthor or student about something relevant because I\u2019m thinking of it then.  That doesn\u2019t mean I expect them to respond or get to it immediately.",
