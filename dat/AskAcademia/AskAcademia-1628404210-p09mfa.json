  "text": "Hello everyone!\nI am currently working as a product design engineer in a reputed electronics industry. I mostly design plastic & sheet metal products. I have done my B.Sc. in mechanical engineering. \n\nI want to pursue graduate PhD programs in USA & do research in additive manufacturing. \n\nDoes anyone know universities that have research programs on additive manufacturing?",

      "text": "By the time you're looking for PhDs you need to be looking at individual professors, not programs.  Very broadly speaking, your steps are:\n\n\n1.  Look at research papers (and the speakers at major conferences) to see who's doing what work in additive manufacturing.  Make a list of professors whose work interests you.  Spend some time looking at their websites and skimming their recent papers.  \n\n2.  Look at where they work.  Check out their research group.  Consider if you'd be willing to live in that place.  See if you meet their department's minimum criteria for a PhD applicant.  \n\n3. Contact the professors to see if they're taking grad students next year.  Send a concise, personalised email describing what specifically drew you to their work and what you're interested in working on.  Include a CV.  Search this subreddit, or google, for good examples of how to do this.\n\n4.  If any answer you, and you meet and think you click, then follow up according to their instructions or their department's procedures as described online.  Again, search this subreddit and google for advice on how to pick a good supervisor.  \n\n5.  In parallel to the above, look for funding opportunities.  If you get get a scholarship then they don't need to pay you (or they don't need to pay you as much), and you'll be a more competitive applicant.\n\n6. Also in parallel to the above, do some self-evaluation to figure out what you need.  Consider your own skills and interests: are you looking for something that's primarily theory/modeling, mostly experimental work, or a bit of each?  Do you work well in teams or do you want a project that's entirely solo?  Do you need a very hands-on supervisor who meets with you every week and has a lot of involvement in planning out your work?  Or do you prefer to be more independent and want someone more hands-off and who gives less guidance?  What are your future career plans?  Which projects will let you develop skills that are relevant to those plans, and which supervisors have a network which will support that direction?  Keep these in mindn when doing the above steps.",

      "text": "you can have a look at [MIT Center for Additive and Digital Advanced Production Technologies](http://apt.mit.edu/)\n\nFrom my personal experience, best technical guidelines for 3D printed machine elements come from MIT Press. I believe they possess a solid research foundation of that field.\n\nAs a BSc you may have difficulties for admission directly to PhD programs, they will probably require you to do a integrated PhD with MSc included.",
