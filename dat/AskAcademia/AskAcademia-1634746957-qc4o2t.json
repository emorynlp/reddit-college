  "text": "\nI\u2019m (22F) a first year PhD student in physics, and I kind of absolutely hate it. I know at least some of the problem is my mental health, adjusting to having moved across the country, and a bunch of non-school external stressors that I have been dealing with\u2026 I\u2019m in therapy and I take meds. \n\nBut I wake up and dread my classes. I dread my research. I feel like a disappointment to my advisor who is so nice and puts so much faith in me. I\u2019m skipping class and sleeping and I\u2019m still so exhausted. I don\u2019t think this is what I want to do, and academica was never something I planned on doing after my doctorate anyway. I think I just want it so everyone knows I\u2019m smart. And it\u2019s always been my plan. \n\nBut I don\u2019t know what to do from here. I kind of want to teach. My mom was a teacher and she hated it, but I think I would enjoy teaching math, and it seems like that\u2019s at least somewhat in demand. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. Any advice from teachers, grad students, physicists, or anyone would be useful. Thank you.",

      "text": "As a Physics PhD student finishing my PhD in 3 months, my opinion is that if you don't enjoy your field and your research, and i mean truly and deeply enjoy, then you will have a seriously bad and depressing time while doing your PhD. I would say that it is not worth it. Also consider that PhD stipend is not very high and covers only your basic needs. You won't be able to save anything. Based on what you wrote, i strongly advise you to NOT do the PhD.\n\nPhD is generally a good option for people who are passionate about their research enough to sacrifice financial stability and almost all social life for 3+ years.\n\nYou mentioned that you'd be doing the PhD at least partly to show that you're smart. In my opinion, that would only show the oposite. It is not smart at all to sacrifice 3 years worth of savings, time with friends, relationships, etc., just to show the world that you're smart. I'd rather show the world that I'm the dumbest person alive and be relaxed, save money for a house and be happy spending time with my friends.",

                  "text": "There are almost always taught or highly guided components to such programmes \u2014 even if only just for the sake of a class/seminar in research methods and one in a very niche area that the student will be using for their research topic. Aside from that, it\u2019s not really necessary to have large taught components as it\u2019s assumed that the necessary background will have already been achieved in an undergraduate degree and increasingly it\u2019s less likely to get accepted to such phd programmes without a masters degree in hand already. So really, it makes quite a lot of sense. \n\nI\u2019ve heard that a lot of American PhD programmes are open ended for the same reason that American undergrad programmes are typically 4 years rather than 3. That is, a fair amount of time is spent at the start getting candidates up to speed. I think (broadly speaking) that European candidates typically have higher levels of understanding going into both undergrad and PhD degrees, though American style PhDs they come out slightly more specialised in their particular research area. \n\nA European degree is not quite so demanding as a North American one in terms of expected published material either so there\u2019s that too. Whether the American or European system is better is a whole other question (do we need to be hyper specialised at the start of a research career? Or is just better anyway because it necessarily involves more practice at all the soft skills of research?), but it\u2019s definitely a gross oversimplification to think that a European PhD is an American PhD-lite. I know you didn\u2019t quite say that, but it seemed to be the subtext (perhaps unintentionally).",

          "text": "One caveat to this advice: If you leave, it is best to do so in conversation with your advisor, department chair, and administration at your institution. Figure out an exit strategy with them that will not adversely affect you in the future. This could mean either finishing the semester out or withdrawing from courses without taking a grade. \n\nConsider applying for a formal leave of absence. The fact that youre in therapy means it should be easy to get the documentation you need. A leave of absence is temporary, usually a semester or two, so you will have a chance to return and pick up where you left off if you want to. Faculty and administrators are increasingly aware of the importance of mental health, especially in the pandemic, so they will understand and respect your decision. You will not be the first person to do this, and faculty/administrators would rather you take a well-planned absence than suddenly drop out. \n\nIn my opinion, you are young to be starting a PhD. That's not necessarily a bad thing; on the contrary, it means you will have plenty of time to do this at some point down the line if you decide you really want to. There is absolutely nothing wrong with leaving a PhD program, and it doesn't have to be a final decision. Quitting now does not mean you can't pursue one later, but that will be much easier if you manage your exit so as to minimize damage to your academic record or professional relationships.",

I don't think *you* specifically are young, because that's a very typical age to start a PhD. Rather, I believe that starting a PhD fresh out of college, though normal, is a problematic norm. To \"make it\" in academia requires a massive emotional and mental commitment to a specific career path (not to mention time), and I just think it's unfair to people in their early 20s to expect them to commit to a career so soon. \n\nI started my PhD at 24 and in retrospect think that was too soon for me personally, given where I was in my life and how I would change over the next decade. I probably would have done the PhD anyway, but I would have been happier, more productive, and even finished sooner if I had started a little later in life (pre-kids but post-maturity).",

Once you actually have your PhD you can move in all sorts of directions that may diverge wildly from what you studied as a student. I absolutely hated my PhD program, but I love working as a physicist; they were/are totally different experiences for a multitude of reasons. Also, academia is not the only place where physicists work. I would never want to work in academia (no slight to those who do of course, it\u2019s a personal choice).\n\n2) A dirty secret about Physics PhDs is that a surprising number went this direction, partially, to feel or appear intelligent. A physics degree, especially if you are a woman, is seen as rare and special (regardless of if this perception is warranted or not), and while I am absolutely not suggesting that this is a good primary reason to pursue this career path, it doesn\u2019t necessarily detract from the fact that you may also really love science, or experimental research, or physics overall. \n\nYou are allowed to have multiple reasons why you want to be a physicist, which could include: social status, financial benefits, personal interests, personal values, passion, etc. \n\nWhat I would strongly caution against is pursuing a physics PhD if you don\u2019t actually like physics, or STEM in general. Note that this is different than disliking being a physics student, or disliking the way that physics is taught in your program. What I mean that if you actually loathe physics as an area of study, I would not recommend pursuing a physics PhD solely because you want to feel like an intellectual elite. Physics PhD programs in the US are grueling and many times painful, and absolutely not worth it if the only value that it has to you is as a vehicle to stroke your ego or mask your insecurities. Don\u2019t do that to yourself or the profession, it\u2019s not worth it.",

The salary is usually pretty low vs what you could earn elsewhere, especially with a physics PhD. The instructors I've interacted with during my PhD were miserable, always grumpy and annoying to interact with. \n\nHave you ever taught students? I spent several years teaching during my graduate school so I feel I have some idea what it entails, and just how underpaid and not appreciated teaching positions are. If I really wanted to teach I'd rather learn how to make cool youtube videos. I could not in good faith advise anybody to work as a teacher, especially when they have really good quantitative skills (if you were admitted to a physics PhD program I'd say that puts you quite high). You could do a masters in data science if that is something that appeals to you. \n\nAnother option is to take a leave of absence (if available) to figure out what you'd like to do. I took it for 3 months, came back really fresh and with a more clear mind what I wanted to do.\n\nThat said, I had a similar experience my first/second year when I was taking classes and exams. I ended up working in a very small lab, on topics that I was really interested in, and with an adviser who gave me enormous freedom in types of projects I could work on. With a caveat that I'd need to be a TA to support myself. \n\n(FYI, I am in the US, PhD in physics, working in industry.)",

Honestly if you want to teach below that - just go grab a teaching credential or try substitute teaching at your school district. Move back home and live off your parents for a bit. be honest with them. You are smart but school just is not for you at this time. Maybe in the future research will become important to you",

I will say that a ton of people immediately advise quitting (and I was told the same at one point when i made a post as an undergrad going Through It) but for now I'm glad i stuck it out. the process of research and learning can be cool sometimes IF you're not a constant depressed and anxious fuck like i was my first two years\n\n(oh yeah and i don't plan on staying in academia long term and neither do a good deal of my friends -- but cool for us to be in ~academia for a few years)",

It was a nice program with lots of great people and great funding, but I had spent four years getting my bachelor's and two more getting my master's degree, and all six of those years I was in research labs busting my butt. Quite frankly, I had sat through enough classes about chemistry in the preceeding 6 years that the ones that they were making me take for my PhD were incredibly boring to me. \n\nThe idea of finishing my first semester and doing another semester of classes while attempting to get a foothold in research lab with covid happening while adjusting to a new place far away from my home.... While trying to move into my own place properly ( I was staying with my best friend) AND deal with some depression and my ADHD...\n\nSuffice to say that I spoke with some trusted people in my life and presented the situation to them and told them that I wanted to quit. These individuals said it was obvious I had thought it through and that I could always go to another PhD school in the future and that it was no wonder I was burned out after 6 years of academia. I decided that night that I was quitting, I think it was the beginning of October 2020. \n\nI politely emailed My department chair and research advisor (who had just accepted me into his research group, oops!) and informed them of my decision with a couple of reasons listed. I met with them and they talked with me and they were understanding. I emailed my supervisor for my teaching assistantship with my letter of resignation, which was basically just me saying that I was going to let my contract expire and continue teaching my classes I'd been assigned for the term. \n\nLess than two weeks after I made a decision I moved back home, stopped attending classes, and The only thing I did was to teach my remaining online classes (thankful that I managed to have my recitations online, woo).\n\n\nSo that's my experience. Now that I've had a year off to do other things and take my mind out of academia, I'm reapplying to PhD programs and hope to be attending next fall or thereabouts. As it turned out, I've just needed a break from it all, but I'm ready to give it one more try at another school closer to home!\n\nBest wishes, just remember to do what's best for you!",

Depending on where you teach, you may also deal with low pay, terrible admin, adversarial parents, students who are not having their basic needs met at home, and a whole host of other problems (and this is before you add in the effects of a global pandemic that severely stunted kids' emotional and academic growth).  I'm not saying this to discourage you, just consider really carefully before you commit the time, money and effort to pursue public school teaching.",
