  "text": "So, as some background, I started grad school back in 2019 as part of a Pharmaceutical Sciences PhD program. It was a bit difficult for me to adjust to everything at first (juggling classes, research, my TA position, ect.) which made it difficult for me to get in the lab. Then Covid hit. With my ADHD, I've often struggled to manage my time effectively, and during the pandemic it was difficult for me to both do classes from home *and* find time to go to the lab to do research. It had gotten to the point where, after two years in the program, I wasn't close to having something published. So, after talking with my PI, I decided to master out this past May and try to get a research position for a few years before maybe heading back to grad school for my PhD.\n\nRecently, I've been interviewing for a Research Assistant position in a university lab. The professor that runs the lab wants 2 letters of recommendation from me, so I sent her the contact information for my PI and a professor I worked with in my undergrad. I had already talked with both of them beforehand about letters, and both agreed to write me a letter of recommendation, though my PI wanted me to draft his letter for him (which was understandable, as he runs a big lab and is often busy). \n\nHowever, just recently I sent my PI the draft he requested, and he later replied saying that he didn't think it would be a good idea to give me a recommendation. Talking with him later over the phone, it seems that he believes that an honest letter from him would hurt my chances. He mentioned how I was at the bottom of a class he taught in my first semester (I got a C+), and how I've been late for seminars. Additionally, he pointed out how another student in his lab that mastered out did 50 reactions per week while I did less than 100 in my entire time there. He said he would still be willing to write me a letter of recommendation if I really wanted one, but since he wants to be honest the letter may reflect poorly on me.\n\nAt this point I'm not sure what to do. I know I underperformed in my Master's degree and his letter might hurt my chances, but I've already submitted him as a reference. Should I still use my PI as a reference? Reach out to the professor who runs the lab? \n\nFurthermore, if this job doesn't work out, I'm not sure what to do going forward. I've only worked under one other professor (the one I mentioned earlier from undergrad), and while I think I did good work under him, I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to get a research position with only one good reference, especially with a Master's and no recommendation from my PI. Can I still turn things around? I'm just worried my grad school performance has permanently torpedoed my chances of getting into research.",

      "text": "As hard as it may be to hear, your advisor is doing you a favor by not writing you this letter. They do not want to write a letter that will sink your chances. You could talk with him as some have suggested but he's not going to suddenly be impressed with you as you under performed. This is a lesson in asking for references. A letter of reference is not from any prof you know, but from one who is impressed with you. In the future, ask someone else to write your letters. As you already submitted his name, you can email the potential job contact and note that your PI is very busy so you would like to add a different person to your reference list. You don't need to tell them that the PI doesn't want to provide a letter. They may just move on to the new name. As you are applying to a non-academic job, you have more flexibility in who writes your letters. Good luck.",

      "text": "Academia can be very competitive, and while it's hard to tell someone that they're not well suited to it, I think that might be what your professor is getting at.\n\nHe's given you specific feedback that all point towards you struggling along this path in the future too, and you haven't shared (here) any personal growth to better manage your ADHD, work habits, or the rest of it. Maybe you've done a lot and COVID-imposed working styles set you back more than it did others. However, the person you describe who doesn't produce data, doesn't show for scheduled commitments, and doesn't perform well with classroom material at the graduate level is not in a place to be successful in a PhD. If this Research Assistantship is a stepping stone job to PhD, it might not be the right choice for you. \n\nUltimately you know your abilities and your goals, so you want this letter and this academic path, you need to bring data to yourself and your conversations with this professor. This evidence needs to say you're not the worker your professor has seen so far - you're better. And it needs to be real, not just a promise. Managing ADHD isn't about having good intentions to *really* try next time. You need strategies.",
