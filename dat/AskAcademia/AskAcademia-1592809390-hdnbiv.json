  "title:": "Why is academia such a hated field?",
  "text": "I've never seen another field (except law, perhaps) where the people involved despise their own field of work so much. This sub is itself filled with tons of discouraging posts. \"It pays peanuts\", \"work hours are inhuman\", etc. Even profs themselves are like \"Yeah, I'm really lucky to have this job, but...\"\n\nGenuinely sorry if I sound rude. Didn't mean to though. It's just that for a student of science who dreams of becoming a prof someday, the negativity gets tiring sometimes. I understand no job is all rosy, but if academia is really as bad as people make it out to be, why is it so saturated? \n\nI have doctors and vets in my family. They seem really, really proud of their professions despite all the hardships that come with them. Why don't people in academia feel the same way? Even the general public don't seem to look up to us the way they do to a doctor or a lawyer. They think we are just wasting taxpayers' money. It isn't that we work any less hard or are less \"intelligent\" than those in medicine or the military.\nThen why isn't our work appreciated? Aren't we the people who are supposed to be charting the course of humanity's future and making this world a better place?",

There is actually a lot of different research being done, especially in the sort of grey area between internal / cost accounting and more business management areas. However, for financial accounting (i.e. what most people think of when they think of accounting), a lot of research is concerned with the ever updating accounting standards. So IFRS is pretty world wide at this point, but you've also got UK GAAP, US GAAP, Australian GAAP etc. Quite a bit of research is done each time a new standard is published (usually along the lines of \"how does this affect companies in this industry - a case study\"), and harmonisation between IFRS and local GAAP is also a popular research area. Then if you go more conceptual (hello, this is my home), you've also got research being done into the conceptual framework and underlying philosophies of various accounting standard systems and what objectives they are actually working towards Vs what they are achieving. \n\nA lot of non-accountants (very understandably) assume that accounting is pretty black and white and (as you said) 'already solved', but accountants are slimier than so and know that unless they made the occupation significantly judgement based they would very quickly be replaced by software.",

The average taxpayer doesn't see any way in which they directly benefit from research in, say, most humanistic fields; so why should they fund it with \"their\" taxpayer dollars?\n\nIt doesn't matter if that research is benefitting another population, or working towards some greater good of generating more knowledge, or anything like that; the individualistic taxpayer isn't particularly interested in investing in the general betterment of society if they don't see how it will help themselves directly. (This is opposed to, say, using taxpayer dollars to pave the roads, which generally benefits everyone but which also has a visible and immediate impact on each taxpayer's daily life.) From that perspective, it makes total sense that a population with a very individualistic mindset wouldn't want their tax dollars going towards research that likely as not won't ever benefit them directly.\n\n\\*obviously these are both *vastly* over-simplified examples for the sake of the argument I'm making here, but I think the general idea holds water",

There has been a drive toward the casualisation of staff, whereby trying to get contracts to employ colleagues on permanent (US TT) style contracts is ever harder, and instead we expect junior staff to exist on a sequence of fixed-term contracts with limited opportunities to climb the - already deflated - pay spines, and, as a result of their temporary contract status, hinder their ability to even apply for grants which might help them find better positions.\n\nIn terms of research funding, the amount of funding becoming available has been cut and cut. The methods of allocating funding have become comical. For example, int the UK, the Natural Environment Research Council, who award all government funding for geology, earth sciences, environmental sciences, etc had so many people applying for funding, and so little money to give out that they started requiring universities to filter who was applying., So now to apply to NERC you have to first of all go through an internal review process. And many universities are limited in the number of grants they can submit each round (perhaps as few as 1 or 2). So you can be in a situation where you ahve a department of 10 or 15 people, but only one of you can submit a proposal to NERC each round. Once you get through that filter your success rate at the NERC panel is currently about 7 or 8%. Proposals are graded from 1-10. In the past if you scored a 7 or 8 you had a fighting chance of getting funded. These days if you don't have a 9 you have no chance, and even a 9 just becomes a roll of the dice as to whether you get fuinded. \n\nOur work - when we do publish it - gets used by publishers to sustain a toxic model of publishing houses; our grants get squeezed for publication fees, while our university libraries get charged to access the publications that we end up having to pay to publish.\n\nThe HE sector got co-opted by suits in the 90s and they are milking it to death. That said, there are few other opportunities for me to work in my field, and no other opportunities for me to teach at this level.",

Long way to go.\n\nI almost wonder what will happen with the coming 'trough' of budget shortfalls. So many of the suit's calculations were based on BAU indefinitely. With so many undergrads now suddenly reevaluating whether college is really worth it, especially with courses being online, a lot of schools are going to fail over the next 2-3 years (my undergrad put out an email to alumni that played down the risk, but reading between the lines revealed that they are seriously concerned about the long term prospects of the school - and they were up until this point pretty solid financially) \n\nYour Harvards, Oxfords, MITs, they'll all be fine. State schools might see some campuses close, maybe temporarily, probably permanently. But your 'regionally ranked' private schools are at serious risk of facing an academic mass extinction. Who knows what kind of knock-on effect this will have on the rest of the industry.\n\nThe obvious first result is a depression of academic wages even further than they are already. But if the loss of enthusiasm for HE becomes a trend that outlives covid, then I can see this spilling over to rest of the academic sector a well. Fewer universities and students means fewer studies (bad) which could mean more grant money available for each study (good). It could also mean that the parasitic industries that built themselves around academia - SAT/ACT, digital libraries/\"publishing\" houses that charge for both access and submission, textbooks - may no longer be viable without the volume of students they've come to expect.\n\nNow, I'm just spit balling here. There is a serious financial crisis facing schools worldwide over the next 1-2 years at least. While it will be painful regardless, there is an opportunity to potentially create some real systematic change. Off the top of my head, a 'crowd sourced' platform to submit and peer-review papers and studies may just be enough to break the back of companies like Elsevier. Especially if you could decentralize the hosting and make it entirely open source so that there is almost no legal surface to target.",

      "text": "I think there's few reasons. One is the discrepancy between what you thought you were going to do, and the reality of academia. As you say, when you're early in training you think you're going to be \"charting the course of humanity's future and making this world a better place\". People who value that goal can put up with the low pay relative to training because the goal seems so exciting and worthwhile. After being involved in the way research actually works and seeing the ability and behaviour of people who you once believed were the leaders in your field, it can be pretty disillusioning. Personally, I've ended up feeling that while I would love to be \" charting the course of humanity's future and making this world a better place\", I'm actually just throwing together research that fits within the purview of the current grant but contributes very little to the future of humanity.\n\nAnother big difference between academia and lawyers/medical doctors is the stability. While in your early 20's the idea of having to work overseas and moving around doesn't seem like an issue and actually sounds exciting. By the time you're doing it, it gets a lot more difficult to put up with. There are parts of your life that really suffer, or just get a lot more difficult relative to the stable career of a lawyer/medical doctor. In those professions you can probably get a job in whatever city you want, and you get a long term salaried position rather than 2/3 year contracts.\n\nWith respect to how it's perceived by the general public I think there's actually a lot of variability in the response. Plenty of people think being a researcher/professor is very impressive, but there are definitely people who think the way you mentioned. Maybe I'm cynical but I think a large part of that is to do with salary. To a large degree, people venerate professions that earn lots of money, and that's not really the situation for most academics. Also, people interact with lawyers and medical doctors in their daily lives so they personally benefit from that expertise directly, that's not the case for researchers.",

I just don't understand this sentiment - If doctor don't complain you think it's because they feel similar issues but just don't complain about it? No. Academics are unhappy/complaining for real reasons. If another profession had real reasons to complain they would too. \n\nAcademia is structured with an intense hierarchy, where the salary range for the first ~15 years is between $35,000-50,000 (lab tech to postdoc) which covers zero years of experience to having a freaking PhD lol - very little material reward for increased education/experience. This breeds contempt in any profession! Since you're comparing other professions, imagine a lawyer needing a BA, then law school is 6 years (PhD timeline) and then you're still in a training position making 50 grand while other lawyers tell you that you should just be happy you're carrying out your amazing country's constitution yet with only a chance to make the big lawyer bucks and the goal job later. It's a gamble that doesn't pay off for a lot of people in academia so there is of course complaints. \"Just be happy you do what you love\" \"your still in a training position\" \"your degree is basically free so you don't have loans to pay off (read: so you don't deserve more money)etc are just excuses to not fix a broken system and frankly I find oppressive illogical and demeaning. I said what I said.\n\nThen 1 in 20 postdocs or whatever pops out to be a professor somewhere, so there is a lot of \"failure\" and/or struggling to succeed so of course there is widespread bitterness. Then those new professors instantly justify all of their hardships because they made it(!) making it difficult to share empathy with their lab members because they toughed it out why can't you.  I had a postdoc friend who complained constantly about how little money they made and that the \"training position\" excuse was hogwash. Then he became a professor and bemoaned how expensive postdocs were and how little they accomplish and how he has 10x responsibilities now as professor but only makes 2x as much as he did as a postdoc. Like dude how did you completely forget what it was like to be a postdoc less than a year ago?? Yes you're on the other side but this should show you how broken the system is not that you should resent your lab members. The cycle continues.\n\nI completely agree that having a more positive attitude about your workplace and profession is helpful all around(!) but I strongly disagree that it also means you should be content with your system - we need change and people are unhappy for real reasons, not because we don't have mental fortitude to be happy like medical doctors do.",

Usually the pay bump going from mid-level experiences (roughly a postdoc) to manager (TT assistant professor) runs between 0.3  to 0.5x. Whereas in academia it isn't uncommon to get an actual 2x bump going from postdoc to TT.",

It also leads to a huge misunderstanding of what an academic does and how much they get paid?\n\nThe general public knows very little about the research aspect of academia and judge academics mostly on pedagogy. And when college is seen as hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of \u201cinvestment,\u201d classes and teachers seem more like a product. There is this idea that academics are supposed to serve \u201cstudents\u201d rather than the actual material and pedagogy but surprise! That\u2019s not what actually happens and lots of times students fail. And instead of blaming failiure on the lack of prep in primary and secondary education, academics themeselvs get the blame. Then general public gets this idea that academics are just \u201cpompus people\u201d who are out of touch and who makes SO much money only to \u201cfail\u201d students.\n\nDoctors may be pompus but at least they save lives.\n\nAnd lawyers? If I\u2019m being honest, they aren\u2019t that publically esteemed either because of the terror that they are all liars that will do any means necessary.\n\nThe last thing I want to add is propoganda...how many tv shows, commercials, and public dispalys feature doctors, lawyers, and detectives? The answer is a lot. I can name 5 doctor shows without thinking too hard. But academia? There is little to no mainstream propoganda for academics. The closest thing is big bang theory and....yea",

Doctors do complain about their work hours and low wage (in the beginning) a lot. But later on they gain experience and often open their own private practice or work in a clinic, where they can choose the conditions.  \n\nUnless you're a senior scientist, you can't really do that. Working as a proffessor can grant you a decent life, but how many are there compared to all scientists? Teaching is overall incredibly time consuming, so can be experiments. People in academia usually do both. Many institutions don't pay overtime. On top of that, you're expected to move around the world to share knowledge with other scientists and leave all your loved ones behind. It also requires you to have no commitments. This is very hard, as you give a lot and gain not that much for your personal growth. That's the easiest way to burn out. Especially if you're a woman and want family one day.  \n\nI can't imagine finishing a PhD at 32, having family and then going back to the lab 3 or 5 years later. One of our proffessors actually tried to talk us out of applying for PhD for this reason. I, for example, love science and very seriously considered a PhD.... but I can't do mobility because I have commitments where I live. I don't want to work up to 10 hours a day because of experiments. I don't want to work weekends and give up my personal life completely. And right now I need a surgery, which will get me out of work for at least 2 months and there's no compensation from my employer. Guess I'll end up on street or something, Idk. It's frustrating but at the end of the day, every job in academia is different. If you're lucky, you'll be offered good conditions and you'll happily accept.",

Most of us never see a permanent contract, keep jumping from place to place and eventually need to find a second career after having sacrificed our entire 20s and 30s to academia. After having made it through the worst part of this and more or less securing my career, it still made me sick to see young physicists entering this spiral. I felt terrible about encouraging them to continue on this path because it is impossible to tell who will make it in the end and who will end up miserable with regrets\u2026\n> \n> Science itself is severely suffering from the poor working conditions and lack of genuine career prospects. I personally found it extremely hard to focus on the science while constantly being worried about the duration and location of my next contract. #PublishOrPerish. Interactions with and among colleagues are often dominated by the drive to \u201cshow off\u201d. Very few people focus on removing misunderstandings or ask honest questions in order to fill their knowledge gaps. The general atmosphere is dominated by doubt instead of trust. We constantly need to outshine our peers. Better to demonstrate superficial knowledge of broad subjects than to focus on the details of a deep problem. Your next result needs to be \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d, otherwise you\u2019re out of a job. But produce it and have it published at least one year before your contract ends because that\u2019s when you need to apply for a new one. Science has become a show\u2026\n> \n> I see absolutely no chance that any of the above will change any time soon.\n\nThis isn't just bitter complaining from someone who \"didn't make it\". These are the thoughts of someone who has obtained a professorship at a prestigious institute working on quantum gravity, an extremely difficult subfield in terms of both its technical complexity and its extremely high rate of professional attrition due to its extremely small amount of funding and positions available. So this is someone who made it through the gauntlet to get the dream academic job, and is now leaving academia due to what they consider to be a toxic work environment.\n\nGranted not all academic fields are this bad, but it does offer some insight into the problems which arise in academia.",

      "text": "As someone in Legal Academia....FML ;)\n\nFor my specific niche though, academia isn't respected as much as the private sector pays you way more, against usually better secondary labour conditions. The work hours in academia here are murder, there is a high reliance on grants, job contracts are uncertain, legal scholars fall into roughly two categories 'scholars' and 'lawyers' and the two cannot stand each other. All in all it is a pretty toxic mix. However, my generation onward has a more relaxed attitude and I get the feeling that the \"lawyers who want a prof. title\" are slowly out of fashion, leaving just the scholars. The freedom is amazing and even though my work feels ever-ongoing, I wouldn't really go into the private sector.\n\nI am always brutally honest to the prospective PhD's though. You need to love teaching, learning and writing, because you won't get your kicks from any of the other things offered.",

      "text": "Imo the lack of rights you have as a PhD student contributes a lot. As a result there is a lot of abuse that probably wouldn't be tolerated to such a large extent in the industry. I've met professors who couldn't make it in a practical job and went into academia.\n\nFor example, in my country you have a minimum of vacation days. It's a legal right... Unless you're a PhD student. PhD students (in my country) have a vague statute between employee and student. Vacations should be agreed upon with your supervisor. If your supervisor doesn't want to grant you your vacation, HR does nothing if your a PhD student. If you work in another position at our university, HR does intervene if you don't get your legal vacation days. It lays the ground work for a very abusive situation. Similarly, depending on whether the research grant belongs to your supervisor or to you, your supervisor has final say on all decisions, while your PhD depends on it. In my case, this has led to my supervisor putting a lot of pressure on me to do unethical practices and him making such grave errors with my data that I didn't finish in time. The dean, the ombudsperson and every possible organ knows and my professor has admitted to being in the wrong. Yet there are no consequences for him while I'm the one who hasn't got my PhD yet and I'm the one working on it voluntarily on top of two other jobs. The moment I decide to stop and not get my PhD, I know my supervisor will publish with my data and will take all the credit for my hard work.\n\nI absolutely love doing research, but for me that lack of rights as a PhD student is what makes academia horrible.",

      "text": "Because of a few reasons stated. . the work is very long and difficult and the pay does not match that. It makes people feel undervalued. A medical doctor will make two or three times as much working similar or less hours. Also it requires a post doc, sometimes a long one hardly making any money at all. While your friends with a BS degree make double your income lol. \n\nSecond, the funding system is crazy. Apply for NIH funds or else you can't be a prof. Not only that but those grants RO1 are incredibly difficult to obtain. You maybe get one or two shots at it. If you don't get it then you can't be tenured. If you can't be tenured you have to quit and search for a position at a different University. But they see that you didn't get tenure at the last place and probably won't hire you. I've seen this where people end up in lifelong lecture positions which pay even less and are yearly contracts because they couldn't get that grant. And the reason the market is over saturated is because universities have paired down how many tenure tracks they offer now. So now they only offer a few. It's cheaper for them to hire lecturers. \n\nThis leaves with a scenario where to be successful you have to work like mad to get tenured. Like 10-12 hour days for years including weekends to insure you get that grant and get published. Otherwise the cards are stacked against you. It's a long difficult path that is not really rewarded at the end. You essentially need 10-15 papers with a home run paper in there like nature science or cell plus finding to really guarantee you land a tenured spot. \n\nEven the major contributions to science these days is all by private companies not really by academic scientists now. The main goal of academic scientists is to train the next gen of scientists not really make ground breaking discoveries. That's pretty rare. Even Nobel prize winners is mostly just people working in the right field at the right time finding something important essentially by stumbling into it. \n\nSo combine that situation of extremely competitive, burn out, low pay, low public recognition, and minimal contribution to the field leads to a bunch of people who are miserable. Science is a great field and it's good to get people excited about it. Every job has the daily grind but in this field some people have a hard time finding the positives. Just depends what you want in a career and what's important to you. The best thing about the job is if you manage to get tenured you have life long job security.",

That's not really the way to end up super satisfied with the path you took in life, even if you would have liked it a lot if you'd arrived at the same destination differently. I myself went to grad school because the local economy crashed and I suddenly couldn't find anything but service jobs and I needed something to do while I waited for things to get better--and then I was successful enough in grad school that I stated. I didn't really know what I was getting into, because....\n2. the mental image and the lived realities of the job are just SO different. (Grad school itself is close enough to college that there's less of a shock there.) I wouldn't be surprised if an office job were often boring, or frustrating, because... duh, office jobs. I wouldn't be surprised if being a lawyer was incredibly taxing and required working almost every weekend. I wouldn't be surprised if working on a political campaign involved, yes, a lot of political maneuvering. But it turns out that as an academic I am ALSO often bored, frustrated, and trying to maneuver impossible political situations, and I work almost all the time. It's just not what I (and I think many people) pictured. And yet it's hard to leave because....\n3. People are constantly telling you how lucky you are. Best job security in the world, no? Get to \"spend your life thinking about interesting things, talking to interesting people,\" right? And \"Do you know how many people try and can't make it? How many would kill to be where you are?\" This might make a small percentage of us feel better but not most of us. Try it, next time a friend is complaining about his/her insensitive/selfish/domineering/whatever male partner. \"He doesn't have a lot of credit card debt. He doesn't live at home. Do you know how many guys do? How many women would kill for what you have?\" Now imagine that not just you but almost everyone she tried to talk to responded the same way. How do you think she feels about her relationship now, better or worse? And yet, at the same time--people are vulnerable to other people's (perceived) judgments and expectations! Chances are she won't feel happier with him--but she'll be worried about breaking up with him, too. Everyone else thinks she should be happy--maybe the problem is her. Maybe he really is the best she can do. Etc.",

Most researchers want nothing more than a salary that is enough to live on and time to think about research. It would be easy to implement, and pretty cost effective (think how productive we could be under those circumstances).  But we are living under an occupation, to put it slightly hyperbolically, by the business world. I think this goes a long way to explaining both the general unhappiness of academics and the perception of academia in the general population. Anyone who reflects on the state of academia is aware of the situation and of how it \"should\" be. This comparison causes ennui. Meanwhile, the constant representation of academia as the R&D/training arm of the business world makes the general population feel like our contribution to society should be described in dollar amounts. It doesn't help that the prevailing political position of our age is that everything can be described in dollar amounts.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve heard different things when it comes to specific complaints and I chalk that up to depending on what field you\u2019re in. But there\u2019s a couple of common arguments that I\u2019ve seen across the board: \n\n1) Politics. Now I\u2019d consider myself extremely left leaning, even left of liberal. But I absolutely agree that the \u201civory tower\u201d metaphor plays in to a lot of academic jobs. Academia is absolutely a bubble, and like any other select community the competition can become ruthless. Especially considering that each university has specific tenure requirements that rely on student evals, faculty evals, etc, word can spread fast if the up and coming tenure track faculty member is not up to par. Hell, word can spread fast period. You piss someone off, someone pisses you off, egos start competing, and people will be able to tell/will probably find out eventually. Even between full time professors, things can get ugly when it comes to vying for certain students, maintaining a certain level of prestige which often means churning out accomplishment after accomplishment, or publication after publication, etc. But really, and especially at bigger institutions where it\u2019s all kind of nebulous and you have bigger departments, the political power plays and ego trips can get the best of disillusioned professors. Even issues and run ins with the deans and administrative staff and get a lot of professors down. \n\n2) Funding. Sometimes the salary for certain professorships don\u2019t last a full year, and especially if you\u2019re a researching professor, this basically spells constant grant applications and renewals which add a whole new time commitment and stressor to the ins and outs of things. Securing grant money is a big task, especially if you\u2019re trying to buy new equipment, go on a specific trip, or students are relying on you for funding. Also, most professors don\u2019t even make *that great* of a salary to begin with, so the constant need for extra money can take a lot out of people. \n\n3) Admin can be bitches to work with. Sometimes you get stuck doing a lot more administrative work if you happen to land a title of department head or dean. Again, you\u2019re met with bureaucratic work like handling student complaints, dealing with scheduling issues and staffing issues, allocating funds for the department, etc. All that on top of being a major primary contact for people who have questions, such as grad students, incoming faculty, etc. \n\n\nGranted, I don\u2019t know much. My parents were professors for about 15 years and I happen to be pretty close with my research advisor. Going to a small liberal arts school where everyone is close, you hear a lot sometimes about academic politics. I def know that I started out college thinking a professorial post was my final destination, and am about to graduate next year totally disillusioned with the entire system. So my bias is definitely wrapped up in this post, feel free to take it with a grain of salt. \n\nI totally understand being over the negativity, and the thing is that until I experienced a lot of the power tripping bullshit that professors pulled, I felt very similar. It seems like a decent plushy job, why tf is everyone complaining? \n\nA better question might be to ask why the hell does academic burnout happen as quick as it does, and what factors of the system could we change as future professors to ensure that people in this career field actually enjoy their line of work? That\u2019s something that I heard once that kind of resonated with me amidst all the negative energy. Knowing that there\u2019s an opportunity to make some changes and be a positive influence if I get to that place. \n\nTLDR, it\u2019s a dog eat dog world and not everyone in academia is super supportive of  or excited by your work as you are.",

      "text": "I can maybe speak to exactly what you\u2019re observing as someone who left their intentions of academic physics to pursue a clinical job in a field known as medical physics.\n\n1. It is a thankless profession with essentially no societal recognition or pay commensurate to your ability and effort. Seems like you\u2019re aware of this, a lot of the recognition part boils down to the pay. Can\u2019t begin to tell you how often blind dates and the like in graduate school would just assume I was childish or something when they realized what I was mentally capable of and that I wasn\u2019t aiming to be some sort of prop trader or something. I\u2019m only really speaking for people in physics but the fact of the matter is if you get a tenured professorship you\u2019ve passed some of the most insane talent/work ethic/luck filters any person could ever go through. The end goal is a job no one really cares that you have outside of your academic circles and a paycheck that\u2019s less than half of what you could probably be earning. These issues are orders of magnitude worse for the overwhelming majority of PhDs who will not *ever* be tenured faculty, this relates to...\n\n2. The career has literally no big picture certainty to it unless you\u2019re tenure track and even then it\u2019s really not matched by what you could pull down through your talents in industry. Just how long can you be strung out on postdoc contracts. How many times are you willing to hop around making near poverty wages, watching your childhood friends be successful and buy homes and have children. Will you ever even be able to start a family in this lifestyle? Do you dare buy a house you can hardly afford when you have no actual reason to believe you\u2019ll be at this institution for more than two years? Things like multiple divorces are sadly really common in academia.\n\n3. There\u2019s no career certainty. Publish or perish. Oh you had an awesome idea and did entirely valid and brilliant work but it turns out the answer wasn\u2019t the sexy choice? Turns out our understanding of the universe is pretty solid and you spend more time finding out that stuff isn\u2019t interesting as opposed to stuff is interesting. So you just spent a year investigating something and got a perfectly scientifically valid result that no one will publish. It means nothing to your career now. By definition you\u2019re looking into things people don\u2019t know, can\u2019t even tell you how many times in grad school weeks or months of serious and dedicated effort were put into just finding out something couldn\u2019t be done. Bonus points if you find out it has been done but no one publishes negative results!\n\n4. You have very, very little assurance that what you\u2019re doing will ever make any impact. Even loads of brilliant physicists who did extremely impactful stuff in retrospect spent most of their life with the community thinking they\u2019d gone after pointless theoretical masturbation. Maxwell is an example, his equations set the stage for decades of inquiry after him. This is even more true now with the publish or perish model where you are encouraged to just pump out as many low quality publications as possible at many institutions. People like doctors and stuff see that their equally taxing efforts are making a day to day difference. Odds are that new algorithm you\u2019re writing or solar panel you\u2019re designing will get you a conference poster and that\u2019s about all. The majority of academic research is frankly not impactful.\n\n5. Politics at the institutional level, field-wide level, and national level. At the institutional level you have to remember most academics were nerds. Being smart was their thing, they now have an outlet to amaze themselves with how smart they are and trivial stuff like coauthorship orderings on low tier conference blurbs can become multi year dramas you\u2019d think Shakespeare concocted. At the field level it\u2019s more of the same but now throw in the ability for personal grievances to impact things like grant funding or paper reviews. At the national level you have the ability for a congressional budget cut amounting to a rounding error to decimate your entire career. National politics also affects the societal lack of appreciation in the US at least.",

That said, I know I am lucky to have been in the right place and time to land my job. The job market is really tough, so I don\u2019t like to point out how fabulous the job is when so many people struggle unsuccessfully for years to find a position. Of course, it\u2019s not perfect (what job is?), and some universities are more flawed than others. Those places make for more interesting stories, I suspect. But for many of us, the job of professor is a dream come true. If I were a student now, I would still work hard to try to become a professor, but I would also have a back-up plan for other careers that I know I would also enjoy.",

If you\u2019re not at least a little familiar with hiring, promotion, and job security patterns in higher ed, stop all dreams of an academic career and educate yourself before you take another step down that path. Perhaps you\u2019ve heard (tongue in cheek); professors stay in academia for the same reason people stay in abusive marriages...for the kids. I tell aspiring profs the same thing I do about getting a tattoo...don\u2019t do it. Its highly personal and should never be done because of someone else\u2019s opinion or influence. That being said, I have 16 tattoos and have been a University prof (ft & ad) for 22 yrs. I love my job.",
