Why should private companies profiteer from science; journals contribute nothing - peer review and editing is largely free, research is paid for by the public, for which they charge exorbitant fees to access or publish (depending on journal and publishing model) it's an utter disgrace. I say this as research intensive academic, I refuse to review or publish in for profit journals, I only do editorial work for society journals where proceeds fund grants, scholarships, meetings etc. Good on Alexandra Elbakyan!",

There are vague concerns I've seen others express about whether copies of papers downloaded from SciHub are legit (i.e., that someone may have uploaded a fake paper using the doi of a real paper, etc), but I've never seen anyone provide an example of this actually happening.\n\nUltimately, there needs to be some middle ground. The economic model of most academic publishers is not sustainable and it's extremely exploitative, but at the same time publishers do add value to manuscripts (not anywhere near enough to legitimize what most charge) so there needs to be some mechanism for publishers to at least recoup their losses. SciHub fills a niche at the moment, but the hope that most of us have (I think) is that it won't have to exist forever as more authors, universities, and funding agencies push back on the academic publishers and we more toward a more sustainable model.",

It took several days of effort on my end to simply \"correct\" what they did back to how I had it. And I am an experienced latex user and this thing was perfectly formatted for the journal - the eventual published version was exactly what I had, with the extra steps of having to go back and forth with an editor.

There are tangible costs associated with publishing and this needs to be considered.

Organizing of reviews may or may not be done by volunteers, i.e., some journals pay their editors and associate editors, though this is the exception more than the rule. Hosting is the obvious one and providing some implicit guarantee that this hosting is in perpetuity (i.e., your article won't disappear from the face of the Earth in 10 years time). Though it's unclear why, many journals still do print physical copies, though I can't really imagine too many people who would be upset if they stopped doing this and reduced their prices. I am in no way trying to argue that the fees most charge are in anyway reasonable, but it's also naive to pretend like organizing and keeping a journal going is a zero-cost endeavor. Someone needs to pay, whether in money or time (e.g., a diamond open access model where virtually everything is \"free\" because people volunteer to do traditionally paid positions, like copy editing and formatting, for free).",

Also, LaTeX is not the standard in many fields, and conversion of author Word docs to typeset text does require both labor and human judgement.\n\n(I've copyedited hundreds of articles for one society, and the \"confusing ungrammatical mess full of typos\" flavor far, far outnumbers those nice clean articles. Most of the nice clean ones have already had a professional editor work on them on the author's side. The editing is as conservative as possible, but it's not trivial. That said, I think it's obscene that journals that DON'T provide copyediting charge as much or more than those that do. And a bad copyeditor can certainly make the process worse rather than better.)",

They farm out submissions to reviewers and coordinate turning the feedback into an actual decision. Typesetting is I think mostly done by the authors using existing styles, which are themselves generally Word templates or LaTeX class files developed by some academic somewhere, again, as a volunteer activity.\n\nOther than hosting, the main thing I can think of is printing. If you still need to mail out printed and bound copies to subscribers (and why you would, I have no idea), then there's a whole process of dealing with printers and shipping and whatever else. I think you'd get fairly universally applause if you offered to kick the publisher to the curb, make everything free, and in return have to give up printed copies though.",

In 2013 it cost $4.5 million a year. For PMC, you can submit your pre-print or the journal will submit a final copy. Only 20% of articles were submitted by authors, yet 60% of their costs were in converting these author submissions into online format. Granted, these are Word files being submitted, but I have never seen a biomedical/life science journal use LaTeX. My point is that doing the copy editing and formatting evidently does cost some money (though I can't see it costing $2000 a paper).",

                      "text": "For what it's worth, copyediting alone on the cheap end involves a non-staff subcontractor who gets somewhere between $150-400/paper, depending on length. Add in a layer of admin and logistics from the contracting company, then consider that this is presumably still cheaper than in-house copyeditors who get benefits. Proofreading is a separate step with separate people. Ditto typesetting. There is also the cost of updating and providing tech support for all the editing and production software (much of which does get outsourced to India).\n\n$2000/paper is probably high, but for a paper that's 25-40 manuscript pages, not submitted in LaTeX, that gets copyedited and proofread, there is a lot more expense than people seem to think. Certainly far, far more than $90.\n\nWhat's appalling to me is that the journals that provide the bare minimum of services charge the same or more. Academic publishing profits ARE nuts. But it's not the generally fairly low-paid copyediting/proofreading/production staff who are making those excessive profits. Many of them would be better off financially working retail.\n\nI'm not sure what the system should look like. There are already huge subsets of authors who have to pay for editing on the front end to get their papers readable enough for review. How much copyediting is needed post-acceptance also varies widely, and many open access journals seem to just shrug and leave it to the authors, which means that basic grammatical comprehensibility can be quite varied within a single journal. This doesn't seem like a fair or good system to me, but neither does eliminating all editorial and typesetting services and just living with whatever authors can manage.",

I do see SciHub as a way to encourage open access in other fields that do not have this status quo. But I also feel that we should encourage preprints and open access more widely. The fact that researchers have to turn to pirating to keep up to date shows a failure of the system. I think this can be recognized regardless of your views on pirating. We as researchers get no money for publication nor do we for reviewing or editing. The open access in my field has also not hindered journals or conferences, which are still highly lucrative. In fact I'll argue that it has only increased how lucrative these endeavours are.",
