Schwab and published 3 Nov 2010. What makes the paper includes the authors extensive knowledge and his consolidation of this knowledge in a manner that is both concise and inspiring. The figures make the paper intelligible and far more accessible than would be otherwise. Many authors could do well to learn from him and focus on creating figures to illustrate clear points to the readers. When I say his knowledge is extensive, I can elaborate by pointing out he sets a great example for us, modeling how beneficial it can be to investigate genetic lineage of a trait. In sum, I feel the author actually read many, if not all, the papers he cited. 1) knowing your content 2) be an outstanding teacher (deeply care and be experienced conveying this appropriately; seek to inspire) 3) have top-of-line images (and avoid consolidating multiple topics in one image if do do so impairs clarity or forces you to leave critical elements out of the image).",

Famous PIs have a huuuge advantage and can get away with a lot of speculation and poorly backed up big claims, for which small PIs would get challenged by reviewers and shut down by editors in shiny journals. The budgets available are also a massive difference. Becoming a famous PI needs some skill clearly as a prerequisite, but many people would have the level, so even more than that it's just being at the right place at the right time. Like getting trained from a famous PI in the first place (something one does not realize when enrolling in a PhD), and inheriting a project that turns out to be something important for the field with lots of follow ups, rather than a dead end. Or making an incredibly lucky discovery out of nowhere, happens but quite rare.",

And it sounds victimized; like there's nothing you can do, you don't have the privilege to publish in those journals. \n\nI came from a big famous lab and we had papers rejected from the top journals all the time.

IF 2-4 for smaller papers). From a big lab, you add 10 to these IF for the same papers at all levels: small papers end up in mid tier journals around IF 10, polished papers with hard work but not amazing results end up in a 20, and great papers actually make it in Nature/Cell/Science.

      "text": "I'm not sure I can think offhand of a particular paper and structure is somewhat field-dependent and article-type-dependent, but the two things I wish authors (at least in STEM and social sciences - humanities are a different beast) would work on even more than using clear language are (i) figures and charts (the classic author on visual presentation of information is Edward Tufte) and (ii) using tables appropriately (where they are genuinely the best way to present information) and laying them out clearly and logically so it's easy for the reader to interpret them and pull out information. Tables and figures are often the part of the paper the reader relies on most to understand the key points, as well as what they might use for comparing to their own results or rerunning calculations\n\nI see SO, SO MANY terrible, confusing ones - misleading pie charts (I.e., when options are nonexclusive and therefore add up to more than 100%, although I admit to struggling to think of any good time to use a pie chart, personal prejudice), huge walls of unreadable bar charts that would be better as tables of numbers in supplemental material, diagrams that are really hard to follow or look really crude, multipart figures where it's not clear which panel letter goes with which panel, tables that are two totally disparate sets of data jammed together with misleading column heads....etc. etc. Making sure figures/charts can be interpreted in a black and white printout and by people with colorblindness (I.e., not red/green bars of approximately the same value with no other patterning to distinguish them) are also good practices that are too rarely followed.\n\nI wish I had a go-to source on table layout, but unfortunately I do not, just five years of editing frequently very messy tables to teach me what not to do. If anyone has a nice essay or book to recommend on displaying tabular data, please let me know!\n\nRe: clarity of writing, whether or not you can get away with relatively \"plain language\" depends on the journal and your status and the expectations of your field and how good you are at writing plainly while also demonstrating that you know what you're doing. You don't have to and shouldn't completely avoid the technical terms of your field - just think about when you need a technical term and when there is a simpler way to express the same idea.\n\nBut it IS generally possibly to avoid overuse of abbreviations (which can easily blur together for the reader if there are a lot of similar ones). I personally find it helpful as a reader when writers are very sparing with abbreviations, only using them when they are standard or very helpful for making the text more concise (e.g., long chemical names). If the paper is about Really Awesome Widgets, it's a lot easier to read and follow if \"really awesome widgets\" is spelled out in the text or called \"widgets\" instead of \"RAWs.\" \n\nIt's also often helpful to give a brief introduction of key concepts at first mention, unless the journal is very specialized and it's assumed everyone knows them (I do interdisciplinary work in an interdisciplinary fields and so far have published in broader-scope journals, so I always briefly define theories, all but very common methods, etc.).",
