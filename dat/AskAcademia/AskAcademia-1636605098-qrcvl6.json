Essentially just counts of bug offspring and graphs of those counts.\n\n I don\u2019t mean that in a sarcastic way, I\u2019ve just seen laptops bought for grad students or techs who don\u2019t have a computer at home, and some of them take them home so I was wondering where the line is drawn for academia, in general? Personally, I have a $200 basic laptop (yes I regret it now that I\u2019ve worked with the computers my boss bought through grants and not my personal money\ud83d\ude05). LOVE that my lab lets me borrow the laptop when I work from home, they\u2019re amazing for that. \n\nIs it really that bad to use a work computer to do personal stuff? I have my personal email linked to my work desktop, and my boss told me it was ok to watch Netflix on the lab iPad while doing insect stocks (they take a full day of mindless insect maintenance).",
