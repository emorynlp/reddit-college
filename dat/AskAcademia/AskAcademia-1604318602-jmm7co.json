You have to have a purpose and goal.\n2. Look at the editing and word-smithing, the technical part, as a way to get your ideas across. I think too many people feel like writing \"properly\" is just something you do to follow the rules. But instead you have to look at it as a tool for getting people to pay attention to your ideas rather than being distracted by mechanical errors or bad organization.",

Not surprisingly, I found myself very distracted with setting up my lab and getting started with teaching. The Pomodora technique helped me keep from getting too far behind on the review article. Here is what I did:\n\n1. Wrote an outline of the article that included all of the section and sub-section headings that I thought were needed.\n2. Organized a bunch of citations that I thought I needed into each sub-section.\n3. Used the Pomodoro technique to force myself to complete individual paragraphs using the headings and citation organization that I had already constructed. I found that one or two Pomodoro cycles was enough to get a solid paragraph chunk done.\n4. Because I had already imposed some organization on the article, I hopped from paragraph to paragraph if I felt myself getting bogged down in any particular section.\n\nThis maybe brings up another important point about academic writing. Don't try to write things from start to finish. It's too easy to get intimidated by all the blank pages in front of you or get bogged down. Write yourself a strong outline to start with, and then write individual pieces as you find the motivation and inspiration. You can go back later and edit to make sure everything flows together.",

I\u2019ve found it\u2019s much better to just get something written down and use that as a starting point. Even if it\u2019s not amazing, I have something to build on later. It\u2019s much, much easier to work from an existing draft. \n\nAlso, if I feel like I\u2019m getting writer\u2019s block, I\u2019ll shift my writing to something simpler. Sometimes it\u2019s even an answer on /r/AskScience that gets me going again, because I can sit and write about the basics of my areas of expertise. It\u2019s some combination of reminding myself why I love what I do and the satisfaction of getting some words on the page. I\u2019m sure that method won\u2019t work for everyone, but it does seem to help me.",

      "text": "Writing does not have to be soul wrenching. Writing  offers challenges, the opportunity for growth, the chance to be absorbed in the activity, and the exhilaration of success. Like any task that requires skill, writing has frustrating moments. Like any other skilled activity, the more your skill increases, the greater the ratio of good experience to frustration. It'll never be easy, but it can have many positive moments. Writing is what Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi would call a flow activity--activities that offer the best experiences in people's lives.\n\nKeep focused on the stuff that interests you--the research and ideas that you (hopefully) want to share with others. Write as if you're sharing your ideas with someone who would be interested and enthusiastic. Don't get bogged down in technical details or thinking about potentially hostile audiences until you're closing in on the final draft.",

Also,  it will let you finish the first draft faster,  so you get more motivated.\n\nWhen you enhance over the first draft it will be much easier and less effort.  You already have the main material.\n\nAbstract is the last thing after you are satisfied with your draft. Just summarize very briefly the problem,  methodology and results.
