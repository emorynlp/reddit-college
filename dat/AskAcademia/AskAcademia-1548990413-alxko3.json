Please help me with some phrasings or general advice for saying no to students (keeping in mind it is a small department with \\~10 incoming students per year, I am a new professor with funding and not many students, etc so I can't just tell white lies).

Then they had me come in and talk to them about what I'd read, and summarized. \n\nIf he can't hold a reasonably competent conversation with you after that, which he may well not if he's as insufferable as he sounds, I suggest telling him that he's not ready because he just doesn't have the background understanding yet.

Sit down with the student and explain Latin roots, pointing out how the words are broken down by syllable. Please use an actual dictionary, printed on paper. Better yet, ask the student to bring one to your office with a few pads of sticky notes to jot down roots and variations and stick them on the page. You might learn something.\n\nAlso, please consider the possibility that the student is dyslexic. For many students (males in particular) dyslexia starts to resolve itself around the age of puberty, but there are many years of learning to compensate for.\n\nI once had a dyslexic student who told me that he remembered the exact day that he realized that the word \"the\" was _always_ spelled the same way. He was 13 years old, sitting at the end of the bar doing his homework in his father's tavern at 4:00 in the afternoon, and that life-changing event happened without anyone else's notice, but it changed his life forever. He made a lot of progress in his language skills in my developmental writing class at university level when he was about 20. l remember walking away from the commencement ceremony on the day he graduated. It was about 105 degrees, and I was wearing my full regalia, rushing towards air conditioning, when I heard my name. I turned and saw him walking with his mother. I don't remember much of the conversation, but I do remember her saying, \"James _loves_ you.\" That was sometime in the mid-1990's and it means more than any of the teaching awards and the publications and the research. \n\nI studied Chaucer in high school, and I remember one line in particular: \"Gladly would he learn and gladly would he teach.\" It has motivated me through the inevitable ups and downs of my career.\n\nMany faculty members find learning easy, so they never learn how to teach. Get yourself to a Lily Conference. Start a teaching circle. You will understand why universities cannot afford to banish the Humanities. \n\nJust don't banish the students.",

          "text": "> they are paying for their education and your salary!!\n\nThis phrase, in my mind, automatically negates any input you have.  What that implies is,  \"I'm paying, so you should put up with me, irrespective of the standard of my work or my attitude.\"\n\nNo.\n\nAs your professor, I know more than you.  (I mean, that's why I'm teaching and you're not.)  Pulling the \"I pay your salary!!\" card attempts to switch the hierarchy implying I should be deferential to you - in short, money is more important than knowledge.  That, at least in the classroom, is not the case.\n\n> towards their personal growth\n\nYou can't have it both ways - you can't treat education as a consumerist transaction to gain (buy) an academic qualification, and yet also expect education to be a pastoral, nurturing experience.  Pedagogically, one is answering the question, \"Will this be on the exam?\", the other answering the question \"Why is it like this?\" and as academics, we just don't have the time to do both.",
