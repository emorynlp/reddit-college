Be happy in what you do and make sure it's developing your career not someone else's. I would say trust no one as well but that's a little too x files. But as everyone is climbing over one another for the few academic jobs around remember that the ones doinh the work aren't always the ones recognised or promoted. Oh and have a family earlier.

He was a slave driver, and at that time we all pitied his students. Looking back I now see he had a close to 100% completion rate for his PhD students, nobody took more than 5 years for their doctorate, all had at least 4 first author publications, and everyone is successful post their PhD. For all his abrasive behavior, he ensured his students won or came close to winning society awards, and fought hard for his students to be placed at good places. ***I now seriously admire him.***",

Fight perfectionism. Treat everything as a draft (treat your entire life as a draft!). Nobody cares about perfection, as perfect things remain unreleased / unpublished / unfinished / unhappened. As \"[Done Manifesto](https://lifehacker.com/the-done-manifesto-lays-out-13-ground-rules-for-getting-5864004)\" put it: making something makes you right.\n3. Publishing more is more important than publishing in good journals. Impact is a lottery; don't obsess about it.\n3. When teaching, don't worry about grades. And in general, remember that you are not a drill sergeant, prepping for a space invasion. Teaching may be super-exciting, so it's important to set limits on your time, or it takes 100% of your time.\n4. Connect with people. Talk to people; meet new people; speak publicly; make it a habit. It's called \"networking\" sometimes, which makes one sound like a tool, but the core idea is that we are in it together, and we depend on each other _a lot_. Take a habit of getting to know at least 1 new person every n days. It's especially important now, with everyone so isolated. Not sure how to do it in practice, but you need to find a way!",

I'm almost 40 years into this business of living, and I still cannot do it. I write, and delete, and write, and delete, and rephrase, and delete, and my emails are still way longer than they should be.\n\nEVEN THOUGH I know perfectly well that it is a horrible practice. Even though I know that longer emails are less likely to be answered, even when they are read, as we have this subconscious assumption that longer emails somehow deserve longer replies, that end up never happening. It's ridiculous, how hard it is, when it goes against your nature :)\n\nThat's why I included it on the list haha! Maybe I'll listen to my own advice now!!",

It's too risky.\n\n* **10+ IF journals**: They are reputed and well respected, with way faster and saner review processes. A few here looks exceptionally good and will look very good on your resume. Aim here.\n\n* **Everything else**: Still peer reviewed and incomparably better to have an *APL Materials* on your resume than a manuscript that's being polished for months to get into *Nature*. \n\nEveryone I have seen who has more than 10 first authors gets interviews, even at top 10 schools. Of course, how you do after that will depend upon you and the hiring committee, but a certain minimum number is guaranteed to get your foot in the door at almost everywhere. \n\nEarly career scientists should really aim for quantity above quality in my opinion.

My take is that \n\n(1) there are really only two \u201cmain\u201d astronomy journals for most types of research, excluding some niche elite tier that many career researchers never submit to (usually these special cases are to report earth shattering papers like LIGO\u2019s first detection or the main results from a satellite).  Even Nature astronomy is often somewhat nonreputable because it tends to post very speculative, click-baity science (I know this is hard to swallow but everyone understands it to be true) \n\n(2) The journal acceptance rate is ~80%, but that is not perceived as a negative. Astronomy as a field is very undemanding when it comes to publishing results. Unlike almost any other field, importance simply does not come into play when it comes to journal articles. Much of astronomy is continually improving measurements of single objects, and then, of course, some very important papers come from aggregating And analyzing these measurements en masse.\n\n(3) Speaking from experience, It would be very hard to distinguish between papers from students vs. Those from people with PhDs. I occasionally receive correspondance about papers I have written and no one is any the wiser.\n\n(4) Astornomy papers often have huge author lists, so the field\u2019s content quality is kept up my having many eyes on any given work (this collaboration oriented nature is effectively demanded by the huge amount of cost for any space mission or telescope or long term project). The journal review process is almost incidental, anyway: preprints are the go-to and almost always are only minorly different than the published versions.\n\n(5) the field\u2019s pace is very very fast. New superlative discoveries are made every day. Focusing on rejecting papers or demanding serious revisions because of style rather than substance/validity would take much too long. Hence why preprints dominate.",

All teaching-focused institutions and many, if not most, PUIs absolutely care about teaching. In fact, in the SLAC world the exact opposite of what you say is true: everyone who earns a Ph.D. can do research, but a great many cannot teach. A strong teaching record will absolutely open doors that the lack of one will close.  For example, my school will not interview anyone who has not been the instructor of record for at least one class-- being a TA is meaningless. We have no problem finding those candidates who meet that expectation *and* have a record of publication.\n\nThe problem is that is generally quite hard to excel at *both* teaching and research as a graduate student.",

What's true, I think, is that *good* cover letters are often similar but those are maybe 1/4 of a typical pool. It's actually not that easy to write a cover letter than hits all the right buttons for a committee, and at a teaching-oriented institution the teaching part is the non-negotiable starting point that determines if they bother to read anything else in your file.\n\nFWIW, I'm a historian as well though my hiring experience has been across the board as I've often served as an outside member on committees for other departments.",

What we're looking for (we=my colleagues in this case, so a narrow sample) is evidence that a candidate can not only manage a classroom and grade papers (which TAs do) but that they can build a syllabus, establish learning goals and assessments, select appropriate materials, etc. etc.  All things that high school teachers do, but that far too many graduate programs don't bother with. Since we have no problem finding great candidates who do have that experience, so we tend to favor them in the process.",

Don\u2019t be afraid of failure: failing often and learning from your failures is how you get somewhere.",

They're excited to talk in front of huge crowds about their work. They don't mind stretching the truth to get the recognition and money that they feel that they deserve. They don't mind using students in a somewhat unethical way for free labor, because they believe the students are so lucky to work with them.

      "text": "\\-This isn't finals week in college. It's your life. It's not a sprint. You can't ever stop self-care. Self-care must ALWAYS come first. You can't show up if you haven't been well-taken care of. You need to be well-nourished, get enough sleep, exercise, spend time doing nothing, spend time with people that love you, and set boundaries. Set boundaries, and always, always put your *needs* first. There is no shame in this. Think about kids in a grade school--the ones with really responsible parents, and the ones whose parents aren't bathing them, feeding them, making them go to sleep, letting them get exercise, creating a safe home environment for them. Those kids can't show up fully to school, because they aren't being well taken care of. You're the kid AND the parent now. Take care of yourself so you can really show up.\n\n\\-About 80-90% of your job is going to be some form of organization, emailing, or paperwork. This isn't you wasting time; it's part of your job. It's not you procrastinating working, it's not you doing other menial tasks during your work time. It IS work. Put it on your to-do list, and schedule time for it. Feel good about doing it. \n\n\\-Learn to prioritize your time. I use Trello. I create cards, break them down into tasks of an hour or less, and sort them based on how important they are. I don't try to tackle everything at once. I look at it, and ask myself \"what is the absolute minimum that I could do today and go to bed feeling good about myself?\". Then, I put ONLY those on the to-do list for the day, (Including time wasters like email). Then, I do my best to do only those items. When I'm done, I can add other things. This stops me from procrasti-working, and feeling like I didn't get done what I needed to.\n\n\\-Say no to opportunities and people that don't spark joy or contribute significantly to your growth. Definitely say no to those that give you a yucky feeling.\n\n\\-Go into mentorship meetings with a goal in mind, and maybe even a schedule. Your mentor isn't superhuman, and they have a lot on their plate besides you. They might be good at figuring out your needs, and they might not. Don't leave it up to chance. One way to help ensure that you get the mentorship you need is to figure out what you actually need from your mentor (tangibly) and tell them. What are your needs, and what specific actions do you need from them to help you meet those needs?\n\n\\-Ask your mentor to describe your tasks to you in detail in the beginning, and take notes. If they say \"give me a run-down by next week\", say \"talk me through what a successful run-down looks like to you\". This will help you know what to do, and also help them really consider what are reasonable goals for you.\n\n\\-Track your time. Again, I use Trello, and have a list that says \"done\", where I put completed tasks. Sometimes, I create tasks and put them straight into the done column if it was something productive that I did that deserves to be celebrated. This means that at the end of the day, you have a tangible list of the things that you have done. This keeps up motivation.\n\n\\-Don't be (too) afraid to take up professor time. Sure, be respectful of their time. But not \\*so\\* respectful that you never ask them for meetings. Go, meet with them, introduce yourself, ask them questions. Keep it up. People like to mentor, and feel invested in you. Distribute your mentorship among multiple people.\n\n\\-If you find yourself continually failing in an area, don't just self-flagellate. It doesn't really MATTER if you're the problem. Find a solution. One of my most successful ways is to find a buddy to share that load with. I was insecure in stats, so I started a weekly statistics help group with some of my friends, where we meet, and say \"here's what I'm thinking about this week as far as my stats projects... talk through it with me\", and then co-work. I wasn't getting up early, so I found a running buddy to meet me at 7am to go for runs. I wouldn't start my stupid dissertation, so I bet 4 of my friends that I'd pay them $100 if I didn't get it done by a certain date.\n\n\\-Don't try to be perfect. You won't ever be perfect, and neither will your work. This isn't undergrad, where they will tell you how many words and sources you need, and you'll get an A. There is nobody laying out an assignment and giving you an A, so you will never get that \"A\" feeling. Instead, figure out the absolute bare minimum that needs to be done for the task to be done and for you to feel good. Go ahead and write down the things that you want to do, but then highlight the things that you NEED to do, and the first time, do only those things. Then, only once you're done, if you still want to, go back and do the \"want\" list.\n\n\\-Hang around with people who are (or are striving to be) someone that you want to be. If your friends get high and eat junk food, guess what you'll do. If your friends brag about procrastinating, guess where your life is going. Raise your bar for finding friends. Pay attention to how you feel and how you behave when you're around/ immediately leave the presence of those people. Are they  bringing you up? Are they holding you accountable? Are they helping you grow? Do they make you feel good? If not, acquaintance-zone them.\n\n\\-Apply for summer internships every summer, no matter how much pressure you feel to keep working on your projects.\n\n\\-Your coworkers are your coworkers, and your friends are your friends. There is going to be some overlap, but it's less than you think. Take things slow, set boundaries. In grad school, people (including professors) don't always set boundaries, so set your own, and err by being friendly, distant, and close-lipped.  You can always deepen a relationship; it's a lot more awkward to begin intimately and have to recede to a professional relationship.\n\n\\-Don't assume that people are on your team. People in academia succeed by being selfish and self-promoting. They aren't all on your team, and they aren't all trying to build you up. A lot of people are very insecure, and will actively work to discourage you from feeling secure and succeeding. Others just won't see you on their own pathway. You are your own advocate. Don't expect to be able to rely on other people. Provide for yourself, and be pleasantly surprised. Don't rely on others and be disappointed.",
