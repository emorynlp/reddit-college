  "title:": "Professor vs. Academic librarian career",
  "text": "Hi, has anyone considered both of these routes for your career? My husband has a tenure track job prof job. Currently I work only part-time and raise a family. I have an M.Ed. I have taught secondary school for several years, but plan to eventually transition. I am researching career paths that would be fulfilling, allow enough time to travel to see family abroad, and flexibility due to husband's future sabbaticals. I know that spouses often take sabbaticals together if at the same institution, but not sure how that works if institutions are different. I've researched quite a bit about academic librarian careers, which seem to fit my interests/personality, but I doubt there's nearly as much flexibility as higher ed teaching. Any advice/input welcome. Thank you!",
