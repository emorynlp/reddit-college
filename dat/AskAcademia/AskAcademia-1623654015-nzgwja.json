  "title:": "Quitting PhD advice.",
  "text": "Hello everyone, 4th year PhD student in Chemical Biology here in a prestigious PhD program(rank 1 university of our country), asking for some advice regarding quitting.\n\nI was a bright student thinking I would like to do academic research as I felt it was my passion and would love to continue further with it. Thing is, my supervisor is very reputed but is very harshly critical and has very high expectations. His behavior during group meetings is also rude to borderline abusive, yells very often including stuff like ' you don't belong in my lab', 'get the hell out of the lab' etc. After 2 years into PhD I started feeling completely burnt out. My passion completely vanished for academia, the insane work hours(15-16hrs a day including weekends) and also as mentioned above the abusive guide all together made me want to quit. I still tolerated all of it since I thought leaving would disappoint my parents greatly( both of them are doctors so they value higher education a lot, one of the reasons I joined PhD). I have also talked to them regarding quitting and they basically brushed it off saying ' it's just a phase, put your head down and go along' etc. etc.\n\nBut now I am at the end of my 3rd year and I feel like I just cant continue any farther with all the stress and psychological turmoil, its been a completely hellish experience. At this point, I simply cant even look at a paper without feeling disinterested and bitter. Should I quit or is it too late? I can convert my PhD into a masters, my institute allows that. I have held off my decision till now only not to disappoint my parents and in the process feel like a total loser in life.\n\nP.S. I have also been feeling suicidal very frequently as of late.",

      "text": "There were quite a few people in my PhD program who got their PhDs who I didn\u2019t think really wanted or should have.  A lot of people in these programs do it just because \u201cit\u2019s the next thing\u201d.  But it really depends on what you want to do with your career.  After my PhD, the majority of jobs I applied to were 0-1 years and PhD or 5-7 and bachelors.  So I realized then that for some jobs I could have just jumped right into the work force at that company and ended up roughly in the same spot.  Having more education does make it easier but honestly, networking is by far the most important thing.\n\nIn the end I got a job at a place where we primarily hire PhDs but there are some masters and even some BS\u2019s.  I needed to jump in as an intern and switch over.",

I know, from personal experience, it's hard to a) recognise just how seriously bad the situation you're in is, even as you're saying the words and b) to think that anything can help make things better. Mental health is like an elastic band, you can stretch it so far and it will go back but stretch it too hard even if it doesn't break, it loses its elasticity. \n\nSecondly, I still work in academia (hadn't quite been the plan) but I switched careers from the PI pathway to something quite different. One of the things that helped me make the jump was the freakonomics podcast episode on quitting. It's quite old now but I know they replayed it a few months back. If you can find it, you may find it resonates. It certainly did for me.",

In my viva (thesis defence) my examiner asked what I'd have done differently, and my answer was \"learn when to quit\" - I didn't mean my PhD but I drove myself to a very dark place trying to make an experiment work that was never going to. When I wrote my thesis up and had all the literature together I suddenly realised that it was clear lots of people had gotten kind of to the point I had but couldn't go further - but at the time I was so stressed I couldn't see the wood for the trees. I should have binned that project in year 1 not the end of year 3 of a 4 year PhD. \n\nThere's a big world out there, that welcomes people who know their mind and are able to make decisions. Good luck.",

Plus, it's mean, but knowing that my abusive PI had one person less to do his work and was going to be in a bad spot filled me with a sort of bitter joy. 10/10 would do it again. I'm teaching in middle school rn, and I always say that the most important difference from the academic environment is that finally I can reprimand the people who act childishly!",

You are making a sound decision based on the untenable situation created by your supervisor (and a lack of a safety net for you within the program/dept/institution). Some folks have a hard time understanding that in a situation like yours, it's an abusive relationship. You don't deserve that treatment. I watched way too many friends, colleagues, and colleagues of friends get mistreated by advisors/professors in PhD programs. As someone who has one (though in a different field), I can say that a PhD is not worth the level/type of stress you are facing. Whenever someone says to me that they want a PhD, I try to dissuade most because I don't think they need it in what they end up wanting to pursue.",

And I had a brilliant senior in my lab, he had 21 publications in good journals and 2 patents during PhD, he applied for professorship in many universities, didn't get accepted in any of them. But after finishing a single post doc from Tokyo uni and returning to country, he immediately lands professorship in one of the top institute of our country. \nNow of course you can become lecturer with PhD in community college, but if you want a good university position,then no a post doc is almost always a must.",

Make a plan on what you do instead and then confront them about your decision. There is no shame in re-evaluating your career path! If you can convert the PhD into a master, you do not even loose that much. Especially in industry there are many roles that can be filled with a masters. So don't worry and do whats best for you.",

It's by no means a proof that you are smart or accomplished or anything of the sort.\n\nI would make an argument that having quit a PhD is a medal of bravery!

Even if you graduate happily and with honors, you will probably end up in a complete different field (in research, academia, or something completely different) and all you did during your PhD will become meaningless. No matter how fancy is your university, your supervisor etc., these things will only help you to a limited extent. \nI know of many people who hated their PhD but decided to go for a postdoc \u201cjust to make sure they actually hated  research, and not only their PhD lab\u201d. Some actually did, some enjoyed Postdoc a lot better.\nBut if you think that you won\u2019t hold on till the end, there\u2019s nothing wrong with letting go. PhD is about research, including on yourself. If it shows you what you\u2019re meant/not meant for, that\u2019s awesome. \nGood luck with everything, and take care of yourself!",

I think is it generally a bad idea is to ditch your program and just leave with hands empty, esteem low, poor resume.\n\nBut if that is what happens, you'll bounce back, but it will just be slower bounce back, like one of those crappy trampolines. Your parents might be disappointed, perhaps, because maybe they worry that leaving will be making things harder for yourself. My math phd friend was talking like this, but he stuck with it, and after graduation all that crap became irrelevant and it was just about pivoting and rebranding himself to get a job. And don't worry about if you will stay in academia right now. That kind of horoscope thinking can be a mindfuck.\n\nAnd whether you want to stick with phd or convert to masters, you should also try some exchange programs that will get you out of your supervisor's little twisted world for a while. Exchanges are seriously awesome and lifechanging. Ie Fulbright. If your in US, Boren Fellowship, or like an ECA grant for a region like through ARISC ([https://arisc.org/arisc-research-fellowship/](https://arisc.org/arisc-research-fellowship/)) and just do your own thing. Erasmus. There are so many... ( of course if you go that route, you'll probably need to sweet talk your advisor (is that your supervisor)\u2014hopefully he will be open-minded about letting you expand your horizons)",

You gotta take your own well being seriously! even if that just means a temporary leave! You gotta get to where you are okay first! Before even considering ABCDE the first thing we got to do is stop the accident!\n\nAs people have mentioned, there are sometimes great resources to go to at the uni, but also other places. I've been in similar situations to the extent of having suicidal thoughts and of being at a \"crossroads\" in life in this sense. \n\nI can't tell you that you cannot be a \"total loser in life\", because you've obviously said that with a particular model and value set in mind. What i can tell you is that that *perspective* can change wildly. Think of the things that once mattered to you. If you're like me, you've been 14 and wondered desperately what friends and the other sex thought of you, and had fears surrounding that. Maybe been in your early twenties and felt these pressures of \"society\" wanting you to excel in this very particular way in academia or in industry. Just like being a vain 14 year old, these immense pressures are contingent on all kinds of random things. It's not that they are illusory, but in a very real sense, you get to choose which are to be taken seriously and which aren't. \n\nI'm a really old guy for the place i'm in, and so i'm used to people thinking i'm a failure. Starting med school at 30... with nothing to show for 10 years. But it doesn't matter in the SLIGHTEST to me, because i feel i know what i want to do and i feel happy and grateful that i can work towards it. \n\nI come from a family with no one near academia... or jobs, really. And while people (including myself) can whine about that, i can't imagine quite what it would be like to always have the motivations of my loved ones hanging over my shoulder, wanting things for me, etc. For all those feelings though, you know in your heart that it's what you want that matters, and you can never be a good son/daughter, brother/sister, wife/husband, etc. while worrying primarily about what they think.\n\nMuch love! Of course i'd be happy to talk if you want. Hope you have the best day!",

It might be worth just sticking it out since you have put so much time into it.  \nHaving said that, I think what I would do in your situation is look into which jobs you would want to be moving to that isn't in academia. What do these jobs require in terms of qualifications? Would you be in a better position with the PhD or the same? Do they need a masters and can you convert the work you've done so far into a masters?\n\nOnce you have the answers to these questions you will have a better idea of what leaving the PhD program will mean to you.\n\nAlso, if you just have a single year of the PhD left and make the decision you're leaving after that, it can make the load a little lighter. I don't like my current job and have a great job lined up to start in August, knowing that I'm leaving has made the current job a lot more tolerable for the rest of the time I have to do it.\n\nGood luck!",

Also, considering almost the entirety of last year in my country was spent in covid lockdown, so university was closed, a lot of work is pending, most likely my PhD will take longer than 2 more years to finish.

Nobody can blame you for not wanting to put up with abuse. If your parents are disappointed, that\u2019s a them-problem, not a you-problem. Do what makes YOU happy, because it\u2019s *your* life.",

I could have tried to stick it out but thing is there is still quite a long way ahead of me, in our country PhD is for 5 yrs or even 6 yrs. So I still have at least 2 yrs left and considering our country went through almost a year long lockdown due to covid, a lot of work was halted during that time. So it might take even 3 yrs. I really don't think I can stay here for 3 more years. I can leave by converting PhD to masters, my university allows that, that's what I am doing.",

      "text": "I left my first PhD program by switching to a masters on my way out the door. I did not get along with my advisor at the time and did not like the direction my research was going in - it made me hate science. I highly recommend getting the masters if you have the coursework and research requirements met, and if it will only take one more semester to do so. You don't need the PhD to be successful and you can always try again in the future.\n\nThat being said, after getting my MS, I worked for two years in industry, then reapplied to a different PhD program. This was an excellent decision for me, I was able to mature more in what I wanted to accomplish with a future PhD, I regained my love for science and engineering, and I knew what I wanted to look for in a PhD program. I am now in my final year and my advisor is a trusted mentor and colleague to me; I choose the school I went to because of him (I choose to work with him over the #1 researcher in my field). I was also able to broaden my network and get on projects that I would have been uninvolved with otherwise. I don't think I would be finishing if I didn't have such a supportive and understanding advisor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: I am in United States, so my perspective is likely different",

If you become a professor you end up taking care of silly children (they're young, they'll be stupid) and then you end up talking to a bunch of spoiled children (your old colleagues who can't face the reality of their work not getting them far in life). If you like research, you could go into it with a masters or a phd, I would recommend doing it privately in industry.",

For instance, if you only have 1 more paper to publish, or a few months left, then I would say stick to it for now so that all this effort doesn't go to waste. If on the other hand you have a lot of work, like 2 or more papers, and you have another year to go, then perhaps going for the Master's option would be better.\n\nI can't say that it gets easier. My PhD has been the same, 60 hour weeks, working every weekend and every public holiday including Christmas, and I don't even go to a reputable university, in fact I think mine is ranked below 200 in the world rankings lol so yeah I think this is the nature of academia itself",
