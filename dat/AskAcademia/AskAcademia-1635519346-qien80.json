  "text": "A few years ago, I left my physics PhD program with a masters degree after being in the program for two years. I'm in industry now and very happy to be very far away from academia. Most of the time when I talk about my experience in my grad program, I can very clearly feel my heart rate go up and my blood pressure increasing. Talking about certain aspects of the program almost always gets me on the verge of tears and makes me hate myself. Does anyone else feel this way?",

      "text": "I feel the same way as you OP. When I think of my experience, it's just mostly lows. Every once in a (long) while, there'll be some small breakthrough and I'll feel great about what I've accomplished, but I've realized that as time went on, these \"highs\" weren't really worth being stuck in the pit of \"lows\" for so long.\n\nI've been trying to read about what people enjoy about grad school but I just can't relate to any of them. I constantly feel lost (in terms of my work) and lonely (like there's hardly anyone to reach out to for help). To me, it's like a perpetual struggle. My groupmates have been very helpful and I am eternally grateful for their help. It's just that people are starting to leave and I have fewer and fewer people I can really talk to. \n\nOn top of all this, I can't seem to get along with my supervisor's management style. I don't have anything against him personally. It's just that his management style is just so stressful to deal with. The way he communicates and asks for stuff is very anxiety-inducing too but I can at least overlook that as he's not a native speaker.\n\nI'm sure not everyone has the same experience. Looking at the others around me, it seems like they're coping well. I'm sure many people enjoy their academic experience and there are many stories online that confirms this. However, mine has been really sour and I am looking forward to when I can be done with all these and leave. I know some might say that I should give it another shot at another institution/group once I'm done but I've reached the point where I don't really want to try again.",

      "text": "Weirdly, yes. I loved a lot of parts about my PhD. However, the constant stress of dealing with a department in a state of flux, which shed professors like a duck sheds water, ended up leaving me with an advisor that was a problem. Somehow nobody overseeing my PhD portfolio, either in my department or higher up in the office of grad education, seemed to noticed my advisor didn't have a PhD. Which made her worse than useless in overseeing my progress. She was a problem for a long time, but it was more effort for the department to address her, so they let her do whatever.\n\nShe more or less ignored me for three years, coasting off my achievements, then within the last year of my PhD somehow did a 180 and started demanding weekly meetings. In which she would straight up tell me she would not read all of my dissertation and then proceeded to nitpick grammar issues rather than commenting on the soundness or rigorousness of the method or analysis. She would also tell me not to speak to the dean or associate dean.\n\nOne of her most shocking stunts was telling me to get together a chapter, told me to not worry about proofing it, and then during our next meeting a day later asked with absolute disdain, \"Why are you like this,\" when it wasn't proofed. I can take criticism quite well, but it was delivered with such a personal barb, it really stuck with me. A few weeks later she got in a fight with my coadvisor and told him (without consulting me), I wouldn't be coming into the lab to work for the rest of my dissertation (about a month). He threatened to remove my funding. Considering this lab was funding my PhD, I was appalled and called to apologize on behalf of my advisor and told him I would be coming in. \n\nShe was such a malignant narcissist that every time I walked into the building my body went into a state of flight or fight for fear of seeing her. These probably sound relatively mild, but that last year of my PhD really threw a shadow over the rest of it.",

I feel like having that other experience did help me heal but I still get massive anxiety around the subject sometimes, but only like, in a setting where I'm gonna be graded for it, I love learning stuff on my own apparently. But it's probably better to stay away from \"real Physics\" for a while... plus there's no free time and that truly fucks me over more than anything else. There's not even money at the end of it\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I also started therapy because my email and phone notification sounds would make my heart race.\n\nOh god, me too but I hadn't connected the dots, I never used e-mail before I got my toxic advisor and always had some anxiety around it so I thought maybe that's just how I was but it definitely got worse. My bad habit of going back and re-read rude e-mails probably didn't help, but I kinda haven't in a while and that helped. Wish I had any tips for you\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe try and change the sounds? For me it's the notifications, since mine make no sound. But changing the sound of my alarm helped me actually pay attention to it",

My teachers and advisors did their jobs and were there for me for the most part.  \n\nMy post doc advisor ignored me, and I floundered.  It was incredibly stressful, and the whole system was basically set up as a tournament for his benefit.  It was a big lab with more than 20 postdocs and he gave guidance only to people who's projects were going well.  I was offered a couple of tenure track jobs, but I turned them down in order to go into industry.  So I'm very happy about where I wound up, but the post doc as it is now should be eliminated.  \n\nI was traumatized by that realization, that my pd advisor had set the place up to his benefit the detriment of most of his advisees.  After I got into industry, I was placed under an actual manager who worked with me weekly and I was finally able to perform to my own standards.  \n\nAlso, I've seen a few people set up their postdoc studies to have two advisors and joint meetings - that works well.  The two advisors keep each other honest, and if one is too busy, the other one can help you.",

Those scholars you respect will turn their backs on you in a heartbeat to preserve a funding stream or protect a prominent colleague. They enable abuse, threats, sexual misconduct, research misconduct, fraud, and more, all in the name of publications and R1 designation. And the worst part is that none of them were born this way. The system makes them this way by encouraging them to be so desperate and by rewarding anyone who brings in results at any human cost.

But the social life we had in grad school (I was married already, both my partner and I were students though in different schools of the same university) has never been matched since. We're still \"close\" in modern terms with friends from grad school, which for us was in the early-mid 1990s. Mostly care-free, nobody had kids, nobody had much money, so we did a lot of stuff in groups (potlucks, hiking trips, parties, etc.) that sadly we just didn't get to do much after we started our careers, had kids, etc. It was a good time and I miss a lot of those people often.\n\nThe actual school part? Most of my classes were just students sitting around a table arguing about books. Didn't get a lot of \"instruction\" except in classes outside my Ph.D. field when I went into other departments/schools to do interdisciplinary work.\n\nExperiences seem to differ a lot by field...most of my friends in the humanities enjoyed grad school, most in STEM did not. The radically different models of education/research are probably a big part of that.",

Everyone who works in the same lab is unavoidably working on similar things, sharing equipment and maybe even data and authorship on papers. If a peer fucks up their own data, they probably fuck up all your data too. And every paper you publish is one your peers can't, so there's more incentive to steal work or to sabotage others. Discussions about research can easily turn into your ideas being scooped, so people may be more secretive and you get fewer great discussions. \n\nWhereas in my field at least (mostly theory), we all work independently on very different topics even under the same PI, and we don't share resources or work together.

In the humanities it's exactly the opposite; I'm a senior full professor and have exactly *one* publication with multiple authors on my c.v. (and that was an interdisciplinary collaboration with STEM colleagues). In grad school there was literally *nobody* working with others, nor even on topics their advisors were working on. Nobody on my committee had any background/expertise in my dissertation topic; I was the \"expert\" on the subject from about the second week of research. So I was never in competition with my peers; indeed, we were all pretty helpful to one another, holding writing groups, theory workshops, sharing resources, etc. It meant nothing to me if a friend got a publication in Medieval history while I was working on 20th c. American history-- I was excited for them.",

I would never describe my group as a \u201clab\u201d because it\u2019s simply a nebulous, vague grouping of many individuals with somewhat overlapping interests, ranging from the scale of the universe down to the micro physics of plasmas, spread over many departments, institutions, and countries. I work alone, and can easily go months without seeing another PhD if I don\u2019t put real effort in to see them. We organise discussion groups because we\u2019d otherwise never see or talk to each other. Conferences only happen once every 2-3 years. That doesn\u2019t really sound like the environment you\u2019re in.\n\nYou can\u2019t have feelings of toxicity towards people you never see and can\u2019t even remember the name of. To have toxicity requires close quarters, which usually means a \u201clab\u201d-type setup. You\u2019re in academic boarding school while I\u2019m a commuter.",

I was excellent first sem, but my grades dropped to above average and then went lower until Covid happened. I decided to drop out of my bachelor's. I was miserable, not in touch with my emotions and out of control. I took a year to recoup, took to therapy and read self help books, lots of meditation. Two years later I can say, I feel better, healthier, more in touch with my emotions. I started taking care of myself, prioritising my life according to my dreams and needs. I know not everyone can't afford to leave education and fend for themselves but I've been studying at home and developing my skills, building relationships in my city and trying to get jobs. It is possible if you try. I tried focusing on finding financial freedom and developing systems to suffice my necessities. I haven't succeeded but I'm still learning and getting a little more confident daily.\n\nThe idea of having a degree got to me I guess. I didn't even know what I was doing back in college. I just knew I needed to have one, but after a little soul searching, now I feel like I have more direction in my life and that want for a degree was probably just to satisfy my parents' wants.\nThat being said, a lot of job opportunities require a mandatory degree, but since I have work experience and my field doesn't require a degree always, I became fortunate.\n\nP.S. I'm a Sound Designer now and I've done two films in Bollywood, hoping to get more. Dreams pay.",

      "text": "Not at the moment, but before I started my PhD, when I was still in undergrad, I had a 1-year long internship in industry as part of my degree (paid, moved to a whole other city for it and everything). The fact that I was all alone in a new city, with no friends, no social life etc. was bad enough, but then the entire project I was supposed to be working on went nowhere for the whole year and I was too junior to do anything about it, leaving me to worry continuously about what I was going to write my report on (this would be assessed by the university). I would have whole days when I would go to work and talk to no one all day, just stare at a computer with nothing to do, because the constant worrying also meant that I couldn't get myself to invest time and effort into social interaction. The whole thing made me so anxious that when I went home for Christmas, I was talking about how it was going with my mum and I just started crying. I was feeling so low that by comparison going back to university and sitting exams again was something I looked forward to. I've never left a place after living there for a while and not felt a little bit nostalgic about it, but in this one case, on my last day I took half the day off, barely said bye to my then supervisor, and I was on a train out an hour later. Once I left, I was too traumatised to step foot in that city again for 2 years. \n\nOn the bright side, it did teach me a lot about what sort of situation I DON'T want to be in, so when I chose my PhD supervisor I made sure to pick a group where I would get the necessary direction. I was briefly doing a short project in a group that reminded me of that year-long internship, but because of my previous experience I recognised it right away and steered clear of pursuing a PhD there. People thought I was exaggerating when I told them if I could handle that I can handle a PhD, because PhDs and academia in general have a bad rap in terms of students' mental health etc., but I can honestly say, now that I am close to finishing, that my PhD has never brought me to the level of desperation that that internship has.",
