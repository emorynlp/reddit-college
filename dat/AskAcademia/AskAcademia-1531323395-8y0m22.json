  "text": "I'm a late stage PhD candidate with a bit of a conundrum... I'd spent about 1.5 years developing and implementing an important model run for a paper with some collaborators. My part was done relatively quickly compared to the rest of the paper, but it alone ended up being a crucial part of the paper's results - it is called out directly in the abstract, results, conclusion, and even the title of the paper. It's not like we wrote out a contract or anything but it was generally understood that I'd be part of this paper. So I do my part and the project goes on for a few years and I check in occasionally while the main author does her thing.\n\nImagine my surprise when, last week, I find the paper published in PNAS without even so much as a mention of my name in either the author list or the acknowledgments! Nevermind that my contribution was one of the headline results or that it took up over a year of my time (and funding, grumble). The paper was led by our collaborators but a professor in my department, who is on my committee, was heavily involved in the paper and was the main connection between us and our collaborators. It's shocking and disappointing that she would somehow neglect to include me in the discussions. To add to the political aspect, somebody else is on the paper who I'm certain did little work - he was an author on our last paper on the same topic but did not do any of the computational modeling work that is being showcased in this new paper... I know for a fact he doesn't know how. I have no idea how that could be but it looks like he was just thrown on the authorship list for some reason. \n\nNeedless to say, I'm quite frustrated. But now I'm not sure what to do. Way after the fact, she wrote me an uncharacteristically friendly email showing the paper was published and privately acknowledging my contribution (but not apologizing...), maybe meant to just make me feel better? She downplayed how much I would have benefited from the authorship but that, frankly, seems insane to me. I don't feel like I have power in this situation but I feel I was severely exploited. Is there a way to post-hoc edit the authorship list somehow...? How do I prevent this from happening again? Any similar stories from others here?",

Journals take authorship disputes quite seriously, and neglecting to include authors can lead to corrections or retractions.\n\nThat said, going straight to the journal is the nuclear option. You may want to first try some of the other avenues that have been suggested. Regardless, collect and collate as much evidence as you can that your work was a significant intellectual contribution to the manuscript; you'll want to have that ready regardless.",

If not, then perhaps you should find other big shots to work with.\n\nYou will continue to be exploited because you have demonstrated that you are exploitable.

Do you think it is likely that your professor didn't even mention you or acknowledge your contribution to the model when presenting results and having discussions? If that's true, then I'll be quite pissed off at her.  If your collaborators know that you did the work, and you have had prior communications, but still ignored your absence at the author list, the whole authorship list is fucked up.\n\nPNAS has a section for author contributions. Did your collaborators fill it out? If so, you should be curious to know who they credited with the model.\n\nI cannot comment on her motives, either it is her trying to trim down the author list from her own group, or just willful ignorance but you have good evidence against her unprofessionalism in the email she sent to you about acknowledging your work for this publication.\n\nYou have a very good reason to appeal your case, and all of your co-authors should be able to understand the situation she put you in. You can start with telling your adviser, that you are unhappy with how things turned out and you can't sit this one out considering you did a crucial part of the work. It is not even about your career, what she did was wrong. Ask her if she has a resolution to this problem. If that doesn't work, going to the journal directly would be pretty bad, because it will shock the rest of your co-authors, so try to bring them into light of your situation before taking any decision. Of course consider any other options that sound better in terms of a solution.\n\n If you are confident in your abilities to be successful in the future and have a good post-doc lined up, you can afford to get out of this without stirring up a shit-show, but what she did was pretty bad and criminal, and she might end up doing this to other junior researchers.

I spent two months in an internship and pulled 12-14 hour days to be able to finish up my work from that project. Professor never submitted my work and instead had one of his post-docs re-run the entire experiment 2 years later with him as a lead author and me nowhere on the list. His excuse?

If it's a small field, and everyone is friends with everyone, then it may be a good idea to get a resolution in a way that is communicative and respectful, but not force it. Unless one makes a switch to the industry, an advisor's recommendation can come handy at almost every step of the career : finding a post-doc, applying for awards, having someone nominate you for talks, applying for professorships and so on. Unless her adviser is a shitty person, she may try to sweeten the situation by offering to have the OP included in a different paper or making some other concession.",

Surprisingly, it was never the tyrannical types that did this (with those, you can see it coming), it is with the charismatic, even somewhat \"nicer\" types of PIs, that attract people to flock to them with excitement about research (I guess that makes it easier to blindside you). It also made me, as the recipient of this lack of respect, do a lot of self-blame and wonder if I have a \"doormat\" personality that caused this to happen.  When I suspected it was happening prior to publication, I was unable to fix the situation without being accused of causing drama.  I have only had one former big-name mentor give me an unprompted apology that s/he knows s/he did me a huge disservice that likely affected my career, but I did not get the apology until 20 years later . . .\n\nSo I can commiserate, but unfortunately I have no solution for you. I was never smart enough to figure this out.

This can be emails, i.e. a paper trail, your work that lead to the model implementation, etc.; and it better be good. If you're successful, the paper is likely to be retracted, as it's usually a major procedural hassle requiring the published authors' consent to change the author list of a published paper, and even then it would most probably be in the form of a correction or an erratum, i.e. your name still wouldn't appear on the published paper.

      "text": "Tbh that suuuuuper sucks, but you might want to let it go and just make sure in the future you discuss these things earlier. Especially if you're on other authors with the PI, their future recommendation letters for you might be worth more than middle authorship on a PNAS paper.*\n\nLike- just because they screwed you over doesn't mean they won't get defensive and blame you for the uncomfortableness of the whole situation if you try to get it corrected. And if it turns into a drama thing in a small field, being in the right is no guarantee that public opinion will be behind you. So while it is shitty, it might be that the best thing for you is not to pursue it. The other thing I would recommend if you have a good relationship with your actual mentor is to get their opinion on the matter. Sometimes they have a better sense of the politics of these kinds of things and could give you advice on what would benefit you the most.\n\n*Maybe I'm wrong about how much each thing would benefit you, but that's what I would do in your situation.",

      "text": "I just want to agree with the others and say that I think the nuclear option (contacting the journal) is a terrible idea at this point.  I would return to the email she sent where she seems to acknowledge your contribution.  I would ask her if you could please meet to discuss this.  I wouldn't be aggressive since that can put people on the defensive.  I would say exactly what you did: that previously your similar contributions have resulted in authorship and that you are confused why you were left off.  Put the ball in her court and have her explain.  Instead of saying, \"I was left off and I demand that this be remedied\" you could try, \"I don't understand how this happened...\"  If you're not satisfied, then say that that explanation isn't satisfactory.  You could put her in the hot seat to explain...but do it nicely.\n\nMy guess is that there's something political going on behind the scenes.  Or she genuinely thought your contribution didn't warrant authorship.  \n\nThe best way to protect yourself in the future is for her to spell out exactly what does constitute authorship.  The reason I say not to go nuclear and contact the journal is that your professor is likely to be someone you collaborate with in the future, or at the very least run in the same circles with.  You don't want to get the reputation for being aggressive or a bad team player (even if you're not in the wrong).  Also, as others have mentioned, what's worth more: her recommendation or this pub?\n\nPersonally, I've been in your exact shoes (perhaps without the stakes of a PNAS authorship).  I edited a book for my PI and then she gave the credit to her former post-doc who was up for tenure and he needed the bump on his CV.  I also did posters and conference presentations without credit.  What this did was 1. give me skills that I wouldn't have otherwise got and 2.  showed me how not to be and what kinds of people I don't want to work with.\n\nIn contrast, I'm currently part of a research collaboration and it's incredible.  When we coauthor papers, the authors are listed pretty early on in the drafts.  On my most recent pub (I'm author like 10 or something -- way down the line) the first author emailed everyone and asked if we still wanted to be on the paper (I asked her if she thought my contribution was enough and that if she felt it wasn't to take me off) or if there was anyone we forgot.  It was a truly collaborative process and now it's my gold standard.\n\nTL;DR: don't go nuclear.  Don't burn bridges.  For the future, open lines of communication early in the process so that all authors are identified.",

      "text": "I was left off a paper for which I had made the initial discovery, and completed the initial portion of the work.  After I left the lab, subsequent students completed the rest, which was published ~3 years later.  When I contacted the paper, they said to reach out to the institution where the lead PI now resided.  That institution's director said something to the effect of \"I feel for you, but my advice is to just move on with your life and be better\".  \n\nAt the time I was very upset, but looking back, I realize that was probably the best advice as it's had zero impact on my career.  All we can do is be better with our own students, and in the future be sure you know what kind of people you are working with, and get in writing what your authorship role will be.\n\nBut, if you wish to pursue it, I don't think the paper will do anything but refer it to the institution. I'd recommend reaching out to the Director of the lead author's and PI's department, and go up that chain to the Dean.  If they don't respond, perhaps the Research Integrity Officer could review it?  Not sure if it's in their domain.  Good luck and I'm very sorry, I know what you're going through.  All I can say is it will get better with time, and to be great regardless of them.",
