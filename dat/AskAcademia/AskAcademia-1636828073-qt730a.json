To paraphrase a book written by Dr. Meg Jay, anyone who feels confident and competent at the beginning of their career is probably either over-confident or under-employed, and if you feel like you aren't \"good at\" your job, well, you might be right.\u00a0 You are new on this career path, so you are going to make a lot of mistakes. The only way to get better is to get a lot of feedback over things you did wrong (obviously positive feedback and encouragement is also needed, we are not robots). It always stings, but there is no other way to learn other than to hear a LOT of \"that's wrong, that's wrong, that\u2019s wrong.\u201d\u00a0 It still sucks even when it is (and should be) interspersed with positive feedback.  I see stress + anxiety as a sign that someone is in the right place. You can't grow without being pushed, and if you were always \u201cdoing it right\u201d it means you are in a place where you aren\u2019t learning.\u00a0 Obviously if you are in a constant state of near panic that is not good either, but I think there is a way to \u201clean in\u201d to anxiety.\u00a0 I used to give presentations at a seminar series where public and constant criticism was VERY common.\u00a0 I would mentally prepare for them by imagining putting on a coat of armor, and visualize taking the criticism like it was bouncing off metal plates. Instead of imagining \u201cit will be fine and everything will go well,\u201d I would imagine \u201cthis might be ugly, but if I just brace for it, it will be fine.\u201d I would also ask a classmate to take notes of the criticism for me so that way I could just focus on staying calm in the moment, and then review the criticisms later once I cooled down.",

It has already slowed to pathetic rates, in real terms, while published papers increase.  It\u2019s like some perverted form of intellectual inflation. \n\n\u201cWe know more and more about less and less.\u201d \n\nPeople like yourself are part of the problem.  I don\u2019t fit any of your pre-constructed stereotypes, so you cram me into the first box you are triggered towards, like a gag reflex.  You don\u2019t think. It\u2019s automated, like a robot.  You move concepts around, rearrange them, categorize them, but you don\u2019t think.  \n\nYour absolute lack of reading comprehension is proof of this. \n\nI disproved your point, in both the negative and positive, about conspiracy theories being about falsification. I threw in something I knew would trigger you, valid though the point was.  You sung the song I was already hearing before clicking reply.  Robot.",
