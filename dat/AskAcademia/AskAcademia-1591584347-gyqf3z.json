  "text": "I'm currently an MA student in philosophy and I find myself constantly looking up things which I should have memorized by now. Like the different types of fallacies and arguments, significant contributions of certain philosophers, philosophical eras, certain definitions etc.\n\nI'm a good student and work pretty hard overall, but I'm finding this frustrating. How can I retain a foundational information 'data base', if you will, relevant to my field?",

That doesn't necessarily mean in a classroom \u2014 there are other ways to simulate that kind of activity (like writing lectures for your future self to give).

Rote memorization is hard even with really basic things (names, dates), and certainly not appropriate for summing up, say, Platonism. \n\nI'm a historian, which is close to what you're describing, and the stuff I have _ready to go_ in my brain is all stuff I've taught or written about.

Some people are extremely visual and have to see things written down or drawn out. Some people need to say things out loud. Others write themselves little songs to help them memorize things (I'm like this, if I make it a song or a rap I will never forget it, I can still tell you every stupid poem I memorized for french classes decades ago), and others need to cram right before going to sleep. You can give yourself flash cards on a given topic, try memorizing them using all kinds of different ways (different cards for different methods), and then test yourself to see what your retention is after a day, a week, a month. This will help you to learn about yourself, and your learning style. It may sound bizarre, but it works for me. Good luck!",

      "text": "I work in science and I don\u2019t memorise things per se but one way you could organise a large set of information relative to your field would be to keep or publish a personal Wiki. You would probably have to think very hard and work hard on organising all the little bits of info, and that would make you very familiar with the content. \n\nA nice example of a personal academic wiki is nosubject.com. There are some nice tools that to help you maintain a Wiki, for example tiddlywiki.",

      "text": "A phrase I often use: become intimately associated with the information.\nLook it up. \nUse it. \nTalk about it.\nTeach it. (This one is huge)\nI personally love teaching things because it allows me to use the cool knowledge I have acquired over the years and pass it on. When I\u2019m learning new material I find myself doing this more. My roommate\u2019s cat knows a lot of physics, biology and chemistry by now. Lol\nIt just takes time, the more senses you use the information the more ingrained it will be. Teaching is one of the best ways to use multiple senses at once.",

      "text": "The book *The Memory Code* talks about how ancient people would remember vast repositories of cultural knowledge. For some of them were talking every plant, animal, insect, land or skyscape feature,  genealogies, paths to find water or migrate safely, information about other people\u2019s and their relationships to the former, as well as the foundational mythology of the people. \n\nThey did this through training, and (the author argues) almost always by using a method that brings together \u201cthe method of loci\u201d, song, and other factors. \n\nThe method of loci is the thing that you hear about when people talk of a \u201cmemory palace\u201d, like memory champions use. The Greek Orators used to use the technique and our modern description of it traces back to them. \n\nThere are also books relating to these techniques, such as *Moonwalking with Einstein*. \n\nThe author of the memory code claims to have used these methods to remember every single country that exists as well as a few facts about each, and then another related one which traces all the important events she can find and add in from the Big Bang up to human history and to the present. \n\nIt sounds like you need to do the same as the old tribal elders and remember a vast amount of cultural knowledge. Maybe it\u2019d be possible with methods like these.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve used funny mnemonics to memorize as much as possible. My masters is in education so it\u2019s more experiential and not quite as technical and context heavy as other fields. \n\nFor example, I remember the 7 key parts Chickering\u2019s 7 vectors development theory as: \n\nCompetence, emotions, autonomy, interpersonal [relationships], identity, purpose, integrity \n\nChubby Elves Amused Icicles Into Panicky Interns\n\nI just chunk data, use a mnemonic generator until it shows something funny, and just memorize it. This isn\u2019t great for technical things, but easy and effective for short memorization that can help with quick recall in a class room, job interview, or conversation.",

      "text": "I am sympathetic to the comments that just say \u201cI don\u2019t memorize things, they just eventually stick\u201d as a math major, since I rarely intentionally memorize things in math classes. However, as a premed major, I think it\u2019s also important to understand that this won\u2019t always work. I\u2019m studying for the MCAT right now, and I have to basically put six ~400 page books into my head. \n\nThat said, I use Anki for all brute-memorization. It\u2019s a flash card app that automatically creates a schedule for you to review cards in order to maximize the effects of spaced repetition, which helps you remember things over longer periods of time. I\u2019ve never been great at memorization, but with this app I\u2019ve been able to memorize ridiculous amounts of information. Also, I wouldn\u2019t buy the $20 app on the AppStore\u2014the free browser version works just fine for me.",
