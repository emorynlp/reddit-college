  "title:": "Is \"bullshit\" a legitimate research area and is it supposed to be tongue-in-cheek or am I just immature?",
  "text": "I met a linguistics faculty recently whose primary research interests included \"bullshit\". I laughed when I read that because I thought it was a joke, or at least supposed  to  be a humorous description of what he studied. Then I  looked it up and found legitimate papers published in big journals about bullshit,  discussing it like it's a scientific term. \n\nIs the linguistic research area \"bullshit\" supposed to be humorous like papers on \"Trajectory of a Falling Batman\" ([https://journals.le.ac.uk/ojs1/index.php/pst/article/view/2036/1939](https://journals.le.ac.uk/ojs1/index.php/pst/article/view/2036/1939))? \n\nOr is this a research area people discuss with a totally straight face and no hint of humor, and I'm just immature for thinking it's a joke?",

      "text": "Yes, it's a legitimate area of study. Bullshitting is trying to pass off vacuous or epistemically fuzzy content as truth. It involves an intentional state of an actor and a presupposed state of receptivity by an other. The recipient of the claim likely has to engage in some type of reasoning process to accept or reject the bullshit. For these reasons bullshitting is a complex process that may yield insights into how specific operations or processes (such as reasoning or evaluation of a claim) may operate.\n\nEdit: here's an example of a bullshit study in a decent journal http://journal.sjdm.org/15/15923a/jdm15923a.html",

It's the idea that people say stuff that sounds good or helps them achieve a goal like looking smart in the moment *without regard to whether it is correct or not.* For example, if it had turned out that hydroxychloroquine was in fact a great treatment for coronavirus, Trump--a bullshitter of epic proportions--would say, 'see what a great medical intuition I have!' and continue to use it to his advantage. The fact that the claim is decidedly false though is also of no concern to him. The statement served his purposes at the time of giving people an excuse to downplay the relevance of the virus that he had allowed to get out of control. A crucial corollary is that bullshit can turn out to be true but still be bullshit.",
