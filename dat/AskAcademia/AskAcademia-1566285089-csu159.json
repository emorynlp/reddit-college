  "text": "Hi, today in the orientation for new faculty, we were told roughly as follows \"Avoid dating students as much as you can. Use Tinder or Bumble. This is a big city\". Not that I disagree with the message, but I tried dating apps before and none has resulted in anything substantial, let alone a relationship.\n\nI figured that I have a much better chance by talking to people in real life. But how do you go about balancing research, teaching, writing grant proposals and finding a date? Most of the other new faculty already have partners and kids. I find it difficult now since I have to approach women very subtly given my position.\n\n1. Students: big NO.\n2. Peers, i.e., other faculty/staff: pretty much all married or taken.\n3. Friends of friends: I just moved here and I don't have any friend in the area.\n4. Dating apps: never worked out before.\n\nI'm (\\~30, M and Asian if that matters) actually decent looking. I can talk to people and socialize fine -- I did have girlfriends in the past when I was a student and it was way easier. I think if I'm not pro-active then I might just end up being alone forever. I did enjoy being single for a long time, but I'm also at the stage where I want a more intimate connection. But I just don't know how to get out of this situation.\n\nAnyone had the same experience that doesn't mind sharing?\n\nEdit: I guess it's ok to date grad students from other departments as long as we disclose it. However, the approaching and flirting parts seem very tricky to me given my position.",

I started doing things differently and am getting more dates with people who are looking for the same things as me. Here's what I did.\n\n\\- I made a profile that was focused on reflecting who I truly was, rather what I figured girls were conventionally looking for on those apps. I still tried to use my best photos and wrote a pretty short bio.\n\n\\- I became more selective on who I swiped right on, especially on tinder. Less selective on Bumble because of the whole message first thing.\n\n\\- I only continued conversations that were ACTUALLY turning into real conversations. I mostly talked to people who started the convo with good questions, both asking good questions to each other throughout (often questions related to things in your pics or bio!), and I did't have these conversations with any expectations. This is another one of the benefits of Bumble, the girl messages first so generally you can tell if they want to really have a conversation by if they have a good profile, and if they start the convo with a good question rather than \"hey\".\n\nI still prefer meeting people in person, it is more certainly more exciting, and a little more genuine. But I have to say, especially for the reasons you stated about work and difficulties meeting people who you don't have a conflict of interest with, I have found that Tinder and Bumble do have a good place, and appreciate them for what they are.",

      "text": "So, I primarily made new friends through things like Meetup and definitely could have converted some of those friendly connections into something romantic if I had wanted to. I preferred book clubs because everyone there tends to be a bit nerdy and the book makes for an easy topic of conversation but in a big city there will be groups for any and all interests. If this is a big city that also has a sizable Asian population, there may be cultural groups or meetups that you might like that can be sources of new friends and possible dates. If that's your thing I'd give it a shot since making friends as a grown-up can be hard.\n\nHowever for dating, I mainly went through apps (OkCupid and Hinge, which tend to be more relationship-oriented than Tinder). It's at least worth a shot even if you didn't find them useful before. I found much more medium- and then long-term success when I started focusing on just 1-2 people at a time and making a decision about them before I started looking for anyone new. That way I wasn't distracted by \"possibilities\" on a screen but could focus on the person in front of me.\n\nRE: students, undergrads and your own grad students are a no-go and it sounds like your university isn't a fan of dating grad students in other departments either. I'd check the actual university policy for the latter situation since that's more of a grey area.",

Except I am in a small town as well. Dating was horrible around the university town. \n\nI started making friends in a nearby big city through meetups, geeky events for programmers and scientists, and at the gym. Eventually I had a good group of friends, and by the end of first year I decided to move to the city (about 1.5 hours drive away), and that was when I started getting dates through my regular events. I commute to the university usually once or twice a week (sometimes I get a hotel near campus if I have late classes followed by early meetings).\n\nEventually I met a guy last year at a tech meetup that I really clicked with. Now we've been dating for a year and he's even met my parents and everything. \n\nGive it some time and go to a few hobby/interested based meetups. You'll find someone soon enough :)",

Lot of the undergrad (or just a few years older). \nThe city is pretty small so most people end up dating someone in the university.\n\nI got told in induction that I the university can not control us dating however there are a few rules. The first rule was if you are dating (sleeping, slept with ect) with an undergrad, say to our demonstration coordinator. You won\u2019t be able to mark there work. The second was not to support them in coursework more than anyone else.\n \nThe main emphasis was to just day or at least not mark there work. We got told that we would not get into trouble if we did start to date someone, but could if we didn\u2019t make the coordinator aware as conflict of interest.\n\nOur department is aware it does happen and that they can\u2019t stop it as we\u2019re also students.",

I also avoided using proximity-based apps on weekends because it was full of people from out of town looking for a weekend hookup. \n\nDefinitely join an activity. Trivia, sports, board games meet up, hiking group, etc. Meetup and Facebook events are great ways to find fun things. See if your city has a social newsletter to find event listings also.",
