The first (which is usually justified) is when the (empirical or theoretical) work you are doing doesn't line up well to existing theory, or at least you really haven't made those links clear.\n\nThe second (which is usually *not* justified) is basically when someone doesn't like your research for whatever reason, but can't really think of a good substantive criticism. So long as you can show you have answered a scientifically/theoretically interesting question well, then \"So what\" is irrelevant. It is generally one of the worst forms of gatekeeping.\n\nWhichever sense people want to ask \"So what?\" I personally think that it's a really bad way to phrase a challenge to a piece of research. If it's meant in the first sense above, then just explain how theory and methods do not line up. If it's meant in the second sense, maybe figure out why you don't like the research and either express that, or keep quiet.\n\n\"So what\" is an exceptionally lazy way to critique research.",

I witnessed the prior two as a grad-student. I worked with this guy during my first job and he was 'finishing' his diss while teaching in a small liberal arts college. As I learned more, it became clear that his advisor seriously misguided him, and then left the university after he 'defended' but before he 'graduated.' He received a new advisor and formed a nearly completely new committee after she left for another university. His new committee and advisor disregarded the prior defense and have been asking him to endlessly make revisions. Seems like they are waiting for him to quit.",

Let me just say, I was initially completely in your camp and wanted to see this guy get his work 'approved' and be finally awarded his PhD. But in the intervening years I have come closer to understanding the new committee for several reasons. \n\nI learned that his former advisor had compelled the original committee to grant him his PhD because he was about to join her at a new institution (the one I currently work at, but she and he no longer work at) as a temporary post-doc type position, which she was planning on partly funding with her start-up money. \n\nOver the course of the 2+ years he worked at this institution, he failed to delivery a dissertation which his newly formed committee would approve, and which resembled the one he defended. Turned out that he was getting terrible advice from his now former advisor, but current \"post-doc\" advisor. She had lied to everyone on campus telling them that he would be done soon. \n\nI also came to learn that she had burned all bridges with her former institution (something which repeated itself nearly identically here) and that from my perception of things, it seemed the student's new committee was not going to allow him to pass partly because of resentment towards her. I think this is completely wrong. But the emails I saw looked like his committee did have legit concerns about his work. The kind of concerns that sometimes get overlooked to award a PhD, but also the kind that if someone wanted to be a stickler could use to block his progress. Its muddy. The PhD student in question moved back to his former institution's town and is trying to be present to ensure the completion of the degree.",

Coming from someone who has taken several more years than I was \"supposed to\" to complete a Master's thesis, I can fully understand why sometimes the process extends past deadlines. Hopefully he was complying with committee requirements...the problem, for me, arises when committees keep finding new things to critique or when they go back on their past recommendations (both happened to me) just to be picky. Academia is hard enough as it is, and I have little patience for departments and faculty that do this kind of thing to students. I'm glad he was able to move back to be closer to the University...I've heard of others who haven't been able to, and the dissertation goes undefended for long enough that Universities un-enroll the student. There's even someone in my hometown who famously drives around with his \"ABDPHD\" license plate, proudly displaying his \"failures.\" I think he's happily employed - in industry, not academia.",

                      "text": "Yes, the one he was writing and is presumably still working on (which I have seen some copies of) is in the monograph style of dissertation. In my experience, it really depends on the department and institution as to which variety of dissertation a PhD candidate will be permitted to submit. For myself, my advisor allowed me to somewhat choose how I would compose my dissertation. In the end, mine finished as a kind of hybrid, whereby I had three distinct chapters which represented my three key novel insights into my topic, surrounded by 2 intro and theory chapters at the front, and a synthesis chapter at the back. At the time of my defense, one of these 3 insight chapters had been published with the other 2 in various states of review. I have since published 2 of the 3 insight chapters, and one of the intro chapters (3rd insight is back burnered for data size reasons which became apparent only after my defense). \n\nI do think that there is some truth to the idea that if you can get some of your work published ahead of time that committees often feel some more pressure to see you graduate. In fact, the PhD student who I mentioned above has recently been told by his committee that he needs to get one of his chapters published before they will allow him to defend again. But, this feels like they have kept moving the goal posts and in a moment of desperation as he was pinning them down they threw out this new requirement. \n\nUltimately, I do not think that he is going to finish. I have seen his papers get rejected time and time again, because his data is overly flawed. His advisor had very little idea of what she was doing when she took him on and they started working on his diss. This is because she was trying to 'reinvent' herself and was exploring a new area of research. They wound up over-looking things which are critical to research in the specific niche they were working on simply because they were new to the work and naive about how it should be done. Because of that, there are fundamental flaws in the underlying data preventing him from being able to really \"do\" anything with it. Furthermore, having been ostracized by association with his former advisor, he no longer has access to the resources necessary to reperform his experiments/investigations and no one at his University seems willing to help. With her departure from my institution\u2014with the loss of her lab\u2014there is now nowhere for him to turn to get this thing completed. Which is why I am now waiting to see how long it will take him to quit. \n\n\nMoral of this very long story... picking the right advisor is the most important piece to your PhD education career. Every prospective graduate student needs to be certain they know what they are getting from their advisor BEFORE they go to work with them. But just as importantly, every prospective grad student needs to know what THEY NEED from an advisor in order to be successful. Advisors are people too, some are shitheads (see above), some are great people but largely incompetent when it comes to advising. Some are awesome advisors and poor teachers or scholars. Some have traits you will hate, some are people you will love. They are people too. But the scary thing for a PhD student is how reliant you will be on them, not just to shepherd you through the mechanics of your PhD, but also to help you grow into the scholar and scientist you want to be. Remember, it is this second part that will get you your job, not just having the PhD. \nThis woman failed this guy. Not because she set out to, but because she never really could advise him. She was a fraud from the beginning, who had tortured her co-workers at very institutions with her insane political machination because she was too insecure to ever collaborate-with or learn-from a peer, and saw everyone who already had a PhD around her as a threat to her delicate ego. To anyone reading this, be careful. Do your homework on someone before you sign away half a decade to work with them and have them shape you.",

This advisor did this so many times that the student was supposed to defend (the first time) in February, but we didn't wind up actually getting to their defense until late July. The chair of the department forced the defense to go through because the student had an August start date for a job. The advisor tried to fail the student at the defense, but then the other members of the committee and the department chair asked for just cause, and the advisor didn't really have any. The student defended, graduated, got out. They found out several years later through the grapevine that the reason the advisor didn't want them to defend at all is that the advisor wanted to keep them on their project (as cheap but competent labor) for 1 more year until their grant ran out because it's really hard to find a grad student willing to take on a <1 year project.\n\ntl;dr advisor kept delaying defense trying to get student to stay until end of a grant so that the advisor didn't have to find someone new in the last year of said grant.",

This isn't military bootcamp or football coaching (and both of those are also changing) - this is about highly qualified experts interacting in a professional setting and they damn well better behave in accordance. Making people cry isn't acceptable, and \"as long as they pick themselves up afterwards\" is no excuse. It's also, not to make a fine point out of it, damaging.\n\n\"They were behaving fine with *me,* so it's probably the candidate's fault for being too sensitive,\" is one of the most egregious fallacies of postgraduate education.

The subfields are very diverse, and there are so many understudied languages that it's very easy to carve out a niche. I focus on phonology, and I do some endangered language documentation. You do have to be careful to not let people corner you into frameworks that have no real descriptive benefit (Optimality Theory being the worst offender), which is why I prefer the fieldwork side of things. Then again, fieldwork is unpredictable and expensive. \n\nThe diversity of topics in the field means that there are plenty of prestigious conferences/journals that are relatively within reach, compared to some other fields (my CS friends tell me their conferences are ranked on 'tiers' which sounds horrible). Submissions to conferences/journals are reviewed blind so your work stands on its own, which apparently is not universal (I've heard that history conferences do non-anonymous reviews, and in turn have to set aside quotas so that grad students can have their work seen at all).\n\nI'd say the worst part of linguistics as a field is trying to work around the dogma of frameworks and MIT exceptionalism. It is also a bit frustrating how much insider knowledge you need to read the literature on specific language families since they all have their own unique spin on IPA and morpheme glosses.",

At my university, your committee simply won\u2019t allow you to defend if they think there is any chance of you failing the defense. \n\nLike I said, there could be some serious issues in data, methods, etc that could cause you to fail, or if you freeze up and completely bomb the seminar, but a good committee should have found these errors in the proofreading phase of your thesis/dissertation. \n\nHowever, if someone did fail the defense, they have to go back and correct the issues and wait a certain period of time (I think 60 days minimum) before they can defend again.

They got on with the work, but by the time they viva'd the examiners felt the work wasn't original because two research groups elsewhere had had the same idea, and pushed forward, overtaking this students work. The lack of supervision in the last 2 years basically left the student in a black hole with little input on their thesis, or guidance in how to prepare for the viva to defend themselves. Then no-one really advocated for them. It was a deeply shit situation.\n\nOne was someone who was quite a weak student to begin with, then didn't take any of the advisor feedback in the writing up stage in a misguided belief that they knew best. It blew up in their face.",

I'm not aware of the details, though, and/or whether the advisor could have done more, or whether counseling support could have helped. (I think at one point a job opportunity that didn't require the PhD came along and the candidate cut their losses.) It wasn't entirely unlike how I dropped out of my first attempt at getting through a PhD program - just fading out when everyone expects you to come back - except that 95% of the work was done and the defense conditionally accepted.\n\nAs for panic attacks, I know of many people who manage panic / anxiety disorder through the stress of thesis crunch and defense. The danger of an attack seems to be mostly before the defense -- once you're in the flow, panic is much less likely to strike. I'm pretty sure I know what would happen in my general neighborhood if a candidate had a panic attack immediately before or during the defense: The same as if they came down with an allergic reaction, diabetic collapse or any other medical condition that meant the defense had to be delayed or rescheduled.",
