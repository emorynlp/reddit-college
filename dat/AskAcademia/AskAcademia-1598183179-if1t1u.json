  "title:": "[Vent] As someone who works at two institutions as both staff and faculty, I am sick of faculty promoting that staff positions are all administrative bloat.",
  "text": "I recently had an argument with a student online who was convinced by a faculty member that tuition at a university could be cut by 75% if the university would just get rid of its staff and focus on its faculty and students.\n\nIf you had told me this argument as a student, I would have been convinced that this would be a good idea. But as someone who has since served both as staff and faculty, I'm really sick of hearing this argument (and similar ones) from faculty. \n\nFor one thing, it is like pulling teeth to have faculty discuss anything apart from curricular concerns - which is fine, it's the job of faculty to focus on curricula. However, having been staff, I know what it's like\n* to check enrollment numbers daily and worry that you'll be 10% down one year and that positions will get cut;\n* to have to work with staff to streamline processes so that students have an easier time registering and graduating with their degrees;\n* to have to focus so much time on marketing courses and programs so as to make sure the institution meets enrollment goals;\n* to serve on committees to help move day-to-day operations forward;\n* to review accreditation documents and make sure the institution is in compliance with accreditation standards.\n\nAs someone who is currently faculty as well, most faculty do not want to get involved in the type of work I've done as staff. Quite frankly, as faculty, there is not enough time to get into this stuff. In fact, in one of the institutions I work for, faculty are required to receive an additional stipend for work that they have to do related to committees, if that's any indicator of interest.\n\nThis isn't to say that administrative bloat is nonexistent, but hearing rhetoric like this makes me consider leaving academia entirely, if students and faculty really believe that my staff position provides no value. I've worked in corporate positions before, and if I need to return to the corporate world, I can. However, education is truly where my heart is, and doing work that I am passionate about that serves students and faculty in a positive way is what makes my staff position so fulfilling.\n\nI just wish that more people would understand my perspective.",

It is a large program with 11,000+ students, something like 400 tenured faculty, $300m a year in sponsored research (more than half university's total), 13 departments, etc. \n\nI got to take a look at the college's budget once. In terms of expenditures by department, the Dean's Office was #3. It spent more by itself than 11 of the 13 departments. Departmental costs include postdocs, GRAs, GTAs, research scientists, technicians, adjuncts, secretaries, and the tenured faculty. Departments also included research equipment, computing time, G&A expenses, pedagogical lab equipment, etc. The Deans Office had so many associate and assistant deans their payroll alone was bigger that all of the aforementioned departmental costs, even for large departments like Civil, Aerospace, or Computer Science. IIRC only Mechanical and Electrical beat it.\n\nIt's mind boggling to me. I wonder how one gets a job there...",

In academia we promote teachers based upon their research output, we appoint administrators based upon their success as faculty, and we require PhD degrees for what should require management expertise.\n\nIncentives are rarely well aligned, strategy is mostly a joke, accountability is severely lacking, and clarity and shared vision is nonexistent.\n\nI would have fired, for incompetence, nearly every single academic administrator I have interacted with (as faculty) if they had been working for me in business.\n\nNow is that their fault?

And the head of that office is being paid $250,000 when I'm told I can't hire a T.A. to help my 100 student required course.\"\n\nOccasionally I'll look over at r/professors and see someone who's badly ill-informed about other staff positions that they think are bloat. Some positions are there because of government regulatory requirements. Some because there was some infamous fuck-up by a professor years ago that means there needs to be oversight to make sure it never happens again. Some because research depends on outside funding, which many professors can't get without grant writers and accountants. Some because universities' pockets make them a constant target of frivolous lawsuits. And many because schools are in competition with the private sector for competent employees, and since they can't pay as much, they compete on stability, making it rare that positions are eliminated until the incumbent leaves. (In my department, we have single moms, cancer survivors scared of recurrences, parents of college-aged kids that can't afford risky employment prospects, etc. Those exist at all employers but are overrepresented in higher ed.) In other words, most staff are necessary because today's faculty couldn't be a modern faculty without them.",

Universities (specifically in the form of faculty governance) decide what departments a school should have -- and which to give more resources to, which to scale back or restructure, etc. If you mean individual departments are overstaffed, that certainly happens, and recessions often take care of that. But almost by definition, an entire department can't be bloat, because the faculty, who embody the university mission, have decided that department should exist.\n\nI mentioned scale back or restructure. That's something that happens often or, really, on a rolling basis; internal competition for resources is cutthroat, so when a department looks bloaty (too big relative to its output, external funding, enrollment), other departments start making the case to the dean, provost, or other faculty that resources should be shifted out. The only departments I can think of that survive those attacks are ones with substantial independent endowments, and even those sometimes result in the school going back to the donor/family and feeling them out as to whether they'd renegotiate the use of the funds.",

That said, I'm not really sure what those new administrative positions actually do,\n\nIt's a little bit of both, which is what makes defining \"administrative bloat\" so challenging.\n\nOn one hand, there are the endless VPs and deanlets making inflated salaries to do very little, and the assistants to these people who work hard for low pay but wouldn't be needed if we didn't have an Office of Useless Paper Pushing to begin with. We could easily get rid of a lot of those sorts of positions, but at most schools, only a handful of administrators make big money, and some of them have to pay that much if you don't want someone completely incompetent doing the job. \n\nThe obvious solution is to cut the waste (thus saving at least some money) and promote from within the faculty to fill the top administrative positions whenever possible. The catch is that most faculty don't want to spend all their time begging alumni for donations and many aren't great with admin details, so finding a willing and able candidate may be challenging. I'd like to see top admin positions start going to unemployed PhDs and exploited humanities adjuncts, but fat chance of that ever happening!\n\nOn the other hand, the university's legal obligations have grown and so have students' needs. As the university serves a more diverse population, you need more staff to help students transition into college. For instance, if you have a bunch of first generation college attendees, they need more help navigating the university's byzantine bureaucracy and strange, opaque norms. In part, the problem is that the university is filling in for non-existent social services that *should* be provided by the state but aren't. Healthcare costs for faculty and staff have increased, and so have the costs of providing mental healthcare to students. \n\nThis is the difficult part. Do you rollback regulations, at the risk of for-profit hellholes exploiting students or letting profs sexually harass students or leaving disabled students to fend for themselves? If not, you need staff for that. Do you cut student health services just because it should technically be the community in general that provides such things to all people (not just students) who need it? If so, does that mean we don't care about students who have mental or physical health problems? Do you cut programs designed to foster success among students who face greater challenges (e.g. first-gen, diverse populations)? If so, isn't that stacking the deck in favor of students with more social and economic capital?\n\nSome of this work could probably be done by faculty and graduate/professional students (e.g. get the law school to help with compliance, assign faculty mentors for at-risk students, staff the health center with as many psych grad students and med students as legally permissable) but like...do you want to take time away from research and teaching to do that kind of thing?\n\nIt's a tricky problem.",

Based on context clues, he guessed that \"office hours\" were times when professors were busy working in their offices and you shouldn't bother them. He was surprised and grateful when a colleague corrected this misunderstanding.\n* A student emails one of their profs (or sometimes, a completely random prof!) about a problem with their housing or meal plan or something else that's completely outside the purview of faculty. Why did they do that? Reasons include: they have no idea who to ask so they use the \"ask a teacher\" strategy that has worked well for them in K-12; that prof said (at orientation or in class) \"don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!\" and the student took that literally; their parents (who have never been to college and don't know anyone who has) advised the student to ask a prof because that is the only position at the university they are familiar with.\n\nI imagine we'd get a lot more questions like that if we didn't have staff doing orientation, 1st gen student programs, res life events, etc.",

Likewise, because students are taking on insane debt, it's all the more important that we make sure our least-privleged students get the help they need to graduate (because a partial degree is basically worthless in the labor market).\n\nBy contrast, however, only about 30% of German young people go to college, while 67% of American youth go to college. If you're only educating the top 30%, of course you don't need to do much handholding. The 1/3 who don't need handolding in German higher ed don't need it in the US either - the additional help is for that extra 1/3 of the population going to college in the U.S.\n\nMy point is not to get in a pissing match about whose approach to higher ed is best, but rather to explain why, *yes, we really do need more student services than European universities because we are serving a broader population*. Maybe we don't need quite as much help and staff as we have now, but how else do you get all those additional students from more challenging backgrounds to do well?",

      "text": "I think what faculty sometimes resent is not the staff per se but the creep of staff roles into our work. There can also be a contemptuous attitude toward faculty from administration, and I think that is often echoed by staff because they tend to spend more time with administration than faculty members do. Administrators tend to hate faculty because we are fairly autonomous, and tenure protects some of us from retaliation when we speak out.\n\nWhen faculty express that we don't want to take on staff-type responsibilities in addition to teaching, research, and related service, there is often pushback from staff--faculty are sooooo lazy, why don't they want to help us with all the other work of the university?\n\nThere is a reason that faculty tend to involve themselves only in research/teaching adjacent work--it's what we know how to do and is our strength, and it takes more than 40 hours a week as it is. I am incredibly crappy at event planning and cold-call fundraising. There is no need for me and my middle-aged back to lift boxes at freshman move in. I am not the best person to send to a recruiting fair (forcing me to miss at least a day of class). My school just put out a call for faculty to serve as (unpaid) door guards taking temperatures and handing out masks--high probability of Covid exposure, no extra pay, sign me up! And yet I'm asked to do these kinds of things regularly, and the older I get the more likely I am to say no. My tenure means that I can say no, confidently, to taking my turn getting pie in the face at a homecoming booth.\n\nUniversities need staff. In the case of my university, we need more hands on deck period, and I definitely feel that staff dislike faculty because we can actually say no to tasks that aren't in our lane.\n\nBut since you're faculty also, maybe you don't hate faculty? This is not the case for all staff. I've heard complaints about our higher wages (they go with the degrees), fewer on-campus hours (we work from home a lot) and lack of dress code (no real explanation for that one but I'm grateful not to have to wear a university-branded polo shirt and a name tag every day).\n\nI can see why a staff person might think a faculty person is lazy, just because they are not on campus and in view, but it doesn't mean we don't work. The reverse is true as well--I think faculty could have some compassion for the largely more tiring and precarious working conditions staff have to deal with.\n\nI think staff and faculty could benefit from solidarity and mutual respect. None of us are the overpaid ones, even though our salaries combined make up the bulk of any academic budget. The overpay is at the very top.",

But it remains a fact that full-time faculty positions also serve a purpose, and we don't really do those anymore. It's not that the jobs are pointless. It's that there's zero balance, and so seemingly the fact that students like having a Wendy's on campus is sufficient reason to have a Vice President of Corporate Partnerships for Food Availability and all his associated staff, but no one feels like it's important that the person teaching the Chemistry classes has health insurance.\n\nAnd I'm obviously being a little snitty with the made-up example there. Again, I think most of the money goes into Marketing, Compliance, various forms of Student Services, etc. None of those are useless functions. It's just the degree to which their labor expenses keep growing in comparison to academic faculty that's the problem.",

This is why there must be a mutuality of purpose and of goals among the faculty, among the staff, and among the senior officials because together they will sink or survive.",

I am an adjunct at a large r1 state school and I DREAD when I realize I am going to have to deal with administrative staff. Some things I\u2019ve experienced:\n\nWas verbally offered  a full time non tenure track position by the Dean. No one could tell me the salary and  as the beginning of the semester approached, I couldn\u2019t get into touch with anyone in HR. They even put my name in the newsletter that I had accepted and I had classes assigned to me. I never got a formal offer letter but the Dean eventually told me the salary two days before the start of the semester at which point I declined since it was very low. Never got a formal offer.\n\nI was developing a new online course in a new system (moved from blackboard to canvas). Got an email from the distance learning department saying it didn\u2019t conform to their standards. I didn\u2019t even know they existed much less know that they had standards. I asked for a template that conformed to these standards. One didn\u2019t exist yet so they offered to help me build out certain parts since they interjected themselves late in the game. coming back from winter break, it hasn\u2019t been done and I reached out and they said they didn\u2019t do it yet because of winter break and now don\u2019t have the bandwidth because they didn\u2019t realize that the class was for the upcoming spring semester. So I had to do it all the week before the semester with my dean breathing down my neck. when I told the dean what happened the distance learning people denied everything but luckily my co instructor (tenured prof) was also on the call and vouched for me.\n\nI got this prepaid Visa card in the mail packaged just like any other credit card. No school branding or anything. It looked legit so I set it aside since it didn\u2019t have a balance or anything but the activation website was from a legit large bank. Fast forward a few months and I see that my direct deposit hadn\u2019t hit. I happened to be talking to a friend of mine who is a dean at the community college and he said \u201cyou didn\u2019t throw that prepaid card away did you? That\u2019s how adjuncts are getting paid now but they didn\u2019t make a formal announcement for some reason and a lot of my adjuncts threw it away, but your money should be on the card.\u201d It was on the card...\n\nI could go on...",
