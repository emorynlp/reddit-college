You want to go into industrial R&D & the positions you desire require a PhD\n\nC. The positions you want require a PhD even if it's not in R&D\n\nBasically if your job requires one do it. Otherwise no point. The only exception I have seen are people near the end of their career often in R&D that want to do a PhD as a self accomplishment and not to further their careers",

The most balanced academics are the ones with a 'fuck you I can quit tomorrow if I want' attitude. The worst and pettiest ones are too, come to that. But still, you will be delaying your earning potential by almost half a decade so if you plan on getting phd while providing, that's a recipe for burnout.",
