  "title:": "What's the difference between calling someone \"Dr. Name\" vs \"Professor Name\"",
  "text": "This might be a stupid question, but I'm that meme of the guy being like \"I don't know what xyz thing is and at this point I'm afraid to ask.\"\n\nI did my MA at an R1 public university, where all the faculty I encountered had doctorates. We called them by their first names after we had been invited to do so, but the polite, formal thing was to refer to faculty as \"Dr. Name.\"\n\nNow, I'm doing my PhD at a different R1 public university, where all the faculty I have encountered have doctorates. Again, we call them by their first names on invitation, but the formal thing to do is to call them \"Professor Name.\"\n\nIs this just a department culture thing? Or is there a functional difference?",

Some people or places will be more or less strict about those rules.\n\nIn most other countries (especially the UK) things are a bit more strict and only full tenured professors are \"professor\" - everyone else is generally just Doctor unless they have a fancy title like dean or director or something",

There are also lecturers in the US who teach college classes but aren't professors, and students like to call them \"professor\" out of convenience.\n\nAt my graduate institution, anyone at the graduate level or above just used first names.  It was a bit of a shock to get used to, but it definitely made it easier to interact and collaborate with faculty.",

Most academics have a PhD, but there are many other doctorates such as MD, DO, DDS, EdD, PsyD, EngD, DBA, etc etc. Some of these are professional doctorates and some of them are academic doctorates (i.e., a substitute for a PhD). There's a list on Wikipedia that's a mile long ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_doctoral\\_degrees\\_in\\_the\\_US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_doctoral_degrees_in_the_US)) \n\nThe title \"Doctor\" is appropriate for anyone who has an earned doctorate. That is, the proper way to address such person in a formal setting is \"Dr. Lastname\", and not \"Mr./Ms./Mrs. Lastname\". \n\nMany but not all professors\\* hold a doctorate. Most persons holding a doctorate are not professors. \n\n\\* In the US, it is common/colloquial usage to refer to any person instructing a college-level class as a \"professor\" even if they don't hold the rank of Professor.",

                      "text": "Only about 1% of the US population has a doctorate. Its not a \"short dick move\" to be proud of that. \n\nFor me, it took 11 years to aquire - not to mention the sacrifices, like giving up my 20s and choosing to study rather than work or build wealth. As a first-Gen college student, and as a multiple minority, I also had a constant uphill battle in academia with professors in my R1 doctoral program who felt that I didn't belong because I went to state schools, or that I wasn't committed because I had to work in addition to going to school, or whatever else.\n\nI insist that people call me Dr. because I worked really fucking hard to get here, and in a professional setting, I deserve to have that recognized. I don't want people barely know calling me \"Miss veryshanetoday,\" when the appropriate formal title in my place of work is Dr.\n\n*edit* I frankly find the responses to this comment to be a little ignorant. I'm not interested in arguing, but for anyone lurking who genuinely wishes to understand why some \"insist\" on being called Doctor can read a few articles that I found from exactly one Google search of the phrase \"women in academia being called dr.\"... my stance is an extremely common one for minorities in academia. \n\n1. [Should all Ph.D.s be called 'doctor'? Female Academics say yes.](https://www.kqed.org/science/1926489/should-all-ph-d-s-be-called-doctor-female-academics-say-yes) \n\n> On the first day of class, Debbie Gale Mitchell, a chemistry professor at the University of Denver, introduced herself to her students, telling them about her Ph.D. and her research. She told her students they could call her either \"Dr. Mitchell\" or \"Debbie.\" A male colleague had told her that he went by his first name and that students were friendlier as a result, so Mitchell decided to try it. Many students chose to call her \"Debbie.\" Then one day a student asked if she thought she'd ever get a Ph.D. \"I discovered that for me, the use of my title is VITAL to remind students that I am qualified to be their professor,\" Mitchell wrote on Twitter.\n\n2. [Why women academics with PhDs are often not called doctor](https://theswaddle.com/why-women-academics-with-ph-d-s-are-often-not-called-dr/)\n\n> The article reflects a larger problem faced by women academics who face severe discrimination and belittlement in their fields, often from male academics whose entitlement and gatekeeping keeps women from flourishing as renowned and respected experts and scholars. While the \u201cDr.\u201d title may seem superficial, women academics in the past have pointed out that it\u2019s often the only (and quickest) way to prove to someone that they have advanced qualifications in their field of expertise. This is especially important considering the title \u201cDr.\u201d has almost exclusively male connotations and associations, and women scholars with doctorates are often referred to as \u201cMs.\u201d or \u201cMrs.\u201d\n\n3. [What the 'doctor' title means for women of color with doctorates](https://theconversation.com/what-the-doctor-title-means-for-women-of-color-with-doctorates-150194). \n\n> I am not only a woman who holds a Ph.D. in a male-dominated field, but a woman of mixed heritage (Irish and Native American). There was never a time during my Ph.D. studies that I was not made aware that I was different, sometimes unwelcome, and most assuredly unlikely to thrive in academia. [...] There have only been a handful of times when I\u2019ve encountered people who refuse to use the title \u201cdoctor.\u201d I certainly have had numerous encounters, particularly on airplanes, with people who, when I tell them I am Dr. Hannigan and I explain what I study, they respond with a variant on the theme of \u201cOh, so you\u2019re not a real doctor.\u201d",

Most I have been to used Dr. Name but one I taught at used Professor Name. \n\nIn the US, professor is both a job title and a profession.  Anyone who teaches at a university is a professor, but only some professors are Assistant Professors, Associate Professors, or Professor (people call it full Professor, but the title is technically Professor).  You see the same thing with instructor.  If you teach a college class, you are an instructor, but some places also have a job title Instructor.  So I am Dr. Manova, Professor of neuroscience, who is the instructor for psychopharmacology.  \n\nBut to directly answer your question, it is a culture thing and there is no real functional difference.  At the one school I was at that used professor, they told me it was because when the college was first founded, not all faculty had a doctorate, so they used professor so everyone would have the same title.  That tradition stuck. \n\nRarely, because faculty without a doctorate can be called Prof Name, but not Dr. Name, some see Dr. has a \"higher title\".  However, I had a literature professor back in my undergrad school that preferred Professor even though most went by Dr.   Her reasoning was that Doctor meant you got a degree, but Professor meant you got a job.

If you mistakenly call someone professor when they don't have a Prof title (and maybe only a PhD) they will correct you because we're very strict about it.

I am not familiar with the US context directly, but have Chinese and New Zealand experience.\n\nIn the case of China, 'professor' is standard as a student reference to faculty, whether they are a lecturer, assistant, associate or full professor. Initially, it seemed a bit odd because in New Zealand students would never call me professor. Sometimes they'd use my first name, other times nothing at all. It's usual for undergrad students to avoid faculty generally so the need for honorifics is largely avoided. Another point is that in the New Zealand system most teaching is done by lecturers and senior lecturers, the equivalent of assistant professor/seasoned assistant professor in the US system (so, above 'lecturer' as used in the US system). While almost all NZ lecturers have a doctorate I've never been called 'Dr.' by a student.",
