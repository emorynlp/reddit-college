You're right, I'm sure, that a PhD counts as \"publishing\" prior art, and I suspect it would also be possible to call a PhD a publication for the purposes of a defamation suit (though I'm not 100% sure).\n\nThat said, theses are *not* (with caveats) publications for third party copyrights, for example, and it's perfectly appropriate to publish material as journal articles or monographs which  you have only previously used in your thesis. Academic publishers would not class a PhD as \"published\", and you'll note many citation formats explicitly call PhD theses \"unpublished\".

In some areas, conference presentations are considered valid as academic \"publications\", and in others one's thesis is often the greatest single publication one will make (e.g. being edited to be published as a book).",

You'll need to include them in this publication. They cease to be a justification, but you proposing these findings for the first time.\n\nThe reason that your examiners looking over it is not classed as peer review is because there is no third party editorial control over what changes are made or not. The PhD thesis process can not be relied upon to be at the same level of rigour.",
