      "text": "Some programs are set up for you to earn a master degree while obtaining a doctorate.  Others allow X credits from a master's to be applies to a doctorate.\n\nIn general, jobs/positions looking for a PhD are not worrying about if you have a master's.  So, the underqualified isn't an issue - unless the Doctorate was in an area not applicable for the job.\n\nIn terms of \"still learn whatever they missed out on\", that varies. Some places, the master's has mandatory classes not required by the doctorate.  So, for specific courses, no, they may not overlap. But, for instance, if you are switching universities, that will also be true.\n\nMost places in the US, a master's is about 33-36 hours. A doctorate is around 72.  The master's may or may not be about research. A PhD is about research.\n\nIn shirt, if you have a doctorate in field X, no one is worried if you have a master's in field X",

      "text": "It's very field-dependent. It is likely more prestigious in other fields, but in my area (molecular biology/neuroscience), the main reasons someone might do a masters first is 1) they're not sure yet if they want to do a doctorate  or 2) their undergrad academic or research experience is inadequate for admission directly to a PhD program. Getting a masters after a strong undergrad experience is not a good use of time if you intend to go on to a PhD. Once admitted, the doctoral program does not distinguish between students with and without a masters.",

In my field, a masters degree is expected for admission to a phd program, which then is at least five years but they do not give you a second masters on the way.",
