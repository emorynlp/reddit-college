      "text": "Thanks for sharing that! Unfortunately [retraction watch](https://retractionwatch.com) is full of similar stories in which scientists use identical tables or even figures in their different manuscripts. Which is so obvious and bold and unimaginable to me that I\u2019m actually amazed. Also sad. But also amazed by their absolute lack of care. And it\u2019s not a single person, usually there is a TEAM of coauthors who must all agree on such procedures.",

A table is a set of numbers - if they're used, say, in the methods section, the same methods can be reported in several papers (especially when reviewer 2 does not accept \"as per our previously described methodology\" when trying to avoid it). Or in commentaries.\n\nIf people are re-using their figures in original research papers, then yikes.",

It\u2019s about a phenomenon in which the same data (tables, statistical tests, graphs or microscope visualisations) are used as new studies with new results, claims etc. \nI mean if universities do not punish that kind of behaviour they are basically predatory universities, just like predatory journals but on the institutional level. And that is scary for scientific integrity. I always considered that in terms of a personal issue. Sort of \u201chow can you look at yourself in the mirror?\u201d but the author of that blog post actually brings an important point in which data like that, especially fabricated samples of thousands, really impact the future meta-analyses.",

They make up the overwhelming majority of caught fake data, and I don't want to know how much that isn't caught. The problem is so pervasive that it discredits honest work coming from that country. I got my project stolen and paper held in peer review for 1.5 years before two chinese authors published the same thing one month before acceptance. Only their results showed a cure while mine had only minimal effects. The project was so oddly specific that literally nobody had a reason to also be working on it. From that day, I stopped believing anything coming from China. If reviewers and editors don't want to do their part in stopping the problem, than just do your part by ignoring their blatant lies. Don't cite, reject in peer review, don't even read.",

It shows the recent trajectory of Chinas lies and it's frightening. Keep in mind, they publish a TON of papers in total so having such a high frequency per paper retraction is frightening.
