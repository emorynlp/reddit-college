  "title:": "How do people find time to work on multiple research projects and publish multiple papers? I can barely find the mental capacity for one.",
  "text": "I'm an MSCS student who does research in machine learning. I've noticed that many people work on several projects at once (usually their own project and as a participant in another) and often have multiple papers published in venues.\n\nRight now I'm trying to get my own research project going as I'm graduating next semester and need to write my thesis anyway, and am also involved in another project with a PhD student at my lab.\n\nI find myself usually spending 100% of my time on this project, and my colleague seems to expect that as well. I spend the entire day at the lab working on that project, and at night I'm also constantly wondering what kind of ideas I could try out.\n\nI've tried doing the \"alternate days\" thing, but I find that it often takes me more than a day to work on some ideas, and when I'm done with that there are more things to do for one project.\n\nMaybe my predicament is the result of me being relatively junior and not trained enough, but if there are any tips that you guys could give me that'd be great. The most advice I get from my lab mates and advisor is along the lines of \"everyone goes through it.\"\n\nThanks.",

      "text": "It just comes with experience. Time management is critical, too. Once your own project is up and running, you\u2019ll hit points where there\u2019s nothing to do but sit and wait for data, IRBs, reviewers, finding, etc. Those are the gaps you fill with other projects. Plus you\u2019ll gain enough expertise to serve in more of a consulting role which doesn\u2019t take as much time as running a project by yourself.",

      "text": "Depends how paced your projects are and how time consuming. I often work on up to 7 projects simultaneously, but it means I have a sample for one project being made, an hours long measurement running for a second one and during all that I do data analysis on a third project. Next day I may post a few samples to external collaborator, and while waiting for feedback work on something completely different, with a paper on yet another thing in a reviewing stage.\n\nIt maximises the chances of success, as many research projects  I work on are blue-sky, so hard to predict if the physics is even there.",

      "text": "A lot of it is just timing. Usually you can get into a rhythm where some projects are on the back burner while you focus on the others then switch back. So one you're waiting for reviews back, one you're in the early planning or writing stages, one you're in the hard core working on the meat of the research. It's much harder when they pile up, which it sounds like yours did. \n\nI also give myself extra days as padding if I'm promising something to a colleague or PI.",

      "text": "Before I left research I had 8 projects going at one. I am a chemist though so it is a bit different. I worked with pathogens so I would have to factor in incubation periods, culturing time for bacteria and parasites, the health of the parasites I used, health of my mice, for each project and then allowing time for the treatments to work. So I had a lot of waiting times in each project. I do not know how it would work in your field though. For mine it was just using those waiting periods to do something else since I couldn't do anything else at the moment for a project. For me it was just a way of staying busy so I wouldn't be bored sitting around doing nothing. I do not know your field though to know if you even have any time gaps like I did though.",

So data is used for many slightly different pubs or one research group will rejig something to get more funding from some funding body that one of the members has close links to etc etc. Those are only two quick examples - there are numerous ways that people work the system.",

In general the idea is to mix two very different types of work together.\n\nI have talked to a couple of people: pretty much all of them seem to be bothered by this problem and agree that it gets better with time. Best of luck!",
