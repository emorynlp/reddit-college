  "text": "I just go student reviews back, and honestly, it makes me wonder why I try at all. Philosophically I know I need to live up to my standards, not every single students', but I tried really hard to make this class useful and supportive. I used groupme to help answer questions (the students could chat me ad hoc, and I would always respond w/in 24 hours during the week). I had asynchronous lectures and then did extra exercises during office hours for students who wanted more connection. I posted midterm grades so students knew where they stood, I sent out weekly newsletters with reminders and upcoming dates, I held exam review sessions that always went long. I tried SO hard to help these students.\n\nI'm a hardliner on two things: no one gets an A for free, and I have little patience for cheating. I'm up against the historic course structure where it's an easy A. In fact, a student who took the course with the other prof said, \"I didn't show up for his class ever and still got an A.\" That's what people expect with this course. If that's the experience you were wanting, then my class was going to be a heavier workload for sure.\n\nAbout 1/3 of a small class responded to the course survey, and a few students ADORED ME, and then a few absolutely hated me. I'm pretty sure some of them are the ones I caught cheating. But they were giving me scores that didn't even make sense - almost everyone gave me the highest score possible re: answering questions clearly and responsively, and one student randomly gave me a 'd' with no explanation.\n\nA student gave me 'D' in another category because I wasn't responsive in the days leading up to the project. Nevermind that the project was due on a Sunday, I told the class to send me all questions by Friday evening, and I even popped in on Sunday afternoon to answer questions. They were mad I didn't respond to their question immediately on a Saturday.\n\nA student said I never helped them figure out the software for the course. I posted install instructions, walked through multiple examples, and even had a review on that type of problem during office hours. I also debugged any issues students sent my way.\n\nMultiple students randomly gave me \"d\" and \"c\" scores on things that, objectively, I know I am doing better than the other professors who taught the course. My lecture notes are really good - I spent a lot of time improving upon previous semester notes, and I saw that my notes were clearer, explained more, and drew more connections. And yet some students torpedoed my communications score, some without explanation, and then one student who brought up the fact that I didn't respond to their project questions on a Saturday 3 times.\n\nI think my biggest sin this semester was getting fed up with all the cheating I encountered (each case took so many hours to handle), that I finally sent out a mass email and said that any future suspected infractions would be sent to the honors system with severe punishment suggested, no questions asked. As a result, one student gave me a bad score for my classroom environment, stating that I was \"paranoid and emotional\", and that they \"felt unsafe in this course\". Should I have done a mass email? Maybe not.  But unsafe? Paranoid?\n\nI have good reviews too. For the students who hated me, I also had students who said they highly recommend this course and talked about what they enjoyed. But when you have a small sample size, those students who hated you will destroy your reviews. And I know I'm up against a course that is what many students consider an easy A, and I know many other profs who turn a blind eye to teaching in my dept, but I do feel, on the whole, I accomplished what I set out to do.\n\nBut fuck it all, it hurts. I put in a lot of effort into this course to try to give the students a valuable experience. Not an easy one, but a valuable one. I take reviews seriously and try to learn where to improve (for instance, I swear to blog that I am never having a project due on the weekend again, and, objectively, I could have provided a bit more structure on the project) - I even have midterm evals where I adjust the course where I can based on student feedback. I am a grad student - I've seen what other profs do - and I know I did way more than most for this course (I'm at an R1; I know a lot of these professors are swamped with research). How are they getting these great scores???\n\nI don't know what I'm looking for here. Maybe just someone else to say, this happens to all of us. That all the work and sweat I poured into this course mattered, even if I would have gotten that same stupid number score at the end of the day with half the effort. That it was worth it, to take a hard stance on cheating, even if I got some vindictive reviews. Realistically, maybe I just needed to go through the cathartic exercise of writing it all out.\n\nP.S. How important is that stupid little number that students give me, anyways, when applying for teaching-specific positions?",

I would say that all of my colleagues are well aware of the fact that grades are the #1 predictor of student evaluations and the way that student evaluations are administered make them meaningless from a statistical perspective. The fact that you're being rigorous and that you're a graduate student are essentially a baseline penalty that is totally out of your control. I'm sure that this doesn't take the sting off of the evaluations - students with an ax to grind can be real shits sometimes - but it certainly can explain them to an extent.\n\nWhen I have been on search committees for TT faculty positions, I have entirely disregarded student evaluation information that candidates sent in (and I would say that most of my colleagues have done the same). Being able to talk about your pedagogy and practice in the classroom is so much more important than glowing evaluations from students who received easy A's.",

      "text": "I am also a graduate student instructor - the advice I've received within my own community of practice (which focuses on learner-centered higher education) is that these bimodal reviews HURT but they are also very normal to receive and not reliable measures of instructor effectiveness. It doesn't make the reviews sting less, but I want to affirm that your efforts in the classroom do matter. Because you mentioned applying for teaching-specific positions, I will pass on the advice I have received - assess and document your students' learning through innovative assessment. Build a teaching portfolio based on your assessment alignment with learning objectives, and include data about how your students perform on your assessments/how they achieve the course learning objectives. \n\nI've also been in situations where I have taken a hard stance on plagiarism at the expense of my rapport in the classroom/end of semester reviews. How I am addressing it now is that I spend a whole instructional day on plagiarism, how to identify it in one's own work, and how to identify it in a peer's work. My hope is that it will help students understand plagiarism clearly before I ask them to write anything - the vibe I've gotten before is that they had no clue what counts as plagiarism, but that could be unique to my context. Good luck! The reviews hurt but they are not a reflection of your ability.",

And it feels so counter-intuitive, in a way (like, isn't some info better than no info?). But it seems that in many cases bad info is worse than no info, and evaluations are a case of \"bad info\".\n\nLiterally the only time in my career when I saw evaluations used for good is when people tried to fire a tenured prof who hated and abused students, an even then they were not _that_ horrendous, all things considered, and even then we failed to fire them.

My efforts are wasted on something like intro to philosophy, music, and even a number of technical classes because the fact is the type of STEM career I want uses an evolving skill set and knowledge base that colleges for whatever reason lack the capacity to curate to on an industry level.

Very rarely do they take the time to actually consider and evaluate along the different dimensions, and usually it's just a case of \"I like you, so everything was good\" or \"I don't like you, so everything was bad\". What students like is easy work, high grades, and a few jokes (as well as being attractive, and male). So if you want good evaluations then you can't really run a course that's useful and challenging, at least not without a very small curated group of students. I know that it's not helpful to say \"just don't take it personally\" but I think in the long run you will always get a handful of these negative reviews if you're challenging the average student. I'd try mentally re-weighting their opinions by how good of a student you think they are. Were the ones who adored you the students who seemed smart, engaged, and insightful? Were the ones who hated you uninterested, lazy, and looking for a quick A? If so then I'd say that speaks pretty highly of you and what you did. In any case I hope you're feeling a bit better about it by now.",

          "text": "> why student evaluations are largely useless\n\nStudent evaluations are just useless, period.\n\nLook, why would you try to put a number to a course? There are only three different uses for this number, really:\n\n1. Compare diff profs teaching same course\n2. Compare diff courses taught by the same prof\n3. Compare consecutive renditions of the same course, same prof, helping them to improve.\n\n1 doesn't work because of known (and unknown) biases, such as biases against women and people of color. Biases that are there even if the course is given online, and the (fake) name is changed as an experiment! And then there are countless other irrelevant biases - accents, height, approaches to grading etc.\n\n2 doesn't work because just having a course larger, or adding one mathy topic, or giving evaluations on a rainy day, changes the evaluations a lot. Similarly, different genres (like, electives vs required courses) are just simply plain uncomparable!\n\nFinally, 3 doesn't work precisely due to OP's post: we, humans, are just too vulnerable, and students are too noisy, young, and inexperienced. If a person cannot (yet) count, how can you hope that they'll understand your grade rubric? If a person cannot (yet) teach or study, how can you hope that they would value your good assignments? In a controlled experiment, withdrawing feedback from randomly selected 50% of instructors actually (wait for it) helped them! As they didn't feel like shit all the time!\n\nOP, don't feel discouraged. Just don't read your teaching evaluations (and I'm serious). [Think of this comic](https://imgur.com/r/sadcomics/DA4OG6a). You are a good teacher, and you'll be an even better one, but for real, concentrate on those people who care to study. And collect your own feedback. Don't let them judge you, but ask targeted questions - did you like this? Would you like more of that? Did you work better with a deadline or without it? Half of these questions should make them students reflect on their learning, and realize that your practices actually make sense. Another half may be useful for you. For example, if you poll students, and get a 50/50 split on some question - for example, 50% say the course is too fast, 50% say it's too slow - it's a good thing to show them, to make it known that everyone is heard, and everyone are about equally unsatisfied, just in opposite directions. You feel better, they feel better, it's a win-win! But don't read evaluations :)\n\nYou are great, I'm pretty sure! :)\n\nReferences:\n\n* Ch\u00e1vez, K., & Mitchell, K. M. (2020).

They're useful if for no other reason than so then students feel heard, and if there's a pattern of misbehavior by the instructor it may show up here.\n\nI would absolutely agree that student evals should not be given undue weight because it's such a crude measure. I also agree that numeric scales in this situation are too easy to distort, and the bimodal nature of \"I liked it\" vs. \"I didn't like it\" on a scale makes the response seem more extreme than they really are.  Just like other forms of useful summative assessment, essay boxes on what students appreciated or struggled with would get more useful qualitative feedback. \n\nI think the major value to the instructor is the evals can indicate practices which students perceived as very helpful or difficult. When they show up repeatedly it's something to pay attention to.\n\n\nI would add two other dimensions to consider: \n\n1) It's entirely possible for a student to have an excellent learning experience in a class they don't enjoy. I've had this happen several times in my academic career. This can be the result of many factors such as unusually or unexpectedly strenuous requirements, abrasive/mean/rude instructor, topics or activities which aren't \"fun.\" I have come to appreciate much later several courses where I struggled but I didn't realize how much I had learned.\n\n2) Higher level or graduate courses can have much more informed students capable of providing well written and meaningful evaluations.",

If you think of it, they create and perpetuate these aforementioned biases (via psychological priming), as they force students evaluate instructors as product. They are basically the opposite of reflective writing (which is an empirically proven methodology that improves learning), where students try to understand how they learn best. They are also the opposite of co-owning the course (what we often try to do in the syllabus: let's build it together, etc.). They are more like amazon reviews, but for people. Shifting the relationship into this customer-product space that admins like sometimes (not even always), but that ruins learning. They ruin everything, or at least go opposite to everything we value, as instructors, and painstakingly try to create during the course.\n\nIt is possible to collect info from students, and make them feel heard. It's important. But evaluations are NOT the way to do it.",

If you ask young students (like 1st-2nd year undergrads) whether they need a deadline, they are likely to say \"no\", and then they fail, as deadlines help. And they'll be unhappy. So there are questions you actually don't want to ask, as students will naively vote against their interest :)\n\nAsking questions is good in three cases:\n\n1. When you genuinely need to know something. Like, have they studied something in school? Did they enjoy lab A or lab B better? How much time did it take them to do the assignments? stuff like that.\n2. If you want them to think about something, and come to the conclusion that you know, but they don't yet know. For example, you can give them a deadline, and then ask them to reflect whether having a deadline actually helped them to stay motivated and organized.\n3. In cases when you don't care, but it may help them. Say, you need to decide whether to make something due Monday or Thursday. What works for them would depend on their typical weekly schedule that you don't know, so you can offload this question to them, and they will like it (supposedly).\n\nAnd in general, feedback helps. It helps you, and it helps them. As it makes them think about the structure of the course, and your pedagogical choices, it exposes some of your thought to them, and make them realize that you weren't doing stuff ad-hoc, but actually there was a reason why one topic went before the other, or you made them talk to each other, or you assigned groups at random, etc. They won't realize that it was meaningful unless you talk to them about that; and asking for feedback is one of the best ways to do it.\n\nEither way, I get carried away again, sorry :) Good luck!! You are great, i'm not kidding, it's quite clear from how you write and think about this experience :) Stay strong, and don't overgeneralize from bad people. Ignore them. Full 5-10% of people are plain bad, like latent evil, it's OK. I mean, we can do nothing about it. But the majority of people are good, and working hard, and trying to learn, and they are grateful, and rewarding! :)",

I \"changed\" my personality between semesters of teaching - started acting more upbeat/cheerful, lectured more enthusiastically, that kind of thing - and my scores went up accordingly. \n\nThey will also rate you based on your patience. If you come across as impatient or frustrated with a student even *once*, that pretty much tanks your rating with any students who are nearby to witness. This is hard because it's easy to come across as impatient even if you don't mean to and students seem to be pretty sensitive to it. I get to evaluate TAs as part of my job and it's astounding how much a TA's patience seems to have on what their students think of them. \n\nEven if you control for all that though, if they don't like you as a person for whatever random reason, they will rate you badly no matter how well you teach. So I'm pretty sure some of it is just out of our control as teachers and there will always be outliers who just don't like you as a person, even though the majority do. \n\n(In response to other people's comments regarding stereotyping, I am a female teaching in a STEM field, and haven't had a problem with being rated as emotional or harsh).",

I think the most influential lecturers with the most valuable courses do tend to be the most polarizing, because they also push students harder and expect more from them. The professor I mentioned had, by far, the most difficult courses in the department, and would intentionally give exams that he expected the class to do \"poorly\" on - but the exams themself could push students toward new concepts and show new connections (this is in pure math) so it wasn't unreasonable, especially because he would then apply a curve after the fact. Every student in my department either loved him and viewed him like family, or hated him and avoided him at all costs. I can't say for sure that you are similar to him, but I definitely think its possible, and I want to thank professors and lecturers who go out of their way to make courses valuable and challenging even though that might make certain students hate them.",

Not every student appreciated it. Some hated me for literally laughable reasons. But some loved me and they supported their glowing review with specifics of why they thought I was such a great teacher.\n\nAs a teacher, you can choose to focus on the bad reviews and get disheartened, or you can choose to focus on why students love you.\n\nThe point of student reviews is not to judge you as a person or even to determine your job or future jobs. They're simply for self reflection. If you got poor scores but the students point out good reasons for why they are giving you low scores in that area then it's an opportunity for growth and to try something different. If they gave you poor scores but didn't provide good reasoning for them or bad reasoning, you can mentally throw out that review. It means nothing, both to you and to other people who might see these reviews.\n\nEveryone at almost every level knows reviews are mostly reflective of what grades a student got and some students irrationally hate some teachers. This is very apparent if you're a secondary school teacher like I was because those kids generally don't hide it. I'm convinced the same thing happens in college but students don't have to interact with their teachers as much so they can hide it better.\n\nFocus on the good and the constructive criticism. Throw out the rest. I can't claim to know everything about college level teaching but in other levels, ALL teachers, principals, and educators at every level knew to take student reviews with a healthy helping of salt.",

      "text": "Hi there! If you're a grad student, your evaluations probably aren't important for the job market. Sometimes you need to include some, but you can usually pick a good one instead of including everything.\n\nI do see, reading your post, that you probably have some issues with teaching to work out in the future. If you want to get good student evaluations, you can actually make changes to increase their trust in you. I think it's a worthy goal to have students like and understand you. Here are my thoughts, as someone who used to have shitty evals as a grad student and now has excellent ones.\n\n1. The asynchronous model is going to be the hardest one to get good marks in. Adding a weekly zoom meeting if you have to be remote will help. A \"classroom feeling\" is going to be better. Once the world is normal again, pick face to face classes for an automatic bump in your evals.\n2. On the first day of class, ideally in person or at least in a live zoom, be super friendly and engaging. Tell the students things like \"this course is going to be difficult but fair\" and \"you'll have to put in lots of work, but it will be worth it to you when you see how much you learn and how much you improve.\" Also, \"I'm going to support you every step of the way, through everything that you might find hard.\" You fill find some of those very statements echoed back to you in the comments of end-of-semester evaluations.\n3. Have a midterm evaluation that you give to students. Ideally, you would incorporate their useful feedback and improve the experience for them. If you want to game these, use a scale that will encourage high scores. If your evals rank you 1-5, ask for a score out of 10 on the midterm evals to get your students used to giving you a higher number. I've never done this myself (too lazy for midterm evals at all) but it has helped others.\n4. For troubleshooting your specific course: If you're not going to answer questions by email on a Saturday, the due date can't be Sunday. What were you thinking? Make everything due on Mon-Thurs. If it's an online course, set one due date per week. I use Tuesday midnight for everything and that way I know to be \"on call\" Mon-Tues. You have to make the schedule work for you.\n5. On cheating: this will be controversial but do not worry so much about discouraging and catching every cheater. Cheating is rampant in academia. My view of it is that they are mostly hurting themselves and becoming more stupid, if possible. If you have cheating that you can prove with something like turnitin, by all means, file the form with your chair and give the student an F. Roast them if they are well and truly caught. For cases where it's iffy, just let it go. Your chair and dean will not back you anyway without solid proof, and you're just making the students mad at you. I am in a field where students can do a difficult-to-prove form of cheating by using Google Translator (foreign language). If I suspect the robot, I say that on the paper, give a grade I call \"C is for computer\" and move on. They rarely ask me for a better grade, they know they are caught, and I don't have to threaten them or go through an honor code violation for something that, well, I can't really say 100% was the robot translator but sure sounds like it.\n6. If it isn't obvious to you at this point, you should not have sent an email essentially accusing the whole class of cheating. Just don't. Cheating is something you have to deal with case by case.\n7. If you're a teacher who gives more work than the average and grades harder than the average, that is respectable to me, but you should expect lower evaluations. I have colleagues in that situation and I consider them good teachers but they are simply at a lower ceiling on student satisfaction scores than a person who is more relaxed. If the students do not perceive you to be \"generous\" with them, they will not be generous with you.\n8. If you are going to be high workload / hard grading, I suggest being extremely relaxed and friendly in your personal demeanor. If you are a high stress / high anxiety type of presence, students will feel that way too. I suggest learning some corny jokes related to your field as icebreakers. I also have some really stupid rants (foreign language teacher) that are about things like my hatred of tomatoes (ugh, the slimy seeds!) that I started performing regularly because they were kind of funny and in vocabulary the students could understand. There may be something that could lighten the mood in your field.\n9. And lastly, if you are a woman, LGBT, a person of color, or a person who is perceived to have an \"accent,\" they are going to give you harsher evaluations than your white/cis/het male colleagues get. Your ceiling for \"good\" evals is lower, and you will have more nasty comments. Do not worry about it--in tenure decisions, your department will know this and if they are a good department it will not matter so much to them.",

All those studies say that evals are biased against me but I get good evals.\n\n1. Have a solid syllabus that explains firmly what your expectations are. I grade no late work, for example. There have been like 2 exceptions in my career so make sure you have a good reason.\n\n2. Under promise and over deliver. I say I reply to emails in two business days but if it\u2019s during \u201cbusiness hours \u201c I usually reply immediately.\n\n3. Have early anonymous evals that you can respond to. About 5 weeks into the semester students tell me what they like and don\u2019t like about my class. A week later, I talk about all the likes (reminds them that I\u2019m actually good at this) and address the dislikes. Sometimes they don\u2019t like something but I explain why it\u2019s good for their learning. Sometimes they say I don\u2019t offer x but I remind them that x is posted in blackboard.\n\nVoila.

      "text": "It sounds like you\u2019re doing a lot of things right and really passionate about teaching, so I hope that a few poor reviews don\u2019t discourage you going forward!\n\nWhile some people on this thread have said student reviews are useless and not worth reading, I would disagree. You are getting the student\u2019s experience and perspective, however biased or subjective (and sometimes petty!) that may be. Rather than dismissing all of the negative feedback completely, can you glean some constructive information to inform potential change going forward?\n\nFor example, you yourself say that you\u2019re a \u201chardliner\u201d on no one getting \u201can A for free\u201d and that you \u201chave little patience for cheating.\u201d These are great things! However, maybe you could reflect on how you communicate these to students. When I was a student, I always hated when teachers started off their classes by talking about how there were no \u201ceasy As\u201d in their class. It felt like right off the bat that the professor was: a) judging other classes as being easy As and that they were superior to those other teachers/classes and b) assuming that at least some proportion of students were not intending to do the work needed to earn an A. While these might be true, it comes off as unnecessarily negative and presumptuous, when you could instead just state the requirements for earning an A in your course.\n\nIt seems like you\u2019re already able to do this (e.g., with the mass email on cheating and through mid-term evals), and I hope you\u2019re able to glean even more (while recognizing that some reviews probably don\u2019t have anything constructive). I wish you all the best in your continued teaching career!",

          "text": "Thanks for your response! I totally agree - I think I owe it to the students to look for the constructive comments in their reviews and adjust if necessary. I just was surprised by the reviews that were just mean without constructive comments this go round. I'll definitely pay attention to how I communicate with students. I don't think I said anything quite like I wrote it here, but as another commenter noted, it may be worth it to tell them things like \"this class will be tough but fair\" (i.e. it's not an easy a, but you will know what to expect). Thanks for your kind words!",

      "text": "Student here, so my perspective is limited but I can say this...\n\nIf you're teaching a course that is traditionally an easy A where you're at and trying to make it even marginally harder, then you've already won the award for world's biggest ass-munch in many students' views and that will not change unless you're willing to stop being so personally invested in \"challenging\" your students or being that \"above and beyond teacher that goes the extra mile to teach these kids something!\" Frankly, most people don't give a shit about any course material whatsoever unless it relates to our careers, we all just want to graduate and get out so we can do something that puts food on the table instead of attending school. If you can recognize that you aren't special and teach to the same tune your coworkers do, you'll make more students happy... AND the ones that you do want to challenge who are actually interested in what you have to offer will be more than happy to engage you. Sounds counter intuitive to give students exactly what they want I'm sure... but at the end of the day school is for them and it needs to be broken down to a level that is useful TO THEM, they are the customer that you have to cater to even if the customer is not king.\n\nSo in short, its good to teach to their best interest, but I think you have a skewed perception of what the average student's best interest is because you've conflated the course material with your ego to a small degree. \"Multiple students randomly gave me \"d\" and \"c\" scores on things that, objectively, I know I am doing better than the other professors who taught the course.\"  Seriously, take that attitude and throw it in a garbage bin, the idea that you're \"better than other professors\" and should go against the grain by doing it your way is part of your problem here.",
