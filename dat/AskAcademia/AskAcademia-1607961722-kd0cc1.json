  "title:": "Is misogyny the only problem with the WSJ op-ed on asking Jill Biden to not use 'Dr.'?",
  "text": "Edit: I do not often post. And looking at the options for flairs, I have a feeling this might not be the right subreddit for this. I apologize if that's the case.\n\nSo recently there has been a furore over the op-ed by Joseph Epstein asking Jill Biden to not use the title of 'Dr.' and even calling it fraudulent. The article is absolutely misogynistic and should be condemned. However, I was also offended by the denigration of PhDs in general. I have listened to people talk about 'real doctors' and it gets annoying. As a PhD in computer science, I do not go about touting my title in a hospital. In fact, I rarely use my title, unless required on a form. However, I feel that people who choose to do so are completely in the right. If a PhD goes about using the title with their name, the only flaw that can even be alleged is vanity, not fraudulence.\n\nI do not know whether the author chose to disparage PhDs only to help his misogynistic agenda with regards to the next first lady, or that he felt envious of people with higher degrees while he worked in academia. However, I think that the article can be condemned from an angle other than misogyny. The reason is that both WSJ and the author will double down on saying that they are not misogynistic, but in my opinion find it harder to objectively defend why a PhD should not call themselves a doctor.\n\nThis is just the thought that occurred to me. I would love to hear what other people's approach is towards this and learn from that. Thanks.",

Community college is an incredibly important dimension of US Higher Education, serving over 40% of all college students, and studying retention at CC is very valuable. \n\n(2) Being given a platform to judge a dissertation by its title, as opposed to its content, is the epitome of \"sound\\[ing\\] and feel\\[ing\\] fraudulent, not to say a touch comic\".",

He has to believe that him taking a some final exam in absentia at Fort Hood shows how he's a real man and not some poncy academic weakling.\n\nThen he also has to show that not only is his honorary doctorate as good as a real one, but actually better because modern PhD programs are degree mills, despite his clear ignorance of what they entail (claiming that oral exams and thesis defenses are things of the past is an *interesting* take). I'd also love to hear his justification as to why not speaking Latin really cripples either me as a chemist or Jill Biden as an educator. I guess she'll never get that job as education secretary for all the children of Vatican City. \n\nHe then has to, of course, invalidate all *other* honorary doctorates because he can't have any of the libruls be on his intellectual level. \n\nThe dig at community colleges is because he still, deep down, fundamentally buys into the idea that more advanced degrees make one 'better' and has to assert his dominance over anyone with a mere associate's degree. Which is hilarious, because I both know PhDs who started off at community college, and I now recommend to most friends and family that they start out at a community college instead of going straight to a university.\n\nOne of my biggest takeaways from years working as a TA and volunteering at schools in the community where I got my PhD is exactly how great a deal community colleges really are. The first two years of any degree is going to be damned near identical no matter where you take it, and lecturers at universities aren't going to generally be better than ones at community colleges in reasonably populated areas. Sure, maybe in extremely remote rural areas they'll be stuck with whoever they can get, but there are currently far more PhDs than there are academic positions in most fields, so I doubt this is a problem in most places.",

So what I wonder is if the use of the title \"Dr\" is established by rule or simply by practice, maybe because the popular way to call an MD is \"doctor\".\nAfter all, \"doctor\" is a word of Latin origin, from the verb docere (to teach). It then turned into doctor (teacher) and it seems that it was introduced into middle English from French (thank you, Google, for the latter piece of info) with the meaning of \"learned person\". So, yeah, doctor must have later come to mean the equivalent of MD somehow, in popular speech. In Latin, in fact, it's medicus.\n\nI wonder if \"dr\" for MD is then a residual of the original academic title of doctor (which I'd expect would be given to pretty much everyone back when universities still spoke Latin and only taught 3 courses - medicine, law and theology/philosophy) or rather the result of a form of appropriation favoured by the similarity between the popular term for (medical) doctor and the actual academic title that refers to a PhD.\n\nEdit: oh, I see! In the US an MD is a form of doctorate, because people need to go to college before going to medical school! Apologies, Europe got me confused. In most of Europe, in fact, to get a PhD it takes more (total) years of study than to get the equivalent of an MD, so MD is not really at the same level of a PhD \ud83e\udd14",

No, my DMA doesn't qualify me to operate on someone's gallbladder, but their MD doesn't qualify them to perform as a concert soloist with the NYPhil or teach doctorate-level pedagogy and specialized ethnomusicology courses at a major university either, so he can zip it. \n\nThat said, I tell my spouse all the time that I can't wait until after I graduate and someone stubs a toe in my presence, and I can dramatically say \"everyone calm down!

So in my case, for a while I was \"Dr. rer. nat.\" (doctorate of sciences), then after my habilitation I was \"Dr. rer. nat. habil.\", and had the title of a  Privatdozent, and now I am a Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Only the Privatdozent and the professor are allowed to advise people pursuing a \"Dr. rer. nat.\" degree.\n\nIt is not possible in the German system to be appointed to a professoral position without a doctorate, and at the research universities, you still need a doctorate and the equivalent of habilitation (which typically means a strong publication record and teaching experience; in my case my habilitation was another 100p strong thesis).  But then, in the German system a professor's position is typically tenured (the system is changing towards more of an assitant prof -> prof type system, similar to the US, but only slowly).",

I have friends who were his students in the 80s and they said he's always been like this; his record at *American Spectator* pretty much confirmed that.\n\nBut of course it wasn't just sexist and patronizing. It also revealed that:\n\n* he thinks Ed.D.s are not \"real degrees\" like Ph.D.s\n* he thinks M.D.s are the only \"real doctors,\" despite the fact that the Ph.D. pre-dates the M.D. by centuries\n* he thinks what matters about a Ph.D. is that it's \"hard\" to earn, despite not having earned one (or even an MA/MS) himself\n* he thinks Ph.D.s shouldn't use the honorific \"doctor\" despite 1) having earned it; 2) offering no evidence that *anyone ever in history* somehow pretended to be a medical doctor while holding \"only\" a Ph.D.; 3) not recognizing that many, if not most, Ph.D.s have far more extensive education than M.D.s and are trained in research rather than \"just\" practice. He's a fool.\n* he is apparently embarrassed by his own failure to earn a terminal degree, having spent his career as an instructor (wanna bet he insisted on \"professor\" from his students?) with only a BA, which would not even qualify him to teach at a community college today (to employ his own belittling tone toward CCs, which is of course unwarranted)\n\nObviously the WSJ editorial page editors published his snark because they wanted to drive clicks and found it an easy way to attack a Democrat, attack women, and signal to their conservative readers that academics aren't to be taken seriously. It deserves all the pushback it's receiving.\n\nAll that said, I think it's *also* valuable in one way: it has prompted conversation about the very real problems women in academia experience with people dismissing or ignoring their credentials and expertise. My social media have been flooded with stories from female colleagues/friends who have experienced this from everyone ranging from students to board members. It's a good reminder that those of us in positions of authority-- esp white, male, older faculty like myself --must be careful to establish and support standards of practice that address this, like using honorifics with our female colleagues in public and in writing.",

If you are ever looking for a simile to denote rarity, try \u201crarer than a contemporary university honorary-degree list not containing an African-American woman.\u201d \n\nIn other words, the fact that African-American women are frequently given honorary degrees is a sign of a decline in the quality of honorees (so not just misogyny but also misogynoir). Also, like, does he not understand that an honorary doctorate is not the same as putting in the work to earn a regular doctorate? Because he devoted a lot of this article supposedly about a woman with an earned doctorate lamenting the quality of honorary doctorates.",

      "text": "There are several issues and honestly the whole topic is a mess that can't possibly be unraveled in a reddit comment.\n\nFirst, the Dr. she is using is valid and is in no way fraudulent. As you rightly point out, the article is a politically motivated and frankly quite vile piece of crap. So I don't think trying to approach this from his ramblings can lead to anything productive. I will say that she has an EdD, which is not a PhD. It is still a doctorate which confers the right to be called Dr. but I believe it's not ONLY misogyny, as if that would not be enough, but also a deep seated disrespect for non-STEM or medicine-related fields. So yes the problems in that article are...well, it's a shitshow in many different ways.\n\nBut maybe let's start over and ask ourselves about degrees, their meaning, their value and the use of 'doctor'. Not only is there a complicated history of who is called 'doctor', there is furthermore a complicated history of class and degrees as a whole. First of all, doctor was originally used for learned academics - people who lecture at academies and universities. The use of doctor for medical doctors is significantly more recent, so historically speaking it is the medical doctors who began to use this nomenclature. But does this matter? Language is flexible and as long as everybody understands what is being said in what context, ambiguity can be fine. It is not particularly common outside of jokes that medical doctors and doctors in the original sense of what is nowadays called PhDs are confused, so language wise it's mostly fine.\n\nIn many western countries there has recently been a mostly men/male-driven push to not focusing on degrees so much. This is often because they feel uncomfortable with being treated differently simply because of their level of education or job, it can feel awkward to be called Mr. for many people in their young adulthood, let alone Dr. That along with their internalization of themselves as belonging to what is perceived as a privileged group with somewhat easier access or at least less pressures not to do so, makes them want to be chill about it, play it down, and in general you will find most young men in academia like first name basis, casual talk. This may on the surface seem like a good thing, and as a young adult man in mathematics I feel these sentiments too. However, this now puts the people who are first generation academics or people who have so far been minorities in academia into an awkward position: Because a large majority of young men are attempting to play down their degrees and status after attaining their doctorate, now all of a sudden it makes people think of women or first gens or ethnical minorities who wish to carry their title as a sign of their achievement as arrogant or stuck up.\n\nYou will find these sorts of things a lot on Twitter. Someone adds Dr to their handle, then a bunch of people comment why they feel the need to point it out - usually in reference with a lot of their colleagues or acquaintances not doing that. But the circumstance is different for these people, they feel like they belong to a group which has historically been denied this privilege and now after finally also attaining it, they are once again being denied to carry it because most men are, for in my opinion good reasons and with good intention, trying to dismantle the whole degree structure. In a way, and in a vacuum, I think most people agree that we would be better off if degrees had no such role in our lives, if Dr. did not modify the way you are generically addressed, just as I think we all agree that Mrs. and Miss in a historical vacuum is ludicrous. But we don't live in a historical vacuum. We have to deal with the past and the implications that have grown out of our use of language. So while I and many others in my position, based on modern values, feel a need to downplay our education and to remove this \"Dr.\" calling stuff, for many people this is a social status that they feel they've been denied despite, of course, rightfully now having earned it. So as I said, this is a complicated mess. It seems recently because of absolute jackasses like Epstein who are literally trying to deny people their degrees, younger men have started to, somewhat reluctantly, also wear their doctorates again, e.g. on Twitter and other social media, to make it clear that it is perfectly correct that someone who has earned that degree has indeed earned it.\n\nIt's all a mess, you see. Nobody in their right mind would invent such a system nowadays but we have to deal with what is not what we want. And what is, is that any woman, minority and of course every single PERSON, who completes a doctorate at a well regarded university (by which I mean not a degree mill), deserves to be called by the degree which they signed up for and completed if they so desire.\n\nAs a small side note, in some countries like Germany and Austria, the doctorate literally confers a name change of adding Dr. to your name, and the masters degree until recently used to literally change your name to include Mag. (magister, which means teacher). When the Mag. title was removed and became the MSc and MA during the Bologna process in the EU, there were massive shitstorms about people being denied their right to be Herr / Frau Mag. Many people rushed their degrees so they could complete it with the old Mag instead of the new post-name optional international masters degrees. So it is not impossible to get rid of such structure but it IS difficult and people hate it. Both for valid and for invalid reasons.\n\nWe also can't generalize over all countries and cultures, it's unfortunately all a complicated mess. Apologies for the long post, hope some of my pointers made sense and lead you down useful thoughts.",

              "text": "Yes, that's a well known poem in the relevant circles in this discussion and while I agree with the core idea as seen in my original comment, I think in general it causes needless diversion between people to phrase it in that way. A lot of people will agree with you if you say that academia is hard for everyone but can be MUCH harder than average if you're from a disadvantaged background or belong to a number of underrepresented groups. \n\nBy starting the conversation by saying it's easy, you already fail at the first hurdle because academia honestly eats at most people mentally and physically, so many men reading that poem might feel \"excuse me, how was/is any of this easy?\" Well the answer is, it isn't easy, it's actually really difficult. But it would be much harder if on top of that your entire social environment put additional pressures on you, or you had no financial support to fall back on or if you constantly had to defend the qualifications you already have obtained. Basically, I think many men are right there with the opinion expressed in this poem and could easily be made to agree, but you're losing them for no reason other than to get a jab in. Getting a jab in can be nice venting of course but it won't do much for the cause. \n\nIn particular, I myself see benevolent intentions in most men playing down their own education. They think it dismantles the perceived class structure (and this does unfortunately backfire for others like I said). They're basically already on your side that these things are bad though, so no need to antagonize. In general the internet could do with more constructive conversations in how to help things.",

Up here in the Nordics we culturally just don't use titles or honorifics anymore, to the point where Sweden even had a linguistic reform aimed at reducing social stratification ([Wikipedia article on the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du-reformen)). Basically, only royalty (addressed in the third person, for example \"Would the King pass the salt?\") and the speaker of our parliament (when addressed during debates in the parliament for complicated reasons) are afforded titles. I would call our prime minister by his first name and that would be in no way offensive. Similarly, I wouldn't *dream* of having my students call me Dr Lastname. That would be a huge social faux pas and my coworkers, friends, and family would literally poke fun at me for being a pretentious twit. \n\nThat said I just added \"Dr.\" to my name on Twitter because of the whole WSJ/Dr. Biden thing, so not all conventions translate across borders I guess. FWIW I'm expecting to get called on this by my Swedish colleagues.",

Still, it is hard to take his opinions on the rigors of doctoral work seriously when he is himself limited to a BA, one he got via an extension service over 60 years ago. He likely has never taken so much as a sophomore level science or math class; how could he possibly compare the challenge of getting a PhD in genetics, or aerospace engineering, or mathematical biology, or hydro-geology, to that of an MD? \n\nImagine if someone wrote about how today's Marines are \"soft\" because their boot camp drill sergeants are no longer allowed to physically beat trainees like they did during WWII. Then it was revealed that the author, while quite brilliant, had never so much as served in the Boy Scouts, much less the armed forces. Why would anyone take him seriously? What is the difference between this an Epstein? \n\nThis is textbook ultracrepidarianism, combined with political slime.",

Is Dr Biden actually doing this? As far as I've seen, she's just put \"Dr Jill Biden\" on her twitter as her name - since it's her name And honorific. I didn't see anything about her insisting on it or correcting anyone or anything of the sort. Epstein's piece seems to be preemptively telling her not to use \"Dr.\"\n\n> Both her predecessors from the same party have advanced degrees/doctorates from very competitive programs, and neither make a point to bring it up every time.\n\nHillary Clinton and Michelle Obama both have JDs, which for whatever reason generally doesn't come with the style \"Dr.\" And again, where is this \"make a point to bring it up every time\" accusation coming from?

I do think you\u2019re probably right some of his piece is anchored in some personal resentment about academic credentialling.\n\n(And on a second, personal note, I know some Ph.Ds and Ed.Ds that are, frankly, some of the dumbest people I have ever known. I\u2019ve seen dissertations pass through committees that I would\u2019ve failed in my undergraduate research classes. \n\nNow that has nothing to do with Dr. Biden whatsoever, but it has been interesting to me to see our cultural fetishization of titles laid bare.

He's accusing universities of giving out honorary degrees to women and minorities BECAUSE they are women and minorities. Probably also due to these women and minorities engaging in  \"woke\" activism. \n\nBy giving degrees out to people based on their race or sex, he's saying these universities are making their honorary degrees a mockery.\n\nI don't know how you could misread this so badly.

This annoys me quite a bit, so I leave you the following analysis and am done with you:\n\nSpeech exists within a context. Every word carries with it the connotations that adhere to it in the modern vernacular. Everyone of a certain age has been exposed to this concept, so should know it.\n\nIf you write or speak for a living you are responsible for how other people take your words. At least after a point.\n\nHe, along with my mother and mother-in-law, grew to adulthood in a time when women were treated as legal children in certain respects (e.g. not allowed to have their own credit card without a male co-signer, even if they had a job; compelled to use their husband's last name according to state laws). It is within that cultural context that he calls Jill Biden, a full legal adult, \"kiddo\". You don't call a black adult \"boy\" or \"girl\" unless you're trying to be seen as racist these days. Everyone knows this. Likewise you don't call a female adult a child.\n\nAnd then he outright wrote:\n>Political correctness has put paid to any true honor an honorary doctorate may once have possessed. If you are ever looking for a simile to denote rarity, try \u201crarer than a contemporary university honorary-degree list not containing an African-American woman.",
