  "title:": "How to tell a struggling PhD student who wants to stay in academia that it's time to look for other jobs?",
  "text": "I have a PhD student who is finishing this year who ended this job round with no postdoc offers. It's not completely surprising, unfortunately. The student, let's call them P, has had 4 years to improve on things like writing, communication, technical skills, and programming but has fallen short on all of them for where they need to be to be competitive for postdocs. That being said, P is a hard worker, super enthusiastic about research, and has been a good member of my group. P has gotten some interviews, but often gives extremely technical talks with no introduction (despite many rounds of feedback on this from me and others) and has tripped up when asked about the deep details of their work. Unfortunately, I see almost no way of them making it through the whole tenure track (postdoc, postdoc, faculty, building a group) without a quantum leap in their skills, even if there was an offer this year.\n\nP is understandably very upset about not getting any offers but continues to say that all they want is a career as a researcher and to stay in academia. This doesn't seem realistic and I want to start gently steering them towards the idea of looking for opportunities in industry or policy, especially since their PhD funding runs out later this year. But I'm not at all sure how to have this conversation without dashing their dreams. They're really eager and dead-set on this line of work, but I just don't see a path. Any advice for how to steer this conversation and offer constructive suggestions? I feel terrible that I have to deliver this news, and I've never done it before.",

Practice your script beforehand, warn them that this won\u2019t be an easy conversation ahead of time, then tell them exactly what you said here and just as directly. Don\u2019t leave any room for nuance. Resist the urge to couch your feedback in positivity. They need to fully understand everything you said here.\n\nThen give them time, maybe a week or so, to process. You won\u2019t be able to make them feel better since you were the one who gave them the negative feedback, so encourage them to seek out someone who can (friend, mentor, significant other, etc). Make it clear you support them and want to talk next steps with them, but that they should take time to process feelings first. Don\u2019t push them to get past the negative feelings and accept that they may blame you partly.\n\nUltimately P deserves to hear this direct feedback and you owe it to P to tell them this. The truth is that we don\u2019t all get to have all of our dreams and this is okay. But you can\u2019t let P continue down the path of thinking they are headed to academia with your blessing.",

Can this person run basic statistics that are taught in an intro undergrad class, make database queries, and know how to make pivot tables in excel?  Then welcome to the world of Institutional Research at a university or back office staff at a public school district.  Does this person have good reading comprehension, welcome to grant congruency, bonus points if they have human or animal research ethics or biosafty/radiation experience.  After they pick up a few certifications, they will be running the RIO office.  \n\nI work with a successful company that lands plenty of government research contacts.  Their main project manager has no particular technical skills.  He is a nice guy with good people skills and above average organizational skills.  He does not write the contracts or proposals (they have grant writers for that), he does not think up or write the technical stuff (he finds university professors to come up with the ideas), and once the grant/contract is funded, he does not do the research (he oversees the team he put together).  He has an advanced degree, but it is more to look legitimate to the agency they are applying to, but he could do the same job without one.\n\nI have a former student that got a PhD and now sells research equipment and provides technical support to investigators.  Her PhD allows her to understand what people need and what they are doing in the lab, but she does not \"need\" a PhD to do sales.  I have a friend that works in pharma whose job is to read papers all day long and forward relevant papers to the R&D staff so they don't have to put effort in staying on top of the literature.  I know another person that went into policy work and works for an academic society...well, to be honest, I don't know exactly what she does, but it seems mostly like office work.  I have another friend that got a job working for a company and he is basically a recruiter for PhD talent.  I had another friend that got a job for a military contractor after her PhD where she basically ended up doing things a well trained HS graduate could have done.  She actually left this job pretty quickly because of how low level it was, but the pay was good and the company wanted a PhD doing to the measurements because it looked good for the contract.  \n\nOP also never mentioned this person's teaching skills.  A community college or even HS could be a place for this person where research skills do not matter (though the parts about making talks too technical and not making corrections based on feedback is problematic for a future as an instructor).  \n\nSo basically, yes, there are jobs out there that would ask for a PhD that basically require aptitude of a fairly bright teenage pet sitter, but benefit from experience gained from PhD level research.",

I apologize for not answering your question but I'm hoping you may consider my dilemma. \n\nI'm a physics masters student interested in advanced theoretical physics. Though I'm doing masters right now, I don't think I'm competent enough do any kind of research in the field I'm interested in. I haven't solved any problems from books or assignments. I have ok grades. I don't think I'm a dumbass and consider myself to be reasonably good at things which I've studied properly which is not much. But I doubt I can do research in string theory if I didn't even read Sakurai/Goldstein properly. I admit all my problems are due to procrastination.\n\nI'm in a serious dilemma. Should I just try to do some small lame master's thesis and apply for grad school or should I leave masters and start masters all over again in a different uni to properly study? I may procrastinate once again but I'm really worried I would not be able to do any good research if I don't know the basics and regret later in life. Some information: I get paid while doing masters in my country so money is not an issue. \n\nI sincerely can't imagine myself not learning physics or science in general to understand the world. I don't know what else is there other than understanding the world and I think physics is the one I love the most because I believe in reductionism and believe that everything should be understood from the absolute fundamental ideas.\n\nMy school has nothing to do with it. It's me and my fucking procrastination. I'm hoping that the result would be different this time. I might be wrong and waste another couple of years, but is there any other option I have?\n\nAppreciate any response. Thanks.",

          "text": "Look, if you've always had a procrastination problem, starting fresh at a new masters will not fix it. You need to get to the root of the issue. Usually procrastination is an anxiety problem, even if you don't feel actively stressed out or panicky or any of the more obvious anxiety symptoms. A good therapist is key for helping you figure out *why* you do things and give you tools for counteracting that.\n\nMy advice: If you're not reading your textbooks properly, it's not because of something intrinsic in you, it's because you're not setting yourself up to read them properly. Start your assignments the instant you get them, set aside time to read every day (WITHOUT email/reddit/twitter/facebook/instagram open! set your phone on \"do not disturb\"), and then continue doing that for entire semesters. This sounds easy on paper, but if you're used to procrastinating then it will feel like moving through peanut butter as you do it. That's really understandable for you, don't be hard on yourself about it, but keep moving through that peanut butter because that is what you need to do to overcome this personal challenge. That's the part where you will probably notice your procrastination isn't laziness, it's a defense mechanism to protect you from the anxiety of working in this way.\n\nA therapist is a good tool at that stage because you can talk through your thoughts and personal discoveries each week, like you would with a friend, but you're not burdening any of your friends with your journey. Most humans process things by talking like this (this is why we ask each other \"how was your day?\"), so even if your therapist doesn't give you *advice* you will still get a lot out of having that listener.\n\nFinally, don't forget that physics is huge and lots of the same themes run throughout many topics within it. Maybe theoretical topics are cool and excite you but stress you out too much to be how you'll make your living. Maybe there are other topics that *feel* more approachable to you. I guarantee you that if you get deep enough into any topic, you'll find interesting mechanics analogous to what you love in your theory topics.\n\nP.S.- And if you don't have enough time to work on this before starting your masters thesis, consider taking a semester off for medical leave. During that semester do your therapy work and have some academic goals like \"read textbooks Y and Z and solve all the 'easy level' practice problems\", with deadlines you set yourself, so you can practice anti-procrastination.",

But it will be so much easier with one.\n\nI got through my own procrastination issue by basically doing all the above, but I felt really alone while I did it. I was ashamed of my procrastination and so I didn't even bring it up with the therapist I was seeing at the time. I still have a lot of trouble actually believing that I'm good at things, because I was hiding my own lack of preparation for so long.\n\nAt the time I didn't think it was an anxiety thing, but I've learned lots about myself since then and now it's so clear to me that that feeling is about avoidance and anxiety. \n\nI actually still struggle with it a lot, even as pushing against it has become habit. Doing my work the instant I got it became something I just do (good!), but as you move further away from coursework and your responsibilities diversify, keeping up this habit looks different. And sometimes you don't even have the ability to do stuff right away, you've got to put *something* off because there's too much to do at once. Recently I realized I am truly procrastinating on a couple of my projects, exactly like I used to in college, and this was so humbling. The procrastination feeling is a familiar old friend (doing the avoidant things is so soothing, whether they're social media or TV or just other projects). But now I know how to check myself -- when I start doing, or consider starting, those things I was avoiding, I get this weird specific feeling, and *now* I know that that is one of my anxiety feelings. 20-year-old me didn't have this perspective. \n\nAnyway, so just be careful, because this can come up in all sorts of contexts probably for the rest of your life. I really don't believe anyone is lazy, they really are just acting out certain urges that they get in response to their circumstances, and these urges happen because... I dunno really, genetics + formative childhood experiences + habits, and all this stuff combines to make your brain chemicals that color your entire reality from moment to moment. It's not your fault, but you can do stuff about it. That's why it's smart to set yourself up to have success in taking those actions (like through getting a therapist if you can afford it).",

Isn't it just a bad habit? \n  \nI just wanted to call out these comments first just because they feel like there is a lot of underlying judgement, and possibly towards yourself. Procrastination is normal and you shouldn't feel any negativity towards wanting time to yourself every now and then. It only becomes an issue when it becomes chronic, and even then, it still isn't some kind of terrible personality trait because it is a product of underlying challenges. \n  \nYou are allowed to let yourself feel upset and to step away from your responsibilities to take care of yourself. The important caveat is that you bring awareness and non-judgement to how you manage whatever is challenging you.\n  \nI would absolutely recommend therapy based on your OP (therapy is never a bad idea, even if you feel like you don't need it). They can help you explore your thoughts and feelings, and really put a language to your experiences. It is a very empowering opportunity and can make sure you are equipped to be aware and non-judgy of how your mind is responding to the challenges around you.\n  \nThe other thing I would suggest if you really don't want to do therapy right now is mindfulness meditation. The idea behind anxiety is that you are in a constant adrenaline rush thats triggered by stress. If the brain doesn't practice calming itself then it rewires itself to more efficiently operate in a stressed state and you end up just feeling stressed at a basal level. Mindfulness teaches your brain how to focus and observe your thoughts in a non-judgemental way so that you can give your brain the space to move on. It is really easy to do and basically every single study on mindfulness has shown it only has amazing benefits for your mental health.",

I\u2019m particularly skeptical of students who only want to do some very niche theoretical topic, as refusing to be interested in other fields or subfields makes it harder to find a topic of study that fills your niche. In all fields of physics, even some of the best of the best  physicists end up having to leave academia eventually because there simply aren\u2019t enough postdocs and permanent positions to satisfy everyone\u2019s wish to stay. This is doubly true of something like string theory, where you can count on your hands the number of good postdoc positions in the US any given year. Afaik most people who do string theory for their graduate already specifically prepared for it ahead of time. \n\nThe fact of the matter in my onion is that most people who do start a PhD should have not have the expectation that they will permanently stay in academia and should have a job plan in the event they have to leave academia. If you are not content with the idea of doing a PhD and not staying in the field in any meaningful fashion, you should reconsider whether you want to do a PhD.",

I love learning about these. I'm not sure how much I enjoy researching in those. Research afaik requires lot of work in the details (most times laborious). This may sound very selfish but I just love learning and leave the hard (laborious for me) work to others (others may actually enjoy the work that I'm considering to be laborious). But the thing I'm most interested in is in the fundamental laws because I believe in reductionism.

Researching is very, very different from *learning* in the sense that you mean. Most advisors actively encourage their students to quit taking classes and reading general books after the first year to do highly focused and specialized research. The two activities are so different that you should be given fair warning that you might end up hating the PhD experience and are in danger of burning out or dropping out early, which comes with huge opportunity costs. If your goal is self-study such that you can have a basic command of the basics of the material, the research portion of the PhD is not designed for that. This is also concerning because one\u2019s ability to graduate with a PhD is mostly bottlenecked by the research part, not the class-taking and self-learning part. A PhD mostly consists of the parts you may find boring and laborious. \n\n\nYour last statement has me a bit confused and makes me think you need to really consider your academic and life goals. A PhD program is 3-4 years if it goes well; a fraction of that (less than half) will be devoted to the part that you\u2019re actually interested in. The \u201cliving your life\u201d part at the end of your paragraph is a bit troubling to me because eventually you will have to leave full-time schooling and set aside self-study to your free non-work time, regardless of whether you stay in academia. Whether that happens now, after a second masters, or after a PhD, it will happen eventually. It doesn\u2019t make sense to do a PhD because \u201cyou couldn\u2019t imagine living without learning more\u201d considering the PhD is for a finite amount of time, *especially* if you don\u2019t plan on staying in academia at all. \n\nMoreover, the trouble with the PhD is that is it a net negative experience for people that attempt it and then leave early because the research experience wasn\u2019t good for them (and that\u2019s putting aside generic competence and work ethic). Not only is the time wasted, but the gap in one\u2019s CV, the lack of work experience, and the stress/anxiety/mental health issues make the cost extremely high as a professor or whatever.",

I think I'll be better informed if I do the thesis but then again doing thesis without basics is not a fun way to approach research...so idk.

You can however, explain different paths and how you assess your student's ability to succeed on those paths. This can then serve as basis for the student's own decisions. The student will understand that is better to have an acceptable job lined up than being unemployed in search of the perfect opportunity. But the student may not yet understand their chances correctly.\n\nIn your opinion, they are unlikely to succeed on the tenure track path, so it would be risky for them to pursue this path further \u2013 as evidenced by their difficulty in finding a postdoc. (And I'm assuming they already cast a wide net, instead of only looking at prestigious or local positions). You can be quite honest in your assessment that even if they were to grab a postdoc, you don't think they have the skills to progress further. But as an aside, working in academia doesn't have to involve tenure as the goal.\n\nIn STEM, it should be generally possible for a PhD holder to successfully transition into industry, even without very strong writing, technical, or programming skills \u2013 the deficit in communication skill is probably more worrying though. The main hindrance seems to be the student's self-image as a researcher or future professor. A better image might be something like \u201chighly qualified professional\u201d.\n\nIt might already be helpful to reinforce that they do have career choices, that they don't have to go the postdoc route just because they did a PhD. I.e. the lack of success on the postdoc market is not a career failure, it is a sign in a different career direction. But you're worried they'd be heading towards failure if they stay on that path.\n\nIf you can pull some strings to get the funding, you can significantly soften the blow by offering a clear (financial) off-ramp to the student: a guarantee that they will be employed for a few months longer, with an understanding that they really need to churn out applications because you cannot (and will not) offer further support afterwards, and that those applications shouldn't go to positions in academia. The advantage of such an off-ramp is that it sets clear boundaries and expectations (their career problem isn't your problem).",

Clarify why they want to stay in academia, what are their expectations.\nOften it\u2019s just a lack of imagination or knowledge about alternatives. Do their expectations match the reality of working in academia today?\n\n2. Be very clear on that a career outside of academia is not lesser - there are so many amazing career paths in other sectors and collaborations between them and academia. (If that\u2019s what you believe of course, they would likely pick up on insincerity)\n\n3. Clarify which weaknesses make them unlikely to climb the academic ladder, but also highlight their strengths. Maybe you have ideas for positions where those strengths would let them excel?\n\n4. Last but not least, encourage them to go to career workshops and see a career coach, they are experts on this stuff. I was lucky enough that my PhD program offered plenty of these, and it really helped me make good decisions.\nAlso, in light of the communication issues you mentioned, as well as the difficult period they\u2019re experiencing, P might benefit from seeing a psychologist if they aren\u2019t already.

Our PI would make suggestions, and those suggestions sometimes included discussions of slides for the introduction.  We often spent an hour or more discussing a ten minute talk.  If I came back the next week with revisions and didn't include the revisions we'd discussed, my PI would have asked why and there'd be a serious discussion.\n\nSo yeah I don't understand how it got to that point.",

If they want to waste years trying, then that's their choice. They need to learn their own lessons and figure things out for themselves. What you say may well be true, but it's not up to you to tell them what you see them doing in life. If you accepted them for the program you should support them with your letter (reserved if must be) and then let them learn their own life lessons.",

OP is responsible for their cohort, and did not train this person well enough, and then wants to tell them they should quit. And this is defended in the guise of \"professional development?\" OP bears some responsibility for the situation and can't be the only one to decide that the plug gets pulled. This department let this person get nearly to graduation before deciding \"oops, you suck!\" They should have let the person master out or something way earlier than now.",

Your initial comment reads like you are saying the advisor should not talk to their student but it wasn't clear you meant that because you thought the advisor failed. This section made it sound like you were saying the advisor should just say nothing and the let the student fail.\n\n>The person is an adult and can make their own decisions. If they want to waste years trying, then that's their choice. They need to learn their own lessons and figure things out for themselves.\n\nYes I agree with you, this advisor has failed their student. However given that, I'd say that belated honesty is better than no honesty at all.",
