  "title:": "Importance of undergrad grades on postdoctoral grant submission?",
  "text": "As briefly put as possible: My undergrad grades were not the most perfect. I had a couple of C\u2019s in courses not related to my current research field. Got into grad school due to my strong research background (2 pubs as an undergrad). Grad school went well for me, I gained more first authorships, and obtained several -internal - funding awards; advisor didn\u2019t push for grant applications unfortunately. I now work as a post doc in a well-funded lab at an Ivy League school but I\u2019ve never applied for \u201cofficial\u201d grants. I\u2019m concerned that my undergrad grades are going to come back and haunt me. And/or my current advisor is going to think poorly of me - he\u2019s a wonderful human so this is likely in my own head.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this sort of situation - either as a mentor or trainee?",

      "text": "I've had several grants from the NSF and have applied for many more and no one has ever asked to see my undergraduate transcript. I've also applied to NIH and same thing. If your advisor does for some reason inspect your undergrad transcript, just tell him the truth. It is part of your story and the path that led you to the success you are today. And don't be ashamed, you are proof that people are not fully realized beings as undergrads and shouldn't be judged for a few average grades they earned as young adults.",
