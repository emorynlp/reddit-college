  "title:": "Is anyone willing to be a guest-speaker in my bioethics and medical literature class for 1 hour this spring?",
  "text": "In consideration of bringing professionals and industry insight to students I am trying to arrange a guest-speaker for our class discussion. This is for a University in downtown Chicago. Depending on the week our focus will vary from exploring topics like euthanasia to experimentation ethics and the Nuremberg trials after WW2. \nThe meeting would be via zoom and my class is Wednesdays from 6-8 PM CST. If you work in the field of bioethics and or medical ethics and are willing to come online for my class discussion I would be willing to compensate you. I could possibly just record an interview with you instead of a live Q and A from the entire class (24).Thank you in advance.",

I have done 3 stints of graduate cellular and molecular work but I am a teacher and cannot give them this expertise. I am really looking forward to it.",
