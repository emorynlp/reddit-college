Note that in any case, you'd still get a PhD from the university, the research institute isn't able to deliver diplomas. \n\nThere is no serious difference between this and the uni PhD in terms of legal framework in France (the same laws apply). Some could argue that the researchers in the institute, being recruited more selectively, are better but that's difficult to generalize.\n\nOne key point that's specific to France : if you're doing a PhD financed through the institute, it's harder to get teaching hours during your PhD. It's not a big problem because you could do a special type of postdoc in France that *does* give you teaching hours ([ATER](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attach%C3%A9_temporaire_d%27enseignement_et_de_recherche)).\n\nI mention this because in France, if you're trying to get a permanent university position, you'll be expected to have some teaching experience. \n\nThis may or may not apply to german system but I imagine it's the same kind of setup (harder to teacher at a Max Planck institute but teaching is a required skill for habilitant or similar postings).",

My work-life balance improved drastically, I ended up still publishing quite well, and I am now doing a postdoc at a different research institute, with a much healthier and collaborative culture.

The relationship you'll develop with a doctoral advisor in the US is likely to be more intense than with a European advisor or a UK advisor.  Handholding though? Not in my view, but I can see how from a German perspective, it could be considered such. I considered a Max Plank Institute for my PhD work a few years ago. I applied to several programs, also in the UK and the US. I'm pretty sure that I owe my tenure track position just after graduating to the \"handholding\" I  received in my American institution, where I enjoyed input and feedback way beyond statistical analyses and theory. If you want a job in academia, I'd say US universities are undoubtedly better at preparing the best professors, balancing research,  grading and service from day 1. To be sure, toxicity, unhealthy expectations and madness are commonplace in US academia, not as much at all elsewhere.",

He always manages to give me just enough instructions to know what I'm working on, but not so much to the point where I'm not allowed to think for my own and problem solve. However, you will hear horror stories of people who were paired with shitty advisers that either don't care about their grad students or are just shitty people in general, so I guess you could say the US system is very \"adviser-dependent\".",

      "text": "For context: I did my PhD (physics) at Imperial while collaborating closely with a group at a Max Planck, my current boss used to lead that Max Planck group and my closest postdoc colleague did his PhD at a Max Planck.\n\nAs everyone else has said, MPIs are very well regarded so the reputation question isn't really a problem. One thing I haven't seen mentioned though is the difference in group size. My PhD group was bigish for a university (25 people), but the group I was collaborating with was part of a division with 80-90 people. Our 25 people were split into 2 labs with a PI each. Their 80 people were split into 8 labs with some group leaders, but all ultimately under one director.\n\nThe PhD students at the MPI said to me that they felt a lot more like a cog in a big machine than an individual researcher. Lots of strategic planning for \"maximum overall impact\". Not a lot of room for random side projects and \"oooh, let's try that\" unless you were a postdoc/group leader or the director really liked you. I heard of several instances of people being \"forbidden\" from pursuing a project because it \"technically\" belonged into a different lab's remit (even though they all worked on very similar things). I saw my PI in passing almost every day and had one-to-one meetings regularly (some other students around me had weekly meetings). Not exactly handholding, I still had lots of freedom, but my PI was aware of what I was doing. At MPIs, the directors' workload is much too big to have that sort of close contact with their students, so the group leaders do a lot of this stuff. \n\nSome people thrive in that sort of \"industrial\" research environment, other people want the more intimate small-group experience (my current group has 6 people and I much prefer this).\n\nAnother thing is that MPIs are *extremely* well funded. For most practical purposes, they have infinite money. Purchasing decisions that we would agonise over for months, they would make in a day, and just buy the best equipment available on the market. Or buy \u00a350k worth of stuff \"just in case\" a preliminary result panned out. This of course is very helpful to get lots of papers fast and build a solid base of publications, but it will take some adjustment if/when you leave the Institute and work at a university.",

      "text": "I would only add to the good advice already here that this answer will depend on your career goals as well. If you want a research-heavy position, whether R1 university, private sector, gov't, etc., then I suspect that this would have very little impact. If, however, you want (or honestly even would apply for) a professorship at any other type of school, then you might consider how doing a PhD at a university would benefit you. I work in the extreme of very small teaching liberal arts college, but have also interviewed at larger schools who commented on liking that I had worked in a university system so understood the unique problems and bureaucracies that come with higher ed. Additionally, most schools that aren't research-intensive want to see some teaching experience since that will be a significant portion of the job. I don't know that this would sway you either way, but a point to consider.",

Being a TA doesn't count for much, if anything, but many applicants have experience as instructor-of-record while Ph.D. students. I'd taught a half-dozen courses entirely on my own before I even took comps.  It's an expectation in the humanities and most of the social sciences. Less so in STEM but that's what postdocs are for.\n\nWe hire almost exclusively \"brand new\" Ph.D.s in fields where postdocs aren't the norm.
