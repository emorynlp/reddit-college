  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm wondering if you know what kind of job platform that caters to the academics who are only employ 9 months of the year? What kind of work do you search for in the summer to supplement your income, besides teaching summer school? Do you know any job platform that is specially built for this short term employment?\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "Most academics spend their summers doing research. Second most common would be extra teaching in the summer for pay (at the same university where they normally teach). Third most common would be administrative work (department chair and above are often paid a summer stipend).\n\nAs the employment options are relatively straightforward (and for most, relatively easy to find), there doesn't seem to be a need for a platform.",
