  "text": "Hi all. I recently graduated from the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop and am writing my first book. I worked at the university as an adjunct this past year but now I\u2019m struggling to find more teaching. The only way I could get a better teaching position is by publishing but while I work towards that, I obviously need income. Many people in my program had/seemed to have trust funds. I\u2019m thinking of a PhD in English but ... my job prospects would be about the same until my first book is published. I do feel like I have okay connections but I just feel really depressed and stressed about the future. I\u2019m teaching students in China online and only making like 70/class and it takes at least 2-3 hours to prepare materials\u2014that\u2019s a whole other story... is there any hope? I have three years of experience teaching writing/literature at the college level and I\u2019m 26. Kinda feeling discouraged and depressed. I\u2019d like to tutor but everything I come across pays really low. I\u2019m proofreading for a company and it pays sometimes as low as $5/project. I also have experience teaching music and I worked as a college admissions counselor if that counts for anything...\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t mean to imply that a book will bring any income whatsoever, just that teaching positions tend to ask for publication history in job applications.",

          "text": "Also boosting this! I\u2019m in a PhD program in English (cw dissertation). I don\u2019t recommend it, unfortunately. Here\u2019s my (overly long) story:\n\nAfter a year of adjuncting, I got lucky and got a 2-year poetry fellowship, where I got to see a little more what the hiring process and life looked like for professors. I saw how the sausage was made, and it was a bleak sausage.\n\nI saw friends get year-long teaching gigs at Ivies and still not get hired for tenured positions at smaller schools. I saw great teachers with multiple books make it to on-campus interviews, only to get passed over for more established profs making lateral moves. Meanwhile, I was still sending out my first book.\n\nI realized that getting a tenured position wasn\u2019t something I wanted to put much faith in. I looked at grad programs in more \u201cuseful\u201d paths I was interested in\u2014education admin, nonprofit admin, high school teaching, etc. But all those programs generally weren\u2019t funded, and I was terrified of taking out student loans. (My MFA was fully-funded, but my undergrad loans were still a stressor.) However, I knew I had a shot at getting into a fully-funded PhD program in English. I could write, research, and teach while I took other courses on the side and used my summers to get alt-ac experience. \n\nSo, I started my PhD. But the pandemic has now really messed with my plans. Though I got a (free!) graduate certificate in nonprofit mgmt here by overloading on classes, the TA load is such that I don\u2019t have time to get experience outside of teaching during the year, and the summer gigs I wanted to apply for have been cancelled due to Covid and budget cuts. (I\u2019m also contractually barred from working for anyone but my university during the school year even if I did have the time.) \n\nThough I\u2019ve enjoyed most of my classes and am excited about writing my dissertation, it is difficult for me to feel the same sense of purpose I had when I started. The fear of my job prospects is always in the back of my mind. I\u2019m pretty depressed. Ultimately, I wish I had just gone back for a 2nd Masters in something with better job outcomes, that I\u2019d just chosen to bite the bullet and take out the loans somewhere affordable for a more in-demand field. I feel like I\u2019d have more time and energy to write creatively, too. On the plus side, I like the city we live in, and I didn\u2019t lose my job during the pandemic.\n\nAll that said, if you want some ideas of what to do instead of a PhD: \n\nYou could pick a state where you\u2019d like to live. Then move to that state and do jobs that leave you with the mental energy to write. Your college admissions experience could open up a lot of doors. If you realize you really miss teaching, look up your state\u2019s outlines for getting teaching certification for folks who don\u2019t have Ed degrees. In some states, it\u2019s pretty easy for Masters holders to get certified. \n\nSend your book out and publish in journals. Try to let yourself write without the fear of academia. Maybe your book will get picked up, and you\u2019ll get a fat advance! Apply only to the fellowships/residencies that truly excite you. \n\nGet that sweet, sweet in-state resident status if you stay put. By the time you get in-state status somewhere, you\u2019ll have a better idea of what path you might want to pursue, and all the public universities in the state will be your oyster to apply to. You also might have moved-up at a job you like, and then you won\u2019t even need to worry about grad school!",

      "text": "Congrats on getting in & graduating from Iowa! That's such a prestigious program & it will be great on your calling card, no matter what you do going forward. I'm a writer, as are most of my friends, & I know at least 5 people who graduated from Iowa over the last 10 years.\n\nI can't recommend one way or another whether to get an English PhD. I would say that it appears to be just as competitive to get jobs in that stream/at that degree level. There are just way more degrees granted that positions available (in both literary & many other fields). Of course some people do this degree because it's a genuine passion, & no one wants to talk you out of that.\n\nI'm not 100% sure if what you're asking about is a true career path vs. a stop gap job while you work on your writing project(s). So what I'm recommending here, in place of proofreading/teaching, is a type of \"day job,\" in case that's what you need for now. It's a tip another writer gave me, & it really got me out of a similar rut: and that was to look for jobs in \"communications.\"\n\nThese roles are often editing in nature, & involve a degree of writing/research. Some place will have some copy & ask you to trim or revise it, or will ask you to draft it, & then share it, whether internally or internally. Like you, I used to work as a proofreader (for a great magazine & do freelance etc.) but it didn't pay enough, so I got a job doing \"communications,\" first for a social non-profit, then for a mental health organization. And it paid, like, more than 10x as much, & had benefits etc.\n\nYou can probably find entry level-ish communications jobs for $30K+ up, or part-time if you prefer, etc, as there are many options, & a lot of transferability. You might not want to do communications for, IDK, a bank or something super corporate, but perhaps if you find something arts-related, or related to some other interest you have--it might even be a type of org/industry you want to understand better for your own writing! But a job like that will allow you to live & write indefinitely, that was my experience. I wrote 2 books (poetry), while working in communications, & I have a number of friends who continue to balance this role with their writing practice. And I think your MFA & teaching experience will give your resume a bit of an edge.",

I've done all sorts of different jobs before arriving at academia and all of them, I would argue, are informing the work I'm doing now.  You sound like you have a better idea of where you want to be than I had at 26, but I'm just saying keep your mind open to different opportunities.  Life will take you all sorts of places if you let it.\n\nIf you have your heart set on teaching then it's a matter of starting to take small steps towards whatever you need to do to be able to teach.  Try and set aside that feeling of urgency that you need to be somewhere or someone *right now*.  Think of yourself as growing towards it!  You have the rest of your life for this stuff :)  Give it time, do small things every day to get you where you want to be, and eventually it'll happen.",

Some of these people tried a hybrid path, publishing academic work while maintaining their creative practice to keep both doors open, while others just did as little in the program as necessary to keep good standing and maintain their stipends/insurance. It's not easy, because you'll have to juggle coursework, exams, teaching, etc. But if all you want is to have time and space to focus on your writing then it beats many of the alternatives.",

In no moment I told op to daytrade, that would be something incredibly stupid to do, you're changing my words.

MOASS) will only \"start\" after July 14) and wait for the best, because people on the Internet are really going to break the economy if this plays out as it should. You'll see the news telling you to sell those shares, you might see people tell you that you will lose all of your money, you might see it drop 80% from a moment to the other, heck you might even hear I am in a cult, but you don't sell until you see a life changing amount of money in your account, ok? You shouldn't be doing with your money what a stranger tells you (so this isn't financial advice) but this could really change your life if I'm correct. Visit r/superstonk if you wanna go down the rabbit hole, but I warn you there's a LOT of info to digest. In summary there is a financial war going on and we got Wall Street by the balls, they have huge undisclosed short positions and will eventually, if not by July, be forced to cover their short positions and GameStop could go to 20 million usd a share.",

Don't start working jobs that have zero to do with your career goals. Don't spend time doing work that isn't mentally stimulating and that doesn't add value to your personal aims. \nWhat you are trying to achieve is insanely hard. Give yourself credit for how far you've come! And now go on and continue towards your goal. It's true that many people don't make it. But there's no reason why you should be one of them.\nI know we're all very passionate about not starving to death.. :) But it's so important to follow your dreams, as pathetic as it sounds. \nPerhaps working a job in publishing, proofreading, editing services for academics or something like that is feasible?\nI wish you good luck!",
