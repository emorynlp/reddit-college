  "title:": "How do I excel in writing discussions and conclusions?",
  "text": "I'm on my masters in humanities, and while I do feel like I'm getting a good grasp on theory and think independently around it, I'm struggeling to ask critical questions and use the theory to draw my own conclusions when writing. I can discuss subjects and compare how the different theories and authors look at it, but I'm really having a hard time writing something that is \"good\" and using the theory to draw independent conclusions. \"Be independent\"- how do I become independent when everything I do is based on earlier reasearch??\n\nI don't know whether my problem is that I'm not critical enough when writing and thinking, or if it simply is that I haven't understood how to write good discussions and conclusions, but I would love input on both. If anyone has any good advice, either on what you're looking for in good texts, or things/ways of thinking that could help me improve, I'd really appreciate it.",

Clarify something about the disagreement.  \n\nLook for absences.  Look for places where the field hasn't examined something that it could.  Show how inclusion could make the field better.",
