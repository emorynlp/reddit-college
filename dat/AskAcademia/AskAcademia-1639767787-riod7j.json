  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nLooking for some advice. I just had a campus visit last week at a SLAC for a TT job in a humanities field. \n\nHow long does it take until the committee makes a decision usually? I haven\u2019t heard anything and wondering if a decision has been made. The last candidate, out of three, visited early this week. I unfortunately didn\u2019t ask about a timeline when I visited.",

      "text": "As others have said, the bureaucracy means that this can take a LONG time--especially since most schools are on break now.\n\nKeep in mind that some schools can't tell people they didn't get the job until someone has taken the job and signed a contract. This means that if you're not the first choice, you could theoretically not hear for months. \n\nEven if you are the first choice, the committee has to pass that info on to the department and/or chair, who have to sign off on it, then it goes up the chain. At a big place, this can take a while--especially over break.",

Other candidates would not be contacted until much later. It is not uncommon for a candidate to accept an offer from another school, at which point we may make an offer to a second candidate. If so, this would likely happen ~8 weeks later, possibly longer.",
