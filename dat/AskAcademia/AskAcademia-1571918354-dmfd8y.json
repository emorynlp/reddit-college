  "title:": "Struggling to transition into the \"real world\" after graduating. Lack of confidence and direction in life.",
  "text": "Hi there,\n\nI graduated this summer with an MSc in nuclear engineering. I've always enjoyed studying and I did this course as I was offered a stipend and it was an opportunity to do another year of physics. Before this course I did a bachelors degree in physics. I live in the UK btw.\n\nIt sounds sad but I enjoyed spending a lot of time on my own learning about lots of different topics. I immersed myself into the course and sacrificed everything else in my life.\n\nNow that I have graduated I feel lost. I don't know what to do with my life. Also, I have always had social anxiety and low confidence and these things are starting to become a problem again as I am afraid to apply for jobs or go to interviews.\n\nI've applied for a couple of graduate schemes. I was actually rejected straight away by two in the nuclear field as I don't have any experience. I am looking at different fields like trading, finance or petrophysics, but I know that competition for graduate jobs will be fierce.\n\nAt the moment I am looking at Christmas retail jobs to tide myself over, but even then I am a bit anxious about what the roles might involve. I attend a running club every week to get out of the house.\n\nI think a PhD is out of the question as there doesn't appear to be a demand for PhD graduates in the nuclear industry. I don't think a PhD would help my job prospects in any field, plus I am 31 now.\n\nDid anyone else feel lost and lacking in confidence after graduating?",

      "text": "Most of my friends and I myself all felt that way after graduation. It is perfectly normal and understandable: after all you've now achieved the goal you've had for a long time, and you probably hadn't made any plans beyond that point.\n\nIf you really want to, you can definitely do a PhD, even at 31. But don't sign up for one just because you don't know what else to do. Whether there's a clear demand in industry or not is not that important - there will always be some positions where a PhD is viewed favourably.",

A 10% improvement now would pay massive dividends over the course of your life.\n\nOne thing I think is you've got a great opportunity now to get into a sector you like. Imo be careful about what you choose. For example if you do finance and then work in it for 5 years you will kind of be a \"finance person\" and it will be easy to continue in that field and harder to move to another. So pick something you think you will like.\n\nIn terms of applying for jobs I pace myself against applying for 100 jobs which I genuinely want hoping to get 1. You can't really just apply to 2 or 3 and get disheartened, it's a marathon. The good news is though you will get one after a while, it just takes time and persistence.",

It might be a preferable route than going into industry. I\u2019m the same way, in the sense where I took some time off and worked in industry, but felt kind of lost after my masters research. I felt like pursuing an advanced degree would be more meaningful (personally) than just making money, so I decided to go back and get my PhD. \n\nAt the end of the day, whatever you do, know your worth. You are clearly intelligent given your degree subject, and I know you worked damn hard to attain that. Have confidence, because not everyone could have accomplished what you have thus far. You are qualified for whatever path you decide to go down. Hope this helps without sounding too cliche.",

I spoke to my tutor who said all him and the lecturers do is look at research all day aswell as teaching responsibilities and I thought that sounded perfect \ud83d\ude02\n\n\n I think ive come to terms with the fact im best suited to academia, I have an obessive personality, I get very interested in things and I love the aquisition of knowledge. My advice would be dont assume you have to get a PhD directly related to your masters, I'm sure lots of PhD programmes would find someone of your calibre of use. Do what you enjoy cause at the end of the day that is what you will excell at.",

      "text": "I felt this way every step of the way from undergrad to my current position. Having to put yourself out there, interact with new people who are evaluating you, feeling inadequate, it sucks. From that perspective, letting yourself settle into something you see as easy, low stress, or more menial is really tempting. The only reason I didn't do that early on, like when applying to grad school, is because I had a partner who was depending on me to make the most of what I had accomplished to that point.  \n  \nAt the later stages, finishing my postdoc and interviewing for a faculty position, I had kids. The idea of starting to seriously apply and interview was like mentally crippling for me. Wanted to just call it quits badly at that point, even though I loved the work and had done well enough to be competitive. I'm fortunate in that not trying my best felt like it was just not an option.\n  \nI think it's important to remember that feeling like it's too hard to even try or that you don't have a good chance among your peers is often totally incongruous to how others see you. If you like the work, you *can* brute force your way through the grueling application and interview process and you can do well despite those feelings.",

      "text": "I felt the same way when I graduated in August. Tutoring or teaching maybe a good way to make some money in the short term. What I have been doing is reaching out to my entire personal / LinkedIn / school network for informational interviews. Anyone and everyone. This has really helped me get an idea if I\u2019m interested in what they do or what I thought was interesting.  It also helped me practice for interviews and gave me more confidence talking to new and profesional people about my work and interests. After a few months, I\u2019m pretty sure I know what direction I want to take and start working towards those jobs.  Just my two cents. I am also 31. Good luck!",

      "text": "I\u2019m in my final year of grad school and also work part time, and I feel a LOT of what you\u2019ve expressed feeling, too... especially when it comes to confidence. After further reflection, I know my low confidence comes from identifying deeply as a student and a learner, so when it comes time for me to actually do things in my job, I jump into student mode and question if I\u2019m addressing every possible angle that we should think about if this was a thought exercise. Even though I realize that, it\u2019s much harder for me to confidently approach tasks! Recently, I\u2019ve been brave and sharing this with my manager, who is very supportive and appreciative that I\u2019m being candid about potential barriers to high quality work. Just opening up that channel to communicate is important for us to support each other well. I\u2019m still definitely working on this, though, since I know that all of my training is sorta meaningless unless I approach my work with confidence and ability to trust myself. If I can\u2019t trust myself why should I be hired? \n\nThere\u2019s a lot you can do as a nuclear scientist, especially when it comes to nuclear disarmament work. I worked at a foundation that funds nonprofits and think tanks seeking to address nuclear challenges globally - so, if you\u2019re at a nonprofit or think tank doing that kind of work, there are funders who want to support you. \n\nI agree with others who suggest finding a way to give back and be in service to the younger generation. I don\u2019t do this as often as I wish or used to, but try to mentor in anyway you can. Actually, since I can\u2019t mentor in person, I try to give my two cents here online, where I can feel that I have the potential to help somebody, even as I experience my own challenges and struggles. I feel that the notion of giving back after we\u2019ve \u201cmade it\u201d is too lonely, and even when you get \u201cthere\u201d, your advice may be way out of touch since you\u2019ve never really been in the habit of mentoring anyway. Kinda like how some corporate big wigs think they can run a nonprofit, lol, but I digress... \n\nAnyway, you have much perspective and insight to provide to others! It\u2019s actually much rarer than I realized, having a masters degree and building the fortitude to graduate. High school and college students could certainly gain from your technical and personal knowledge. \n\nFind some outlets for creativity and passion projects! Those give me the most life and inspiration :) \n\nAll the best, friend! I\u2019m right there with you.",
