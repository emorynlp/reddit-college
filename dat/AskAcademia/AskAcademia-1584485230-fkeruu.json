  "text": "Hi academicians,\n\nLike the title says, my institution has cancelled May commencement ceremonies across all campuses--while they're looking at other options like postponing/virtual celebrations, who knows what will actually happen. I'm a first gen PhD candidate who intended to walk in May, and had really been looking forward to sharing this moment with my parents, who barely got through high school.\n\nI understand the reasoning behind the move, but I'm still holding space to feel a little upset. Anyone else in a similar boat?",

However our graduate field assistant for my department said we might still do something small.  You might check with your admin if your department when it gets closer to May to see if that is feasible.\nI ordered my robes, idk if I can get them or at least I\u2019d like a 70$ refund lol for the PhD rental robes.  Even if nothing happens I think by May a friend or two and I will go take pictures next to our university\u2019s sign.  That\u2019s something fun you can do.  I\u2019m sure amazon sells graduation hats, might not be the right color but other people don\u2019t need to know that!\nDo some self care the next couple of days it\u2019s been an emotional roller coaster.",

      "text": "We also had to break with traditions.  \nUsually the tradition in my lab is that you defend, have a small reception, receive your graduation hat (that your labs decorates for you according to your interests and research project) and then we go and the student [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUv7EgO2VCE]kisses the G\u00e4nseliesel on the market well[/url] and decorates the well with flowers. The PI will also pull the student around the well in a small decorated cart (as many rounds as the student took to graduate). Then lunch/dinner/drinks depending on time of day.\n\nI defended, received my hat and had a small reception but not more. We'll have to do the G\u00e4nseliesel tradition later.\n\nAnother option (which other labs do) would have been to do that after the official graduation ceremony but of course it's unlikely that this will happen, since this is quite the mass event: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNWewUYUTEI&t=53s]Impressions[/url].\n\n\nBut I don't want to complain. Our university will not hold any defenses until the 20th of April (at least), so I'm grateful that I could defend at all. The day I had my defense was literally the last day where it was possible (which only worked out for me because we rescheduled my defense, originally I was set to defend on the 26th of March...).",

So while we haven't heard about commencement, I am sure it is not going to happen. I know it is necessary to preserve the health of the general population, but yeah... I feel extremely unmotivated to do anything (and there's not much I can do because I do lab research). It all seems kind of pointless since job searches have been put on hold and we don't even have commencement to look forward to.",

Only one person before me even got a masters and few on either sides of the family even got bachelors. My university held my commencement but the hooding ceremony was outside. The invited speaker graciously cut her speech VERY short with the impending rain. The president of the university then stood back up and took the speaker\u2019s time to do his own talking. The rain began and we didn\u2019t get to walk or be hooded. It was immensely disappointing. I wasn\u2019t about to make my family sit through another much longer regular commencement the next day so I let it go. \n\nThe next day we had a small party with my family and closest grad school friends at the house of a professor who I was close friends with (not my advisor or someone from the department). My wife stealthily arranged to have a make shift hooding ceremony where this professor hooded me. We then proceeded to take all manner of silly pictures together and generally kicked the party off right. \n\nYou might see about arranging this yourself if you have the opportunity.",
