It\u2019s extremely common to feel that way when you reach a milestone you have been working toward so single-mindedly for so long.  I encourage you to take a break, if you can, and reconnect with yourself and the things that bring you joy.  Go sit in a park.  Go for a bicycle ride or a hike.  Watch a movie.  Go on a trip.  Hang out with a friend.  Do anything except work on the next paper, at least for a little while.",

The anxiety took probably a day or two to go away since I had been so focused, it took awhile for the brain to realize it was done.  I didn't do much in the lab after that cause my paper had been submitted and I wasn't going to start a new project.  Other than helping out some lab mates, I just cleaned my area up in preparation of leaving.  But enjoy this time and take the time to relax and have some fun!  Congrats again!",

      "text": "Right after I submitted my PhD dissertation, I was an unshowered, disheveled mess. At about 9pm, I immediately went to my local watering hole.\n\nThis was no ordinary watering hole. It was a back-alley speakeasy whose door looks like you might get your kidneys harvested. Upon entering, one's eyes are greeted with beautiful marble statues, sumptuous chairs, and the odd funk jazz band if you come on the right night. \n\nWhen I entered, there was almost no one there. I went to the bar, sat down and ordered a beer, and started surfing reddit. A tipsy man approached me, and within a few seconds he revealed himself as a local tech bro looking to elevator pitch his newest dumb idea. Given that I had just finished my PhD, I was able to intellectually disarm him, and not listen to his newest dumb idea. After some small talk, he left to go \"work the room\" - not that there was much room to work.\n\nA very not disheveled, good-looking man then came down and sat beside me. It was obvious he batted for the other team. After some discussion, it turned out we had a shared interest in Ancient Greek literature, although he was much more advanced than myself. Not only was I jealous of his long, dark-brown hair, he also understood all the references to Lucian's \"A True Story\", something I was never able to master - the oldest Western science fiction novel, complete with space whales, space wars, and parodies of contemporary literary works.\n\nA man and a woman then entered the speakeasy, and sat down beside us. The man was bald, and clearly on cocaine. The woman told us that it was his 30th birthday - an early mid-life crisis. She immediately picked up on the fact that I had not shaved in several days, nor had I done my hair up. I was also wearing a suede leather jacket that \"aged me\" (I was clearly 6-7 years her junior), and my blue pyjama shirt and sandpaper jeans. This did not go over well. She spent a considerable amount of the next 30 minutes trying to convince me to let her do me a makeover, speak poor French with the homosexual Ancient Greek fellow while telling me I could also not speak French, and ignore her mid-life-crisising friend who was bald and very self-conscious about it - he did look splendid without hair, though.\n\nThe bartender came by to refill my much-needed forgetful juice right as this woman was pointing out for the (n+1)th time that I needed a new sense of fashion. Her face was that of a beached whale. I ordered the most expensive drink on the menu.\n\nThen I found a typo in my dissertation.\n\nAt some point, I survived the night, went to piss in the urinal, and waddled back home. I think I arrived to the office on time the next day, but it's a bit unclear in my head.",
