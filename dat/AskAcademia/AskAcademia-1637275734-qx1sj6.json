  "text": "Hello AksAcademia Community,\n\nI'm curious how complicated the footnotes of a scientific paper can get? In more detail, what elements do they usually contain? Do they just contain plain text, do they contain formatting (bold, italic), do they sometimes contain references, cites, equations, ...?\n\nIf you are curious why I'm asking this. It is because I'm fine-tuning the footnote feature of [https://www.monsterwriter.app/](https://www.monsterwriter.app/). Your opinion would be very welcome :)",

      "text": "In the context of scientific publishing, footnotes should certainly be formattable and should accommodate references, citations, links, and math (with correct numbering based on where the footnote symbol appears in the main text). Perhaps you could draw the line at inline figures and tables if that's an enormous effort\u2014although it would be nice to offer nearly every feature that's available in the main text (headings don't generally need to be supported).",
