  "text": "I'm 3.5 years into a postdoc at a R1. In that time I've got one first author publication (related to my PhD, not my postdoc), one mid-author, and two pre-prints, one of which won't be moving forward. There are three manuscripts that could get submitted this year but submitted isn't published and really I feel completely demoralized by the gaps on my CV.\n\nThe lab had a rough year with a graduate student who was dealing with a mental illness eventually resulting in a psychotic break and left the lab. It was honestly somewhat traumatic because we did everything in our power to get this student help but it did nothing.\n\nMy boss is surly and difficult to work with. I'm pretty placid and used to ornery bosses, and I was given a lot of flexibility/leeway as a new parent (I had a baby in my second year) and a partner with a well-managed but chronic health condition, so it was working well for a while but I'm realizing now how much I am being taken advantage of. I work really hard, but have so very little to show for it. I don't know how to apply for grants. My boss keeps telling me I won't get one. I don't know if I should spend my energy in a futile effort applying for grants or futile effort in getting these papers out. I'm so disillusioned with the system. I can't even tell if I like research anymore. I used to enjoy it. I can't remember what I enjoy about it.\n\nI taught a semester as an adjunct. I always was interested in teaching and thought I would enjoy it because I like working with undergrads and I had enjoyed TAing as a grad student, but I found it challenging and got some pretty harsh evals (I was very pregnant at the time, which didn't help). When I left I remember thinking that I could have done it better but overall it was a good experience. However, looking back I just remember being tired, stressed, and those harsh evals.\n\nI'm thinking industry might be my best way to go, but my field doesn't translate well. I know everyone says that, and I need to rely on my strengths but looking through job postings makes me realize I am mediocre at just about everything that matters.\n\nThis is such a downer post, but I am super isolated and don't have people to talk to. I guess I am asking for some realistic advice...I feel like my career is in the toilet and nothing I do matters to anyone.",

      "text": "\"makes me realize I am mediocre at just about everything that matters\", it feels you might experiencing a bit of impostor syndrome. You got a PhD, you got a post-doc, do not question your skills, you are clearly talented.\n\nBeing in a similar situation, I would suggest this.\n\nThe translation of academic skills into industrial skills is most of the time hard, but maybe you can complement your research skills using online resources (eg look online for some MOOCs that can help you understand business problems). \n\nThan take some time (1 month at least) and show off your skills with one/two personal projects, publish them online, and try to grab the attention of the industry sector you are looking for (send the projects with your CV).  Show, do not tell, what you could do for a business company. \n\nSet up a LinkedIn account, and spend 5 min everyday to like and comment posts related to your field of interest. This will get you the attention of professionals.\n\nSet up (at least) a 6-month plan of how you will allocate time for your current work objectives, training non-academic skills, and family, and try to stick to it. \n\nBe prepared to *be patient*, it will take time. Eventually you will get a job where you are stressed but happy.",

But if you keep focusing on the next goal without appreciating what you've accomplished thus far then its not surprising you will feel down. So look back, appreciate what you've done and gain some needed confidence from that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs to u/reFelUK \\- While the transition to industry advice appears sound, do you have any annecdotal evidence of such tactics working (for yourself, friends or others)?",

I can tell you this:\n\nOnline courses are helping me to understand business problems. So, in the cover letter I now try to explain what I could do for a company in a concrete manner (e.g. instead of \"I can analyse your data\", i write something like \"I can identify your top products and predict what characteristics make it the top to support the marketing department with ads\").\n\nA made a six-month plan with different milestones, and this helped me to manage all different things (otherwise I have the tendency to jump from one project to another).\n\nIncreasing my online presence on LinkedIn (liking and commenting) helped me to get my first interview (in less than a month, considering I am looking only jobs in my small city, I consider this a great thing).",

It's not surprising as you're getting intense pressure from all directions, work trouble, sick husband, caring for a baby etc. \n\nMy suggestion would be, before making any career moves, to see a therapist and see what they think. Maybe your university has a scheme to support you?",

      "text": "Hey there OP, first off, big hug.  And congrats on being a new mom. A couple of things:\n\n- I\u2019ve gone through both depression and post partum depression. You sound like you\u2019ve been back at work for awhile and your baby appears to be only a year old. That is really hard.  I really recommend going to speak to both a doctor and a therapist.  Universities typically have excellent mental health resources and benefits and I hope you have access to them. Please use them. They saved my life. PM me if you want to chat about this.\n\n- It\u2019s very hard to make good decisions if you\u2019re not in a good state of mind; lack of executive functioning and all that.  I caution you on making any big moves at the moment \n\n- Re teaching - my university has tonnes of training for post docs on how to be a good teacher. One off workshops, full certifications, mentorships, etc.  I found them really helpful AND they look amazing on a CV because being a good teacher means being a good communicator and that is a very transferable skilll.\n\n- My university also has career resources for post docs and grad students. I really recommend you check yours out if you have access to it. Tonnes of seminars on how to transition from academia to industry, people to help you write a resume and practice for job interviews, skills inventories to help you figure out what fields may work for you etc.\n\nI hope something here is helpful. I\u2019ve been in your shoes and know how hard everything feels right now. Big big hug.",

      "text": "Seek a mentor. There are online mentor matching schemes if there's nobody you can turn to at your university. LinkedIn could offer some ideas of external mentors, you could reach out to guest speakers. You could set up a researcher support network in your department and invite people to give career advice talks, it sounds like your cohort could use this. Your PI is using you as a workhorse. Of course you could win grants! \n\nDo some googling for all competitions, grants, prizes, awards no matter how small. Science writing, data visualisation etc are all things you can win prizes for that don't rely on a publication record. Boost your CV however you can!\n\nYour career is in your hands. Ultimately, you're playing the game on 'hard mode' so things will be tougher for you, but most of progress in academic careers comes from determination. Having said that, if it's not working for you, do consider other career paths. I got out and now work for a government department that also does research. Good luck!",

      "text": "Everyone above has given great advice and finding a good mentor is always a fantastic thing to have. I had bad burn out in my 4th year and couldn't even remember why I got into research in the first place. I was in a bad spot and ended up convincing myself I should go into patent law and not research. Spent the next few months and hundreds of dollars to become a patent agent, but by the time I finally was I didn't even want to do it anymore and was ready to defend.  I got a local job in industry and absolutley love my career.\n\nMy advice would be to think really hard about whether your struggling bc of your advisor and the research or because your heart is not in research anymore. For me that was a long and expensive question, but at the end of the day it wasn't my advisor or surroundings, it was the specific area of research I was in. My job still uses my grad school skills but has allowed me to really expand and find out more about what I'm passionate in. Best of luck!!",

      "text": "I've been a postdoc for 3ys,as well, and I made the move to the industry. I explain how I realised that I had to move, how I did and what is my opinion about my move.\n\n1) Like you, I was passionate about my research. It was on theoretical mathematics (which does not translate easily to the industry).\n\nIn my first postdoc, I took a position as applied scientist in a startup because I had no job opportunities in academia. This was an 1y contract and I was so worried on what to do after it that I could barely focus on my research. At the end, I found a post doc in a university and had to change countries (continents). This position was supposed to have a collaboration with a major university (e.g., Caltech) but when I arrived there, my supervisor only used this collaboration as a bait for me to do whatever he wanted. He also said the same thing to me: you won't get any grant.\n\nDuring the last year, I decided to give up academia and move on to the industry. In this last period, I realised how much I gave up and how much academic decisions (such as grant approval) are merely political, and guess what academics will never admit this.\n\n2) To start my next step, I decided to search for jobs and talk with postdocs that made the move. They were basically working less and earning more. Their jobs were not aligned to their scientific expertise and this made me realise how far from society I was. I talked to recruiters to understand what were the market needs and how I could improve it. It took me one year to learn this.\n\n3) After my transition to the industry (3y ago), I couldn't be happier. I have time to myself, I have time to spend with my wife. I don't need to work during the weekends. I earn more and I am healthier. It also noticed that my friends that never gave up academia got a position and they were never super intelligent. For instance, I have a thesis award from a French research society and publications as first author in the best journals of my field of research. They have not the same achievements as I do. This made me realise that academia is far from being the meritocracy that academics claim. They got their positions because their supervisors were good politicians not because they deserve it. If there's meritocracy in the world, it is not @ academia",

      "text": "One possible way to transition to industry (which I highly recommend, having done it) is to look for internships designed for post-docs. Lots of big companies hire post-docs for relatively advanced, but limited scope work where you'd be expected to do some directed, but independent lab work and likely produce documentation of your process and results, like a white paper. In my company, these internships pay quite well and many companies have intern hiring cycles around now for summer starts.",

      "text": "Hi OP, I also wanted to extend virtual hugs as I understand what you are going through. Also, congrats on being a new mom!  \n\nOne of the commenters recommended finding a mentor - do it! If your PI is not really filling that role, is there someone else you can talk to to help you navigate job prospects in your field? My PI is not my mentor, in any capacity, so I have found that when I need advice/read-throughs on job applications, etc, there is another faculty member in my department that I turn to.  \n\nFinally, without knowing your field, I wanted to give you a little solace from my physics education background. These studies are mostly all done at the intro levels. On a 1-5 evaluation scale, women ranked 1 full point lower than men on an evaluation for online intro STEM classes (and the same teacher taught both, just with different names on each class roster).  Pregnant women always get lower evals than other women across the board in STEM intro classes.  If you had your child during the term you were teaching, you probably got even worse evals for that (any level, but more prominent at intro level).  If you are young (or look young) that hurts your evals.  If you are short, that hurts your evals.  \n\nSee if you can find some useful feedback in that pile that can help you improve teaching going forward (ex. I wish we did more in-class demos or I wish the prof could post her notes after class was over, etc).  But for all the hateful, derogatory, or demeaning comments, know that is really not about your abilities in the classroom.  (If you would like the long versions, I'll gladly dig out some links to these studies).",
