  "title:": "How can I speak with an academic advisor before I\u2019m enrolled as a student?",
  "text": "I\u2019m looking to continue my education and go into nursing, I\u2019ve already graduated from a 4-year university with a BA but I need different pre reqs and recommendations about which route is best for me to pursue what I want. I really just need to meet with an advisor! But whenever I google about it- I always find that in order to speak with one I have to be a student at that school. Does anyone know if there are \u201cfreelance\u201d academic advisors or opportunities to speak with one even if I\u2019m not a student? \nAny info is helpful! Thank you!",

          "text": "I hear what youre saying, I guess I\u2019m just not sure what pre reqs I need or which programs I would be eligible for given my previous degree (a degree unrelated to nursing, unfortunately). I\u2019d just like for someone to look at my transcript and help me figure out the most efficient path, rather than waste $ or time being unclear about how my previous education might or might not apply to my future education. I think I\u2019ve become more confused about this process because I know a few different people in nursing school, and they got there using completely different avenues. Some started from the very beginning and others were able to save some time by getting into programs that move quicker. Just don\u2019t know where I stand.",

You don\u2019t need an associates degree. \n\nAn accelerated program will allow you to transfer in credits from your original degree to take only the nursing courses you need, but often is competitive to get into and has a number of prerequisite courses- basically all of the requires science courses for the degree. \n\nYour other option is to enroll as a first year and complete an entire degree, like you did your first one. \n\nSome schools might let you transfer in some courses from your first degree, you\u2019d have to specifically ask about that.",

Some programs require a child development class or developmental psychology. If you have not taken a chemistry class, it is likely you will need to in order to take microbiology. Not sure where you are located but nursing programs can be very competitive to get into so it is important that your grades in those courses are high. You should check the requirements and how they accept students (waitlist, lottery, rubric, etc). You should be able to inquire with the school before you are a student or go to their nursing specific website for information.",
