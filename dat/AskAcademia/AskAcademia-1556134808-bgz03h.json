  "text": "I work in a shared office with a couple of other research groups at a university, one of which a feud with someone in our group (e.g. using office consumables, misplacing staplers and claiming ownership of items etc). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast week, when I was working late, a member from that group came and intimidated me, swearing and getting uncomfortably close, asking me about an office item which was misplaced quite often (I knew of it, but not really the specifics), to which he ended up smacking me on the back and head several times (a very aggressive way that could've seemed casual if anyone was watching).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince then, I've been feeling quite shaken, I don't really trust the environment I'm in anymore and certainly not anything around me, I've been keeping my food locked and putting all my work in a binder at the end of the day and taking all my data/books home in case there is any  further conflict that gets worse than physical. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand academia can be a stressful environment but I don't anyone has ever tried to physically confront me over something that I was not directly involved in (other than having a vague knowledge of the events). Is this a common occurrence that people brush off? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a junior research fellow if this helps anyone.",

It's inappropriate in a work space to be bickering about office supplies to begin with, but that was tolerated and now it has clearly escalated. It should not have been tolerated to begin with, as it does not sound like a tongue-in-cheek, \"now who done stole that one good stapler\" situation.

It's been really encouraging to hear that this is not a thing in academia that I've encountered (of course, I've dealt with/been in the same room with some very heated/demeaning arguments but nothing physical). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly, I know I've been asked some questions about situation in detail. Unfortunately, I really don't want to escalate this as I'm a junior research fellow with \\~ 4 months left on my contract, I really need everything moving forward to work so I can move on. The risk of a drawn out complaint with the possibility of being distracted/hindered from my work at this stage really can't help me. The aggressor in the incident was a senior postdoctoral fellow two groups down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThirdly, I've started keeping a diary of events revolving around this problem, I've decided to keep all my belongings away from the office in a friend's space in a neighbouring area. I will need to keep using the office as it has hardwired connections to the server I do all my work on etc etc. But my opposite number has not really changed, he is still constantly very angry (?), when there are very few people around (while I'm still here), he has a tendency to start throwing/slamming things, often very close to me to create a big noise. It's still very intimidating but I guess I just have to work with it for the time being. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you again for letting me get this off my chest.",

It doesn't always work out as perfectly as simply not getting help. And not reporting isn't always just a case of being a coward and perpetuating rape/assault/etc.",
