  "title:": "Is There Such A Thing Called 'Lateral Research'?",
  "text": "I'm not really sure what this would be called but I am often shocked/excited when I am reading literature from another discipline and find theories trying to answer the same exact question as stuff I'm more familiar with in my home discipline. I get that it's all different because every discipline has its own unique assumptions, etc, but is there a field where people in different disciplines don't aim at expanding on literature in their own discipline, but rather with other disciplines trying to answer the same question?\n\nIf there is, where should I look for it? (My guess would be meta-science journals but I haven't had any luck) If there isn't, is there some fundamental reason why this kind of research can't be done that I am missing?\n\nThanks all!",

But you can sure learn alot about population Dynamics of civilizations by studying cell culture.\n\nIt's also eerily good at modelings colony growth and destruction in a way very similar to what we see happen in large cities and societies.\n\nIt also provides insight into how to cure problems with under and over population, stagnant growth, etc. \n\nFinally, it does a good job at describing how society will all end. All of this in a culture that is allowed to grow for only a few weeks. \n\nIs this what you mean?",

Some new areas of research have been carved up this way. If your question is not so big, u can try to find literature in regular journals pertaining to either field. I would think everyone would publish interdisciplinary work. I'm not familiar with the expression \"lateral research\".",
