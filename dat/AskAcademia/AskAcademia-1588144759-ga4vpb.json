I still think a lot of it is about a lack of understanding of careers too. Some necessary job skills can be learned in a variety of subjects, and so field of study doesn't line up perfectly with a career. I've found the \"career world\" to be surprisingly flexible. I've gotten two careers with either 0 or near 0 experience, and even I (the physics and math major) would not have guessed I had a chance. Teaching at the high school level, and IT.\n\n>What surprises me most is how you won't get people who make the most basic assumptions that even sound like math or physics would be useful in, such as nuclear power plants, space agencies, or something similar.\n\nHaha!

First - from non-physics people \"oh, what exactly is that?\"  Second, from physics people \"oh, so you couldn't cut it as a *real* physicist?\" Either way, I shake my head and get back to work studying graduate school admissions and retention practices in physics. Trying to do my part to make sure that the process is more equitable for all and that once you go to grad school the culture isn't toxic. (which is not to say it won't be stressful, it most certainly will, but there is a big difference between the pressure of having to write a dissertation and having your advisor tell you that \"the only reason you got into this program is b/c you checked some diversity tick-box\"  <---actual quote from a TT professor about their student, to me, in an interview, for my research).",

Based on what I know, it's an interesting concept that may be utilized specifically for stationary batteries (e.g. keeping energy from solar cells in households), and there is a lot of ways to approach the problem (I mean, at the very least the are [so many possible combinations of metals](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/cr300205k), so there are many points to start the research). \n\nIn the lab where I'm doing my PhD research, the focus is primarily on conducting polymers and the ways they can enhance the performance of various devices, from batteries to fuel cells, to catalysts, etc. We mostly work with \"standard\" batteries with solid electrodes and liquid electrolyte, but judging by the literature the popular area now is solid-state batteries.",

I teach that too). It\u2019s that Ochem is (usually) taken as a first semester sophomore, so students aren\u2019t all that good at studenting yet. They\u2019re smart people. They\u2019re also young in college-years and have to that point likely relied on their HS \u201cI don\u2019t need to study or read ever\u201d study skills to get through everything and Ochem just doesn\u2019t work that way. So either students learn to study and do well... or they don\u2019t. \n\nIt\u2019s also got a bad stigma because a bunch of the not-super-motivated \u201cI\u2019d rather be an art major but my mom says I have to be a doctor\u201d types don\u2019t do well and then tell everyone else it was harder than it is to excuse their bad grades. \n\nSophomore year is also when a lot of the more motivated people also realize they don\u2019t want to complete the pre-health major they start out in, so Ochem usually takes the fall as the reason they don\u2019t follow their original dreams.\n\nIt\u2019s also more like learning a language when people expect formulas and math and shit. I draw fancy hexagons and talk logic in a foreign language with arrows and letters and funky notations... so generally it\u2019s people who are good at patterns who do well at Ochem.",

Because it involves medicine a bit, it always stumps people. Some love to hear NLP stuff. The rest doesn't really get any reaction from anyone. But the above algorithm almost never fails to get a good honest \"wow!\" out of people.\n\nI'm doing an MA in linguistics and want to focus especially on non-TGG approaches to grammar. IDK if I'll be able to do my thesis on that to. I have other interests too, gotta read a lot and sloowwly make some decisions...\n\nEdit: I did my BA in Italian (i.e. Italianistics, but we always just said Italian), and I've had one guy ask me \"What's that?\".

Neurolinguistics and psycholinguistics uses some invasive methods to study brain as speech occurs, also neurolinguistics studies interactions of brain damage and language. Phonetics is somewhat involved with speech anatomy (from larynx up to the nasal cavity, it's really fun stuff and if you dive into that). All these kinda feed into speech pathology, but rather than a subdiscipline of linguistics, it's a therapeutical discipline (or something, IDK the exact terminology there) that uses findings of linguists. But it always has the biggest wow factor out of anything else. You get like 10 times the respect and admiration.\n\nTrills are not that hard, unless you're [ankyloglottic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankyloglossia). I'm mildly so, but even then I manage most of the trills. Try the \"drrrr\" excercises: say \"drrrrrah\", \"drrrrrrah\" repeatedly, try to hold it as long as possible. If you're learning a language, try saying drr insread of the trill. The d has the tip of your tongue placed nicely on the alveolar ridge, and when you push some strong air into that the trill happens automatically. Then all you need to learn is to control it and not do it too intensely.",

It is a lot like learning a new chord on the guitar \u2013 you then have to practice the changes from and into other positions, and incorporate it into a song.",
