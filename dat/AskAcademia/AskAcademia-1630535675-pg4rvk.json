  "text": "Hi I just got a grade C for on of the courses I took this summer. As a grad student will this look bad on my PHD applications. My older grades aren't that great either. I was wondering if it's possible to still try applying for a phd. My prof encourages me to withdraw form this course but I dont know if I should because I need the credits to get my masters which technically ends in the summer. If I do end up withdrawing I don't know if the program will let me retaking another 3 credit course this fall.",

      "text": "Research often trumps grades. How's your research experience? Your best bet is probably a program that directly admits you to work with an advisor. They then have a lot of control of admissions and you can convince them before you apply why you are good. I don't care much about grades but I want to know that I don't have to worry about my student going on probation (needs a 3.0), there is some material I need them to have mastery of (and grades don't always show mastery), and grades can be a reflection of work ethic.",

      "text": "I'm not sure the other commenters here have picked up that you're talking about a class in your MS. Research generally trumps grades, but if you got a C in a grad-level class that'll will be a major red flag for another grad program. In grad classes people generally get only As and Bs, so if you get a C you were clearly behind your peers. \n\nFind out the answer to your question, if the program will let you retake another 3-credit course this fall. Knowing all your options will help you decide what to do.",

      "text": "In the humanities, a C in grad work (yes, in an MA program) will often not even count toward the degree. \n\nIf you are applying to PhD programs, you do NOT want a C on your master's transcript, so if I were you I'd drop that class like a hot potato.  \n\nBut I have no idea about the sciences and social sciences.",
