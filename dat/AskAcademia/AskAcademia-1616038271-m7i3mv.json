  "title:": "Friend outsourced her thesis portfolio for MFA. Should I keep quiet?",
  "text": "I consider myself to be a pretty ethical person, but I'm not really sure what to do here, or the proper course of action. Hopefully you folks can help guide me a bit.\n\nA friend of mine is graduating in May from her Creative Writing program, an MFA. She recently bragged, in private, about paying other people to write for her ever since she was an undergrad (at the same school she's getting her MFA now). This behavior even extends to the portfolio for her thesis project. \n\nShe said no one knows besides the people that wrote for her, and the whole vibe was very much like she'd found a lifehack that she couldn't believe everyone didn't do.\n\nAny other time, I would probably steer clear of the whole mess, especially if it were a one time thing. Who knows what people are going through, you know? But since she's done it for so much of her academic career, it's been weighing on me.\n\nDo I report this? Is there even a mechanism for doing so?  I think part of what I'm wrestling with is since she doesn't seem to have told anyone else, she'd probably know it's me if I speak up. It could blow up about a quarter of my social circle. But since I have no proof myself, no smoking gun, is there even any point in putting myself out there in the line of fire for this one? \n\nWhat would you guys do? \u2639\ufe0f\n\nUPDATE: After considering the discussion and weighing my options, I reported. I was very upfront about having no proof beyond my own account. They now want to talk to me 1 on 1 and have a meeting to go over everything. I didn't want to get even further involved after the initial report, but that looks like it will be a challenge. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nUPDATE 2: They wanted as many details as I could give them, which wasn't a lot. I ended up delivering them via video conference, which was pretty awkward. As far as I'm aware, my identity was preserved, and nothing was done. Her thesis/book was printed, and I got a copy of it. It has so many basic spelling and grammar errors not only in the text but on the back cover as well. I guess I know what an MFA at [REDACTED for privacy] is worth \ud83d\ude35",

But...\n\nI cannot agree much with the rest. I too have ADHD and a biochemistry degree (I know at least a couple more). I don't \"shit\" on others about it. It's tough, class feels meaningless, and self-teaching has been the only way for me.\n\nI also think that reporting is a personal choice. Everyone is living through their own filtered lens. People should live as they so choose, as you seem to do.  \n\nIt's easy to apply your own philosophy to everyone, as I guess you feel that neurotypicals do to us. But I don't think the solution is to say \"fuck you all\" and go rogue. Do you expect to be heard like this? Do you think this will lead to change? --side note: it may, if you organize a successful large-scale protest at a small institution\n\nI think many would agree with some of your sentiments. And I think change is happening in real-time as we speak. But I have found that it only happens by us having direct conversations with those in positions of power. I think with COVID especially, I've been giving my graduate school directors a lot of feedback on what works and what doesn't, as well as how to make school for inclusive for neurodivergent or culturally-divergent people. \n\nI can feel your struggle, and I wish you well.",

                                  "text": "I think this discussion has gone way off track from the OP's situation, so I'm just going to add in my personal experience here. \n\nI also have ADHD. I never graduated high school (or got a GED), and nearly failed out of 3 community colleges and my undergrad institution due to my undiagnosed adhd symptoms. Once I got treatment the academic stuff became almost manageable. At the same time I met a professor who was just starting up a lab and needed some undergrads for the summer. \n\nIt's now 4 years later and I'm currently 2 years into a chemistry PhD program (I have my 2nd year exam in 12 hours lol). I graduated with my bachelor's after 6 years (11 if you count the community colleges), and finally cracked a 3.0 in my final semester. I suck at taking classes, but I'm really good at research; I had 2 first author publications in *J. Phys. Chem.* as an undergrad. I also managed to pick up the NSF GRFP fellowship. \n\nAlong the way I had several people, including my first therapist, who told me I should drop out and find a career that suits me better because obviously college was not for me. I am really glad that I did not listen to those people. Those comments were some of the most demoralizing messages I could have received. I knew that my understanding of the material was not the problem, I just couldn't demonstrate that understanding in a way that got me good grades. I was severely depressed, and I was constantly telling myself that I want good enough and I should just quit. Actually hearing that from other people just compounded that negativity, and I replayed those comments in my mind countless times. \n\nI'm starting to get off track here, so I'll circle back to my main point. \n\nColleges are not built to accommodate neurodiverse people. They fail us out of inflexibility, not because we don't understand what we are learning. I don't condone cheating, but once I got diagnosed and started seeing that I was pretty successful in the lab, I quickly recognized that college was more about jumping through the correct hoops than actually learning. \n\nAgain, I am not commenting on the cheating described in the OP. That is clearly wrong. That said, those of us who can't study and memorize information like 'normal' people have to find alternatives. \n\nFor example, my second year exam includes a proposal presentation. I passed the written component with flying colors, but I generally struggle to remember information until I get some external promoting. Knowing that, I designed my slides so that they would elicit lots of questions from my committee. Unfortunately most undergrad programs don't offer the flexibility to take a non-standard approach like this for most graded assignments. \n\nAs a general rule I assume I'll lose 10% of the points on an exam due to the ADHD tax. That's on a good day. On a bad day that tax can skyrocket. \n\nI have a collection of spreadsheets that I've made for common calculations because I fuck up simple math quite easily. Does that mean I don't understand stoichiometry? No, it just means that I transpose numbers and lose decimals very easily. That is essentially not a problem in the lab because I have access to my computer, but on an exam I'm fucked. \n\nI'm just trying to point out that a person's success and grades in college does not necessarily have any bearing on how successful they will be in their career. Hell, my tendency to hyperfocus and leap down rabbit holes can be helpful because I end up exposed to information that I otherwise would not have come across.",

However, in the grand scheme of things, the MFA in CW is not all that helpful if you\u2019re trying to teach English or CW and you don\u2019t have a book pubbed. I say this as someone who has an MFA in CW and who is currently a TA in an MA program bc my MFA was not enough to get hired as an adjunct even at a community college. \n\nYes, you do generally need the MFA to teach, but you ALSO need a book pubbed.",

Plagiarism is a huge, glaring violation in academia, but if you're not part of academia yourself I find it questionable whether academics have the right to *demand* that *you* adhere to academic ethics. Perhaps there are in fact actual general laws that might apply to you in your country, I dunno, and perhaps your personal conscience does end up telling you to report your friend, but be aware you're not going to get what you might consider a balanced response here.",

Contract cheating is a huge thing, it's been growing over the last 10 years and every uni is (or should be) aware of it and how to identify it. \n\nThe academic integrity advisor I worked alongside would work with a small group of people to assess each complaint and was trained to read through work and pick up inconsistencies and evidence of potential cheating.

However, the way I see it (as a student and instructor and also a writer myself), as of right now, the friend is only hurting herself with her cheating. \n\nThere are two ways to (potentially) prevent the friend from affecting others down the road: confront her or turn her in. Turning her in would lead to significant consequences for both parties, as the poster above has outlined. Confronting her allows her an opportunity to change, which we could all probably use at some point in our lives. It\u2019s a more empathetic approach and still gets the job done (if the friend is not receptive, well then, that\u2019s a different issue altogether). \n\nI\u2019m not suggesting helping her hide a body.

You could theoretically do it anonymously by leaving a typed note under their door or faculty mailbox. Be honest in that you have no proof and you don\u2019t want to ruin her life, but you would be remiss if you did not speak up about what this person is claiming behind closed doors. The person who said there may be other red flags is right - even if you don\u2019t have the proof, this starts the inquiry. She could be just really awkward and said that to sound...I dunno...imposter syndromy? But it sounds like it\u2019s legit. \n\nIf you want a frame of reference for my advice: I teach an intensive high school STEM program that preps students to go into labs their first year of college.

No one wanted to be near him, professionally, relationship-wise, or any other way. \n\n*Sometimes you gotta let them bury themselves.*\n\nOn the other hand what she is doing is not a degree. People who have degrees are because they earned them. So....if she is mad at you reporting because of HER wrongdoing then that is HER problem. She isn't outsmarting herself by taking unethical shortcuts, she is dumbing herself down excusing herself from hardwork and it will also impact whoever she ends up working with. Whether it be fellow colleagues or students, someone is going to take the brunt of her shitty work ethic.

My University once got an anonymous letter detailing all of the moral failings of a new adjunct a month before he started working. I was asked to talk to the guy \u201clightly\u201d, but the anonymity of the letter and the fact it was sent before he started working led to the question who could have sent it. Since the person who did  knew he was going to start this new job, it had to be some one in his inner circle, possibly with a personal reason to fuck up his career. \n\nIf you knew who her main advisor was, I would probably try to contact that person directly. And if I didn\u2019t know, I probably would not try to become a detective to find out. Anonymity and email make it easy to throw out baseless charges. \n\nWhatever you do, a true friend would never put you in this moral quandary.

You have made a mountain out of a mole hill. This is far different than social justice that is way more complex with much more layered feedback mechanisms that are harder to control. Don't conflate the two. This is a clear cut case of academic dishonesty - right and wrong. These types of situations are pretty straightforward. She knew the consequences which were laid out bare. They are not ones that are argued by anybody. People fight hard to get what was handed to her - I would argue this kicks out the teeth of those who worked and suffered to get to where they are. She won't go poor, she just won't get the degree she doesn't deserve. How is that unfair? Her life will be shitter for a while, but things could be far worse.",

I assumed it was just the masters when I wrote that. But all the same, she should have thought of that. \n\nAs a Professor, I see this shit more often than I should. It has farther repercussions than you clearly realize. When you put kids out into the work force, or worse, academics, and they can't do what is expected, it reflects poorly on the department and the advisor. If my students were hired by a consulting firm and couldn't do their job, I would develop a reputation. And as someone who would also receive funding from some of the same places my students may get hired, that could be negatively impacted too. This is a cycle that affects more than just one person. \n\nClearly you are not within the higher Ed game and don't understand the pervasiveness or severity of this type of situation. Again, this is bigger than them. I'm happy you want to be the empathetic soldier; to be honest I'm incredibly liberal (see my post history) and would probably agree with you on a lot of issues. But not this. This is a serious, all too common problem which is why academic departments take it so seriously. It has serious back consequences that can haunt departments, advisors and even institutions.",

I feel resentful about this knowing how much I am struggling, and also how degrees are being cheapened by this. \n\nI've been a TA and seen how hard students work with very poor writing skills to get through their classes. These students don't have the money to do this and/or have too much integrity. This kind of behavior comes at the expense of these students because who is getting awards/scholarships, good job offers, letters of rec, etc? The people with good grades. \n\nI know that on an interpersonal level this is hard - if you have a therapist I suggest talking with them about this. \n\nHowever if you really decide that this is super unethical and want her to be held accountable, you could look for proof before reporting her - say that your sister (or whoever) needs help with a paper in college and ask if she can recommend a service/person she used. Depending on the laws about recording people without their knowledge in your state, you could even try to record her secretly (do look into these laws though). Either way it gives more information you could provide to the school. \n\nI agree with others that talking with her will probably not result in her wanting to turn herself in. If you were feeling really brave and confident in your position, you could cut ties with her and tell her directly that this is why. Not even in an angry way, just being clear about your values. \n\nOn another note if you are really concerned about her knowing it was you, you could also try bringing up her cheating in front of other friends. Just do it casually, as if it's not a big deal. That would give you the opportunity to both see how your other friends react, and give plausible deniability about who turned her in. Though it does kind of risk making it look like it was someone else who did it - but who knows, they could agree with the action of reporting her.",

If you actually care about her growth as a person or about your friendship, and if this weighs so heavily on your conscience that you have to do something, then talk with her about it. If she doesn't respond well or this so disgusts you that you no longer want to be her friend, then stop being her friend. But do not involve yourself in her degree/the thousands and thousands of dollars she or her family have spent on her education. You have no right to interfere in her relationship with the school.

Heck, my response would be very different if this wasn't your friend but rather some random student in your class, but you're basically facing two different ethical dilemmas and I'm telling you friendship should take precedence. Controversial I know, I'm just an undergrad student but hear me out, most of the other people on here are grad students and professors that have been brainwashed into a completely different set of ethics than what the rest of the world operates on because academia selectively promotes people that abide by them.\n\nYour thought process is basically coming down to academic integrity vs friendship integrity. Friendship integrity is more real and lasts for life whereas the latter disappears once you graduate into the real world.\n\nFirst I'd like to dispel the notion of academic \"integrity\" you've been brainwashed into losing sleep over. I get that cheating and plagiarism are against the rules, but think about who makes those rules for a second... Academia, which is an archaic institution that gouges whole generations on loans just so they can get credentials for a job that actually pays enough to put food on the table, supposing they weren't sold on something worthless like \"gender studies\" or \"Medieval philosophy'. \n\nAcademia operates on a completely different ruleset than the working world. The reason cheaters look at it as a joke is because it is, it an absolute joke that these massive for profit institutioms actually dare to moralize why students using every tool at their disposal to regurgitate useless class material, ethical or not, is out of turn when they've spent decades lobbying government to effectively game capitalism and turn students into debt slaves.\n\nLet me make this abundantly clear, all cheating does is cheat the person doing it out of whatever knowledge they decided to forego. It doesn't effect you, it doesn't effect the value of the degree, and it doesn't effect the school's reputation. Those are all myths you've been told on the supposition that people look past your qualifications and resume in a job interview. They don't. Penn state has had foot ball players found guilty of rape and sexual assault, yet their reputation as a university is just fine.\n\nNow let's touch on friendship integrity. You yourself have admitted that you would lose a good portion of your social circle by snitching on them. Why is that? Either you have some really dubious characters in your circle, at which point you lose nothing, or there is something innately wrong in coming forward enough to warrant that kind of collective condemnation. Basically, you gotta ask yourself if the problem is with them or you, most often it's the latter but we all have our own moral principles. On some level though, you know you'd be stabbing this person in the back, and I think that's more dubious than any level of academic dishonesty you could commit. This is information you've been privy to as their friend, and friendship warrants a certain amount of confidentiality.\n\nNow, I'm going to get downvoted to hell and back for this post, but that's because my perspective comes from a very different world than most academics on this sub, and I suspect you fall somewhere in the middle otherwise you wouldn't need reddit's help on this. But take it from me, if she gets caught, let it happen on her own merit instead of trying to meddle. She'll learn whatever lesson there is and you won't burn any bridges in doing so.",

I can literally pull up 50 different solutions off codeacademy then make my own original solution based on those after seeing how a general solution needs to work, and no honor court would be able to prove otherwise short of bugging my apartment.\n\nOh, you want me to take a test on my computer at home for a zoom class? What's that, you aren't going to make me use lockdown browser or have my webcam up? I guess I'll just use google to my heart's content then. God know's most other students without a virtue complex will.\n\nI have no qualms about cutting corners when the school has no way to catch it or no way to enforce their policy on it, because grades are more important than learning clearly. At the end of the day, I feel no guilt because I'll be able to take my degree and land a cushy software engineering job at 70-90k a year, of which I am doing more than enough work to prep myself for outside the classroom by pursuing internships and learning the actual tools of the trade instead of some intro to data science class that isn't even up to date on its curriculum.\n\nWhy do I rationalize this? Simple, nobody stops you from looking stuff up in the work place or referencing preexisting solutions because most jobs are about \"running the laps\" instead of actually doing anything innovative. As long as you follow industry guidelines and ethical standards, which are very different from the academic world's, you're golden.\n\nSo bite me.",

      "text": "Can I ask: is it possible your friend is exaggerating a bit about the number of papers they actually bought? Lots of students buy/have someone else write their papers - I'm TT prof and I'm not that mad about it as long as it is original work and it's only once or twice in a student's career. If this is true, she would have had to had the same person writing for her in the same classes, because it is really easy to tell when someone turns in a paper in a tone they've never used before. And if its a smaller program where she had a prof more than once? Again, I'm a sociology prof and if its obvi to me, pretty sure a CW prof would notice...\nIs it possible your friend is testing you to see if you will tell? Because if you report and the evidence isn't there, you could look bad. \nFrom a prof pov... if the faculty and CW program didn't notice or think she was a problem, there's a problem with the program so her degree isn't going to be worth much anyway. \nBUT. Most schools have an anonymous form where you can report plagiarism, maybe look for that? \nGood luck.",
