  "text": "What have people been doing to celebrate successful thesis defenses on zoom?  In real life, we have a party, usually I meet a student\u2019s family, etc. I have really tried to make this day special for my students in the past.  I am not sure how to make sure my student graduating now feels the same way. Mostly what I can come up with is something alternative, like maybe finding an artist to make something that we gift or 3D print something (we are engineers). I would love creative suggestions though!",
