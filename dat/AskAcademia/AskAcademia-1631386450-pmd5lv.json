  "title:": "Achieving a PhD and a BSc at the same university (UK).",
  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI have just graduated from my BSc in Physics and a few months ago I was offered a fully-funded PhD which was joint-funded by the University and the Met Office.  I want to become an atmospheric physicist and the opportunity to work with world-leading experts in both the University and the Met Office is incredibly exciting.  The project itself is something I would love to devote the next 4 years of my life to. However, I have only recently come across the idea of \"academic inbreeding\" (for lack of a better term), the idea being that if you stay to study for a postgraduate degree at the university you studied for your undergraduate degree, you are hurting your chances of an academic career.\n\nIs studying at the same institution for both a BSc and a PhD a poor choice in the UK?  Or would the ability to work with experts in both the University and the Met Office outweigh this problem?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.",

      "text": "Congratulations!\n\nI will pre-face this by saying my PhD is not in Physics. It's a great idea to work with different people and experience different institutions. However, there are lots of very good reasons why you might do multiple degrees in the same institution with funding being one of the most pragmatic! You may also already be in a world-leading department for your research area, have a relationship with a great supervisor or have other ties to a geographical area. There are other ways to broaden your experience through study visits, secondments, project collaborations etc. The fact that this PhD is jointly funded by the MoD presumably means you'd get time to work with government groups as well.\n\nI did my BSc at a post-92 University and when I was finishing my thesis was offered a fully funded MSc and PhD at the same institution. The topic was something I wanted to do and the opportunity was too good to pass up. I went straight into a post-doc at a Russel group uni. Then I was offered a lectureship at the same institution that I did my post-doc at. It means my direct experience of different universities is a little limited but I make sure to seek out external collaborations, mentorship and visits as well as sitting on committees which provide me with a broad perspective. \n\nIt becomes harder to move around as you get older, more established and settle down in your personal life. If you  *want* to travel around, then now might be the time to do it. However, I always advise that you *must* be interested in the PhD topic as there will be many times when you hit a wall but you have to persevere regardless. So if this is something you really want to do and it's a good opportunity then don't turn it down *just* because it's at the same institution as your undergraduate degree.",

I am hoping to network in both organisations too and take advantage of having access to many great scientists.  \n\nI'm very nervous to start but I'm hoping that my PhD journey will be a rewarding one.",

      "text": "Hey! I want to say I don\u2019t have a PhD (I\u2019m working towards it!) but a close friend does. She benefitted from staying at the same uni because it had a heavily funded department in her chosen specialty and she even got access to some world-renowned professors as her mentors. \n\nIt really depends on what you want to do, what you aim to study, what the uni is best funded for, and how the department your PhD will be taken in is rated. \n\nI honestly had never heard of this idea that you are disadvantaged by remaining at the same uni for both degrees. In my friendship groups\u2019 experience, unis have preferred alumni for PhDs especially if the student has a preexisting relationship with key department members (I.e from a masters degree taken there). \n\nUp to you though!",

      "text": "It's a common trope that's wheeled out but personally I think it's nonsense. Following arbitrary rules for success isn't the way. No one is ever going to look at your research record and say excellent publication record, strong research network, exciting area of work, oh but stayed at the same university for their PhD bin them. \n\nThis PhD sounds like it's exactly what you want to do in your career, and it's in a place where you must feel you can thrive. Why jack that in for geography?\n\nI think the idea really stems from people looking at successful people and trying to find tangible markers of success and lots of academics move about a lot but correlation doesn't equal causation.",

      "text": "I have quite a few friends who did their undergrads and then doctorates at the same university from STEM disciplines (UK). In fact, due to the increased competiveness for doctorate funding, it is becoming the de facto only way if you want to skip the masters. All of them found employment either in academia or industry without any extra hustle. \n\nSome who stayed in academia even managed to stay at the same university in teaching fellowships with permanent employment. The thing is that these people know the courses offered by the department from a student's perspective. This additional knowledge helped them be better TAs, score better in student evaluations, and be entrusted with more duties than the average PhD student. Knowing most of the faculty prior to starting your PhD helps too.\n\nIn your case, I do not see a problem at all. Working with the Met is a great experience \u2014I always enjoyed hearing talks by their scientists. If you worry too much, you can see if you can do a more 'official' internship in the Met Office so you can add that to your CV as work experience under a different affiliation than your university.\n\nNow, if you decide to stay there after your PhD in a postdoc, then things might be bad \u2014but they are still salvageable. I was at a hiring committee a few months ago in my new institution in Sweden. One of the candidates did all their education at a single institution and stayed thereafter. While we indeed pressed the candidate about it, it was not considered as a major disadvantage as the internet will make it sound to be. In fact, considering the candidate's honesty about the matter and by their answer (pointing out participation in international conferences and willingness to seak a visiting position elsewhere during the postdoc), I would say that it was not a factor against them \u2014they even got the position at the end!\n\nI would say that the fear for 'academic incest' (as I have heard someone else called this) is mostly an American problem. Do not forget, their PhDs are longer and the admission process very different. In the UK\u2014and Europe at large\u2014I would say there is an understanding of the funding situation.",
