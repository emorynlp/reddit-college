Since the clearence is all you really need nowadays in the intelligence realm and noone is sponsoring for one (of course unless you know someone) I got into anti money laundering for a bank, then shifted back towards a more quantitative analysis role with another company .. all in hopes to build a better record for getting someone to sponsor me for a clearance and THEN begin an entry level role. \n\nIt took my 2 years to figure that out. A year before graduation looking for jobs, post internship, then all of 2020. COVID has essentially screwed the politics market as it has with defense and intelligence.",
