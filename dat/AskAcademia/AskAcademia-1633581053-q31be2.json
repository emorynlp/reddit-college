  "title:": "basic CV template for MA-level humanities scholar wanting to applying for PhD?",
  "text": "The templates that I see for academics in the Humanities online are for later-career scholars. This means they have monographs, edited collections, hosted conferences etc that, as a MA student, I don't have. But I do have extracurricular associations (lol), student assistant and copy editing jobs, and other experiences that I'm not sure how to include in an academic CV. Does anyone have tips, or wouldn't mind privately sharing their own to me? Would so appreciate it! I am applying to PhDs soon and this guidance would help me out immensely.",

      "text": "Education, Academic Positions (TA/RA experience, assistantships, editing/tutoring), Research Interests, Conference Presentations, Working Papers (papers you have fully drafted), Service (volunteer work that serves the university or discipline), Professional Training & Co-Curriculars (reading groups, study abroad, summer methods programs, participation in formal mentoring programs, other outside of class professionalization experience, language immersion), Other Work & Volunteer Experience (non-academic jobs & community service), Languages (which languages & at what level of competency). Really, just create the categories that make sense given your experience and achievements, and then get a prof to check it over to make sure the headings you came up with sound reasonable to an academic ear.\n\nThe Conference Papers section is a big one at the MA level - even a grad student conference can help. Also, if you have any opportunities to help organize a grad student conference, that's a version of \"hosting conferences\" that's accessible at the MA level.",
