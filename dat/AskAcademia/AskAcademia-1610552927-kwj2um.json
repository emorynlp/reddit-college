  "title:": "How do I bring up the fact that my PhD supervisor died and that's why I don't have him as a reference (and some more CV questions)",
  "text": "Hello all,\n\nMy phd supervisor unfortunately passed away this fall so alas, I cannot list him in my references.  \nI'm afraid that not including my main supervisor as a reference might raise some eyebrows.. what if that's enough to stop my application from reaching the point of contacting the other references (who will surely explain the situation)?          \n          \nShould I include a tiny note in the references section of my CV or would that be too tacky/weird ?\n\nBesides this unpleasant issue, I'd also love to read some opinions on the following CV doubts\n\n#####Professional Appointments/Employment\n\nIs this really necessary? I have just finished my phd so this would just be my initial grant and then 3 consecutive contracts in the same lab while finishing my phd. Because of that I don't think it adds much value to my profile, does it?\n\n#####Research experience\n\nSimilarly, i think this will just re-iterate what I did for my phd, I'm not sure I fully appreciate what I'm supposed to highlight in this section Is this where I showcase the things I can do as a researcher?\n\n\n#####Key competencies\n\nI think it's a good idea to have a brief section where you can highlight these but it doesn't seem to be a thing in academic context\nAs my CV stands right now, I have 4 subsections in there: Bioinformatics, Data Science, Informatics, Biology\nwhere I highlight my competences that are most relevant to each section. For example the \"Data science\" parts reads as follows:\n\n>Data Science: Experienced in applying and developing statistical analyses and machine learning tech-niques for biological questions. Enjoys handling big amounts of data and takes pride indeveloping and optimizing fast performing computational pipelines. Very comfortable with the Python data science stack of libraries (jupyter, pandas, numpy, sci-kit, sci-py, seaborn,TensorFlow)\n\nShould all this just go in the cover letter instead ? Or in the research experience somehow ?\n\n\n#####Repositories\n\nAs a bioinformatician, I've created some repositories for which I'm quite proud and I'd like to showcase them. This again doesn't seem to be a thing in academia, what do you think?",

The only reason I left it out of my suggestion (and maybe this is also the idea of the dagger suggestion) is that I felt that one wants to draw as little attention to the point to get it across. \"Deceased\" is a natural word, but nonetheless jarring on a CV. If the reader is carelessly scanning through, the applicant would rather they develop the impression from the actual qualifications. However, it sounds like you have real experience on this point, and I don't! Best wishes.",

At least note what is included there and map your experience roughly onto that template.",

In either case, I agree you shouldn't have it on there twice, and regardless you should definitely also put these things in your cover letter but much more customized to the specific requirements of the job you're appying for.",
