  "title:": "Do you consider an MA in TESOL to be a terminal masters?",
  "text": "There seems to be debate within academia as to what exactly constitutes a terminal masters. Some will argue that an MA degree in the Teaching of Speakers of Other Languages is a professional degree just like an MFA. While there is no PhD specific for ESL teaching (or not that I am aware of), a degree holder can still apply for a doctorate in Linguistic, Education, or related field. The same can be said about an MFA holder in Creative Writing pursuing a PhD in Rhetoric & Composition, Linguistics, and another concentration under the Department of English banner. Just like an MFA holder can hold a tenured track position at a 4 year institution, so can an MA TESOL within the Department of English Language studies, often referred to as Intensive English programs.\n\nSo what are your opinions on the notion of a terminal master's like the MA TESOL?",

      "text": "You should think about why distinguish between a terminal and non-terminal master's degree. Personally I distinguish them based on how applied vs theory focused they are. If they are theory focused a PhD naturally follows as an extension but if they are applied focused a PhD wouldn't naturally follow as an extension. Now this doesn't mean you can't craft a PhD topic to follow an applied degree but it isn't the norm. I will admit the line between applied and theory is grey and depending how you make the distinction will adjust if this definition works.\n\nSo is the Masters focused substantially on the theory behind the pedagogy? or is it more focused on the principles of the current pedagogy?\n\nBut you should think about why you are interested in this distinction as this will likely be more useful to you. A distinction without utility is useless.",

          "text": "I believe the utility in the distinction between a terminal and non-terminal masters is in whether the degree holder can procure a full-time faculty position without having to undergo a Ph.D.  Yes, there are many faculty members across the country within high ed. English language institutes that hold only a master's degree. Again, we are talking strictly about English classes offered to second language learners on a university campus, and not courses under the Department of English and Literature.  From my own personal experience, full-time tenure track positions in post-secondary ESL are few and far between.",

The only ones I can think of that meets this requirement is an MBA and an MFA.  If you include lectures, almost all lecture positions only need a Masters.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>From my own personal experience, full-time tenure track positions in post-secondary ESL are few and far between.\n\nThis is true whenever you look for positions in such a specific sub-section of a field.",

Where I earned my degree, they didn't offer a PhD in TESOL, but they did offer PhDs in Linguistics and Education to which research could be focused on Second Language studies.  \n\nThere were many teachers in the ESL department with just master's degrees. But I guess you would classify them as lecturers/instructors and not professors. There were also a few Ed.Ds as well.  The few professors who didn't have PhDs had been employed since the 90s, if that's a telling sign.\n\nCouldn't we argue the same about the MFA holding less weight as a terminal degree as maybe decades prior since there are many PhD programs widely available in related areas such as Creative Writing and Performing Arts?",
