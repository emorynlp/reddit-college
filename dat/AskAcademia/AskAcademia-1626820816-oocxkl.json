  "text": "I'm a STEM PhD shifting out of academia after a number of postdocs.\n\nAlong with it being a good opportunity, I'm hoping a change of industry will also change up a few things I struggle with postdocing:\n\n\\- Looong timelines & no regular acheivements\n\n\\- anxiety about not doing enough, which makes me less productive, which compounds things\n\n\\- imposter syndrome (it's bad, and actually I believe truly warranted, which is classic imposter syndrome ha)\n\nI have achieved a fair bit, published reasonably, enjoy my lab group, but I'm not top of the game by any means.\n\nThose who have moved out of academia or have experience outside, did a change of environment make a difference to these kind of things for you (e.g. more team focused, shorter timeframes,less need for great ideas),  or am I just an anxious person with low self esteem and will take that along with me?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nEDIT thanks everyone! Great to hear your experiences, and confirms what I'm expecting. I think those of us who feel badly impacted by imposter syndrome and the like should all be prioritising some form of work on that through therapy/ mediation. Good luck out there!",

Here is what I do not miss: \n\n- Bad work life balance. \n- Always feeling like I cannot take vacations longer than 48 hours because of my model organisms. (And my boss. She never took vacations so we never felt like we could.)\n- Feeling like I have to reinvent the wheel constantly. \n\nWhat struggles have I taken with me? \n\n- Imposter syndrome. Guess that is a forever problem. \n- Managers that have no training in management. It isn\u2019t just a PI problem. \n\nCareers are complicated. I am not sure I could not have succeeded in academia. But I am happier outside of it.",

How in heck did you get a teaching job coming from industry without a postdoc, which I see as a requirement on most R1/2 faculty jobs I see lately? I would feel better about trying out industry if I knew I had some chance of getting back to academia (which I do enjoy, but maybe I might like industry better?). \n\nThanks!",

I am now in education at the HS level, which is a totally different beast, but for college level jobs, especially tenure track ones, there are absolutely not enough jobs to go around and anyone who leaves academia should accept the possibility that they are not going to be welcomed back. \n\nOn a separate note, consulting is not for everyone. People I know either love it or burn out in less than 5 years. Kudos to you for sticking it out.",

I honestly love this... projects here might take a few years (1-3 years), but people here work in decent sized groups (think 10-20 at a time) rather than just 2 or 3 of us at a time. I now have a much wider work circle, which I like.  There are also more veterans than just your advisor.\n\n\\- anxiety: I have a certain amount of it right now since my transition was a theoretical field to a very applied one,  but at least people here are pretty helpful and expect there to be an acclamation period.  Some places are rather fast paced,  but mine involves a good bit of red tape (which might be annoying to some, but it allows me to learn to be extra careful).  New ideas are welcome, but since we are making stuff for the military, safety is extra important, so innovation is more restrained.  I'm actually ok with that given my own work-life balance.  \n\n\n\\- imposter syndrome: I feel like I overcame it midway through grad school when I realized how everyone has it, and just accepted my general ignorance.  I now just ask questions all the time of the senior engineers, and they emphasize us newbies being unafraid to ask questions as well.",

      "text": "I left academia after a post-doc five years ago. One of the best parts of working in industry is getting to work with people with completely different backgrounds and experiences. I have many colleagues with PhDs, but I also work with former nurses, marketing experts, engineers, and lawyers. I learn a new way of thinking every time I work with a different team. \n\nThe variety of work is great. And projects certainly change faster in industry. However, I was surprised at how projects even in industry can still take 4 or 5 years, but that will depend greatly on the place you go to work. Some industries have quick product development times. Others are slower than academia. \n\nThe thing I miss the most are the conferences. I still go to industry conferences and present work that I'm publishing, but it's just not the same. Especially because I switched fields. But, that really only impacts me a few times a year and it's a trade I'd make over and over again to not deal with the rampant sexism, to have better balance, more opportunities for professional variety and growth, and most importantly, being able to see the impact of my work.",

      "text": "I'm at a national lab functioning similar to a staff scientist in academia. I live off of soft money, write all my own proposals, am expected to publish, etc. I like it better than academia because I do have access to a decent amount of internal R&D money (which still requires winning proposals to access), but being mission driven helps me focus my research. At times it can feel frustrating, but I'm still given incredible latitude compared to people I know in industry. The hardest thing is money doesn't go nearly as far. For my own overhead I need to wrangle (or get wrangled into projects) of ~$350k/yr, and even our cheapest engineer is more expensive than a grad student. That said, I have access to world class experts with 30 years of experience on my teams, as well as being able to outsource to academia when we have a higher risk/more labor intensive R&D task.",

              "text": "Most scientists I know at national labs (my own as well as others) are pretty happy. Depending on your agency, you may or may not need to constantly chase soft money. It'll make a huge difference in your day to day life. Some places you act more as a contract/project manager for industry, while others you'll be doing lots of your own work. I have some coworkers who are members of a lab that acts like a service center, and they don't have to worry about proposals or fighting for funds. I'm part of a group where we all function as independent PIs putting in our own proposals, but we all are focused in materials & manufacturing technologies. Each has our own focus, and we also often serve as Co-Is or collaborators on projects.\n\nI work with a wide set of people around lab, mostly with thermal management (that's my focus), but also have collaborations with planetary protection, robotics, mission formulation, instruments, and a lot more. Being mission driven means I get exposed to some really interesting, deep problems I never would have known about otherwise.\n\nThe hardest thing is both a lack of tenure, so there isn't forever job security (though at least it's not promote or get fired), and I'm responsible for wrangling funding for my own salary. I'm PI for about 30% of my timecard, a Co-I for about half, and get hired in to other work on other projects for another 20%. It can be stressful when there's not enough work due to funding cuts (aka right now). That said, if I ever can't fill my timecard I could go do flight work...but I really don't want to do that.\n\nI'll say all of this is really dependent on where you work. There are feds at other centers who have solid job security and are guaranteed funding to do their research. There are also other places where their funding levels are 10x ours, so covering your timecard is easy. That said, I love what I do, and I believe in our mission. In the last decade or so I've probably averaged one paper (plenty more as a middle author) and one patent a year.\n\nMoney is better in industry, freedom is better in academia, but we get a really nice middle ground of both.",
