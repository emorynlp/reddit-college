  "text": "I am exploring some post-doc opportunities and want to explore the possibility of working fully remotely (possibly from outside the US). My work is purely computational so I don't need to be in lab.   \n\nWas wondering if PIs at top universities are even willing to consider such an arrangement post-covid and if it would be wise to bring this up in my post-doc interview? \n\nThanks",

For example my University won't allow remote work from outside the country on a standard contract. \n\nIt's a very competitive market so it's worth asking.\n\nEdit: typo",

The terms of my visa say that I can\u2019t stay outside the US for more than 5 months at a time so I can easily work remotely as long as I visit the US twice a year. I actually did work like this during the last year of my PhD and felt I was more productive than I would have been if I was physically in the US.",

Most universities are back to in-person, albeit with mask and vaccine mandates in many cases, and a postdoc who is working remotely would not be as engaged with the rest of the research group. I'm a computational mathematician, and unless you were willing to work for less money, or if you had some particularly unique skill set, why would any PI prefer to hire you over a person who was able to engage fully in the life of the research group?",

To be honest I would be willing to work for less money if needed but I dont know if that is even possible because post-docs seem to have a fixed payscale.\n\nIts just that I see a lot of industry jobs with the option of working remotely with higher pay than what a postdoc gets. Maybe academia is not as flexible yet.",

Several of my friends have also done them. I think it's an important tool to fill short grants where you couldn't recruit someone to move for a one-year job or whatever. But my state recently enacted some regulations that cracked down on people working remotely, and it inadvertently affected postdocs despite the need for remote postdocs. So it was a real fiasco to get me hired, way worse than a year ago. If you're considering living abroad I'd look into whether it's possible to maintain a home in the country where your employer is, to simplify taxes.",
