  "title:": "How to answer an \"Explain your research interests\" Question?",
  "text": "Hey guys! So I was recently filling out an application for a semester-long research experience at my university, and one of the questions asks for research areas of interest. I'm really interested in the total drug synthesis and asymmetric catalysis, but I don't really have research experience in the field. I've read a lot of papers and watched lectures on the subject, but I was wondering how to answer the question given I don't have experience in the field.",

          "text": "I took this advanced Ochem course over the summer, and one of my favorite parts was how they discussed asymmetric aldol reactions - I thought it was really cool how they could use things like chairs from Ochem to explain stereoselectivity -something that\u2019s really difficult to achieve. I\u2019ll spend hours googling how reaction mechanisms work sometimes, and I\u2019ve read through a few mechanistic and synthetic textbooks on my own - safe to say I like Ochem a fair bit",
