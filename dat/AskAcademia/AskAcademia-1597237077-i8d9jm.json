  "title:": "Academic Appeal - PhD removed without fair cause",
  "text": "Hi all!\nFurther to my post from a few weeks ago when I was initially removed from my PhD project. All your comments and advice were really helpful!\n\n\nOn 19/06 I was informed by my assessor and supervisor that they could not condone my transfer into 2nd year due to \"poor writing\" of my continuation report. No actual instances of poor writing were highlighted, my supervisor had actually read the report and said it was fine to submit, and no concerns of writing ability were raised at any point prior.\n\n\nAdditionally, a colleague and I had compared our reports and feedback comments. I was negatively marked/criticized for points he was praised for. We both used the same journals/figures as our introductions covered similar areas albeit different organs as endpoints. He was positively marked for good use of figures whereas I was told \u201cFigures are of poor quality\u201d. I was negatively marked for not using a GANTT chart in my planning, where it is not a formal requirement and he didn\u2019t use one either and it was never raised. \u201cThe future plans seem a bit general\u201d We were told to keep future planning broad as this is not a \u201cfinal paper\u201d, arguably I had shown potential and well thought out avenues for future works and exploration for the study though kept in mind the ability to expand or adapt depending on future results. I was negatively marked for this whereas he was not.\nOn  20/07 a progress committee meeting was held with myself, my supervisor, and the PGR assessors to discuss outcomes. I highlighted that at no point in the year had any concerns been raised. I have always performed well and have been well praised by my supervisor. My supervisor had read the report and not mentioned any issues that would significantly hinder my progression so to remove me based on \"poor writing\" when 1) no evidence has been provided and 2) as if writing skills cannot be taught/improved over the course of my PhD education is a very drastic and final approach. It was also at this time I was prevented from speaking about the bullying/harassment I have faced in my lab and told that this was only a discussion on the academic side of things. In this meeting, I mentioned that in light of the COVID lockdown/closure of the university. I had to carry out my assessment from home, no support or guidance was offered by my supervisor aside from a link to a \u2018phrasebook\u2019. I addressed all the points and adjustment which were highlighted in the initial assessor's feedback and had weekly meetings with my supervisor/team, though no support was given/offered.\n\n\nIn this meeting, it was also admitted by my supervisor that he did not offer/implement any support. Though he tried to cover his own back by saying he had \u201creservations since early in the year\u201d (though this was never highlighted, discussed or anything spoken about as a point to improve) and that I \u201cwas an average student and not forward-thinking\u201d which I have evidence to the contrary that I have performed well and produced a number of plans/presentations and avenues of exploration for future work. I also achieved all the milestones set for the first year, the work was otherwise well praised and had also carried out extra work to help on other projects.\nFollowing this, on the 22/07 I received an email that it was decided that the decision to not support transfer into the 2nd year could not be overturned and it was a unanimous decision by the panel that the written work would not be sufficient for an MPhil re-write as I \u201cdemonstrate at the Progress Committee Meeting a full understanding of the extent of your writing difficulties and the requirement to improve your written communication to an extent where writing for a research degree would be possible\u201d.  Concerningly overlooking the aforementioned points of lack of support, communication, and consideration to the COVID lockdown. So I have worked for two years in this lab only to be removed with no fair cause and no further qualification/career development.\n\n\nAs I am in the process of launching an appeal. I had requested a copy of the meeting minutes to compare with my own. Strangely all mention of my supervisor not supervising was omitted. It downplayed any of the supervision shortcomings and painted me to be a lost cause/bad student \u2013 saying that I did not provide drafts (I sent my supervisory team drafts 3 weeks before submission and also sections with their comments/adjustments) and I have the email logs to prove it. Saying that I had not taken any initiative to seek support \u2013 1) no issues have ever been raised prior relating to my writing, 2) I had elected to attend a number of development and training workshops on my own accord 3) In light of the COVID lockdown, any access to support and guidance was severely limited/if any provided at all.\n\n\nI mentioned in my earlier post that the lab that I worked in was notorious for politics, nepotism, and bullying. The student who had the project before me was bullied into leaving after a few months. It has become clear this is a reoccurring issue involving the behavior of particular senior members of staff which I and others had tried to raise. In my own experience, I had found myself subject to unwelcome comments regarding my appearance and stature made by a senior member of staff. Rumors were being spread about my apparent use of enhancing drugs (I don\u2019t use) and that I was \u201call brawn, no brains\u201d, comments to that effect. Furthermore, on a number of occasions, I had also experienced uncomfortable and unwelcome physical advances by a member of senior staff who would grope my chest and arms. I made it clear to this individual that I was uncomfortable with this behavior and in a professional manner would not like to be viewed as such. Unfortunately, this unwelcome physical behavior continued. In addition to remarks being made that I do not partake in social drinking (due to my religious beliefs) or the eating of shared food items (pork, meat, bacon). I had highlighted this to my supervisor. Particularly the physical harassment and groping who told me he was aware of this individual, politics such as this has a history and that his advice was to \u201ckeep your head down, let it happen and you can get your PhD at the end\u201d. Members of the lab were frequently told to not socialize with me, not talk to me, \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you with him\u201d which cultivated an environment of isolation. Finally, I raised this to the Head of Department via email, because it was taking a toll on my wellbeing and the enjoyment of my work being in such a negative and isolating work environment.\n\n\nThis culminated in an interaction a few days after sending the email, where the senior individual in question lured me to a private corner of the workspace for \u201ca quick chat\u201d and attempted to intimidate me saying I should stop talking to members of the office (my friend/colleagues) and that I should stop talking about the issues and that I wouldn\u2019t be remaining for much longer and that things could be made difficult for me. It is impossible to say whether these instances of bullying and harassment may have tainted my character in the eyes of senior staff for whistleblowing and potentially influenced the channels involved in my academic progression. As I had made it clear that I was not going to be subject to intimidation. It is arguable and perhaps logical that I was removed as a means to silence these issues. As I have highlighted before, written communication is an extremely atypical reason for such a drastic and final solution. Particularly when I have demonstrated promise in all other aspects of my performance.\n\n\nI would appreciate any advice/avenues to explore. I am currently launching an academic appeal so I can get a proper grading or an MPhil to at least show for my years of work. In addition to contacting the OIA, Research Excellence Framework, and potentially the local press / the Independent and the Guardian do articles based on student submissions and academic experiences to name and shame these members and faculty.",

          "text": "I want to reinforce not approaching the press at this stage. Their interests diverge quite a bit from yours (not to say they're opposite interests, just that you immediately lose control once a reporter/editor decide to persue a story). And once they make contact with your school, it effectively triggers an adversarial posture -- for example, university lawyers go from 50% defensive and 50% quiet fact-finding to 90% defensive, 5% quiet fact-finding, and 5% angry.\n\nMeanwhile, the press will only be effective when there is similar behavior across at least a few people at the school, when the school had knowledge and provably did nothing. The story also has to be \"simple\" for a non-academic audience to understand. A school doesn't feel pressure when it's one story; they say \"We're evaluating the accusations and will take appropriate steps\" and it's over. But if they have to account for a pattern of behavior that implicates the school rather than an individual, they have to show change. Unfortunately that usually results in the departure of accusers as well.",

The question is, would it be usable? Would it leave the student vulnerable to reprimand/lawsuit due to risking disclosure of confidential research? Honestly, if I felt I was cornered by those in power and left no choice, my career is over in academia anyway, I would just make such recordings and publish them anonymously perhaps to at least scratch the reputation of such shit profs/staff.",

Being reinstated wasn't an option anyway. They used a lawyer, asked for the minutes of everything. We werent in touch after that, so not sure how it ended but they didn't go to press. The student later started a PhD elsewhere and was directly treated as a 2nd year student there. They didnt get any ref letters from their past supervisors.\n\nIn my opinion, unfortunately, not progressing to 2nd year due to poor performance is a very common and acceptable excuse and hard to argue against. You can name and shame them but it wouldn't save your academic career in the long run. \n\nBut the other stuff you mentioned, being bullied in the office space etc should be brought up at venues other than the appeal process as well. You have to be really clear that it's not just because you are bitter about what happened to you, but there is a wider problem.",

Sadly, that seems more the exception than the rule. People who don't quickly fit into small departments/labs' cultures find themselves ostracized, treated unfairly, etc. \n\nIt is upsetting that you are facing sexual advances like that - and it can't be easy talking about it or pursuing any appropriate actions. While some of our society now realizes men can be victims of sexual abuse, assault, etc. as well, too often such victims are treated like they weren't 'really abused' due to their sex.\n\nThe alcohol thing I understand; I drank from the time I was 16 until I was about 28 (I'm 35 now - seven years clean - excepting all the damn pot I smoke). It was so much a part of my departments culture - particularly among the small number of graduate students we had (political science). Those who didn't drink either went out and watched everyone else get shit-faced and eventually face peer pressure to drink OR they stayed home, bored, alone. Not fair, and it sucks that graduate student culture and sometimes faculty culture can be embedded in alcoholism and immediately judge someone who doesn't drink. Especially when, at the same time, they are saying you're doing illegal substances. And, even if you were (and I know you are not) it still wouldn't be their damn business unless it was directly affecting work within the lab, etc. I have known plenty of grad students - and more than one professor - who are potheads, and I've known quite a few who did harder stuff (coke, amphetamines like adderall). What they do on their personal time is their business, not mine - and that should hold true for you; their spending time talking about the things they think you do says a lot more about them than you. I wish you could go after those who have sexually abused you - and you could; but I've learned from teaching courses on Women, Public Policy and Politics - that men are rarely believed, and both police and universities are far less likely to take them seriously if they make an accusation of sexual abuse. It isn't right - it has created generations of men who have hidden things that happened to them, who thought they just needed to toughen up and put up with it. That same cultural belief is still more present than many of us would like to believe.\n\nAll the ideas I have for how to handle a situation like this are based off of going to grad schools and teaching in the USA. The US and UK education systems are very different, and the structure of universities themselves differ quite a bit. The rights of students, faculty and staff differ too - you'd probably have more recourse in an American University but you never know, each department still has its own little culture.\n\nIf you really want to stay in academia you can always look at other schools, including abroad - though I can understand the desire to just wash ones hands at it and be done after something like this (I have two MAs - was ABD and eventually had to quit my own PhD program due to illness: I tried hanging on for 2 extra years before I admitted to myself I just didn't care anymore and wanted to be done). It is a valid way to feel, it is a valid thing to do - you may regret it for a time but realize you did what was best for you.\n\nEven if you can't get evidence to pursue an appeal or take legal action (at least, that is how it appears), you can raise hell. I'm not sure what types of legal protections you have in the UK as a student, but here you'd have a pretty good lawsuit (but we Americans absolutely love to litigate everything). \n\nI'm the type of ass who would advertise this to prospective students, as an op-ed in the school paper, on reddit and multiple other social media platforms. But I'm a bit vindictive, yet also feel that when something like this happens to one person you can bet your life that it has happened to others, and will happen to still more. \n\nMy social justice warrior self and vindictive self get along a little too well ;)\n\nI hate witnessing people with great power over others' lives act without any consideration into how they are impacting those lives; I hate seeing faculty members who treat providing an education to others as the 'shit they have to do to get to do research' - it always comes out in their teaching whether they realize it or not. I hate seeing someone slowly made more and more uncomfortable, seeing someone slowly pushed aside like a slow-motion car accident you can't stop. I did qualitative research, which is an increasingly rare thing in political science (a major problem with the entire field, not just my former university). Many professors and grad students didn't believe qualitative work was 'rigorous' (though it took a lot more effort and research than running a bunch of regressions on proxy variables!). My work would often be treated as 'lesser than' that of the 95% of grad students doing primarily quantitative analysis. Of course, I made no secret of my displeasure in the final years - and made sure to let everyone know. Because, again, I can be a bit of a dick when I feel I've been wronged - or someone else has - by individuals who ought be 'on their side' and helping them which is what your case entails.\n\nI wish you the best. I hope you can find some resolution. I hope you are still able to use that experience to do work you enjoy. I also think you'll be surprised at how many others have had issues like yours - there are more hiring committees, etc. in academia with members who know very well what type of lab culture you were chased out of. \n\nThere are always a few such departments at any university, and faculty/staff tend to know what departments those are - and are unlikely to be shocked at someone coming for a job, or to apply for a grad program, who has to explain a hole in the CV that exists because of the type of abuse you face. I bet that if you're honest as you move forward in life, you'll find a lot of people are sympathetic.\n\nIt is disgusting how easily, effortlessly and thoughtlessly those we're supposed to trust most - professors, administrators, fellow grad students - can turn on and harm those whose care they are trusted with. You'd think academics would have some self-awareness regarding how their actions affect others. Maybe they do and just don't care. Not sure which is worse...\n\nSorry for rambling, anyways - I wish you the best of luck.",

Publish to Higher Education reddit, to your universities reddit, to your university's Facebook page, to student groups pages, to regional reddits, forums, etc. Publish on youtube, email the posts and evidence to top leaders of the department and the university, and other departments (you'd be amazed at how much influence other departments can exert when they identify a wrong that is this egregious, especially with the bullying and sexual assault (in the US you could have sued your supervisors - although it still would be a difficult battle, but at least you'd take down the sexual predator with you). \n\nI'd say you no longer should protect the people abusing you. Stop referring to them by titles rather than names - let everyone know what university, what department, who assaulted you (and yes, groping is sexual assault), etc. Sure, the revenge will feel good - but it is also good for others: you could save other individuals from being preyed upon, you could save others from losing a year or more of their life to a corrupt department; you could ruin the career of those whose corruption caused you to lose your desired future. \n\nOnce you have nothing to lose, then let loose. It's amazing how much Reddit, Google Reviews, Facebook, Craigslist, Instagram, etc. has altered power relations, yet society hasn't really fully caught on yet. People still don't turn to social media too often to seek justice and go after those who prey on their subordinates and destroy people's lives - but they should. You may not be able to get what you have sought for so long, but you really ought not let this go - this is beyond the pale and if the university won't address it, then it is time to make it a public issue. Hell, you post it on Reddit in a few places and just imagine how many emails will flood those individuals email accounts, the university's accounts, etc.\n\nI wish I knew now because I'm feeling kinda like an asshole right now and I'd love to be an ass to an institution that has earned such... treatment!",
