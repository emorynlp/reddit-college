  "text": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/magazine/title-ix-sexual-harassment-accusations.html\n\nHave you guys read this? tl;dr woman gets coveted job at UMich and is waiting for spousal hire news; woman's colleague tries to sabotage her offer by submitting fraudulent sexual harassment complaints to UMich and spouse's current university (use archive.is or clear your cache for non-paywalled version)\n\nSo I guess, outside of this dude being a fucking psycho which obviously most people are not, this experience really highlights how unprotected anyone who works in academia is. Starting with the fact that people wouldn't be so desperate for jobs if their career choice didn't leave them to languish in Lubbock, TX or go back to low-skilled labor.",

In fact, its precisely because I support it that I worry about the effects of bad actors diminishing it.\n\nWhere you are incorrect, and become part of the larger problem, is claiming that these bad actors simply don't exist and anyone concerned with wrongful conviction is simply a selfish misogynist - as if nuance doesn't exist.\n\nIts offensive, ideologically lazy, and tragically, it undermines the legitimacy of the #metoo movement.",

I know that accusers reporting sexual crimes are often dehumanized and treated like criminals themselves. I understand that even the act of reporting requires someone to revisit terrible memories. That often, victims have little else to offer but testimony, and that testimony is often insufficient to get a conviction. That rape kits are often mis-handled or never analyzed before they expire. I know all of these things. And yet, reading this story is terrifying still.\n\nAt least in court, one is allowed to know who is their accuser, can dispute the facts. The couple in this story was not. They are very lucky that all they missed out on was this spousal hire - they could have lost their entire livelihood. Who would ever extend another TT position to a professor when it is known that the reason they lost their previous appointment is as a result of a sexual harassment investigation?

Even if you can prove that the facts of the case are unfounded, there is simply no way to defend yourself.\n\n>I also don't think that false accusations are insignificant, and that whichever may occur is simply the cost we must bear for a safer academia. Ideally, we pay some modicum of respect to the truth, including some basic fact-checking. Specifically, the part where the title IX investigator said\n\nAnd then you go on to quote a part you think \"proves\" that the investigator doesn't care about truth, and conclude:\n\n>should be concerning to anyone. The investigation can be based on lies, but can still find you guilty?\n\nAnd then when I pointed out you were just buying into the narrative of the article which was obviously sensationalizing and editorializing what was actually going on here, dead silence -- oh no wait, you surreptitiously added in an edit acknowledging that the article was written to support a narrative, as if you yourself hadn't *one comment before* been actively propping up that narrative.\n\nSo yes. You're part of the problem, and you're worse than someone who's just straightforwardly misogynistic, because you *basically* get it, but you're letting your own selfish fears lead you into buying into bullshit.",

If anything, this article highlights that abusers will find a way to abuse any system that is put in place. I think what's needed, aside from legal channels, is a culture of transparency and disclosure when it comes to sexual harassment. No hushing things up, no shaming of survivors who come forward. On a related note, I think people keep trying to make seeking justice in sexual harassment cases more algorithmic (e.g. calling for due process to be maintained; calling for legal protections), but by its nature, sexual harassment cases will always require a lot of discretion on the part of those judging them. I think people need to be more accepting of this reality, so that we may incorporate it into how we think about these cases, rather than ignoring it and attempting fruitlessly to solve them like grade school math problems.",
