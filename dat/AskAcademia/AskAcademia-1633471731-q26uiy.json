  "title:": "Being asked to write my own letter of recommendation.",
  "text": "My PI is asking that I write a draft of my letter of rec for the NSF GRFP that he can edit revise and submit. Apparently he has a lot on his plate at the moment and has been asked to write many letters. (He BCC'd all of us I guess asking we all do the same).\n\nI have never written a letter of rec on my own behalf and it feels really awkward to do so. For example things I wish he would write about me feel very weird for me to write about myself and then submit to him. I also know he does think very highly of me and I believe would sign off on a very strong letter - it's just a little uncomfortable for me right now.\n\nHas anyone been on either side of this situation before? How should I proceed to ensure I receive the strongest letter possible?\n\nThank you!!",

Draft a letter best you can and offer it to your prof as a starting point. They will edit it and make it their own. Your draft will be a big help to them.",

It feels awkward doing it, but it's an opportunity to make sure your strengths and story are highlighted in the best way. Buckle down and push through it. Don't be humble but of course don't exaggerate either.",

You will stand out with good examples of scholarship, leadership, and perseverance. Have a discussion about your future and how you will be a great addition to the community. \n\nI don't feel comfortable ranking myself, but you.could ask PI if they feel you are the best or top 10 percent at some attribute in their experience and mention that",
