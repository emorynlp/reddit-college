  "text": "Hello. I am planning to submit some work to an upcoming conference in economics, and I have the choice to apply for an oral presentation or a poster presentation. I think I understand what an oral presentation is, you speak on a stage to an audience about your research and answer questions. However, I'm not sure what a poster presentation is. Do I just stand there like a lemming hoping someone asks me about my work? Also, which should I apply for, especially given that I am a younger single author? Thanks for your help!",

      "text": "For a poster presentation you make a large poster summarising your research. The poster is displayed through the conference and usually there are set times that you need to stand next to it for people to ask questions. Some conferences also award prizes for the best posters so you might have judges asking questions too. Many conferences allow you to submit an abstract for an oral presentation and if you are not selected for the oral they will let you do a poster instead. If it\u2019s your first conference the poster is less pressure and you\u2019ll get to watch the oral presentations to see what to aim for another year. What does your supervisor recommend?",

I think I am going to opt for a poster because I also want to enjoy the conference and don't want tons of pressure. Thanks for your help!",

I\u2019ll add the minor point that oral presentations are a lot more common (I\u2019ve been an Econ asst prof for 5 years and never done a poster presentation) so you\u2019re more likely to be able to reuse your work for an oral presentation (the slides and the prep), and it\u2019s better practice for the future.",

I had it printed in color and on a vinyl sheet at Office Depot. I shipped it ahead to the conference in a tube (so I wouldn't have to hassle with it on the plane) and bought a cardboard frame at an office supply store in the host city. (It was in Manhattan, so there was one on every corner!)\n\n  \nIt cost about $100 for the poster, but it looked good! As others have said, there were times when I would stand by the display and explain my research to people. I also had a few handouts.\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "As a role of thumb, talk> poster presentation, however it depends a lot on the king of conference, the field, etc... (Usually, poster have the advantage that allow way more people to have the opportunity to present their work; for this reason some conferences are more oriented towards poster presentations, leaving the opportunity to speak only to very big personalities of the field, while others prefer to have parallel sessions, to give more people the opportunity to talk, even if to a smaller audience). \n\nThis said, sometimes conferences give also the possibility to apply for both (meaning that the organizers will decide if your presentation will be a talk or a poster); in one conference i even have two presentations, one talk and one poster, regarding two different topics (again, this depends a lot on how the conference in organized), so i would inquire whether or not you should commit to one when you are submitting the abstract, etc... (usually this kind of information should be present in the conference website, you can also write to the organizers, is you want).\n\nRegarding HOW the poster presentation works, usually there are \"poster sessions\" where the presenters will stay in front of the posters and be available to answer any question the partecipants (who will go around looking at the posters) want to ask.\n\nIf you have to prepare a poster, i would suggest also to ask a college or your advisor (if you are a student) about the style conventions, since (due to the nature of the poster presentation itself) it is very important to be able to catch the viewer's eye. Also, check carefully the instruction on how the poster should be (dimensions, portrait vs landscape, etc...)",
