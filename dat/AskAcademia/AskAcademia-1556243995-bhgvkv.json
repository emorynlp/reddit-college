It's quite difficult to get into the American tenure-track system, if you have a PhD not from the US. Obviously, there are exceptions and it might work out, but it is more difficult.  \n\nAlso, in Europe, you need a Master's degree first, before you can do a PhD.  \n\nFunding is often (but not always) very specific for certain projects, so you might need to adjust your planned topic to whatever positions are available at the moment.",

Can't say much about the disciplines, but some similarities stand out: a supportive advisor and a great source of funding.\n\nThe latter really resonates with me. I would say that literally all the stress I deal with in grad school is due to funding, or lack thereof. I can rarely attend conferences, I have to TA for about 10-30hrs/week and that takes away time from research, making it really hard to compete with other students. My stipend is not great and that creates money problems in day-to-day life.\n\nStill, I wouldn't say my grad life has been bad, and I do have a very supportive advisor. It has greatly opened the doors for me in terms of work opportunities and networking. Also I have learned how to learn at such a rapid pace I feel well equipped to explore new things. Most of the time it's fun.",

I also call and email them with updates. I also loved most of my classes, like thouroughly enjoyed them. Only a few classes, less than a handful I didn't. Writing the dissertation was the hardest part because you feel like it could never end and when your a perfectionist you hate seeing the red ink. But I truly feel like I grew not only professionally, but as a person. I started to realize just how much knowledge is out there that I don't know, that it's ok to not have all the answers, but that being a contribution to society of what I truly want. I matured a lot in I think great ways. Still also keep in contact with many of my program mates. I think it helped that I was a grad assistant and had another part time job so that I didn't feel overwhelmed. I also successfully dated and former a relationship during my studies so I have had the opposite experience than most on that end as well. Part of my success was being at an institution I was already very familiar with, being settled in the city, and having a good support network in friends and family.",

It wasn't a 'lab' environment (I was the only PhD working with my particular supervisors, and most of the PhDs in my office were on similar 'single student' research areas). Treated it like a 9-5 and was done in good order.

Got 4 decent publications and landed a job a few months before graduating.\n\nI think the short timescales required by UK PhDs focus advisors into being a bit more hands-on and proactive. Definitely not all, of course, but the rate of horror stories seems far lower. The system itself is designed with some pretty substantial progress requirements as hurdles, to weed out weaker or less motivated students and push them into an MPhil within a year or two if necessary, rather than let them struggle on for longer than is fair to anyone. On average, a PhD here is completed in 4 years (no taught component, only research) - but I find the timescale focuses minds towards productivity... there\u2019s not so much of the stereotype of students spending entire weeks on social media.",

Energy executives ( from the science side) are still like students when their former professors call them up or drop by. There's a genuine desire to still be part of the 'science'.\n\nWe do field trips out in Nature.

Afterwards, whether you work in academia or industry, you may never again have as much fun and have the luxury of getting so deeply into one subject on its own. My fellow PhD students at the time, some single, some with young families, almost all had a similar great experience. This is due to a few factors though:\n\nI had a supportive supervisor and a great department. Part of this is because I got involved in my college and department equally: did rowing, helped out with department coffee mornings, served on a committee (makes professors remember your name better), taught undergraduates, and even started a student society. \n\nThe other part is self-discipline. If you are not suited to it, you are going to moan and complain about everything. Not talking about the cases where there's serious challenges like difficult supervisors and lack of support- totally different and really serious to address- just talking about the ones who have a great supportive department and great library but still don't do anything for themselves. They like to complain and be vocal. There were quite a few people like that in every institution where I studied, usually at MA level but also doing PhDs and absolutely moaning and procrastinating. I remember doing my MA and one of the other students on our course was very frankly not suited for academic study but quote \"did not think it was worth doing anything else and might as well milk being a student for as long as possible.\" I don't think he got as far as the others in our very small cohort: one's now an Oxford professor, another a professional rugby player, and another a youth chaplain. All happy people. I have no social media and have no idea what happened to this kid. I instead made friends with people who were serious about doing well and enjoying it for its own sake, and steered clear of those people who sat in college brunch/dinner in the dining hall complaining how they spent six hours looking at pictures of cats and only two hours of real work that day. I called them the Commiserators.",

      "text": "Overall, I had a really good experience. I did my undergrad in a humanities, worked for a few years, and got a PhD in health sciences (US). First year - coursework, second year - written quals, third year - oral quals/proposal, fourth year - dissertation defense. I had solid funding throughout (first two years on fellowship, unsuccessful app for an external fellowship so funded third year by TA-ing, and fourth year got an internal fellowship) and a better than average relationship with my adviser. My adviser was very supportive and knowledgable, and after some time I figured out how to get our work styles to harmonize better. It's neat now to think about how that mentoring rapport improved over time - I had never had that experience before. I also worked in health services research role 50% time during my PhD and was able to use the data and some of the tasks for my graduate work - so that made it a lot more efficient and gave me an opportunity to publish more papers outside my dissertation. I entered with zero papers and finished with six, plus others that were under review or in progress. \n\nI definitely had mental health struggles, but they started when I was a child and were worse before grad school. I had such a hard time mentally/emotionally in college, and I thought it was because college was hard, and then my mental health got way worse when I was working. So the PhD didn't cause my mental health issues, but like any other job there would be times that mental illness got in the way of work/life. Having a goal (getting a PhD to be capable of doing interesting and impactful work to improve health) was a good impetus to really learn how to manage my mental illness. Did a lot of therapy and started meds, and honestly, having the incremental goals and progress really helped. Ultimately, all of those things, plus the relationships I was able to develop as a result of getting my shit together mentally, made grad school a markedly better time than anything I'd experienced before. Of course research and grad school is a roller coaster, and I'm delighted that I'm past it and more autonomous now, but it really was the best time of my life up until that point. It helped me a lot to think of it as a job, and it helped that I had some mileage with other jobs that were less meaningful or engaging to me so I had a reference for real strengths/weaknesses of grad school.",

While the work was challenging, I enjoyed it and had no issues to speak of. I kept getting better and better at what I was working on, traveling to conferences in fun locations, meeting new people in my field, etc. \n\nI was in computational neuroscience in the US, fwiw.",

      "text": "My graduate work was the best time of my life.  I came out of my shell, developed life-ling friends, and had a wonderful environment.  My PI was chair and seemingly gruff but genuinely supportive and a near perfect fit for me to work with.  Others in my lab had conflicts with each other, but I got along with everyone and they were very helpful to me.  My PI was very well-funded and I had everything I needed and I was encouraged to go out into other departments and collaborate early; that was superb.  My research area blew up while I was in lab, so I felt some pressure to produce, but there was always something new coming out and I was productive.  \n\nThere were challenges; to this day I am not a fan of Circular Dichroism as in all my experiments my signal-to-noise ratio was about 1 (and that's the only area that didn't get published).  My first semester was literally drink beer and shoot pool six nights a week, but second semester had more demands and I had to spend the first six weeks teaching myself developmental biology to catch up (but I did).  Occasionally things didn't work, but I learned to troubleshoot and develop my own assays.  \n\nThere's often not a lot posted about the positives because w as people like to complain and commiserate.  It's more 'fun' to talk about the bad, and talking about the good can sometimes seem like bragging.  But I, and several of my peers, had truly wonderful times in grad school.",

Advisor has been great, experiments have mostly worked (obviously some haven't, but got enough to write up), published a few papers, and can't say I've struggled mentally.\n\nI think it's half a game of luck really, whether you end up on a good project with a good team behind you. I think having worked in industry before my PhD has helped too. Doing a PhD has not been as stressful as some of my jobs in the past!",

      "text": "My program is very flexible with its students - at least half have full time jobs and live very far from the university itself (I'm across an ocean!). This means the professors have to be flexible with us getting our work done when we have other things to do or regarding meeting times. My advisor is 99% of the time, really great and I always feel better about my work after our meetings. And that 1% is only when I'm annoyed by our 5 hour time difference (or 7 hour flight) creating some communication barriers... Its not like I can ever just pop into his office.\n\nI feel drained mentally and stressed after working FT 9-5 and then doing my research, but I wouldn't say thats mental health issues. My friends who are not students go out without me fairly often, which does get frustrating. But in the end, having the PhD will be more important than going to drink rose at yet another winery (their plans for this weekend).\n\nAnd finding out that I passed my \"comps\" (we call them probations, though that word doesn't translate well) was one of the best days of my life.",
