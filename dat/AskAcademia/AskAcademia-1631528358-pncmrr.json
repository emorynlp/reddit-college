      "text": "The norm is to not use a pseudonym for academic writing.  \n\nThat being said, it is best if you are consistent with how your name appears to facilitate author searches.  Search engines seem to do best with western style names (given name, middle name initial, family name).  Other than that, you can really use any name you want, however, I would suggest that your author name should be similar to your professional name.  \n\nAcademics are judged by their academic work.  The only reason you would hid your authorship is if you do not want anyone to know it was you that wrote something.  Taking credit on your academic CV for a work published under a pseudonym would be odd.  Though I can imagine a few possible reasons, you will end up explaining those reasons over and over.",

The names on their passports are the original Chinese ones but in English speaking gatherings they are commonly known with their English names.\n\nIn such scenario, if a researcher uses a English name that's different from their original/birth name. Does it have any different impact?",

The same for a different version of your name.  This is not my name, but if my name was Joseph and I published under Joe, that would not be a problem either.",

If you are a solid researcher and people know you do good work, your reputation is associated with that work. Yes I know its all supposed to be about the work.",
