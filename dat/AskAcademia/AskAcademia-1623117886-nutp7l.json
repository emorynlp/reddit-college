The research, writing, presenting, and teaching skills I learned in that two year History MA was far beyond anything I'd ever done as an undergrad.  And taught me to bring real intellectual depth to projects. \n\nI ended up going on for the PhD and going into academia... but with the work-skills I'd picked up in the MA, I'd have ruled the roost if I'd gone back to corporate. \n\n(of course, that same MA really showed me how simplistic, shallow and meaningless the \"business\" world is, so that actually created another hurdle.... :-)",

I hope you find the same kind of enjoyment in your future position.",

Sure, I wanted to teach at a four-year college, but my major professor was a jerk, so I wrote up and left.\n\nSo, I focused my search on community colleges where a masters was a minimum requirement and still is.  I focused less on the northeast where I felt a masters was deemed more inferior and eventually was hired in the midwest.  I'd say just shift your focus to the type of position and possibly the location where you are in greater demand and no one will care as much that you don't have the three letters after your name.\n\nBTW, getting my masters and entering the workforce was the best decision I ever made, though I was made to feel like a loser in doing so.",
