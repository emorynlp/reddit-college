  "text": "Im having a pretty hard time wrapping up my thesis and cant seem to tie everything together because of a pretty bad case of writers block. What also doesnt help is that it is making me feel incredibly stupid and that I dont know enough about my material. No matter how much I read I feel like its not enough",

Just write whats in front of you instead of trying to interpret it all, don't think about it too much and don't worry if you might be stupid. It requires non of your personal feelings. Take it a step further and take in the Hemingway lifestyle and do it piss drunk, you'll be writing too much, and trimming the fat while sober.\n\nHemingway was interesting.",

      "text": " I kept postponing my thesis for three months because of this exact reason.\n\nThe key is to identify what is preventing you from writing:\na) Are you feeling lazy? Sadly, this can only be solved by just getting on with it.\nb) Are you feeling overwhelmed ? This might happen because you might be setting a higher bar for yourself. Instead of thinking in terms of \"I want to finish Chapter X by tonight\" just think of it as \"I will work on Chapter X today\". Even if you write one word you have met your goal. \nc) Are you trying to make your thesis the best work of your career? I was facing this issue as I was trying to make my thesis \"THE BEST\" work I would ever write until one of my colleagues pointed out that if I have a successful career my thesis would be one of the worst works (the graph would be going upwards). This helped me get rid of the notion that my thesis had to be perfect.\nThe last part is to remember that \"writing and editing are two very different aspects\". Yes, the sentence you wrote might be incorrect or might be grammatically wrong but don't delete it right away. Split your writing sessions into two blocks, one where you just write the other where you edit and review what you wrote. \nRemember to take time off and relax. Writing is stressful..especially if you are writing about what you learnt. Go for walks or destress completely and then get back to work.\nHope you make progress with your thesis OP. All the best. Let us know if you need any further help.",

When I'm really struggling with a research project and imposter syndrome creeps in, I stop and go build a piece of furniture or something. It forces me to flex similar mental muscles but on a much shorter time horizon, so I remember what it feels like to actually finish a project. Having a tangible accomplishment helps me snap out of it for the time being until the next time around.",

For example, you could choose a supportive friend or partner, get them some delicious food, get your voice recording app ready to go, and just start explaining your findings/intro/whatever you are working on to them while they eat. It\u2019s not so horrible for them as they have something tasty to eat (provided by you), and somehow it works because you have an audience. Academic writing can sometimes be blocked because it can feel too removed from an audience/communicative purpose when you are slaving in isolation. Then later on just start typing up what you said, adding a bit of academic \u201cvoice\u201d, and you\u2019ve got a re-entry to writing.",
