      "text": "Stay organized early on; use a citation manager; find out your school's formatting requirements and adhere to them from the get go. It will save you so much time and stress at the last mile. \n\nAfter you send a chapter to your advisor, don't wait for comments before starting the next chapter. Start right away. \n\nGive yourself a few days to sit with comments (especially if they're harsh), then make a to-do list organized by easy fixes and difficult/time-consuming ones. Address them methodically, starting with the easy ones to make you feel like you're making quick progress.\n\nWhen researching, take the time to make an outline of the important papers/books you will be drawing on. Write a short abstract at the top and some keywords/connections to other research you're using. This will be an invaluable resource to draw on when you need to reference the material as you're writing; you won't have to waste time poring through the original source trying to find that one line or idea. \n\nGood luck!",

Getting something on the page makes so much difference. If you have figures make them first because it's time consuming but easy and will give you a structure for each chapter.",

I used to be intent of writing in order, but with my dissertation it made sense to start on ch 2, because that's what I was reading about at the time and I needed to be clear about my methodology for the rest of the project to take shape. Then I went to chapter 3, then back to 1, and so on.",

      "text": "As always, YMMV, all that, but 2 things that worked for me:\n\n* Recursive outlining. Outline main chapters, sanity check with advisor. Then outline sub-chapters, check with colleagues and advisor. Keep breaking it down and re-arranging until you have something that flows naturally. \n\n* Writing badly. Learned that from listening to a podcast with Dan Harmon, TV show writer behind Community and Rick & Morty. When I get stuck looking at the blank page it's difficult to lower my standards enough that I start writing, because I want to be a good writer. But I can't become one if I don't write, so what I need to do is the opposite: try to write as badly as possible (while still being intelligible). It's a lot easier to write badly so this let me put a lot more words on paper in a short period of time, and simply revise them later, which actually led to my writing improving.",

Get a draft of a chapter finished, send it to your committee, and move to the next chapter. \n\nThis will allow you to make a tentative schedule for completing your first draft. Once you have a completed draft in decent shape, revisions are a lesser task. \n\nGood luck!",

It\u2019s backed up automatically if you use overleaf, GitHub integrated for pulling to a offline machine if you happen to be writing off grid, and built in zotero/mendeley integration makes citations easy Peasy. Just \\cite[author] in the text and it\u2019s done. No need to format, no need to place, no need to figure out what number the citation should be. Same for figures and tables, just \\ref[nameoftable] and like magic. No need to worry about changing table numbers, figure numbers etc. \n\nIt seems like a little thing and the learning curve is there, but damn if those little things don\u2019t add up to a lot less on your mind.",

Other days the writing came easy, and I\u2019d get 5-6 pages out. Then there were the days where I would lose 2 pages due to trimming/editing. \n\nThis strategy is what got me finished when I was in my first faculty position at an R1 (instructor level, teaching 5:4) while ABD.",
