  "text": "\nSo my supervisor was very helpful and talked me through the next stages of my project and what they expect me to do over the next few months.\n\nA lot of the confusion lies on my end since I was forcing myself to pack my days full of work when they were expecting me to take it a bit easier and focus on doing one major task instead of several smaller ones.\n\nTo be honest I'm kind of floundering at the minute. My head simply isn't in the game and I'm feeling really bad about everything. I think I need some time off to be honest.",

This is an incredibly common trap to fall into for PhD students, but it absolutely destroys productivity. You're doing very involved intellectual work- doing one think that's well thought out can have far more value than 20 things that aren't.",

      "text": "Good for you. Yes, everyone needs a break once a while. It's summer (assuming you're in the northern hemisphere), take a vacation, go have fun, and refresh yourself. \n\nA small advice that you might mind helpful is to discuss the road map and milestones of your project with your supervisor (If you haven't done so already). By that I don't mean something vague as in 'Why don't you read some papers and see what can we do' kind of discussion, but the kind of discussion with proper goals as in 'You have this hypothesis, and you have to do this experiment, then you do that simulation, then you improve on this existing model, and if you're able to complete them then you can graduate' (I know things might be different for different field but I think you get what I mean). This way you will have some idea of what you need to achieve and the estimated timeline of your graduation. I know many advisers prefer the hands-off approach of discussing only the big picture and let the students do whatever they want and report back once a while but very often the students end up spending time on things that won't contribute to their graduation. \n\nGood luck.",

In the words of Ron Swanson, never half ass two things when you can whole ass one thing. :)\n\nDefinitely unplug for a bit. Take some time, but when you come back, consider setting boundaries for yourself. Make sure you actively schedule time to disconnect from your work. Go for a walk, get some exercise, pick up a hobby \u2013 whatever helps you. Working in a lab can be so immersive that we forget to step away from it. Nothing you do is worth the expense of your health, physical or mental.",
