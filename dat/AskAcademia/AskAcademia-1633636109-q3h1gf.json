  "text": "I've complained for months now about how I've never had the chance to visit the PhD office and how awful it is working from home in my first year.\n\nWell I got what I wanted and was very disappointed... My office mates barely talked to me and didn't make any efforts to welcome me in despite me trying to break the ice several times. \n\nThe faculty still hasn't provided my desktop so all code developments have to be done on my ancient laptop with a battery life measured in minutes.\n\nThe toilets and general facilities around campus suck and we have to wear a mask everywhere, even in the office (not complaining about the mask- wearing it just makes my face sweat). \n\nAll in all it sucked and the only good side was seeing my supervisor irl because we actually get along quite well.",

Try asking if anyone wants to go for a coffee (even if it's just to walk there and back), and try and get people individually to talk to. \n\nOnce you all get to know each other it will probably relax in the office, but odds are right now no one wants to be *that* person who is disrupting the office with chat.",

      "text": "Sorry to hear it has not been the nice experience you were wishing for, but I would try not to give up hope yet.\n\nAre your office mates other first year students, or maybe further along in their PhD, which in my experience can make PhD students much more focused and less keen to chat?  And is there a chance to get in touch with other first year students, or are there any PhD meet-ups at your deparment? Maybe that could help you get started with getting some contacts in your department who you at least can have lunch or a coffee break with. Are there departmental seminars- sometimes there may be nice opportunities to randomly chat to the person sitting next to you before/after?\n\nAnd with your office mates, maybe they become a bit less reserved once they have seen you around a few times?",

Hardware and furniture provided by the university are usually mediocre at best as well. Why not spend a few grand on a decent desk, office chair, and desktop PC, and create a nice home office? Some people from my department were even reimbursed for the hardware from grant money.",

During quarantine I just felt like a hamster on a wheel alone in my apartment, living in a wonky little loop between my bed and my desk. \n\nI also really enjoyed casually running into colleagues during the day. Some of the best, most intellectually productive conversations I had were outside formal meetings/workshops, just running into people in the hallway or crossing paths on the way to get coffee. Other people can be helpful and stimulating, too.",
