  "title:": "Recommendations for books featuring the \"behind the scenes\" of academia",
  "text": "There are a lot of books about how to do research, what it takes to be a good scientist, etc. etc. many of which have been discussed in this sub before. Recently, however, I stumbled upon the book *Apprentice to Genius: The Making of a Scientific Dynasty* by R. Kanigel which discusses a \"dynasty\" of Nobel-and-other-prestigious-award-winning researchers through their mentor-mentee relationships. It goes quite deep into the ugly politics of academia, disputes about authorship etc. It's a pretty interesting read, although it deals with biochem/medical fields which are quite different from my area.\n\nI was wondering: are there any other books \u2014 biographies, guides, or anything else \u2014 that go into the \"behind the scenes\" of academia work and discuss mentorship, running a lab, publishing, and the issues associated with working in academia? I'd be interested in reading more about others' experiences. Something focused on STEM would be perfect but I'll appreciate any suggestions.",

For physics, for example, definitely look at Sharon Traweek, _Beamtimes and Lifetimes_ \u2014 it is an ethnography of high-energy particle physics in the 1990s. \n\nThe history of science also contains lots and lots and lots of careful studies for basically any topic you can imagine. \n\nIn short: there are entire disciplines devoted to this \u2014\u00a0check them out! Most of their book-length output is totally readable by someone from outside of the discipline.",

And, importantly, how to be successful even through all the bologna that comes with it. \n\nThe professor is in is a great book on the process of getting a job in academia and what goes on behind the scenes. It's mostly a guide about successfully navigating the application process. But it is very good and provides a good look at a lot of the aspects of academia. It also includes a section on how to leave academia. \n\nOther books I have read sections of that relate include don't be such a scientist, a guide to academia by prosanta chakrabarty, and the Chicago guide to your academic career (a good reference style book, just look up the sections as needed). \n\nHope this helps!",
