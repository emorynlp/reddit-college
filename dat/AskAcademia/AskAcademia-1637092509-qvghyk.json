  "title:": "Advice for a 26 year old thinking of pursuing a STEM degree?",
  "text": "Located in Ontario currently employed doing admin work for the government and making essentially poverty level income (\ud83d\udc4e). \n\nI\u2019ve been feeling lost in my current job and regretful of pursuing the degree that I chose soon after high school (BPA- public admin, policy analysis spec). I had a lot of interest in government policies and world issues but this interest faded as I gained more knowledge about the career path in government policy. I think a pivot without additional training will be near impossible and could eat up a lot of valuable time. Due to this I\u2019m inclined to think going back to school might be a good choice provided it\u2019s in an high demand lucrative field. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n- Has anyone pursued STEM degrees around my age and if so what were the obstacles (particularly if you were working full time as well)? \n\n- How did you decide on a degree and was it difficult getting into your program? \n\n- What has your experience been like and what kind of jobs have you been employed in since? \n\nThank you in advance! :)",

      "text": "I was 26 when I started graduate school (in the US). My experience was a little different, in that my undergrad BS degree was in STEM (biology) and I had a couple semesters of undergraduate research experience plus volunteering in the lab when I had maxed out on the course credit I could get. I was working full time (retail call center) during undergrad and for the two years before I got accepted into graduate school (note here that I started as a Master's student, but bumped up to PhD after my 2nd semester).\n\nI was able to use my experience from working full time as an advantage, turning it into a commentary on my work ethic and time management skills. Honestly the biggest hurdle was the pay cut I took going from a full time job to a graduate student stipend. \n\nI always knew since I was a kid that I wanted to go into research, and I loved my undergraduate research labs so that was the route I took. I had initially applied to PhD graduate programs that I wasn't accepted to, so I applied to my undergraduate lab as a Master's student to get more experience. I really liked the project though, and decided to complete my PhD there. \n\nI graduated within 5 years, with a good number of publications (most of which were first author). While I was preparing to defend I interviewed for 3 postdoc positions, got accepted into 2, and that's what I've been doing for the past 2 years =) I really love what I do, and though it's not great every day I still find it pretty rewarding.",

Sorry I misread that then, I guess my comment wasn't as helpful as I thought it would be! \n\nHonestly though, I did know people who started late, and I at least did have the experience of working and doing to class both full time. It's hard, and for some classes it's going to be harder than others. STEM degrees require math and chemistry, and my physics and organic chemistry grades definitely brought my GPA down because I couldn't give them the full attention to study properly. Good luck!",

I didn't work full time during my degree, just enjoyed it.\n* I was interested in Biology, it started as in interest in diet/nutrition but ultimately I was more fascinated by the molecular workings of things. It wasn't too difficult for me, but of course it varies depending on what unis you apply to etc.\n* Loved it all (apart from the exams during undergrad). As I said, right now I'm a postdoc, but I applied to academic and industrial (pharma) jobs after my PhD, I think after my postdoc I'll probably move to industry. I don't really want a PI position in academia.",

I think an advantage of the statistics/data science route, if you were to choose it, is that there is so much supplemental material on the internet that is a.) free b.) easily accessible that you can use to get a head start on your path. It would also use them to make you more effective in the classroom. For example, you can work on building your core understanding of statistics/econometrics in class and build up your programming chops in your free time via free online sources (and even put them into practice in your schoolwork). \n\nThis is actually what I am doing now. I had never written a line of code before my current class (which requires the use of R). I gave myself a summer crash course of free material before the semester and put what I learned to work in class. I now benefit from weekly feedback from the professor and more experienced classmates. Another option to look into may be coding boot camps.\n\nBut either way, good luck out there! And props for taking action to change your situation.",

But what you need to be very careful about is, picking the correct major. There are so many STEM majors for you to pick from. I did my BS in Mechanical Engineering. Engineering degrees are comparatively a bit challenging and you require some fundamental Mathematics and Physics knowledge. The major you should pick should depend mainly on what your interests are and what you are good at. There are many options like Computer Science, IT, Math, Economics, Biology or healthcare. All these are good fields but depends on your preference. If you are unsure of your skills, I'd recommend IT. It's a broad  field with many job openings and you have so many free resources to learn from. And you could do freelancing and earn an extra buck as well.",
