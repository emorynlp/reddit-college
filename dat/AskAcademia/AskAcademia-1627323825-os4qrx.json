  "title:": "Would it be inappropriate to give my professor/mentor a small gift?",
  "text": "I know this question has been asked a bunch of times, but I figured I would ask since my situation is a little unique and I will almost certainly continue working and corresponding with my professor in the future.\n\nBasically, I graduated in May, and I have taken two courses with my professor as an upperclassman and spent a year writing an honors thesis with them as my advisor. They have been a great professor, and as my advisor we met most weeks one-on-one during my senior year for my thesis and for mentorship (post-grad/grad school plans, advice in the field, etc) since I plan on applying to PhDs in the field next year. This has all been over Zoom, which has been a little strange (we spoke maybe twice pre-pandemic), but I have really appreciated their help. I also work with them on a long-term research project part-time and remotely at the moment, and plan to meet with them outside of that scope in the future. \n\nI was thinking of giving them a handwritten thank-you card and a topical mug (related to their research interests, it's unique and cheap, ~$10) when I meet with them around the beginning of the fall semester. Is the mug too much? Would this be a source of awkwardness moving forward?\n\nThanks so much!",

I was a chair and I LOVED getting nice notes concerning faculty; I would not only tell the faculty member that I had received it but also put the information in their annual evaluations. That's part of the permanent record and is very useful for promotions, tenure and raises.",

          "text": "I agree. A handwritten card.As a professor and mentor I was always uncomfortable with anything more (even coffee gift cards). Keep it simple, nothing to suggest any impropriety (it's a complicated world now where that's concerned). Signed articles/books and acknowledgment in those is always classy too. It's awesome you want to express your gratitude. \u263a\ufe0f",

My favorite undergrad professor, who i took 4 classes from, was up for promotion right around when I graduated and the department chair asked me to write a letter for the committee. Apparently they actually gave him my letter after he got the promotion. I saw the aforementioned professor in a bar a few months later and he came over and thanked me for my (admittedly) glowing recommendation.\n\nTopical inexpensive gifts are always good though. My department chair was a bio-anthropologist known for his large collection of ties with bones on them. He would get two or three from students each year.",

      "text": "In honesty, it depends on the dynamic of your relationship! During my undergrad, I worked with my supervisor over the summer going into my final year as well as doing my final year dissertation with her! This leads up to now where I'm doing a PhD with her supervision! \n\nI went on annual leave with some family and she looked after stuff for me in the lab and ended up going beyond what I thought she would do. As a result I got her something from where Islay (the place I visited) which is a Scottish Isle that's big on distilling whisky and gin. I decided to get her a small bottle of gin and some tablet as a thank you and it wasn't weird at all.\n\nWe do have a good relationship at work, we often chat about what we get up to outside of work when we're both in the lab, maybe something a lot of other students don't get with their supervisors. \n\nAnyway, regardless of what you decide, I think at least a card is great! Supervisors that give you that much time and advice are a rarity unfortunately, so it's nice to show appreciation. \n\nHope this helped!",
