  "title:": "PhD advisor accused me of misconduct...???",
  "text": "Dear reddit,\n\nI had a fall out with former phd advisor and don't know what to do, so I thought I'd ask here (dummy account). I'll be vague to avoid ID of either party, but I hope to give enough details to draw a picture of my situation (if not just ask). When I finished my phd I stayed on the same lab for a postdoc, and during this time I had an idea (X). I proposed my advisor to apply for funding (for me) to develop idea X but my advisor dismissed it. 3 years later, another funding opportunity came along and I suggested again to apply and develop X, but my advisor dismissed it again.\n\nAs I needed to apply for funding (to be considered in the future for tenure-track jobs), and my advisor was busy, we discussed and agreed that I would work/publish a particular work on my own (I did all the work, advisor provided \"space and resources\"). This freed my advisor's workload and would allow me to show some independent work (my advisor never got his/her head around the manuscript I prepared and didn't mind). The manuscript is now under review in a top journal of the field.\n\nBy this time I left that institution and moved on to another as a postdoc. Given this manuscript, I thought about using part of the dataset (which I assumed \"freed\", as I had to submit the data to the journal, for openness reasons) to write a proof-of-concept manuscript based on the above idea X. The rationale is that, now there's a publication and hypothesis about X in the literature, my case for funding would be a bit stronger.\n\nThe journal sent a request for review to my now former advisor, who got in touch to say that I'm stealing his/her ideas---who apparently had years before I joined his/her lab. My advisor is effectively accusing me of misconduct for using data generated in his/her lab with his/her ideas. I put forward idea X twice to my advisor, and not once he/she mentioned anything like this.\n\nThe accusation of stealing the idea X is what truly bothers me (because it's \\_not\\_ true), because my advisor knew about it for 3 years while working in his/her lab. I can put the use of experimental data to lack of clear communication. After all, the data for the manuscript we agreed I would do on my own is in the open (as per journal request, common in my field). But the idea stealing thing truly bothers me.\n\nNow, in the email, laying out what I could or could not use for my future projects (I'm looking for tenure-track jobs) I was not allowed effectively to use any data \\_or ideas\\_ during my time in my advisor's lab.\n\nDo I retract the manuscript for idea X (which was already sent out to other referees)? What do I do? I've been feeling anxious since all this happened and can't find anywhere what to do.\n\nMy advisor gave a substantial part of my \\[PhD\\] work to a visiting postdoc for he/she to apply for fellowships, so I'm not sure whether to tell my advisor about other ideas I had during my time in his/her lab (which, besides idea X, do not pose any competition between us) as I fear the advisor might pocket them. Had my advisor not handed over my work to this visiting postdoc I would tell he/she about them, so here I am asking in reddit.\n\nEDIT 1:  I hope this helps.\n\n>a) you wrote a paper independently, with your previous advisor's blessing. That paper is published without the previous advisor as an author, and they have no problem with this.\n\nExactly, except the paper is not yet published (under peer-review). If it's published there (if), I will be forced to make data publicly available. But it's common nowadays, even society type journals do this in my field. I submitted the new manuscript with idea X 3-4 months after that manuscript. Last week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>b) you took data that was part of that publication (freely available to all) to work on a different idea you came up with on your own, that you never worked on in your past advisor's lab.\n\nData will be free once the manuscript is accepted (in current or alternative journal). I developed the theory behind the idea while working on my past advisor's lab, but in spare time (I didn't neglect my current research to work on this other idea). I suggested twice to apply for funding to develop the idea (fellowships for me, to develop idea in advisor's lab). Advisor refused both times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>c) your past advisor is mad that you're working on an idea they refused to let you work on when you came to them with it, and is especially galled you're using data you generated in their lab to do so, even though this data is now part of the public domain due to open access publishing.\n\nYes (except data is not yet public, will be  if other paper accepted).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>d) your past advisor has now give this idea (??) to someone else?\n\nNo. In the past, my data from other project (accepted 2 weeks ago) to visiting postdoc. He wanted to apply for fellowships, and my advisor handed over my data for his application. In the mock presentation this postdoc gave, 50% of the slides were my data.  This is how I knew. All colleagues (postdocs, phd students, technicians) exchanged awkward looks and carried on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: OK so I sent an email to my ex-advisor suggesting to include my advisor in the second manuscript to try to end this amicably. I take on the cheek that as the other paper is still under review, the data is not yet technically publicly available. Nothing concrete for a face-to-face conversation, so I think the advisor wants things in writing. Thank you everyone, I'll keep this updated, and whether I might have a career after all this. To say I'm scared is an understatement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 3: Still waiting...",

              "text": "There are multiple issues here. The biggest one, from my perspective, is that the PI appears to have stolen OP's research idea and is falsely accusing OP of stealing *his* research ideas. That is serious misconduct. That's explicitly what I was referring to when I said that the PI was 100% in the wrong.\n\nWith respect to the paper, you all seem to have missed this statement by OP, \"we discussed and agreed that I would work/publish a particular work on my own.\" The PI specifically agreed that he would not be listed, so OP did nothing wrong there.\n\nThe remaining question is the research data. The PI agreed that OP could publish the paper. *Of course* OP was going to use data from the lab to do that. It is a non-issue. The only question is the timing; offering to delay publication to ensure that the PI can get the data out there first would be an appropriate solution, especially since the novelty of the data does not appear to be a contribution of OP's paper.",

Then, the OP is taking that (soon to he published in an open source journal) data to illustrate further theories. This is commonly done in research. If Dr. X published something on a theory. I can use that research to justify why I think my research should get specific research funding. I wouldn't need Dr. X's permission, unless there was special copyright or patent info involved (which it doesn't sound like is involved). You're right that a Postdoc shouldn't publish without PIs permission, but the PI gave OP the OK.",

And I agree that neither side is 100% is wrong (this seems to be a fact of life even outside of academia). I think that its very important for PIs and postdocs to discuss what belongs to whom at the start and end of these positions. But I also still have the inkling (even with the obvious ambiguity in the post) that the OP is less wrong than the PI. The fact the the PI wasn't even an author on the paper that the OP was publishing leads me to think that they didn't make significant contributions to the data collection, so that data would still belong to OP. This is an assumption I am making however, so I could be wrong.",

There is no issues in any respect with that particular work. Like I said, my advisor was very busy at the time, I gave him/her three first author papers in 15 months that my advisor had to go through plus whatever grants he/she was working on (+ teaching, admin, panels, etc).\n\nIt was always deemed the least \"important\", so to speak, and given my advisor's workload + my need for papers we agreed I should carry it alone. Traditionally, papers are incredibly long in my advisor's laboratory so he/she always took a while to get through them. His/her current phd student finished the phd with no publications (due to the amount of data produced), whereas I managed to contribute to a couple as middle-of-the-road author and almost as a favour. So things do get long in my advisor's lab, and with no papers I get no job.\n\nThe manuscript where I'm accused of stealing ideas, is another manuscript submitted to a mid-tier (but decent enough) type of journal. It does use specific data (5-7%?) from the other paper simply to demonstrate the predictions of the theory behind idea X. The paper is theoretical, it always was, I put the data simply to demonstrate is not a blue-skies theory. Because this 5-7% of data belongs to the other manuscript, under review and forced to make it public as per journal policies, I assumed it could use bits of that same dataset. I did not generate any data explicitly for idea X, but repurposed data from the other manuscript under review.\n\nAnd why single author papers would be problematic (there are many in STEM)? If I produced the dataset, the skills to analyse that dataset, and to write a manuscript so that a top journal would consider it... why would this be a problem? (genuine question)",

Like any other scientist, the PI can try and perform and report this science first. Otherwise, the PI's claims end at the projects for which OP was assigned, and at the non-public data which was acquired. That's it.\n\n\"It's not done\" is a terrible argument one has to resort to when one no longer has sound ones. Why isn't it done? Because of the power differential between individuals? \n\nThe PI has no claim to scientific ownership of this project, and to suggest that they do is a gross ethics violation.",

So OP originally generated the ideas while still under the PI's employment, but did not develop them into a proof of concept until after they left.\n\nI'm of the opinion that ideas are owned by the people who generate them, not the people who pay for them. For instance, when I switch institutions, I fully intend to continue all of the research activities which I was doing before that. There is some shared ownership of patents, of course, but that's about it. There are no \"non-compete\" agreements in academia, thank god.\n\nIt's true, it's a one-sided story.

It was after receiving this invitation when my advisor contacted me. I don't know whether he/she also contacted the journal. As far as I can tell from the status (awaiting referee scores) the submission is going on as usual.\n\nThe small dataset on that manuscript is taken from the other manuscript we agreed, my advisor and me, that I would develop on my own to show some independence (my advisor didn't quite understand the idea behind, and as he/she provided \"space and resources\" only and I did all the work to generate and analyse the data, we agreed). That manuscript has a much larger dataset, and only some bits of it are relevant to the theory behind idea X. So, as it's usual nowadays, journals want the data in the open for reproducibility / open access purposes. Given this I assumed, right or wrong, I could use it to test some parts of the theory behind idea X (after all, the data will be in the open whenever the manuscript is accepted, and it's common to re-analyse other lab's data for different purposes only citing the data's manuscript in return... this would be me citing myself).\n\nOther than the issue with the visiting postdoc, which I never raised with my advisor, I'd like to think we had a pretty good working relationship (hence why I didn't raise the visiting postdoc issue). My first option is to sort this out amicably, or as amicably as possible. Like I mentioned, I still need my advisor's reference letter if I want a tenure-track job (or else, do a third postdoc... but even then I'd need a reference letter from that advisor). And I also spent with this advisor a substantial amount of time (phd + postdoc) so going \"nuclear\" it's just feels... awkard. I don't want to cross the street, so to speak, whenever I come across my advisor in conferences and the like. Ideas are a dime a dozen, the saying goes, and none of other ideas I put down over the years means an overlap (total or partial) in research niches besides idea X \\[partial overlap\\]. But I don't want to be accused of theft either.\n\nI only moved on because my advisor wanted me to stay to develop a project that he/she was more interested about than I was. To the point I ended up thinking my advisor wanted me there so long we had the same interests. Because I liked idea X, and felt my advisor was not going to support me for that \\[after two unsuccessful attempts\\], I left at the end of my contract.\n\nEDIT: I forgot. As for the accusation vs insinuation... this is how the advisor put it:\n\n>PhD students and post-docs are not fellows, they get the right to collaborate within our projects, they do not have the right to use our funding and our ideas and run independent, parallel research programmes because that constitutes plagiarism or mis-use of the lab.\n\nIt feels to me as an accusation.",

I developed the theory behind the idea while working on my past advisor's lab, but in spare time (I didn't neglect my current research to work on this other idea). I suggested twice to apply for funding to develop the idea (fellowships for me, to develop idea in advisor's lab).

He wanted to apply for fellowships, and my advisor handed over my data for his application. In the mock presentation this postdoc gave, 50% of the slides were my data.  This is how I knew.

Does your advisor expect you to do identical work to theirs and then also get a job? That would be pretty silly. \n\nA healthy PhD generally starts off as an apprentice, works on guided or pre-fabricated projects, and then slowly moves toward working on their own. Again, not in all situations, but the general ideal would be to have you graduate after having completed or at least started an \"independent\" project. Which is exactly what you've done. I can't see a problem at all. \n\nThe only small thing would be, does it hurt you to include them as an author (if you haven't already)?

She was up for tenure, and had no real ideas for her file. She was desperate.\n\nHer power was in keeping us isolated from each other. Once we all got together and compared our stories, we realized it wasn't an isolated case or two. It was a pattern of abusive behavior and unethical conduct. The international members of our group were hesitant to report her - our nation's government was at the time controlled by a vocally anti-immigrant buffoon, and they feared deportation - but we eventually gathered all of our materials and reported her, as a group, to several of her superiors at once. Her immediate superiors (the college dean and department chair) saw no reason to investigate. But the university VPs and federal grant managers overseeing her lab and grants were outraged. They brought down the hammer on her, and she made a discreet exit to another university just in time to avoid not getting tenure. And we all learned a lesson. We also contacted the journal authors to inform them of her misconduct, but they didn't seem to care.\n\nBut she's still out there, at a more prestigious university, no doubt building up a fresh lab of terrified students and postdocs. Academia taught this woman how to use others and exploit fears to get ahead, and she clearly hasn't been punished yet for her conduct, so she will continue doing whatever it takes to get publications and get ahead.\n\nPerhaps you will learn, as I did, that academia sometimes creates monsters out of people.

If they've never heard of you and aren't considering hiring you, and she emails them out of the blue to warn them about what a horrible person you are, they usually won't take it too seriously. They will wonder why she went to such great lengths to wound the reputation of a total stranger.\n\nAlso, it's possible she's the sort of person who has done this before, and the community will know she's just a bellyacher who spreads disharmony for her own reasons. They'll ignore that, too.",

I would have a conversation before taking other steps and just ask about that bit you cite above that you feel is an accusation and say it confuses you and share your impression/experience. Imo it's worth the effort because it's the friendliest way. I know academia can be harsh, but it can also just be a silly misunderstanding. I hope it is at least.

So it turned out to be very considerate more than inconsiderate. \n\nBut obviously it's still not okay for him to give your work away. I would sort that out before sharing anything. He can genuinely believe it was his idea. PI's have so much on, it can be super hard to keep track. \n\nLong story short, I think before you do/share/worry anything more, try to get an actual (skype) conversation. Stop pingponging over email and have a proper talk. If he's emailing I feel even stronger that it's just a misunderstanding.",

After email 1) we went for a coffee and talked about it, and wanted something in writing to get his/her head around it.\n\nThe second time was at a meeting in his office when he realised there was a funding scheme I could use to develop a project we were working on but was running out of funding. This was about a year and a half ago. When I mentioned idea X instead, the conversation ended almost immediately. But this is my word against my advisor's. Hard evidence of idea X, just those 2 emails. I have no emails from my advisor suggesting he/she had similar ideas and wanted to work towards them in the future. This only happened a few days ago after my advisor was asked to review my manuscript for a journal.\n\nI did present idea X, alongside progress on the theoretical side, during one of the lab meetings (which, given the small size of my advisor's group, it was joint with another group). So people in the group and beyond are aware of idea X (some of them also of my attempts to develop the idea, in my advisor's institution or elsewhere). And with my name only.
