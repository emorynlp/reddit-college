  "text": "Hi folks,\n\nI'm looking for advice on whether or not pursuing science academic career is worth the pressure. I know this varies greatly from person to person but I would love to hear your experience. I am a Canadian third year undergrad in biochemistry and I absolutely love the science (like little-kid-in-a-candy-store love the science) and really enjoy the work surrounding research BUT I am finding the more exposure I have to it the more I hate the culture surrounding science. It affects me less because I am just an undergrad, but I see the effects the pressure has on my mentors and the seniors and I am starting to wonder if it would be better to get out now and pursue an \"easier\" career. Perhaps something like teaching or nursing with well defined job expectations and outcomes. I currently have an undergrad research position and will have one lined up every semester and summer until I graduate, as well as a Master's supervisor should everything go well (I didn't even approach them for the most part, they approached me and I went with it because it sounded like a good idea), but I don't want to waste their time if I am just going to switch paths.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone is willing to share any perspectives on this, I would greatly appreciate it. I want to be a scientist because I LOVE the science, but I am not sure it's worth killing myself over small things every day of my life.",

      "text": "In the US there ~10 more PhD students starting than permanent positions are rewarded in academia and it properly doesn't look so different in other countries. Hence, dropping out of academia is the rule and not the exception nowadays. So, it's not a failure in anyway, despite what your supervisors may like to tell you. \n But it doesn't necessarily mean to stop doing science. Many companies have a research & development department and many startups are also interested in people with a scientific expertise. So, you may end up in a place with lots of former Postdocs. But even many non-research positions can benefit from having a scientific education. \n\nSo, you may to want to see academia as only one of many ways to build your career and it might not be the best for you.",

              "text": "For me (I\u2019m an associate professor in the US), it\u2019s hard to know where to start. But the \u201cpublish or perish\u201d culture is certainly one of the aspects I\u2019m most disillusioned about. Take, for example, the pressure to churn out ever more publications and the emphasis on quantity over quality. This is stressful enough for me as an author, but it also means that each year I get more and more \u201cinvitations\u201d to review submitted manuscripts - for no extra pay, of course, and with no clear guidelines for how many I should accept. Some of these are good, but I\u2019m endlessly amazed at how many of the manuscripts I read are rushed, sloppy, and low in quality. These are no fun to read.\n\nNow, I try to be a conscientious reviewer, which means that even when I recommend \u201creject,\u201d I try to be supportive, constructive, fair, and encouraging. I also always meet my reviewing deadlines (I missed one by a few days once, and I felt bad about it). But unfortunately, many reviewers produce reviews that are themselves rushed, sloppy, and low in quality. (On top of this, these reviews might come in way past the deadline, which leaves the author\u2014who might desperately need a decision on the submission for the job market, a promotion, or post-tenure review\u2014waiting helplessly.) This means that some papers get accepted when they shouldn\u2019t be, and others get rejected when they shouldn\u2019t be. \n\nI\u2019ve learned as an editor that there are mechanisms for weeding out the poor reviewers, but what this means is that the conscientious reviewers end up burdened with far more (again, pro bono) reviews than they can handle. From the editor\u2019s perspective, this means it can be very hard to recruit qualified, competent reviewers, which can delay the whole process even more for the authors. So the extremely broken publication and peer review system, for me, has been one of the major sources of disillusionment. I\u2019d say that many of the same problems apply to grants, too; the peer review process is very \u201chit or miss.\u201d\n\nTo be honest, though, that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg - just one example. Unfortunately, I could go on and on.\n\nTo the OP: deciding not to pursue academia is in NO way a failure. It\u2019s a wise choice, given the ongoing crisis in higher education.",

The job market has been declining for decades, and if you pursue an academic career then by the time you are on it, the market will be far worse than it was last year. Quitting before doing a PhD is not only perfectly fine, it is advisable for the vast majority of students.",

No life is entirely stress free. Likewise no job is entirely stress free.\nDealing with stress is hard. But you can't avoid it. \nIf you have a passion for your work, let that inspire you and others. Be realistic about deadlines and push back when needed. At the same time communicate clearly about your workload, how you feel and where your stress levels are at.\nUtilize your team and network, ask for help when you need it and make sure everyone knows they can ask the same of you. \nThis has really helped me over my career. You wouldn't believe how much of your job and how it makes you feel is in your own hands.\n\nI quit academia because I didn't have the passion you have. I'm now in management and I know how rare it is to have that.",

When I finished my PhD in March, I was sure I would stay in academia. I even got postdoc offers at great labs abroad and it still feels like a waste to pass on them.  \nBut the more I thought about what that means, the less I was into that life style. I'm in my thirties, so I won't have job security for *at least* 10 more years. Most of that time I probably wouldn't even be sure what I'll do the following year. My granny fell sick this year, so working within 2 hours of my family got also more important. My partner was reluctant on moving abroad (especially the States), so how we would have handled our relationship was open and any big plans put on ice.  \nA few months ago I applied to an industry position that would be a perfect fit for my interests. Permanent position, close to my family, my partner was on board. The moment I realized that I'll have job security for years to come and could make plans that are years in the future actually felt amazing. I'm now excited to see where this new adventure will lead to, it's a completely new challenge (whereas postdoc would have been more of the same). I am grieving my academic career but the negatives just were too big for me. I don't think this means I failed, it just means my priorities lie somewhere else than advancing that specific career. And as said, this is anyway the norm, most people drop out sooner or later, either by choice or because they fail to secure a tenured position. I was curious to see how far I would make it but ultimately leaving now on my own terms probably beats having to leave because I have to or getting stuck at a position I'm not happy about.",

If you look at major breakthroughs in computing, you\u2019ll find they mostly came from private research labs, not academia.\n\nI think mostly academia is only cutting edge in subjects that are only studied in academia, and in these cases, academia is only at the top because there is no competition.",

Here\u2019s my perspective. \n\nEvery job has its downsides and it\u2019s up to you to decide what strengths you really value and what drawbacks you won\u2019t tolerate. For example, many profs love to boast that they can do work whenever is best for them, not just during 9-5. A lot of folks also love \u201cnot really having a boss.\u201d For them, these things are great. For me, I hate these same qualities. Having clearly defined work hours gives me comfort and allows me to clearly delineate between working hours and personal hours. Similarly, having a boss, in my eyes, can be a really good thing if you have a good one - they take care of things on your behalf (budgets, tough calls related to staffing, priorities, etc.), giving you more time to devote to the actual stuff you care about. Profs also love to boast the security of tenure, but for me personally, I think tenure is a super problematic system. Yes, I\u2019d love the job security, but this system also protects abusive people by making it hard to terminate or reprimand them as long as they\u2019re successful researchers. \n\nI think it\u2019s a deeply personal decision, but would agree with others that profs are a biased group of people, often coming from a different generation where it was not quite as impossible to get a tenured position. Consider what\u2019s important to you, the potential downsides of each type of job, and that will help guide you.",

      "text": "First, look at the burn out rate for nursing and teaching and see if that is any better.  \n\nI started off as an undergrad in chemistry working in research labs.  It was the absolute expectation that the vast majority were going to go on to work in industry and not academics.  Even among the PhD students, very few were on an academic track.  I've stayed friends with many of them, and they typically have regular 9-5 jobs working at a chemical plant, pharmaceutical company, quality testing company, part of a big conglomerate, etc.  One does on site technical support so he travels a lot.  Another does recruiting for his company so he travels to different universities.  Another moved into sales.  Another works for a law firm advising on patents.  Some are just doing regular R&D stuff in a company lab. \n\nWhen I was in school, the professors would often tell us that we should look into either getting an MBA or a law degree after our undergrad so we could move into either management or patent law.  I have a relative who is a chemists that has spent her entire career working for the federal government in the patent office.  My university's bread and butter for our MBA program is people with undergrad engineering degrees wanting to move into management. \n\nMy point is that the career that you see your professors doing is only one small aspect of working as a scientists.  There are perks to being a professor in that you have more freedom in picking the topic of your research.  I had a friend (in neuroscience) that joined a pharmaceutical company to work with sleep disorders (his area) and one day the boss walks in and says they are shutting this research down and he is now working on parkinson's disease (not his area).  I had another friend whose plant was shut down and told if he wanted to keep his job, he had to move half-way across the country.  On the other hand, they are paid much, much better than academics and from my conversations, have better work-life balance.  The down side to academics and picking what you want to do is that you have to find the funding to support what you want to do and it is very, very competitive for that limited source of funds.  You are also much more free to be successful or fail because you are basically a one-person company working as a contractor for the university.  These factors lead to much of the toxic behavior you see in academics.\n\nYou should feel no pressure to remain in academics.  It is the norm to move on to industry, not the exception.",

Academia just doesn't discourage that, while some industry jobs do. Before studying for a PhD I worked in the industry for a couple of years. I see people working 16 hour days on both sides.",

My European colleagues at the graduate and professional level have always seemed to treat their work as a job foremost: meaning it is not all-consuming. I\u2019m not trying to paint a false picture of the state of either system, and I\u2019m well aware that job stability in the European academy is not great.

I still have several friends in academia and kept in touch with my old group.  There are pros and cons to working in academic research.  The pros are easy to see, the cons aren't as apparent.\n\n[Grad studies is renowned for depression](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-emotional-toll-of-graduate-school/#:~:text=A%20recent%20Harvard%20study%20concluded,mental%20health%20disorders%20and%20depression.&text=Most%20people%20probably%20lump%20doctoral,such%20as%20law%20or%20medicine).  Research is hard - constant failure, mostly insignificant positive results, actual novel success is quite rare.  It's way easier being the research prof overseeing dozens of students' work as just part of their jobs.  Of course there's pressure to produce results - a high volume of work is required to get those few results that earn grant $$$.  It took all these profs many years of hard work and shitty pay as grad students/post docs to get those coveted tenured positions.  So they know how shitty the work life is, and they don't care - they already paid their dues. \n\nPolitics is huge in academia.  Profs with tenure are there FOR LIFE so there's few consequences for bad behavior - there's always someone with a superiority complex pullling power trips and pettiness.  Word gets around if a department has problems with drama and bad blood.  You want to become a prof at your own hometown university?  Yeah it's probably not going to happen if you got any of your degrees there - permanents are only hired to enhance the school's prestige, i.e. targeting people  from other prestigious schools.   And it's incredibly competitive... \n\nIf you still want to get a grad degree, BE SELECTIVE.  Don't just blindly take this prof's random offer because it's an easy choice and lets you defer bigger decisions for a few years.  Sort out what you want to research / where you want to do it, and what you want to do with the degree afterwards.\n\nYou can apply to do grad studies ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD so if you ever wanted to live abroad, this is a prime opportunity.  Yeah grad studies was depressing but I got to spend a year living in JAPAN doing my research, which was absolutely worth it.\n\nOnly take a grad research position if it pays you enough of a stipend to cover tuition and some living expenses.  Yes generally researchers have $$ for a particular research project, so you might not be able to cherry pick your topic but look for opportunities with researchers who work in your general area of interest, you will get exposure to more stuff.\n\nExpect to pursue an Industry job with your degree. Search job postings for your target degree, and see what other qualifications typically go with it.  It's pretty rare for your specific topic of grad research to end up highly relevant to your job, but the skills you learn should be transferrable to what you want to do professionally.",

Teachers are needed, but it's not exactly a field that people are being encouraged to go into because it's a hot mess, and even more of one because of the pandemic. \n\nMedicine has also been affected by many of the same pressures that Universities face, where hospitals and doctors offices are being run as businesses with money being the main goal moreso than patient care. Most doctors and nurses hate this, and do the best they can for their patients anyway, but there is very real pressure to make the business as much money as possible and the workers are left figuring out how to do that. Furthermore, hospitals have just faced huge layoffs in some areas because elective surgeries and procedures are down, and they won't be hiring again until after the pandemic DESPITE needing more help to treat covid patients.\n\nIf the culture is driving you away from STEM, you need to find a field whose culture you would fit into--find out as much as you can about what you are getting yourself into before doing so.",
