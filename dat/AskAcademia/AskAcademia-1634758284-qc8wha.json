Well....Ok, I can show you lots of data that shows how when not fit correctly they don't perform to the rated standard. However, that doesn't mean they don't work to a degree.

Stupid opinions have proliferated on topics I didn\u2019t even realise were you for grabs lol. \n\nI guess what I meant was, aside from the obviously stupid stuff that gets thrown around, there must be a lot of other nuanced stuff that is genuine good science but could easily be misrepresented by people without a full idea of what they are talking about, or the necessary background to give complete context or see the fact that one study does not make something an absolute truth, particularly if it\u2019s a very generalised point. Or when people completely misinterpret some statistical method or whatever. \n\nThe kicker though, is that the lack of expertise doesn\u2019t stop people from talking as though they really are experts themselves, which is the bit I find annoying myself in (unrelated) areas that I actually know anything about. Like, it\u2019s easy to ignore the people who don\u2019t sound credible, but people who talk and present themselves as though they are and reference actual science to make points in ways that are not valid (but can appear so) are the most frustrating.",

Now, being able to read a wide range of primary sources is nice but it doesn't magically bestow the methodological skills of other disciplines on you. But then those people usually believe themselves to be working without \"theory\" or \"methods\" or any of that new-fangled stuff (the primary sources speak for themselves, you see, and methods are just fads), so this point is inevitably lost on them.\n\n(Latin Philology)",
