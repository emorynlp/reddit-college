  "title:": "What are office politics like in academia?",
  "text": "I'm a soon-to-be PhD student who's worked outside of academia for nearly 10 years now. I keep hearing about \"politics\" (mostly prefixed by \"department\"; rarely, \"university\"...) in casual conversations with current grad students at unis I've applied to. Nothing menacing - the term has always been spoken with a tone equivalent to an eye-roll. I'm no stranger to politics in the workplace, but what does it usually entail in academia?",

      "text": "Compared to the corporate world, there are three unpleasant things about academic politics. One is that there is no clear common goal. In the corporate world at any moment of time usually there's a well defined goal (profit, saving, market expansion, sales, loss reduction etc.), and if something doesn't work, it least in theory, you can always stand up and ask the team to relate back to the goal. Look, we are not doing ourselves any good by getting involved in THIS, because it does not move us towards our main goal for this year. And then supposedly everybody readjust.\n\nIn academia, large-scale goals are almost never articulated, so every person comes up with goals of their own, and there is no clear way to figure out what do we want as a team. Basically, except in situations of emergency, we never want anything collectively, as a team. Sometimes the majority of people happen to have their goals aligned, but it always happens spontaneously, not because we are explicitly required, or want to work together. I guess the whole mythology about tenure and academic freedom does not help here as well. People are so proud of the concept of academic freedom that they basically flip out every time somebody tells them what to do. It's very much a \"don't tread on me\" mentality. How dare you tell me how to teach! What speakers to invite! How to do research! People are very protective of their freedom, which is great, but it makes things harder in so many cases, as they may become protective of their freedom \"just in case\", preemptively, before any actual conflict arises.\n\nAnother, related complication, is that there is no culture of escalation and arbitrage. In the corporate world if you say \"do it\", and another person or function says \"don't do it\", you can always escalate to the management, have a meeting, and agree on the priorities. There is typically a procedure for resolving conflicts, and there is a clear power, so when sales and IT have a conflict, they just calculate the costs, have a meeting, put these costs together, and delegate the decision up. In academia the structure is much flatter, the responsibilities are less clear, and there is no culture of escalation. If you would write to the dean about a conflict with another faculty, it would be perceived as an insult and open war, not as a working moment that happens literally every other week. Which means that pretty much conflicts of interest can sit there for years without ever being resolved.\n\nFinally, the last issue is that academics really like to think, analyze, and look into details, and really don't like making decisions. Which is the exact opposite of the corporate world: there people usually work against a pressure of time, so they know (or are taught the hard way) that in many cases it's more important to make _a_ decision, any decision, than over-analyze and procrastinate. So, at least in my experience, in the corporate world when you call a meeting, present your analysis, and no obvious red flags are identified, typically people vote for a \"go\" decision, and immediately send a proposal to the management. In academia typically nobody would believe your analysis, because they will feel that they need to do it themselves (not that they have the time of course), and then several hypothetical reservations will be voiced, and \"what if\" scenarios will be described, and a few people in the room will have some strong reservations they'll never voice (because, again, there is no culture of conflict resolution), and then everybody would agree to give it another thought, and maybe reconvene in half a year, or maybe form a committee, and give it another look, so forth and so on. There is no decision culture, and things can drag forever, even when people are generally sympathetic to the cause, just because they don't have a habit of working small things out in order to push something big forward.",

Managing disagreements (whether small or large) with faculty and administration always feels so needlessly personal, but because I'm a lowly Masters student, I have no leverage when it comes to mediating or defusing a situation that doesn't just end with me and my concerns being dismissed outright. It's been incredibly toxic and frustrating. ",

If you \"escalate\" things, even peacefully, it's war and the other people will be at your throat trying to sabatoge you.  Another strategy is going to HR with some b.s. complaint like you hurt their feelings because... You were direct with them and saying something is exactly how it is is apparently hurtful and you can't do that?  And maybe the managers will just not want to deal with issues so they send out a silly email that, HR compliantly, says \"I don't want to deal with problems, the next person that escalates an issue is going to be negatively impacted on their performance review.\"  \n\nGoals?  Fucking Goals?  Yeah, the only goals are fake ones.  Goals have to sound good to share holders.  If it's rooted in reality and makes business sense, especially long term over short term, that doesn't sound good enough on the next quarter end earning call so... It's fucking awful.  \n\nOh and who are the people above You?  Either people got sick of working with them so they got promoted to the head of your department, or they are the best bullshitters for fake ideas for the quarter end earning call.  \n\nCorporate is super wishy washy.  There are no roses here.\n\nAlso, let me say the stock market is horrible for businesses.  Say you create an awesome company.  What do you do when you hit your stride as a market innovator with a super happy staff, great profits, and an efficient market delivery system?  Like seriously, you get there and everything is golden, you do that for 2 earnings calls and then what?  How do you keep the stock up?  Well, steady perfection isn't it.  Now that you're there you have to make new improvements.  Cut costs, push Untenable expansion... basically canabalize your company.  Once you reach your peek it's a race to destruction.  ",

I sat through a three-hour meeting in which the decision had already been made but one head of department (with appalling student results) didn't agree with the reasons and liaised with another department (with worse results) to stonewall a compulsory change needed for legal reasons.\nShe did the same thing again two weeks later. So nothing happened in discussing implementation so we now have to do it but with no guidance as she wasted our time arguing about it.....My department results are great and I don't have a problem with increased accountability. I wouldn't have minded having a consistent policy on how to do it but she got to express herself which was so much more important.....\n\nThe kicker is she is retiring at the end of the year, so is probably just planning on arguing and leaving it for her replacement to do. The bonus is that unless they hire another idiot, the results should go up.",

      "text": "In my experience, there's three levels, or types, of politics: within your department, within your university and within your field.\n\nWithin the department is fairly typical politics that you'd expect from any workplace: Professor A has his pet courses that he teaches and won't let anyone else near them, squabbles over how the funding is divided, who is organising the conference we agreed to host, who will represent the department at a university function. I'm lucky, I've been in very small, harmonious departments where none of these things have been issues, but I know of departments where Professor A and Professor B don't speak because Professor A got a grant that Professor B wanted, and now Professor B refuses to attend any conference Professor A attends. \n\nThen within the university, it's usually politics involving the admin. The Dean thinks your department should get less funding because you don't get as many alumni donations as the Italian department. The head librarian doesn't allow graduate students access to restricted materials because of reasons no one quite knows, but you can get them on her day off. Sally in the exam office won't let you pick up your students' exams if you show up past 2.30pm, even if the exam ended at 3.00pm. \n\nField-wise you run into all kinds of things. Student A didn't get a grant because Professor C was on the committee and she hates him. You can't research X because Professor D has the monopoly and it would be a bad move to cross him because he is very highly regarded. Don't publish in that journal, the editor has been presenting some wild papers and anything he touches is now entirely discredited. \n\nI also find, within the field, there are odd lines drawn in the sand, where one person will disagree with the conclusions or methodology of another's research and suddenly there's factions, and you'll have groups of people who don't get along, won't work together and barely even acknowledge each other because they disagree about something that is, frankly, trivial.",

I always felt like people were trying to force relationships on me that I didn't want, and that the line between personal and professional was way too blurred.  Now that I'm out, I've been much happier, but a lot of my personal (non-academic) relationships from prior to working at my last lab have suffered pretty substantially.",

Certain folks won't work together.  Certain folks push agendas at every opportunity.  Certain folks are quietly working against other folks.  There are \"open secrets\" about the performance of certain folks.  Etc.\n\nSo, just take a workplace politics story from a former career and insert \"chair/dean/vp/president\" for \"manager/vp/ceo,\" etc.\n\nMaybe you have some particular case in mind and you're wondering \"Can that happen here too?\"",
