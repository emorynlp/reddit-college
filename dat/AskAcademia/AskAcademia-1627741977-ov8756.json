  "text": " Hi,\n\nI am working on a project that involves generating anatomically accurate CAD models of different of various rat tissues (muscle, skin, etc.). Unfortunately my lab does not have access to these animals yet, so I was wondering whether anyone is aware of any data out there that I could use to generate these models?\n\nMy initial thoughts were something equivalent to [The Visible Human Project](https://visiblehumanproject.com/), but would be grateful for any recommendations",
