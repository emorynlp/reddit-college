  "text": " Hey guys, I would really appreciate it if you could put in some of your inputs or ideas about my situation below.\n\nSo I got admitted to a top university in Germany for Master's in Biological Sciences (Molecular and Cellular Bio). But because of the pandemic and all, some documents that I need from my undergrad university are getting delayed in being processed, and that's delaying my visa process also. I highly doubt I'll be able to reach Germany in time when the lectures begin, and I don't think joining late would be a great idea for someone moving to a new country for the first time in their life. So if I defer my admission to the next year, I'd like to do something constructive with the time I'll have. Do you think I can email profs in research institutes around, and ask to join their research for a while? As in, do they accept people who are on a gap year?\n\nDo let me know what you think!\n\nCheers! :)",

      "text": "Yes, of course, you can.  Since you are looking for a year-long thing, instead of a few months in the summertime, it might be easier to find someone willing to supervise you. \n\nDepending on the institution, it may be tricky for non-registered staff/students to access the facilities (due to labour laws and insurance issues), but usually, an informal/unpaid internship can be arranged. Depending on your country of origin, you may also want to look for some funding (e.g. Erasmus+).",

              "text": "No problem. \n\nThere is Erasmus+ for all students; depending on your level of study, the min/max duration is different. I got requests pre-corona from students interested in applying for this funding and coming to work with me. What I am not sure about is if you need to be enrolled or not to apply. You will need to search for that info yourself - then again, searching for things is part of research. :-)",

If you can afford to do an unpaid research placement then okay, but you deserve to be paid for your work. \n\nAnd yes, basically. I did exactly that when I was an undergrad. If you want to see the email I sent out (to a professor in Germany I ended up working with for a summer research project), send me a PM.",
