  "title:": "A template for academic websites in Notion",
  "text": "Hello everyone\n\nI am an incoming graduate student starting my studies in September. I have been playing with different resources such as WordPress to build my personal website. Being an avid Notion user, I decided to try that out as well. This is what I have come up with till now - [ramandutt.super.site](https://ramandutt.super.site)\n\nI have tried to add some of the most common features of any academic website combined with Notion's aesthetics. It also allows you to write blogs, showcase your publications in a very presentable manner, a section highlighting your latest events, etc. \n\nBeing someone who is going to start in academia very soon, I would greatly appreciate any feedback. I am also planning to release this template so if anyone is interested in that, I would love to connect with you [here](https://twitter.com/RamanDutt4).\n\nThanks, everyone!",
