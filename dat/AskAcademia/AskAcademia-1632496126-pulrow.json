  "title:": "Difference between joining a well-established lab versus a very new lab?",
  "text": "I'm a grad student doing my rotations right now and two very new labs (1-3 years old) have really piqued my interest. I might be really interested in joining one of them once I finish all rotations but I'm not sure of what difficulties new labs face versus more established ones.\n\nAre there any differences in terms of:\n\n- Funding (PI being more strict with how reagents are used)\n\n- Future career mobility (established PIs might have more connections?)\n\n- Stability of the lab (is it possible for very new labs to simply not thrive?)\n\n- PI management (would newer PIs be more stressed out/have less time for mentoring?)\n\n- Mentoring by other lab members (is it significantly harder in smaller labs to figure things out yourself?)\n\nI have to choose between a lab that has ~30 people and decades of history versus labs that have 5-10 people and only started up a few years ago (but probably align with my interests more). Any insights would be appreciated!",

      "text": "Some of the criteria you gave do not depend on the size of the lab but on the personality of the PI such as whether the PI is being more strict with the use of reagents. \n\nIt also depends whether the PI has been tenured or not. If not, then it is possible that PI does not get tenured. It is also possible that the PI gets tenured, but not in the same institution. In such a case, you will have to follow the PI wherever they go next. Note that this can also happen with tenured PIs.\n\nIt also depends what you like. A small lab is more convivial and the PI will be more available to you. A large lab is more busy and it is likely that the PI will not meet with you much. Most likely some postdoc is going to take care of you there. \n\nFinally, it is true that established PIs have more connections and that this can be of definite help. However, if you do a good job, then it will not matter much. \n\nI mean you should choose a research group that matches the following criteria:\n\n* Research interests\n* Overall group atmosphere\n* Group organization and overall mentoring (e.g. hands-on PI vs. hands-off PI, etc.)\n\nOf course, the standing of a lab or a university is attractive, but this should not be the main criteria.",

      "text": "I've worked in a big lab and a small/new lab. Both were high quality labs at excellent institutions. I had similar access to resources in both, as both were well funded, but in the smaller lab the PI was heavily invested in my success, as I was in theirs. It was a partnership where we each worked to help the other succeed, which was very motivating. In the larger lab there was more of a sink or swim philosophy and feel. For the first several years i was a very unimportant cog in their science machine. Later I had more opportunities to show leadership, which was fulfilling, but there were plenty who floundered quietly.",

      "text": "It can go both ways. I think you want to assess the risks and benefits of both types of labs and see what current students in each lab have to say about things. You can score big in either kind of lab and there's no de-facto reason why you should stick with one or the other.\n\nHere are the risks of either type of lab as I see them. This might give you thinks to look out for, but none of these are necessarily true of all new vs. old labs:\n\nEstablished PIs can have more resources and potentially a better pathway to success given past experience (such as, they have  established lab personnel who can support new students). But there's the added risk that some established PI will have zero time for new students and will rely on others to do all the mentoring. When it comes time to publish you might find yourself as a junior author because you're making a smaller contribution to a bigger whole rather than having projects that are 100% yours to run with. Worth knowing this in advance.\n\nNew PIs are hungry and potentially willing to throw resources at new students in the interest of kickstarting things. They might also have a set of new projects ready to go that you could dive into and really make your own. But they are less likely to want to take risks on something new and unfamiliar. Sometimes there's a risk that having never mentored a student you are in a weird spot where they are not able to lead you along as effectively as you might want (but then again more senior people can be terrible mentors too). A junior person might also be aiming for tenure or promotion at all costs, such that they will lean hard on you to do things they see as paying off quickly, so there again your project(s) will likely be shaped by that. For that same reason a junior person might see themselves as competing with trainees for author credit and you might find yourself getting pushed aside when it comes time to write up your work.",

      "text": "I similarly chose between a brand-new lab and an established lab for my PhD. I went with the new lab - myself and another grad student were our PI's first 2 PhD students to join the lab. We started with us 2, 1 postdoc, and a technician. Today, we have 4 PhD students from 3 different programs, 2 postdocs, a technician, and each of us supervise at least 1 undergraduate student. We all passed our qualifying exams with flying colors, lab recently received its first 5-year Big Grant from the NIH, and 1 of us has received an F31 NRSA fellowship, with the rest of us waiting to hear about our recently submitted proposals (fingers crossed!). I'd say that maybe while some of these milestones would have occurred faster in a more established lab, we've had no shortage of successes. \n\nI chose this lab despite it being new because I have a large degree of intellectual freedom in my project while also receiving a lot of support from my PI, and I preferred the day-to-day work environment and model organisms used. On the flip side, my committee is comprised of  'high profile' senior tenured faculty in my sub-field who are experts in the family of diseases I study. This means I have immediate access for e.g. collaborations with these labs, a Big Name co-sponsor for my NIH fellowship applications (or letters of rec, etc), and additional support for networking should I want to be introduced to someone my PI might not know personally, etc. \n\nI personally feel very well supported and like I have a good balance of freedom/exploration in my own work while also having a PI who is available to meet or discuss data frequently. The downside is that it takes longer to get things up-and-running in a brand new lab. That being said, it has been really cool to watch our progress over the past few years, and now that we're at a point with multiple students running independent projects in different areas, the pace of cool new data just keeps picking up as we all work towards publication. My project is 100% my own and I've really enjoyed being able to establish new technology in the lab that we can all benefit from, as well as collaborating with other labs to learn new techniques to advance my work. \n\nFinally, I'll say that my PI had several years experience in industry before returning to academia, and was experienced in managing people before running his own lab. We do quarterly mutual performance evals (mentor/mentee), maintain plans for \\~6mo out on what I want to accomplish, and talk frequently about career development. This is not the case with all new PIs.",

I used to think I wanted to join an established lab.\n\nHowever, I joined a very new lab almost 5 years ago despite everyone giving me advice against it. I\u2019m so glad I did because it\u2019s been the best possible fit for me. My PI is extremely motivated to publish and do good work. He was also super involved in treating me and my fellow lab members at the start which instilled some great habits. Since we were new we got to establish a lot of new methods in the lab so it is a good feeling to have experience in many different types of techniques too.",

Your chances of getting a career changing F31 fellowship are way better with the senior guy.\n\nAlso be warry of the successful new PI thats been around 3 to 4 years. There is a decent chance they will take a promotion and move Universities around year 7, which would land right in the middle of your progress. \n\nA PI that just moved  to your school and was promoted to  associate professorship, or an older full professor that isn't going anywhere any time soon are safe bets to hedge against the lab move chaos.\n\nI vote for the senior guy assuming the have a reasonably good track record.",

This usually seems to translate as the students do get more facetime with the PI, but it's less constructive because the PI is still new to this as well. It seems that students in these labs may be more likely to not pass the qualifying exam and/or take longer to graduate because of it.   \n   \nPersonally I would choose a more established lab as long as you get along well with the PI",

      "text": "I joined a new lab many years ago. Speaking from my experience, joining a new lab means you probably will have to do a lot of ground work to get things started, i.e. building test facility, developing test methods, developing data collection / processing tools, etc, and a lot of these don't translate directly to publications or your research directly. However, you do get to learn a lot of new things that you otherwise probably wouldn't have learned had you joined a well-established lab because someone had done most of this for you. I will also add that seeing how we built an empty space in the basement of the building to a proper lab and other students after me benefiting from my work did give me a sense of satisfaction. \n\nI was lucky that my PI was a great person and he spent a lot of time in the lab with his students to build the lab, so we got to know each other very well, and he also bought us a lot of pizza for dinner. But I've also heard stories of people joining a new lab with an awful PI who didn't care about their students. So it's a bit of gamble.\n\nLastly, I'm not sure what field you're in and what's the average size of research groups in your field but 30+ students sound a lot imo. So you might want to take that into consideration because a group this big means the PI might not be able to dedicate a lot of time to each student. \n\nGood luck",

      "text": "I was my PIs first student. It sucked not having grad students above me, but I do see, now that the lab has grown from 3 people to over 15, how I had greater access to them than most the others likely ever will. We're three years in and it's still fairly chaotic, though a lot of that was likely due to trying to start a lab just prior to a pandemic. They are unbelievably busy, so it can be hard to get ahold of them sometimes, but in general, younger faculty put in more hours and are more pleasant to work with, so my PI always finds time. \n\nMy progress as an independent researcher was somewhat hindered as a consequence of being in a new lab. I would have classes that required pre-existing datasets, which my lab didn't have. I had no frame of reference to know what I should be doing or how I should be approaching certain questions. It was also my first time scripting, working in neuroscience, or on the topics I was studying, so it was A LOT of self-motivation and teaching myself; I'd argue more than even the average PhD student. I dedicated a lot of time to developing data processing pipelines that other grad students in other labs took for granted. I was the backbone of a lot of projects that were important to the lab, but not necessarily directly my interests, in a way that the newer grad students in the lab never will have to be. \n\nI do think I'll be working with my PI for years to come (I hope at least) but I'm not sure the same will be the case for the others in my lab, or even others in other established labs. It also helps my PI and I aren't too far off in age and get along well interpersonally. I'm not sure that would be the case if I were working with older faculty. Also we just do much cooler shit. We'd never do half the experiments that we do in more established labs, I think, because there's a greater pressure to take high risk high reward approaches to make a name for yourself in the field. \n\nOngoing problems we have are acquiring grant funding, recognition/connections, data processing pipelines for novel techniques, and resources. I'm in the process of building wikis, centralized script libraries, manuals and all these things for other future students but it's a very slow process. \n\nFrom what you described, it sounds to me like the lab is not that new, so you likely wouldn't even be dealing with a lot of the stuff I highlighted. In retrospect, this really was the best choice for me, and I can't imagine having gone to another lab.",
