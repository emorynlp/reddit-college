  "title:": "Love research, love the culture in academia; Hate teaching - is there a place for me?",
  "text": "It's been slowly dawning on me that at best, I merely tolerate teaching. It's been a little disappointing to discover that since I used to really like teaching continuing ed/college classes to working adults. But I'm currently TA-ing at a public university and it's an absolute nightmare. I find that there's such a huge difference in student motivation and attitude that I needed to seriously reconsider whether the \"teaching\" part of professor-hood is something I'd want.\n\nOn the other hand, I ***LOVE*** research. Theory exploration, data, the whole shebang. Heck, even the REB approval process can be fun sometimes! There are days when my brain is still zooming at 3am because I'm wrestling with a particularly gnarly theoretical knot and I love that so much. Grad school has been such a unique experience because (somewhat unexpectedly) this is literally the happiest I have ever been. I love the work. I love the lifestyle. I kinda...just love everything and want to stay here forever.\n\nBut if I dislike teaching that much, where can I go? I'm not in STEM so my field won't have a large industry research equivalent. I feel like if I love research this much, my only path forward is to suck it up and deal with the challenges of getting a TT position and learning to make the best out of hating to teach. Has anyone ever been in a similar position?\n\n**EDIT**: Whoa! Thanks so much for all the thoughtful and helpful responses everyone. I'm going to slowly go through and reply, but thank you - you've given me lots to reflect on and look into. Also, sorry that I wasn't specific about my discipline - it's hard to define since I'm a little bit interdisciplinary (but I hate saying that because it sounds so pretentious). Officially, my degree specialization is business (not an MBA though) but I have my fingers in a bunch of different research pies across the psychology/sociology/economics/poli sci/comp sci literature (although you could also argue that the field of business technically *is* just a combination of all of those anyway)...so a bit difficult to nail down. Thought I'd just stick to the \"social science\" label for my field haha.",

I've met some professors that are well-regarded enough by their institution that they've managed to negotiate that. And I've heard from them that it's far less frustrating than teaching undergrads, especially at a large public school. And grad students tend to want to participate in research, so you might be able to even orient your student interaction around your own research.",

The college (within the university) that this grad program was housed in definitely prioritized the grad students over undergrad because the grad program was so well ranked that it brought a lot of prestige (so the institution had a pretty big incentive to offer faculty perks like teaching only grad students or a minimal teaching load in exchange for flashy research)\n\nEdit: maybe you should look for institutions with that type of program structure? One where the graduate prog. is more highly ranked than the undergrad? Then perhaps they'd be willing to tempt good faculty in with the promise of a negotiated teaching commitment.\n\nAlso, best of luck! Your enthusiasm for good research is awesome :)",

My impression with government and industry types of research roles is that you have to only stick to what the institution wants you to research so there's less flexibility. But I might be totally wrong - what's your experience?\n\nOne of the reasons why I'm loving the whole academia life right now is the huge flexibility to research whatever catches my eye (obviously within certain limits and dependent on actually getting grants for it). And as I edited into my post later - I'm a bit   of a crow with topics/disciplines and everything looks shiny to me haha. So I've loved being able to completely pivot and explore new areas while collaborating with people outside my discipline.

The hordes of drones in the R1, many of whom openly stated they were there primarily for social reasons (i.e. frat life), were the worst. So maybe look to different types of institutions?\n\nThat said, there are of course many jobs in research that aren't connected to teaching at all. Think tanks, research institutes, and many federal agencies hire non-STEM researchers. Quite a few of my Ph.D. cohort are in such jobs and most seem to like their work. Think Brookings, RAND, Bechtel, etc. as well as the wide range of research jobs with agencies of all stripes (Labor, Commerce, NOAA, USDA, Interior, and of course the DOD).",

The average student is checked out by the 3rd week and resentful by the 5th. \n\n200-level classes are a little better.

So other professors will happily teach those courses. \n\nI don't want to push academia because there's a lot that's wrong with it.

Bring in your research so you are covering something you care about.\n2) in a big General Ed/freshman/Intro class there are always people who don\u2019t see the point, but you can bring some of them around.

My favorite comments run along the lines of, \u201cI\u2019ll never look at movies the same way again.\u201d I\u2019m not saying this to brag, but I also generate lots of majors through the \u201cnon-majors\u201d section (same content  as the majors section but few\u2014if any\u2014students who know they want to major.\n4) The number of TT appointments is shrinking and people who love teaching (or those who can\u2019t land TT job) are more and more frequently ending up with term or ranked-term appointments. At my school it\u2019s a 5-year contract with 80% teaching and 20% service. So, there Is no required research at all, but I do still publish, go to conferences, hold the title of assistant professor, etc. \n4) GOOD NEWS FOR YOU: With more and more people being hired on term appointments, these are often the folks teaching the big intro courses and other lower division courses. At present, all the lower-division (freshmen and sophomore) courses are taught by me or other term. All the TT and tenured faculty teach ONLY the upper-division classes for majors and minors. There is a WORLD of difference between students in their first two years vs the last two.\n5) TEACHING vs RESEARCH: I am in a very small department (6 faculty members and lots of affiliate faculty in other programs offering relevant courses). Since I\u2019ve been here, the only people teaching Intro have been term appointments or lectures (hired for 1 year at a time). I also teach the first film history course which had majors and some minors. Teaching silent cinema (1895-1927) and classical Hollywood+ European cinema of the \u201830s, \u201840s, and \u201850s to 21st century students is a real challenge but, because of the research I have done on this topic I have been able to really jazz it up and keep it interesting to me. Also, things I only originally studied to enhance that course ended up turning into research interests, conference presentations, and papers. \n\nCONCLUSION:\n1) Don\u2019t judge whether you will like teaching in the long run by this GTA experience, especially since you have enjoyed teaching in other contexts. \n2) If you are very research-oriented and work to publish, go to conferences, network (etc.), then you may well be able to land a TT job. You might start out teaching some lower -division classes at first. But, chances are, as you move towards tenure, you would be teaching upper-division and grad classes. \n3) I\u2019m assuming you are having to use a modified format (All online, hybrid, in person but with social distancing). Teaching \u201clive\u201d to people wearing masks sitting 6 feet apart is BIZARRE. I had no idea how much it would bother me. Don\u2019t judge by a COVID semester in any case.\n\nWow, that went on very long. I rarely have insomnia but this is one of those nights. \n\nBest of luck!",
