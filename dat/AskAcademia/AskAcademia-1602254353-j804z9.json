  "title:": "Out of school for several years; interested in pursuing a PhD. Any suggestions on how best to proceed?",
  "text": "Hello all -\n\nI completed two undergrad degrees in 2010 and an MLIS in 2016. My undergrad degrees were in Art History and French Language & Literature and my MLIS focus was on archives and preservation. I am located in the U.S.\n\nI pursued an MLIS as a compromise to pursuing a PhD in Art History because I was always told and was under the belief that a PhD in Art History \u201cjust isn\u2019t worth it\u201d and the job prospects with an MLIS were much higher. However, I was never 100% happy with the MLIS program and despite many applications, interviews, and years of searching, I never landed a library position - not even to reshelve books.\n\nI simply cannot shake the desire to pursue a PhD in Art History to become a college-level instructor/professor. The only problem is I was always super quiet in undergrad and grad school and didn\u2019t make connections, and I am now several years out of school, so academic recommendation letters are now out of the question. However, my undergrad GPAs were fairly decent at graduation (3.85 for Art History, 3.71 for French). Does anyone have any suggestions on how I should go forward in order to have any chances of being successful in my application processes?\n\nThank you!",

She has one now, but it\u2019s not secure (due to the pandemic) and it\u2019s in a different state than where her husband live/works. It\u2019s not easy. So, if you want to do a PhD just to learn - cool. But I would be careful/realistic about assuming it will get you a job in the end. (Source: Unemployed person with 2 MAs and a dual PhD).",

I wouldn\u2019t change those decisions at all, but I have to take these into consideration, too.

      "text": "I took 3 years off between undergrad and my MFA and then 12 years between that and my PhD (undergrad in humanities, MFA in the arts (obviously), PhD in social science/field-specific history). I got the PhD because I decided I wanted to be a professor and I looked at it as sort of a professional degree (like you need a JD to be a lawyer) but in the end, I can\u2019t believe how much I learned. Hard but very rewarding experience, even with the pitfalls you hear about in doctoral programs. \n\nIt took some work to find a program that thought I had something to offer and I did it entirely on my own because I had no connections with my undergrad and no one in my master\u2019s has a doctorate so there was no one to ask for help. I contacted a lot of directors of graduate programs to recap my background and ask if their program and I would be a good fit. A lot said no. Some said I\u2019d need another master\u2019s (no thank you!). But I found enough that were welcoming that in the end I got to choose between 2 very good programs. \n\nI got recommendations from employers who attested to my work ethic, how I\u2019d be an asset to any organization, my commitment to learning, that kind of thing. \n\nIt\u2019s obviously a risk because if what tot want is to teach, like I did, then what happens if no position is available or you don\u2019t get hired. I figured worse comes to worse, I could go back to my old life but at least I would have done all that I could do to pursue my goal. Turns out I did get a job, and the joke is I would have thought this was the perfect job before I went for my PhD but my time there showed me what other options were available in academia and now I want one of those. But I\u2019m teaching in college and that\u2019s what I did the whole thing for so I chose to consider the process a success. \n\nHope this helped! Good luck!",

I have AA's in Humanities & Behavioral Science and a Bachelor's in Philosophy which I received in 2017.  I want to move on to a Masters or PhD, but I have not taken the GRE and my math skills are at least a decade out of date.

I didn\u2019t need the GREs for my masters (it had a portfolio review) and even if I had, they would have been completely out of date by the time I decided to go back. I spent an entire summer teaching myself math. I bought all the GRE prep books and literally started with \u201cwhat is an integer?\u201d I worked nights at the time and 2-3 times a week, I\u2019d go to the park with my book and my notebook and pencil and just practice (got a great tan that summer). I made flash cards and I\u2019m lucky enough to have a friend who\u2019s a high school tutor and I set up an appointment with him twice to go over things I just couldn\u2019t get. Then I took the test in September. It sucked. And I ended up doing... ok. In the end, I got into 2 schools, rejected from one (looking back, it would not have been a good fit and their reliance on GRE scores was only one symptom of that) and I actually chose not to apply to a 4th, partially because of my scores and partially because I would have had to learn 3 languages and also sort of cobble together my own program. I was leaning towards not applying, and my scores convinced me not to. \n\nSo, in sum, yes it was definitely an obstacle. I hated every minute of it. But like I said above, I had an end goal so I just buckled down & did it. \n\nAlso it did prep me for the 2 statistics classes I had to take as part of my PhD program. Those were also painful but at least I know how to format a table in APA now and I have a passing familiarity with statistical terminology. It\u2019s probably clear that I am not a math person!",

Two professors I didn\u2019t keep in touch with were more than happy to write recommendations for my PhD application 5 years after I graduated. When I emailed them, I made sure to include a lot of information about what I studied when I was in their classes, what I had done since, and my interests for the PhD. This not only helps jog their memory but also gives them content to include in your letter.",

Not sure about your particular field, but the folks that actually make it to a tenure track faculty position are very few compared to the people who have a PhD. It's a big, multi year commitment. Take a look at whatever statistics are out there for your field and make sure you're comfortable with the outcomes.",

Higher ed is burning down around us and art programs are closing by the day.  The faculty job market in art is abysmal right now - -We hired someone for an NTT faculty job for 37k a year in graphic design last year before the covid crisis hit (this is a job at a teaching institution with a heavy teaching, service, and advising load and lots of underprepared college students), and let me tell you, we got an ungodly number of applications from people who were adjuncting for shit pay with excellent credentials (some of whom had been doing so for like 20 years!).  Now? forget about it - our Uni  might lay off all our FT NTT faculty this year, another small liberal arts college nearby just shuttered their entire art program, the state uni in our city got rid of NTT faculty and raised TT faculty teaching loads, the regional college about 50 mins. away cut almost all of its programs in the arts and sciences, including art.   It is a massacre.",

      "text": "Take classes. I know that sounds simplistic but take classes. I had a decade between my masters and starting a PhD, and although the literary and language world had changed as far as graduate education was concerned, professors still valued students that worked their asses off. I spent some cash and took graduate courses as part of continuing education branch of two R1 universities. My work showed those professors I was serious and help me develop a pretty specific research program. They wrote letters / the extra year was worth it several times over because I was fully funded with fellowships and could pick and chose when and where in the university I wanted to teach. I recognize that I was lucky as hell, but even in the midst of this Covid madness I am so grateful to be able to teach something I love to students who want to do the work. Don\u2019t rush it. Don\u2019t listen to all the negativity about academia. But take advantage of the fact you will probably be older and more experienced than your competition. Also recognize that if luck is hard work plus opportunity it will take a lot of luck for this to happen. Don\u2019t go into it without the psychological and fiscal stamina to not enjoy the journey. I think it is liberating to recognize right up front that the experience - the hard work of working your ass off on something most folks don\u2019t give a shit about - that experience is all you could have.  We have 400 applications for each of our openings, and maybe 50 can do the gig and for our last opening there were 20 I really could see working with - humanities and fine arts is a hard, hard, row to hoe, and it will get a whole lot worse in the years to come. I do wish you the best, and hope it works out.",

I interviewed in mostly public libraries (my specialization was museum archives, and I think it may have been too specific), and I was always either over- or under-qualified.

I even went the corporate archives route and wasn\u2019t successful there, either. I also did 4 internships while working on my MLIS, but the connections there were hit-or-miss due to situations beyond my or their control.",

      "text": "I was also out of undergrad for a long time before deciding to pursue more degrees. The norm of recommendation letters coming from faculty is partly due to the way that most students progress through their degrees with no break, which means they often have no one *but* faculty to ask. I had several folks I had worked with outside of academia in my field write me letters about how my real-world experiences had prepared me for grad school, how I was as a colleague and collaborator, etc. If your other materials are strong, and if you emphasize your \u201cnon-traditional\u201d path in your personal essay, most programs will actually see a long break in the real world outside of academia as a big advantage. My non-academic jobs were actually hugely instrumental in me getting my current faculty position. First step\u2014internalize the knowledge that this can be a true benefit to you in your career; second step\u2014get folks who know you well to write about that in their letters.",
