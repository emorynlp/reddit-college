  "text": "I gave myself till the end of this week to gear up one last time in submitting my work after been unproductive for a month, but sadly I failed. After long, careful consideration, I have decided to send out that long email detailing my mental issues in juggling pandemic, loneliness and PhD to my supervisors. It was nerve-wracking and humiliating as I was always the strong one, but it feels like a heavy rock has been lifted off my chest at the same time. I\u2019m not sure how are they going to process this, but I\u2019m gonna keep an open mind about the options or whether or not I have one. I\u2019ve taken the first step of the many steps that I\u2019ll be taking after this, so I will breathe for now before facing the next one.",

Relating to your story, I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m not alone in this. I have avoided my supervisors for weeks too, but I couldn\u2019t go on doing that. I woke up feeling anxious every day and going to bed feeling the same. I started questioning my passion and career path - I become more and more disinterested in doing this. I couldn\u2019t go on living like that so I decided to just write that email and send it last night. I need some time off to clear my head and figure out what\u2019s best for me. It\u2019s scary though, as my program is funded and it might be cancelled if I decided to take a leave or extend, but I don\u2019t want to feel stuck anymore. Things may be tougher after this, but for now I\u2019m gonna take it easy. After sending that email, for the first time in weeks, I managed to go to bed and wake up early. It makes me realised that sometimes we just need to admit our weakness to feel better. I hope this will be the start to more good things. \n\nThank you for your kind words.\n\nStay safe. \ud83d\udc95",

I felt loads better when I finally talked to my supervisor, and he was actually really chill about it. I got a month and half\u2019s extension, but we\u2019ve also discussed that I might need a whole extra semester, and that that\u2019s totally fine. It really helped take the pressure of, and even though it\u2019s a slow grind, and I\u2019m still not being super productive, which is frustrating, I actually feel more motivated now that I\u2019m not anxious all the time. Obviously it\u2019s more complicated in your case because of funding (I\u2019m in a program with like 60 students, so all I have to worry about is not qualifying for a student loan if I\u2019m too far behind, but I think I have just enough credits that I can take an extra semester if need be), but it\u2019s still really important to put your own well-being first. Hope it all works out for you!",

I hope your supervisor is understanding too. They are humans too, having issues of their own I'm sure, and in these crazy times it *should* be the norm to be lenient. Congratulations on sending the email, that takes a lot of courage! Fingers crossed that things get better for you, both for your work situation and mental health. Take care and be good to yourself :)",

Not to be a downer, but worse case scenario...\n\nI did the same thing with my PI last week. Explained that I was stressed out by him asking for manuscript updates every few days with all the edits corrected from him days before, in addition to edits he makes during our weekly Zoom meeting. I told him if we set a deadline (end of the month) that I would have a great, non-typo'd version for him to completely edit. I won't go into details, but we argued via email all week (which stressed me out even more). We eventually agreed that I could have until the end of the May to finish (6 days away), but I wasted a whole week arguing with him about it and being so upset about the situation that I lost more time on it than if he had just said \"Ok.\"\n\nHopefully every else has mentors who are supportive in these awful times of uncertainty and best wishes for everyone to be safe and healthy.",
