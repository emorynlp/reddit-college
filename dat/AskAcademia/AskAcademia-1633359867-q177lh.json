  "text": "I have had my first conference abstract accepted last year before Covid hit, and the conference recently moved its dates to the end of the year. They would like a pre-circulation of the conference paper with the possibility of it being published in a journal. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe rough word count is 5,000 +, and I have until mid-November to have it done. I am a little nervous because I am currently writing up my thesis -I am a bit behind because of mental health reasons, I have bounced back, but I am still behind- and this is too good an opportunity to miss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am wondering if there are any time management tips I can glean from r/AskAcademia. What I have so far is this:\n\nOffice hours = 08:30 - 19:30 (8hrs of thesis writing + 2-3 hrs of conference paper writing).\n\nWeekend hours = 09:00 - 15:00 (dedicated totally to conference paper).",

      "text": "You need to start by figuring out everything you need to do for these two papers. Look at how much is actually writing vs what is background reading, data analysis, creating tables and charts, outlining your narrative, importing citations, etc. And within those, break down what you need to do into chunks of work that you can achieve in 1-2 hours. List out your figures you need to make, outline your papers so you know what sub-sections you need to write, make lists of the types of papers you need to read.\n\nWriting is typically the hardest part for most people, so figure out what times per day you are actually sharp enough to write well-crafted sentences in a well-flowing narrative and block those off for writing. Think similarly about how much brain power and focus you need for everything on your list and devote your \"best\" hours to your highest tasks.\n\nAlso make sure you are taking breaks. Ideally ones that involve going or at least looking outside/away from a screen, eating nourishing food, and most importantly disengaging your brain so it has time to wander and be creative.",

          "text": "This is excellent advice, time management has not been my forte so I'm seeking to rectify that. My paper is thankfully a textual analysis, so don't need to do any consent forms or interviewees or to book a lab. \n\nThe breaking stuff down into productive chunks is a good shout, one of the comments mentioned something similar with word counts + accountability deadlines.\n\nSo I have been reflecting on the comments and I will get the parts I know I will struggle done first, and set some dedicates time during periods where I know I'm most productive and crack on. \n\nThanks for all the advice, time management is something I'm trying to improve.",

      "text": "Without knowing your field, I can still pretty easily say that your estimated schedule is unrealistic and will almost undoubtedly lead to burnout. Even worse, it will not lead to a completed thesis or submitted conference paper either.\n\nTime management doesn't mean adding more time to get something done, it means knowing when and how you can make the most of your time. Recognise what time of day you generally write best (and recognise that this might fluctuate too), and try to carve out that time JUST for writing, and then add some time for reviewing and editing. Try to set personal deadlines, and if that doesn't work, set up accountability deadlines with a colleague or your supervisor (e.g., I will send you the first draft of my paper by third week of October). \n\nThere are lots of tips out there I'm sure (using timers for focus, have writing \"retreat\" days, setting word count goals, making small goals rather than big overwhelming ones, etc) but ultimately, you will need to see which ones work for you. And for goodness sakes, please take the weekends off!!",

          "text": "Thank you for the detailed response, I really appreciate it. I say and thought about the comment and ultimately I have to admit you are correct that adding more time doesn't equate to more work being done. \n\nFinding the time I work best for writing is the best bet and accountability deadlines are a good shout for me, I work better when I have a deadline.",
