I also get actual vacation and sick time, and a retirement account. \n\nIn terms of culture it feels a lot more like a real job - I mostly work standard office hours with little to no nights and weekends.",

      "text": "I've worked at a few national labs.  It depends on the lab.  \n\nSome labs have user facilities, where people go to do research and the research staff is there to help users and also get to do their own research.  That's definitely not slow because users usually want to get in and out and get nice data.  It's also nice because you get to collaborate with a lot of people and work on lots of cool projects.\n\nIn others you might get to do your own research, like Los Alamos is known for being one of the birth places of nuclear weapons but now they do a lot of other research on all sorts of topics.\n\nOne issue is that staff members at national labs typically can't get their own grad students (but you can get postdocs), so research groups at national labs tend to be smaller and staff members actually have to spend time doing real research (as opposed to professors at universities who might never go into the lab).\n\nAnother issue is, where does the funding come from?  There's no teaching at a National Lab, so researchers' salaries aren't guaranteed by the department.  It can be harder to compete for grants because lab research is often more expensive than a university because the overhead and salaries are usually higher.  And you're often not allowed to apply for NSF grants.  So scientists may frequently struggle for funding.  When that happens, they often need to find small pieces of a large number of grants, which means they're sometimes working on six different projects.  And it's not spread out across their research group (they don't have grad students; they may have one postdoc) -- they need to personally be working on six different projects.  They also have internal grants (LDRDs), which can be nice but can also cause a lot of politics.\n\nOverall, I really liked the national lab environment as long as funding was taken care of.  They usually have a lot of great facilities and equipment, great colleagues, and you can really just go to work and get stuff done.  But they're not always so great if you need to constantly worry about getting a fraction of someone's grant to pay your salary.\n\nThe people I've worked with have always been great.  That may be due to my own self-selection.  I have heard stories about people who just don't get stuff done but manage to stick around, but I've never needed to work with them.",

One of the primary tasks of professors is to write proposals for research.  It just seems insane to me that so many of the top researchers in the world spend so much of their time trying to get more money to do research instead of actually doing/overseeing research.  National labs do have similar issues, but the nature of the mission of the lab usually means that people don't have to spend quite as much time writing proposals.",

My PhD advisor was a prolific grant-writer - the thing with him was that he told me it was actually his favourite part of academia, he just really got a kick out of writing a wish-list of results he wanted to produce and then convincing someone that it was worth funding. He had good relationships with project managers, and even got me to present to them and get feedback on my work.That was the most positive take on the system I've ever seen.",
