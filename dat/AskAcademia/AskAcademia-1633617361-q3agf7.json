  "text": "Hey everyone, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a second-year PhD-student in law at a prestigious European university and recently I have recently been exploring options to do a three-month research visit in the US as a visiting researcher or scholar. I would love to hear what you guys think would be a good starting option to know more about these possibilities, or would you have any suggestions? I am currently so overwhelmed by the many universities that I don't know my starting point. \n\nMy research considers constitutional law/separation of powers and I would love to be able to 1) join/ or gain access to a group of researchers that focus on this topic, 2) continue to do my own research, and 3) follow a course or so on American constitutional law. \n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated! Thanks!",

D. students themselves to coordinate this as they don't have the \"weight\" to make the connections themselves. If you do, awesome, but it does not look like it.\n\nI would speak to your supervisor and see what contacts they have in the US and take it from there.",

              "text": "Personally I'd suggest you turn this around: don't ask for suggestions, come up with suggestions and ask for feedback and further ideas.  Taking initiative and ownership of your own education and development is really important during a PhD, and especially during opportunities like this one.  \n\nSo ask yourself, for example: who writes papers that you reference a lot?  Who uses methods or approaches you'd love to be able to try out but can't learn quickly on your own?  Who has a novel perspective you'd like to incorporate into your work?  Who's doing some of the best work in the US on your topic?  What groups in the US did you consider applying to for a PhD but didn't?  And who is in a city that you can see yourself living in for a short time?\n\nYou must already have a list of people who qualify for criteria 1 (a group of researchers that focus on this topic) from your surveys of the literature.  Look at these again, look up the websites of the profs and see what they're doing currently, and make a long list.  Bring this to your supervisor and colleagues and ask if they know any of these people or have feedback, then turn it into a shorter list and start applyinig criteria (2) and (3).",

If you do not know, ask your supervisor and colleagues for some names.\n\nThere are various schemes to get funding for such visits such as your own country, your university your are currently studying, the university you want to visit, or even the country you want to visit. Usually, this information can easily be found online.",

You might want to look at your university\u2019s and see if they have offers or support for this sort of thing. Look into lectureships. These are usually for PhD students and are often organized via bilateral contracts between partner universities.",
