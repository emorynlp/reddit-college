      "text": "I'm at a different Max Plank. \n\nThere's so many MPIs that I've noticed there's a range within the MPIs. You get the top ones (in Munich, Potsdam, etc) that everyone agrees are pretty great. Then you get the mid range ones which are ok, but maybe the environment is not that great, or the infrastructure is kinda not really there yet, but it's slowly improving.\n\nAnd then frankly? You the shit-tier ones, where bullying and harassment are the norm, people are miserable and eventually there's a high profile scandal that's written up in Science, Nature or the local newspapers. \n\nThat being said? There's a ton of money and the MPI network is pretty great if you use it. Also, I'm pretty happy with the PhD-Net and what they do for students (we recently got a pretty good raise!!)\n\nThere's been a few high profile cases of bullies at the Max Plank. Maybe look into the supervisor you'll have, check to see if the department you're in has a good reputation. Talk to the grad students. Do they seem happy? What is their work schedule? What are their hobbies/relationships outside of the lab? Is it mostly foreigners? I ask this because if you're a foreigner it's nice to have people that can relate to adjusting to a new country; on the flip side, a high profile MPI bully straight up said he doesn't have Germans in his department because they will actually use their vacation days because Germans know they are entitled to them, so... \n\nIf the supervisor doesn't seem to keen to have you talking to the other students before you accept something, that's a red flag. \n\nThere's also some not high profile cases of shitty supervisors that I know about but I doubt they'll ever get written up. One thing you can check is how many students your supervisor has had, and how many have graduated with a PhD. A low graduation rate could be a red-flag. What is the turnover rate of the staff there? \n\nAlso, i know several people at my Institute that have had issues registering at the local university as students. The MPI is a research institute, so it itself doesn't grant you the PhD. I was surprised at how little support my particular MPI gives students on registering as a student. I get the impression that this MPI and the local university cannot agree on who to take in as a student, and it's left to the student to juggle this. So I know several ppl who are just not registered there, and instead made an arrangement with a different university (sometimes elsewhere in Europe). This will impact your graduation requirements, so make sure it's clear what your funding and your requirements are. \n\nSorry if this sounds cynical. I guess I haven't had a great time at my MPI, but I do think things are improving.\n\nAs for Dresden, I've visited a couple of times, and it's a pretty fun city. Great stuff within the city, and beautiful surroundings if you're into hiking. That region can be pretty right wing and xenophobic, but I don't think that extends into the city so much. \n\nOverall, I've enjoyed living in Germany, but I kinda wish my institute was in a bigger city, so I definitely would prefer somewhere like Dresden over where I live.",

          "text": "I had no clue about these variations between the different MPIs, thanks for sharing all you know about the place!\n\nIn my case, the lab arranged multiple 1-hour long virtual meetings where they had 2 lab members in each session. So I got to speak to everyone in the lab. It was really nice, because many times your question gets answered by a few members in a large group meeting. But this way, both people answered each question every time, giving their own own opinions (it's always interesting when they vary :D ).\n\nI didn't even know the registration at the local university could be an issue. In my case, it's done with TU Dresden and they have the PhD programme under a joint umbrella programme as well. So hoping everything turns out okay!",

I've been to the institute a single time in 2013 for a practical, seemed very equipped but short on office space at the time.\n\nDresden is considered one of the most beautiful historic towns in Germany. It is very rich in classical culture, especially classical music. Popular tourist destination in general. Rents are still affordable in Dresden so that a PhD salary should enable you to have proper flat, not only a room in a shared apartement as in Berlin/Hamburg/Munich. The public transport is also among the best I've seen, affordable and gets you everywhere in town.\n\nOn the flipside, there is a minority of openly racist people in the town. Friend of mine is Indian and has told me of several times when he was insulted in public, in particular late at night.",
