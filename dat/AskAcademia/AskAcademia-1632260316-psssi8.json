  "title:": "Advice for getting back into academia after years away?",
  "text": "I am an anthropologist and I got my masters in 2017. Iv always known I wanted to get my PhD and work in academics but now that it has been 5 years since I was at university I feel like it's a glaring weak point in applying for PhD. \n\nIv started planning and research for my proposal. I have applied to lecturer positions at my local university and community College but again time away from academic pursuits has hindered my prospects. \n\nSo any help brainstorming other things I can do to add more recent academic experience to my CV would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEDIT: Would making my own blog to document the research I do in developing my proposal be worthwhile? \n\nFor anyone who does or has been involved in accepting PhD applications what are the factors most valued for a successful application besides the quality of the proposal itself? \n\nAre letters of recommendation the next most important or relevant experience on my CV, etc?",

      "text": "I think your misconception here is thinking that teaching is what you need to start a PhD program. It is not. They aren't going to expect you to have taught if you've been out of academia.\n\nThey are going to be much more interested in your research proposal, your evidence of intellectual seriousness and maturity, and things of that nature. I would invest a lot more time in those things \u2014 and finding people who are willing to work with you on them \u2014 than trying to get an unlikely and very-low-level teaching position. \n\nIt's hard to give specific advise, but presumably you wrote a thesis in 2017. What became of it? I would work on trying to turn that into a paper you could give at a conference as an \"independent scholar\" (read: not someone currently in academia). That will be difficult enough, but the experience of doing that will probably tell you if you really want to work in academia, give you an opportunity to dive back into research questions, and potentially create the sorts of academic networks that would be useful to creating a viable PhD application.\n\nAgain, you are probably not going to get teaching work with your present degree, even at a community college. And even if you did, I don't think it would help your PhD application as much as you think it would.",

          "text": "Yeah I knew getting any teaching job would be hard but at least locally there are a lot of lecturers with only masters degrees so I thought it worth a shot. \n\nThank you for suggesting making my dissertation into a paper to present, I didn't realize that could be done if you weren't associated with an institution. I will definitely look into that further. \n\nThe teaching idea, in my mind, was to give me the opportunity to make connections for help with developing a high quality proposal and gain quality recommendations. Other ways to make contacts and gain any kind of recent academic experience is brainstorming gold so thanks again!",

              "text": "Just one more note. You will definitely have some difficulty presenting it if you are not affiliated with an institution; it's not impossible, but it's harder to be taken seriously. Either way, you will need a viable writing sample for the PhD applications, and this is a great thing to work on towards that end. \n\nAs for making connections \u2014 you won't easily do that through low-level teaching, especially at a Community College, etc. Talking to people at conferences is probably a better bet.",

      "text": "I chaired Social Sciences at a state college. If you don't have teaching experience you would not make the short list for a lecturer position. However, I would consider you for an adjunct position, particularly if I got in a crack at the last minute (needing an extra Anthro class, illness, or somebody leaving at the last minute). Doing well as an adjunct for a couple of semesters would then make you competitive for a lecturer position if a line opened up.\n\nSo, I'd suggest that you start with adjunct applications at a CC or 4 year college.",

I'm talking about gaining experience as an adjunct that might then make you eligible for full time employment as a lecturer.\n\nIf you google, \"adjunct positions at the community college of denver\" you'll see that they currently have 5 adjunct positions available. The search will also show a number of other adjunct positions available at other Denver colleges/universities.\n\nTeaching grade school or high school wouldn't make you a viable candidate for a lecturer position on my campus.",
