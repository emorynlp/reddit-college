  "text": "I know the field is bleak. And I know people with PhDs are desperate for jobs so they apply to these positions all the time.\n\nI'm just a high school teacher with a master's, but I am about to publish a novel. I taught college as a grad student and I liked it a lot. Teaching high school is honestly so different. It really sucks. \n\nI know I'll never get accepted as a professor at a four year institution without a PhD, but do I even stand a chance at community colleges or lecturer positions?\n\nFilling out all the applications is exhausting. It's hard to keep going if it's all futile.",

What they will care about is your teaching experience. And if you are savvy, you can convince them that your high school experience will be a great asset - a way to improve communication and curricular articulation between the college and local schools.   This is what good two-year colleges care about.",

That said, if you're worried about level of effort, doing a quick cost-benefit wouldn't hurt. Even non-zero chances are unlikely to be super high, so if you already feel like you're doing too much, maybe consider other avenues.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that depts may have different criteria for adjuncts than for permanent and semi-permanent positions.",

      "text": "You've gotten a number of responses suggesting you do it and I agree.\n\nOne thing to add--there are a couple of types of community colleges you should consider. There are the classic ones that are supposed to be the first 2 years of a baccalaureate degree and there are technical colleges (think Hospitality studies, etc.). In my experience the technical colleges are less attractive to PhDs and so it looks to me like fewer PhD's apply to those programs. Around here there are articulation agreements that will allow a number of 100 and 200 level ENGL classes to transfer from the technical college to the CC. I just looked at a major technical college in our area and the Humanities faculty include 23 MA degrees and 14 PhD degrees. \n\nYou might want to take a look at the technical colleges in your area as well as the purely academic CC colleges.",

Teaching high school is honestly so different.\n\nDefinitely agree \"shoot your shot,\" but also think through why you want this. I've taught high school summer school, community college, (with a Master's) at an R1 as a doctoral student and then adjunct, and now am TT at a SLAC. In terms of the content you'd be teaching and the level of ability you can expect of the students, teaching community college was much more like teaching high school than like teaching at an R1. In terms of the amount of time you spend dealing with discipline, etc., CC is nothing like high school.\n\nSo, I'd encourage you to think about what it is about high school you want to get away from and about college you want to get to. Depending on what that is, CC may or may not get you there.",
