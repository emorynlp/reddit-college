      "text": "It's good that you have looked up the person's research, but honestly, it's not great overall.  \n\nFirst off, you should absolutely be looking for paid work.  Treat volunteering as a completely last resort.  \n\nThe biggest problem here is that your email sounds like you imagine getting deeply and intellectually involved in cancer research.  Realistically, as a volunteer you probably won't stick around long enough for it to be worth the time to train you.  For example, in my experience, a full-time summer student *might* accomplish work of more value than the time it cost to train and supervise them.  This is only the case for the above-average students, though. \n\nSo for a volunteer with no experience, it's going to be far more sensible for them to just give you menial tasks, which doesn't really get you anywhere.  If you want to spend hours in a lab washing dishes and counting vials, get paid for it.  Someone paying for your time will make better use of it.\n\n\nA few more specific points: \n\n\n* \"...gaining an ample amount of insight into cancer-related research...\" again highlights this disconnect between expectations and reality.  In a research context, \"ample insights\" happen after years of work, not weeks.  We understand that you don't have experience, so tone it down a little.\n\n* the second paragraph is composed of two sentences that are far too long, complex, and difficult to follow.  It looks like you're copying and pasting buzzwords from their website or papers to try and show off.  Be clear and concise. \n\n* informing a highly-trained professional researcher with years of experience that, in your opinion, their cancer research is \"important\" is cringy.  \n\n* if you're absolutely sure you want to volunteer, then be specific about timing.  Are you looking for a full-time position or a few hours a week?  Are you thinking of weeks or months?",

I've got a few questions.\n\nSo I know I start out being a busboy when I start volunteering, but I got the impression that if I show up consistently, ask questions, put in the work with enthusiasm, and try to actually learn, I'd be able to ask for more responsibility after a decent amount of months and repeat the process until I get offered a paid position. Fortunately, money isn't a massive concern so I'm definitely able and willing to put in the time for unpaid work if it means I can move up eventually. Is this realistic or was I being naive?\n\nAlso, yeah I definitely see where you're coming from with toning it down, I was told to make it really obvious that you've read the professor's publications and really flex your interest and enthusiasm since, with a lack of experience, that a lot of what I have to offer (other than a degree) so maybe I went a little overboard lol. Do you recommend just taking out the main points I got from their publications completely or still show I've read up on some of their work and just trying to condense it down? \n\nThanks again for your feedback it's really useful and I'll definitely look into paid positions since you and many others say that's the best route to take as of now!",

In reality, though, I doubt anyone will count on you sticking around for the necessary amount of time to start moving along this process.  I got my start in research in exactly this way, but as a paid lab minion rather than as a volunteer.  (My \"dishes and counting things\" comment was based on experience!)   \n\n> still show I've read up on some of their work and just trying to condense it down? \n\nYes, I think that's a good idea.  If they're willing to discuss it with you, you can use the interview to show a greater depth of understanding and to discuss why you want to do this and what you're hoping to accomplish.\n\nJust to reiterate, avoid writing things that make it sound like you're evaluating their work.  Enthusiasm is great, but arrogant/overconfident students can be a huge pain to supervise, and a disaster in a lab full of expensive equipment, dangerous chemicals, and precious samples.",

              "text": "Honestly, from my experience, the reality of getting paid as a research assistant who has 0 prior research experience is very slim, at least where I'm from, so I disagree with others on that. Definitely check around for paid positions if you can, but I personally wouldn't get my hopes up.\n\nI think it does help to mention your specific interest in their work but you can tone it down. Your second paragraph also has very long run-on sentences that I would shorten.  \n\nAs for the amount of work that you get, that depends on the lab. Do you know anyone who has worked there before you can speak with? Some labs will keep you to only do menial work while others will let you grow. This really depends on the supervisor. Another important consideration if you do have the opportunity to speak to someone from the lab is to find out what level of work merits paper authorship. Having your name on a paper, even if you're 7th author, will do wonders for you if you want to stick in academia.\n\nEdit: I missed that you already finished your undergrad. In this case you do have a better shot of getting paid, but still low imo considering your lack of research experience. Once you have some experience though, for future labs I would suggest you only look for paid positions. Your time is worth something!",

A PI will not expect much from a recent graduate in the way of specific contributions to their research, and might be concerned that you are wasting your time by volunteering with them. However, if you clearly expressed ambitions for a career in a laboratory or other research setting, then volunteering might give you a boost for more serious opportunities.",
