  "text": "I live in Canada. If I\u2019m aiming to be a professor, does it make more sense to try to get into a top US school for grad school or to stay in Canada? School ranking is important for the job search but US schools are extremely expensive so I\u2019m wondering what the best plan is here. Are Canadian universities like UofT and UBC ranked high enough?",

For example, the economics department at Harvard outranks the one at Ohio State, so what you say would be true of an econ PhD. In some fields, though, the top departments aren\u2019t necessarily the ones at the top institutions \u2014 iirc the top ten PhD-granting philosophy departments include some at institutions that aren\u2019t considered top/elite universities overall \u2014 so in those cases, it\u2019s the department rankings that matter, not the institution rankings. (Though, in general, you can expect these to at least be positively correlated.)",

It may just be selection bias but as an undergrad at UofT it seems like a lot of them are from the States or other countries (or are Canadian, have done a masters in the states and have returned for a PhD). Set up coffee chats (or zoom chats) with them and ask them about job market, why they returned to Canada, etc. You'll get a variety of answers in which you can take in. Also not to mention, many profs have spent a lot time at nurmerous ivy leagues (lots of harvard, cornell, mit, uscs, etc on CVs) and they're teaching at UofT for a reason...",

The capitalist nature of the US makes US universities (even less prestigious ones) extremely wealthy. For example, University of Illinois, Chicago or the Unuversity of Texas San Antonio, while not \"top\" stills enjoy tremendous amounts of money, much of which is used to support research,  and by extension, to attract and retain graduate students. Because of that reason,  I'll always advise students to find the person they want to work with and look at the department in question.",

But it was also linked to that constant debate about basic reality - for me it was the arguments about universal healthcare and gun control that really got to me. I lived near one of the worst school shootings in US history and the conspiracy theories that sprung up and what the parents continue to go through made/makes me sick. I cannot imagine how I'd be feeling right now surrounded by covid conspiracy nuts, anti-vaxxers and the determination that an individual's right to be stupid takes absolute and unimpeachable precedence over society's welfare.

My anecdotal experience is that it is harder to get recognized by American institutions with a Canadian degree, even one from UofT. They often don't even know Canadian universities unless that university really stands out in your field. That being said, it is a lot more affordable and the education is going to be good. You may just have to be lenient with where you're willing to go afterwards, which would likely be the case anyway.",
