  "text": "It has been a horrible experiance full of stress and misery. I didn't managed to publish anything (unusual in my field). Even though I do have publishable research, however I feel it's too late. I'm burnt out and tired and just want to quit..i don't see it happening, I just don't see it happening..\n\nP.s. I'm in an American school where avg PhD takes around 5.5 years\n",

      "text": "My suggestions would be.\n\n1. take some time off, maybe a few weeks, just relax and forget everything and switch your brain off. \n2. come back and have a meeting with your supervisor about what is the absolute minimum amount of work needed to produce a passable PhD thesis. Not a good thesis, one which will pass a viva. Make a plan for how you're going to land the plane with the least amount of effort from this point. \n\nYou should have a lot of leverage in this discussion because it's not good for your supervisor to have a student quit after such a long time. There clearly has been some mismanagement here. If they try to push you into doing extra work or whatever just say no. Do the absolute minimum from here on out.\n\nMy guess would be that even if you don't have 1 word of a Thesis with the material you have you can write one and submit within 6 months. \n\nHopefully it will be easier if you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Good luck :)",

I'm sorry for you (I'm 3rd year phd and can only imagine what you've been through as I'm considering quitting too).  \n\n\nHave you tried to talk to someone ? psychologist, counselor, your supervisors (although I'm assuming they don't really care anymore). This is very likely to help you going through that difficult phase, which is, considering your message, a much bigger priority than thinking about your publication or your diploma. Protect your mental health, think about yourself, take a 1 week break (if that's possible).  \n\n\nHang in there man (woman ?), the way I see it, succeeding in Academia is not really about skills or abilities (if you didn't have those, you wouldn't have been accepted anyway), but rather determination and good partnership with your colleagues / supervisors. But sometimes it's not enough to satisfy expectations (yours & Academia's), and so sometimes you just need to leave (which is OKAY, really).  \n\n\nNo matter what you do in the end, there is no rush. Take a deep breath, talk to someone, let it go, and then after a few days of **not working** and not thinking about work, go back to your supervisors and talk to them about your situation (both your phd and the way it affects you). Make a decision together, it will help you not to put too much pressure on yourself.  \n\n\nWhatever you do, remember : those 8 years were not made in vain. You developed many skills and you also learned a lot about yourself and how you need to work, it's a valuable.",

The actual outcome of the work isn't the be-all and end-all. \n* When my depression hit I'd already finished 80% of the work, minus the write-up. With the coaching of my wife and friend I managed to break it all down into manageable chunks and create a plan that would work for me. I ended up doing 2 hours of real work a day as a minimum and still managed to finish it in a year after I got out of my depression. \n\nJust as a final note - it is worth getting the PhD, not necessarily to break into academia, but as a badge of competence.

Advice from your family should be taken carefully, as they're not familiar with the field, for them it's just 'a bit more effort' but we know it's more complicated sometimes.  \n\n\nDiscussing this kind of issue is also very hard in front of an entire committee. During the last one I cried in front of them and I think it would have been better to discuss my feeling the supervisor I get along with the most. I suggest you do that. And if you don't get along with any of them, talk to a psychologist (specialized in working problems), it helps a lot.  \n\n\nAt this point what you need to focus on is : talk to someone you get along with and works in academia, anyone. As your situation is rather 'extreme' (8 years after all), everyone will become aware of how seriously your problem should be taken. Then, your supervisors. Believe me they want to know what's going on in your head, and if you quit, everyone (including yourself) needs to anticipate that decision.  \n\n\nWho knows maybe you just need a new teammate to finish everything, sometimes all we need is a little push (and confort) :)  \n\n\nbut don't expect it from strangers in the internet though...",

I does sound like bad decision making from your supervisors, and also the fact that your committee didn't try to adjust you topic in order to make your project more realistic makes me question the qualification of everyone to conduct a phd project in your department.  \n\n\nYet, it's probably no one's fault directly (like always), just a combination of unintended factors resulting in a durable mess. It seems you are the only one being aware of how much of a mess it is, comforting my impression that you need to talk to one of them.  \n\n\nThere are always periods where we believe there is nothing we can do to continue our phd (so called [valley of shit](https://thesiswhisperer.com/2012/05/08/the-valley-of-shit/)), the question is : were you deep in the valley for all this time or is it an issue that can't be solved on its own ? To answer that I think you need to brainstorm with your bosses.  \n\n\nThing is, after 8 years it's too late to adjust your topic, and so if your project is too hard to be finished (which is yet to be decided with other members of the project) then yes it may be time to quit. But 1) quitting doesn't mean slamming the door 2) you shouldn't feel guilty or responsible for all that and 3) you did build a lot of experience and skills during this phd, focus on that when you move on to sthg else (with or without your phd).",

Plus no one knows how a phd will turn out because no one is medium. As Klumber says, just write a thesis with what you got, and publish a not-so-terrible paper in a mediocre journal.   \nWe won't pursue in Academia (I know I won't) so we don't care about our impact factor. We simply want to get all the requirements to defend, and then defend. Period. Move on, and have a simple and happy life =) That's my plan anyway.  \n",

With academics in particular it seems like the world is closing in on you when you shut down because of depression. In the past and some even now I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone if I had an issue and no one would know until it has snowballed. Follow the great advice others have given down here in the comments and in regards to the depression sit down with some close friends and talk with them and then have fun for a bit to distance yourself mentally. If you need to do so then sit down with a friend and talk it out with them while you construct it so that you don\u2019t fall into depression and in order to stay on task. I wish you the best",

              "text": "Long response, sorry, but I don't mind spending some time trying to help you, I'm at home with a cold and bored stiff! (Never had that when I did my PhD! ;) ) \n\nAgain, drawing on my own experience, **EVERYBODY** struggles whilst doing a PhD. I have had the benefit of working in two of the top departments in my field, I worked alongside dozens of PhD students both as an RA, as a PhD student myself, as a lecturer and now in academic support services. \n\nI am yet to find any PhD student who enjoys the process. All of us have the same problem: It is lonesome work, it is an enormous amount of information to work with and you are constantly challenging yourself to cope with it. As soon as something in your support network changes, it can trigger an avalanche of negative self-reflection. \n\nA few real life examples of mental health issues without going into personal detail: \n\n*A close friend had two supervisor changes, she managed the first one well as it was a recognised professor at the top of the field she studied, but then he got promoted and had to assign her to a junior staff member who A: didn't understand the research topic, B: didn't have a clue about the methodology. She qualified, but only because she decided to ignore the final supervisor completely, the number of times she dragged herself up from the bottom fighting and screaming is incredible, it took her five years.*\n\n*A young, extremely bright, PhD student in my cohort was doing great, on the surface. Then he had a sports injury, or at least that is what he told everybody. Stayed away for a year, he returned just before my Viva and we had a long night in a pub - he had suffered a mental breakdown because his mother was diagnosed with cancer and he felt he couldn't support her and do his PhD. I spoke to him recently and four years later he has a viva date.*\n\n*A friend who is now an internationally renowned professor suffered from impostor syndrome, unable to make decisions without validation from more senior staff, one of his ideas was straight-up stolen by one of them. He reached out to wellbeing and ended up receiving counselling, best thing that could have happened to him.*\n\n*Recently I coached (as part of my role) a very senior member of staff with my current employer. She was told she had to do a PhD by publication to retain her senior leadership role. Two years in and she is under such pressure that it is bordering on insane. After the session she immediately told her line manager that she had two options: Give her two days a week to get her PhD or drop the demand to get one. She now has two days a week to get her PhD.*\n\nFinal piece of advice (ad verbatim from my supervisor, received *after* I finished my viva voce, the plonker): **A PhD is awarded as a commendation of you managing to get through this experience.** So I will add to that: Treat it as such and look after yourself.",

Twenty percent of people with Ph.Ds in my field get jobs-- you aren't a better person for \"sticking with it.\"  I think this is one of the great failings of academic culture-- continually implying that holding on even though things aren't going well is going to result in living the dream of a tenure track job.

Take a break from the guilt, too. Just disconnect. Then, or before you do that, talk to someone in charge in your program (supervisor, committee, whatever) - see if there's a chance you could take a sabbatical at this point, or if not, if you can stretch it out a little bit longer, so you have time to try and regain your balance.

Usually a PhD candidate will have discussed with their committee what their dissertation scope and objectives are. If you have results you can publish you should write them into your dissertation. It is typical to have some work as manuscripts that are published after you graduate. Speak with your advisor and committee regarding your intention to graduate. Also, do you have an assistantship that pays tuition and a stipend? Many places have limits on how long a student can be supported without graduating.\nMy advice is to find a way to salvage your PhD. You might have to find work outside graduate school to do this. It is challenging but I know plenty that have done this.\nGood luck.",
