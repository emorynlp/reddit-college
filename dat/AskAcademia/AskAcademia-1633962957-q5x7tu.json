I was wondering what questions the interviewer will be asking. Just the typical \u201cwhy should we hire you\u201d etc.? Or will she also question me about my knowledge on the subject? I\u2019m really nervous, and i really want to land this job. Please help me, thanks!",

      "text": "It really depends on who is hiring, what kind of questions you would get. I would assume since this is a researcher position, they are looking more for warm bodies than someone that will bring new cutting edge ideas. They are probably going to ask basic check questions and try to get questions to know find out about you as a person.\n\nRemember to breath, and take your time with answering. Silence is okay, you don't need to fill every space with talking. \n\nA simple technique that improves interview, is repeating the question they ask, when answering. It gives you time to think, and if reinforces that you know the question when answering, and not going on a tangent.\n\nBest of luck.",

Are you presentable, attentive, pleasant, prepared to learn and have an interest.\n\nFor the last point, I would have an idea as to what the lab does, even if the fine details are not so clear to you.\n\nI suppose at that level, I would mainly be looking for any \"red flags\" which might show you are high maintenance.",

Find out what the research area of the lab is and read a recent publication to give yourself some background knowledge in the area. You won\u2019t be expected to be an expert but know the overall topic area to show you are interested. Good luck.",
