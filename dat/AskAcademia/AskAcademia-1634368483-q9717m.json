  "title:": "Thesis student likely not getting a passing grade now. 15 years ago I loathed my supervisor for that. How do I assess who's being wrong today?",
  "text": "I've got a case of maybe misaligned perceptions between student and supervisor. And I always promised myself that I would never treat students like my supervisor treated me. Anyway, this dude is one of the first students I have, so I'm also unexperienced. And the previous ones were all excellent and I felt like I never had to even manage them.\n\n**What I'm perceiving as the supervisor:** I've got a master thesis student who's not working well. He's perennially living in a parallel fantasy world and not really responsive. He does not communicate not even when directly questioned, let alone when he's working on his own even if told \"the first istant that you get stuck contact me\". In July I started telling him \"you should be finishing the first draft of the thesis, with some place holders for results we're waiting for by August 31st. And there's the summer break, it's already a bit late\". He kept saying \"I'm about to finish the chapter\" and never sent anything if not very late, like introduction by 10 september, methods by 1st of october... In 4 days he needs to have the final manuscript and he sent 2 days ago the biggest chapter and... it's unreadable in style and it reads like he didn't understand what he did. I'm sure he did understand something, even if I'm not 100% sure as he didn't talk. \n\nHis university supervisor (I'm the external lab one) said that this thesis is unacceptable and we're \"pondering the options we have\".\n\n**what I've perceived as a student 15 years ago**. I gave my first draft of the thesis 3 months before the deadline to my supervisor I didn't get any feedback. He kept dragging me on, and complaining about me not doing my part while he wasn't reading what I wrote nor giving feedback... When I put together something badly written and sent it to the senior supervisor he said it was unacceptable and I had to graduate at a later session. \n\n\nSo... How do I know \" *who's being wrong* \" today? Because of course I would think that I'm the one working 100% correctly in all situations\n\nedit: The thesis is an european MsC one, so a 10 months project from day 1 to thesis submitted. Not a 4 years PhD one, where of course it makes sens to have very different deadlines",

It absolutely would not have been a readable/acceptable thesis had I turned it in at the original deadline. \n\nAlso I disagree with any commenters saying that you were responsible for holding the student to any internal/informal deadlines. Maybe during a US PhD with program-required deadlines, you might be responsible for setting consequences for missed deadlines. But on a European style taught or research MSc it\u2019s my understanding that the final thesis deadline (and any soft internal deadlines) is mainly the student\u2019s responsibility.",

Some students are great, know what they want, and can organize themselves independently. Other students have anxiety, or depression, or chaotic personal lives, or are just legitimately in over their heads. To be an effective mentor, it is a valuable skill to be able to recognize these kinds of red flags and have a sense about how to approach people and encourage them to open up so you can make the best possible decisions with them.\n  \nIf you want to know more please let me know! I did a lot of training on this because I used to manage some residence buildings at my school and would regularly meet with young students who struggled with the transition to post-secondary.",

Depending on your mental health state, you can have completely drug free talk therapies, where they use things like structured CBT (taking advantage of neuroplasticity) to help change your brain's behaviours (and in turn, the way your brain reacts to stimuli in thoughts and emotions). Saying this as both a psychology PhD student and someone who got therapy. (I recommend going to a psychologist rather than just generic psychotherapists though.)",

Supervisors have no say on when or if students submit theses. Supervisors guide students through the process, but the thesis submission is a hard target and deadline required by the university. You don't just 'not submit' because your supervisor said you couldn't.\n\nFor a research degree the only sign off a supervisor does is to confirm whether it's their work or not.",

They are adults and they had 4 years to understand that their education is their personal responsibility, that deadlines exist and have to be met and that submitting work of unacceptably low quality will result in them not passing. It is not the responsibility of the supervisor or the university administration to handhold them. If the deadlines were communicated to them and they didn't meet them, then it's on them. Leaving an adult to their own devices is a perfectly valid thing to do, I would think.",

There are plenty of students that do Master's because they want the degree, but don't want to be trained as a scientist. They take their courses, do the thesis work that is required of them and that's it. I get the impression that you're assuming that the OP's student treated their work as serious research and training, and as prelude to a PhD but there is no indication of that.",

Unless they are being arrogant about it, it's very much possible that they are not able to perform due to anxiety. Covid has really messed up people's mental states and I have no idea if this person has had any issues recently.\n\nAlso consider if your trainee comes from a different culture.

In short - you have objectively done what you can, it is up to the student to write the thesis, ask the questions and communicate. If they do not do that, there is nothing for you to do. It is not like they have given you a well written and thought out thesis just days before the deadline, they have done no work and are (very poorly) attempting to salvage their thesis now. Some students you just can not help. And to be honest - it might be best for them if you fail them now, so they learn the consequences of their actions before it costs them much more later in life.",

However, it sounds like they are letting themselves down. We don't get into post grad programs without having some level of potential. I would hope that the student met the minimum requirements and was selected for this, versus getting in by merit of applying. I know that's a thing too. Since they are not meeting requirements, I have to wonder what else is going on in their lives? Is this one of those self discovery things where they are about to walk away from it all to live on hiking trails and sell pot to tourists? Or are they struggling with mental health issues and thoroughly self sabotaging? No matter how many times you tell me to ask for help, if I'm in a bad place, I'll never say a word. It's a thing and it's part of many disorders. Or, maybe the student just isn't into it any more and is biding time til the money runs out. It sounds like there are two supervisors involved here, so I'd maybe set a time to sit down with all three of you and maybe someone from OEA or mental health, just to be certain that whatever does come out, you have a subject matter expert that can provide appropriate resources on the spot.",

More structured deliverables that are maybe more well defined than a full paper of a dissertation, like maybe an outline, or some charts, etc.\n\nYou may need to break down the process a bit more for this student.\n\nEveryone here can argue about responsibility or lack thereof but the end result is that student of yours doesn't pass. If you don't care if your student doesn't pass, then don't give this student a second thought, but if you want to be a better advisor, instead of arguing about what is whose responsibility, just do everything you can think of to help this student succeed.\n\nThis is my personal opinion, but if a student has failed, you have failed the student.",

It's also fair to say he's not \"you,\" so to speak.\n\nYou are not to blame. You are not being too harsh. However, it is definitely time to have him apply for an extension and to communicate that you set proper deadlines and he blew past them. It doesn't have to be the end of the world and if he or she reacts poorly, that's on them. I mean this in a kind way, but grad school is stressful and there's always the counseling center.

My reply is pretty blunt but please don't be insulted, I like to just talk about things pretty directly.\n  \nI think the student has accountability to their actions but I also think the supervisor has a lot of responsibility. A student getting this far with these many issues tells me their supervisor was probably disengaged. I would imagine if there was a supervisor who scheduled regular meetings, made real progress to connect with the student, and mentored them and encouraged them to take responsibility in their education, none of this would be happening.\n  \nThat being said, it is hard to expect supervisors to have this kind of insight because they aren't explicitly trained on how to recognize conflict and be able to communicate. Similarly, it is hard to expect young people to have the self-awareness to recognize the impacts of their behaviour and their need to address internal conflict.\n  \nAt this point I would probably start asking what the likelihood is of this student being able to produce acceptable work. If not and this student truly seems like they are in over their heads, it might be worth it to start talking to the graduate program coordinator about whether or not this student should be encouraged to leave.\n  \nBut if you believe this student is just struggling, it would also be worth it to discuss with the coordinator some kind of (very non-judgemental) meeting with the student to express tangible concern, give them the opportunity to open un about it, and then maybe look to do some kind of academic probation. I am not sure what the policies are like at his school, but I would ask about either suspension with the opportunity to enrole at a later date with the idea that the student uses the time to get themselves in a better place. I have also experience some situations where we have made a student's enrolment conditional on regular counselling meetings.",

A tendency to procrastinate & write under time pressure won't kill you with structured essays for classes, but with something as selfdirected as a master's thesis, it can land one in serious trouble. If you sincerely want to figure out what's going wrong, I'd pursue that line of questioning with him.

Reaching out and saying \"Hey, I'm doing nothing\" probably held an expected result of shame for this individual, as it would for most students, particularly one who'd pushed themselves all the way to a masters program.   And if one is depressed, it's entirely likely they lack the mental resources to keep themselves together in the face of an advisor's disapproval.  The lack of responses, even to direct emails, rings of classic avoidance as a coping strategy.\n\nSo if there's some sort of deferral/extension/resubmission process the school allows on mental health grounds, I'd obliquely mention that as an aside, and put the ball in their court.",
