  "text": "So I'm about to soon submit my Masters thesis and I'm actually wondering what makes a thesis really good? I mean there's only so much you can put in it, but like what are they tiniest improvements one can implement to make it stand out? Just really curious on how I can improve mine, and hopefully this could help anyone else in the same path as me atm.",

          "text": "I think this is really spot on and people truly underestimate the importance of this. I know from being on both sides of the marking divide that a well written and well constructed thesis can cover a multitude of sins. At the same time, it doesn't matter how good your argument is if it's hard to get through. When you have a stack of 20 master's dissertations to read it's inevitable you look kindly on the one that you enjoyed reading.",

Your examiners know what the important papers are. Make sure you've cited them.\n\nShowing, through your understanding of the literature, that you've identified a gap in knowledge. For a masters this doesn't have to be some huge breakthrough, even just citing a publication that concluded \"further research / a bigger database is needed to answer the questions\" and then being very clear that you filled that gap and how.",

      "text": "At this stage of the process, I would focus on the abstract and introduction. It will color the readers' take on the rest. Very likely, your thesis is confusing at times, especially for someone who reads it quickly.\n\nAs a writer, you usually overestimate the clarity of the text because you know what is ahead in the text. The reader doesn't.\n\nOne way to address this problem is to make sure that the reader has the whole story with them when they are reading via an effective abstract. After having read the abstract, the reader should be able to tell someone else about the thesis in an elevator pitch:\n\nWhat is it about? Why does it matter (lack of research or other)? Method in some detail (survey of 981 Redditers, 16 rats dissected). If relevant, theoretical perspective. Results.",
