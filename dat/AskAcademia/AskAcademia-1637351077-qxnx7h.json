  "text": "I am graduating university with a BA in philosophy (I\u2019ll have a 3.9+ GPA and Latin honors from the top university in my flyover state). Theoretically, and assuming a decent GRE score (which I have), what fields am I best qualified to apply to PhD programs in besides philosophy? Thanks!",

      "text": "Most PhD programs look for some sort of research experience vaguely related to the program you\u2019re interested in, or at least that will have transferable skills. Another important part Is fit. If you\u2019re not interested in a subject and you\u2019re just getting a PhD to get a PhD, even if you don\u2019t mean it to, it will come across in your application, and that will make most adcomms throw your application in the trash.",

      "text": "What kind of questions do you have a fire in the belly for? If you don't have any, you'll (likely) not make it through a PhD, or (possibly) hate your life while dragging one out of somewhere uncomfortable. Most humanities PhDs (and many in the descriptive social sciences) aren't looking for a particular major, but evidence of both the kind of general academic attainment it seems you have and a passion for the subject (which we can't diagnose from what you've written here). Some will be looking for specific language skills as well.\n\nETA: Also, the question, \"What PhD programs am I qualified for?\" is not a a great question as the answer will be \"lots.\" A better question is \"What PhD programs would I be an attractive candidate for?\" You haven't given us the information we'd need to answer that question.",

              "text": "It is actually inappropriate on multiple levels, but directing you to gradadmissions seemed to most fit your needs.\n\n* Questions about graduate admissions should go to r/gradadmissions.\n\n* Questions from undergrads rarely warrant a post of their own and should instead be added as a comment to our weekly office hours thread.\n\n* Your question is on an academic topic but does not relate to working in academia or academic life, and as such is not suitable for this sub.\n\nAnd on a final and less mod-y note, when you're committing to several years of hard academic study, you really shouldn't be asking strangers for vague suggestions of what you maybe could do, you should have a sense yourself for what interests you and then go from there.",
