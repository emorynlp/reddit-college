  "title:": "How to deal with an advisor who changes the goalposts?",
  "text": "I am  a chemistry PhD student and I am planning to graduate in December. Months ago my advisor and I sat down and went through all of the milestones he would like me to achieve before writing my thesis. Chief among these was completing a little project to be written up as a communication. The synthesis took a little longer than expected and the project completion got pushed back by about a month but I had everything I needed for the communication. Then a week back he informs me that we are going to be submitting this as a full paper, and here are all of the other experiments that will need to be done. I confronted him on this saying that we had agreed to submit a communication (for which the data is compiled and ready to go), he said \"I know it's hard, quit whining.\" \n\nI have carved out a niche for myself in this lab and made myself highly specialised with respect to what the lab traditionally does. This will be my 7th publication in 4.5 years (5th first author). Haven't I done enough to deserve this degree?  I feel that my PI, fearing the loss of my expertise (there are only 2 other members of our group, I am senior most)  is trying to squeeze any amount of productivity out of me that he can. Essentially I am feeling used and under valued for my labor. Any suggestions for coping and/ or retaining my dignity? \n\nHappy to provide more details in the comments",

      "text": "Oh my god this was essentially my situation last year. Small lab, I had been there the longest and had the most accumulated technical expertise, published way more than enough for my degree and my PI wanted me to stay to elongate a small basically completed project into something bigger at my personal expense. The similarities go on. \n\nI went to my committee. Had casual conversations with each of them as well as a conversation with my program director and let them know that my PI was changing the goalposts but I planned to graduate ON TIME and that I had begun discussing postdoctoral fellowship options with potential mentors who had made me offers. I kept the language very nonconfrontational and said something along the lines of \"it's great that PI sees so much potential into what started as a communications level project, but I'm going to make sure (other lab member) is properly trained to carry out the rest of PI's vision if he still wants to work on this after I leave.\" \n\nThat next committee meeting I didn't even have to lobby for myself because my entire committee was asking why I was still there in front of my PI and asking me about next steps/career goals/etc. Then they pushed the message in the closed door part for me. Your committee is there to help you, if you can trust them to.",

In some scenario the advisor holds a good position and ranking, and no one is going to do it for the PhD student. \n\nThere were two also got this situation, one get the defense by spreading the rumor of \"suspisious action of hurting\", another got defense simply because of another high ranking prof. asked about \"why this guy is still here?\" None of them was supported by the Committee. Therefore it's not easy for everyone. \n\n One unlucky story on Reddit is that this PhD was kicked out by the whole research group.",

Her lab had continued money because of a multilab grant. For the next half a year a was stuck in some strange power grabs with one powerful professor demanding to be advisor/chair of my committee even though his work was really not relevant, a research assistant professor (not tenure track) who kept trying to manipulate me into naming her as my advisor (even going to far as to try to get me to sign fake paperwork implying that I meant for her to advise me), and both of them trying to both convince me not to talk to the rest of my committee and to stay for 1.5 more years even though I'd been there for over 5 years and had met all requirements.\n\nIn retrospect, it would have helped me tremendously to have someone tell me to talk with my department head earlier. Both that and one of my committee members who went to bat for me (at considerable risk to her career) got me out of there.\n\nSorry this is happening.
