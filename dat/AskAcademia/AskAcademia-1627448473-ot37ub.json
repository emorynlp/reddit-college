  "text": "I remember looking up my university's professor salaries many, many years  ago in a book in a library. It was partially complete, and this was a public non-profit R2 school. I was simply curious what a professor made a year.\n\nAre all public university salaries for staff and faculty available as public information?\n\nIf yes, is there a central database to look this up?",

In Georgia, for example, if you google, \"University System of Georgia employee salaries\" you'll get the link for Open Georgia (the government link for public disclosures). \n\nFollow that and you'll find out that Dr. X makes more than you--and why is that???",

      "text": "In Canada most professors make the sunshine list (a list each province produces that is available public for everyone who makes a salary over 100k before taxes). I know the US has a similar list so you could start there. Albeit I'm not sure if the pay is that high in academia in the US.",
