  "title:": "Has anyone been to an all in-person conference since Covid?",
  "text": "My field's main international conference is only in-person and is in January. I am co-chair of a session, sole author on one paper, co-author on a second paper, and my PhD advisor agreed to be the discussant for the session I am in. Thankfully, this year its driving distance from my parent's house where I will already be for the holidays and my parents' is driving distance from my house. \n\nWhen I signed up for all of this in June the world was heading in a very different place covid-wise. I'm now very nervous about attending this conference but don't feel like I could just easily pull out due to everything I've committed to. I'm not very high risk, but do have an autoimmune disease and will be stopping by my parent's house where my 93 year old grandmother lives on the way home for an overnight pit stop. \n\nHas anyone been to an international all in-person conference since covid began and how safe or unsafe did it feel?",

      "text": "I've been to two. Both in person. Not international per se, but decently attended. \n\nMore mask wearing and social distancing than I expected, though you had a few vocal people who were aggressively anti-COVID. \n\nI felt safe, and I have 2 children at home (both of whom could not be vaccinated at the time). I've applied to 2 other in person conferences for early next year.",

      "text": "Haven\u2019t been international, but I went to a domestic in-person conference a couple months ago. It was very sparsely attended. It was nice to be back at a conference but it did have a very different feel to it. \n\nAll attendees were required to be vaccinated and we all wore masks. I didn\u2019t feel unsafe at all. That having been said, I think my attitude toward COVID may be a bit more cavalier than most academics, so take my comments in that light.",

          "text": "I attended my session only at an in-person regional conference within an easy drive of a few months ago. There were no vaccine requirements and all of the professional but not academic attendees from Georgia and Florida took their masks off to present and in between sessions to talk. People from other regions kept masks on. It was very uncomfortable. This conference is requiring vaccines or a negative test. I think knowing vaccines would be 100% required would help a lot.",

              "text": "Mine was a national conference in a major city. Probably pretty similar to the type of conference you\u2019re planning to go to. I imagine there\u2019s a huge difference between those and the smaller regional conferences. These smaller organizations always seem like they\u2019re teetering on the edge. So I imagine they can\u2019t worry about driving anyone off with strict rules. I\u2019d guess you\u2019ll be much more comfortable at the International conference.",

Everyone needed to be vaccinated (and it was the first time I've ever had to show my vaccine card).  Everyone wore masks all the time except when drinking/eating.  I didn't see any chin masks or people interpreting \"drinking\" as \"I held a coffee an hour ago\".  That said, it might be field specific, so might be different for your field.",

          "text": "Yeah, we have vaccines required, except they will also allow a recent negative test in place of vaccine so its not really a requirement. I am confident that the academics will be safe, except when out drinking but I can avoid that bit. Its the non-academic professional contingent (similar to other fields' \"industry\") I'm worried about.",
