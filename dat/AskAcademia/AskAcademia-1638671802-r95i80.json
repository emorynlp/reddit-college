Social sciences are rarely as time-sensitive as STEM, but age of sources obviously matters. I reviewed a PhD-thesis in CS that only had 10+ years old stuff in the references because the guy did his review the first year. In that discipline, that is unacceptable for obvious reasons. (In Philosophy or Literature, this would be less of a problem.) Either way, you always need to consider the very latest research at the time you finish, so you don't want to set things in stone design-wise.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that sometimes, people get \"stuck\" in the background/review process and postpone their own actual research for too long. You can always dig a little deeper into the existing literature. For everything you find and learn about, you find more things to learn about, and so on.",

Back in those days, I'd read multiple articles by the same author and the introductions were essentially identical (no more!). If I was doing it today, I'd imagine I'd start writing as I accumulated a number of articles and modify the chapter as I read additional works. I certainly wouldn't wait until I was actually getting ready to collect data.",
