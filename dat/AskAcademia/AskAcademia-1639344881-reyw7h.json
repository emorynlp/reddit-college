  "title:": "Letter of recommendations when applying to faculty positions",
  "text": "I'm applying to several faculty position openings. \n\nI found that some Universities and Colleges ask for a letter of recommendation in the online application material, but I cannot understand this. (These are all US Universities and Colleges) \n\nFrom what I know and understand, letters of recommendation should be asked from the department faculty search committee directly to the people that I designated as my references if they are interested to hire me, and I shall not and should not approach or read the letters of recommendation about myself. Is this correct? \n\nHowever, to upload letters of recommendation as online application material, I need to receive these letters from my reference contacts. But this violates the fact that the letter of recommendation should be sealed and confidential from me. Isn't it? \n\nSo, I cannot understand why and how these Universities require me to upload/include letters of recommendation to the online application material. They didn't provide any email address or offline address for my reference people to send the recommendation letter directly. \n\nWhat should I need to do then? Should I need to just upload the list of possible references for my application?",

There's usually a place to input the letter writers' email addresses. But use interfolio because it will ease the burden on your letter writers.",

      "text": "Letters of recommendation are typically confidential and most applicants use Interfolio. Obviously your committee/department can help you navigate the process (at least it never hurts to ask). Think of letters as less important in the initial screening process (when a search committee is trying to get hundreds of applicants down to 20 or so) and increasing in importance the further you go in the process. You want people who know you to write letters because the generic letter is also a signal to the search committee. \n\nAnd no, you will not see the letters. Interfolio is easy to use, should not be much of an issue,",

Usually in those cases the search committee will tell you to ignore the portal instructions, and just send confidential letters to them instead.  Worth asking the search committee chair about how they prefer letters be submitted.",
