If you're stimulated by pipe dreams and BS and hypotheticals and whimsy, find the people who like to chat and come up with stupid/crazy/cool ideas. If you're very driven and work hella hard, find the people who work solid days of the week but party on the weekend (or go outdoors, or whatever your fancy is). If you're timid and uncertain, find the people who will support you and help your voice be strong.\n\nPersonally, I'm from the first camp (whimsy/bullshit/hypotheticals), and I have HAD to keep in touch with the very few friends of mine that are like that. One lives in AZ, one in MN, one in WA, one in Canada, and I have a few where I am currently. I cherish those friendships because they are rare. But they're there :)",

I didn't really click with anyone in my lab or my cohort my first year (I'm pretty outgoing, and essentially all the students in my department were and are shut-ins without hobbies beyond gaming), but I met grad students in other departments who had friends outside the university who were into music and non-academic activities I enjoy, and these people have remained \"my tribe\" throughout the PhD.\n\nMeeting people like this is basically impossible right now, which sucks.",

That definitely influenced my decision to stay with my PI for my PhD, and I\u2019m so thankful for that. We have tons of funding and the funniest, kind-hearted people.

I've worked in academia now for 8 years, at two different institutions.  I've been lucky that in both cases my departments, and more importantly my HoD (Dept. Chair) and heads of school (Deans?) have been supportive of my career.  I really like my job and can't imagine doing anything else.  Sure there are times where I bitch and moan, but overall I'm paid well, to do stuff I enjoy.\n\nBut, I really think that's about the people I'm working with.

      "text": "What keeps you going when times get tough and you're really feeling the pressure of deadlines while you're not getting the results you were expecting...it's different for every person.\n\nFor me, it's always been skiing and snowboarding.  In high school and college I'd get my lift ticket and spend almost every waking hour from Saturday morning to Sunday night on the slopes, and in college often on weekdays as well (I'd schedule my classes around skiing).  In the third year of my PhD I was in a funk (there's absolutely no skiing any time of the year within driving distance of my university) and was able to get a 4-month visiting student position in a great lab near some pretty good slopes (one of my advisor's PhD buddies was the PI).  \n\nOver those 4 months, I lost a ton of weight, got into the best shape of my life, and (maybe) most importantly, came up with the research that would form the cornerstone of my thesis.  If I couldn't figure out the solution to some problem, I'd put away my computer, get in my car (I always kept my skis at the lab), and go skiing for a few hours.  Sometimes, a possible solution would come to me, and I'd end my ski session and hurry to the lab (or just my apartment) and write some quick code and run it on the server to see if it worked.  \n\nI have grad student friends all over the country, and many of them have an outdoor activity they're obsessed with that keeps them healthy and going strong even in the most stressful parts of their PhD.  Most PIs (in my field) don't care if you take a Wednesday off to go rock climbing, skiing, hiking, cycling, sailing or windsurfing -- for those who enjoy these kinds of activities (and have access to them) I think a PhD is much less taxing on your mental health.\n\nPersonally, I'm not looking forward to being stuck in a boring part of the country with absolutely nothing available during covid.  This winter I'm going to be stuck at home, and it's already driving me nuts.",

      "text": "This is one problem thats so crazily common it's mind boggling that it's just left unaddressed and expected to be dealt in an ad hoc manner. They recommend that you read the Craft of Research but give absolutely nothing to help deal with the mental stress that comes with academia. You get mentors and supervisors that basically just go off with the same approach to handling those they're looking after that they dealt with so it's completely variable how good or bad that is. \n\nMeanwhile, going into the working world, I was surprised by how much industrial psychology is used by corporations to coach grads into the workplace. I had dedicated time at least monthly with a dedicated mentor (that had gone through formal training as a mentor) that had been matched to me according to personality profiles. It's not super crazy things for then to run either and would honestly even help with helping professors with their interactions with undergrads. All due respect to profs for their research but I've met some (and this might just be engineering) that are just completely socially stunted and putting them in charge or a graduate student or class of 100 without proper training is just not the best approach. \n\nAdmittedly I am skeptical in general about the whole personality profile thing but just having someone who knows how to speak to you and unpack a personal problem is amazing. My advice would be to get a mentor and honestly possibly even get one that's not in academia that can help guide you. It can be someone close to you already or someone you respect and look up to but basically have someone that can be a sounding board for your non-technical ideas and thoughts. Someone that you can grab a coffee with and just chat about how things are going, where you are and where you'd like to be. Talk to them about what stressing you and what holds you back and don't try and take all of it on your own. The reason I speak so highly of the way corporates do it is because they basically filter out people who aren't great at mentorship. Instead you'll have to rely on your own gut feel when you meet someone new but take that also as a learning experience to break out of the academia bubble.",
