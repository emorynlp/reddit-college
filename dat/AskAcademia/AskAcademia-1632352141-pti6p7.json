  "text": "I am an international student in US in a lab which has very high citations per paper but the advisor is demanding, the research is vastly vastly independent and the drop out rate is very high, 60%+ . Some of the dropouts had extensive research exp before coming in. The topics in the lab are very interesting to me and is in high demand but It is completely different than my masters or under grad. The Prof is not easy to work with and I am not sure if I am good enough, I am just more than 6 months in. Shall I switch advisor and go to someone where it will be easy to work with or struggle at the risk of dropping out, ruining mental health and everything in between!! I don't know how to weigh this high risk to high reward situation. The who are graduating are happy and had dream output",

Either that, or selecting well-separated column fractions to characterise, then combining all fractions (which includes some non-separated impurity), and reporting total mass as yield.\n\nLooking at a particular elite university in the UK that starts with University and ends with Oxford.

Also I would like to know how you define \"high citations per paper\".\n\nAnd to be honest, those highly cited papers doesn't mean a lot to you, those are yesterday heroes and you aren't in the author list anyways. You should care your own progress, your training to become an independent researcher, and how you could learn the most during your PhD. That said, if you still think you can gain the most from that lab, it's your choice and I respect that.\n\nMy lab is intense, quite demanding, supervisor has high standard to every students, but he is someone that you can reason with. He does care a lot about his students' learning and research progress and give great feedbacks. We only had one postdoc quitted in the history of the lab (mostly due to language difference and inability to communicate academically, though), and recently one student left mostly because they find interest in another field.\n\nI'm not flexing, but I would say my lab is comparable to your case as you described (minus the huge drop out rate and seemingly toxicity) so I'm 100% sure your lab isn't really worth it, unless you have some \"unique\" mental strength : Our supervisor is Clarivate's Highly Cited Researchers for 5+ years in a row, almost every grad students/postdocs managed to find a decent job, research of the group set some current world record(s) of the field.

          "text": "It's almost a certainty that this person will look back on a toxic workplace and ask why they didn't listen to their instincts and walk away. There's no \"love\" to lose in an abusive lab - only patience, sanity, and time from someone's career. \n\nA toxic boss is NEVER worth it, no matter how much they claim to publish or how helpful they promise they will be with your future career. These people lie like it's a bodily function, and the high turnover rate suggests an abusive situation where the PI churns and burns people, keeping them working hard with the faint promise of a recommendation letter, only to throw them in the garbage once they get what they need. The letter never comes, and the postdoc is left with a shattered self image, asking themselves what happens next, and wondering what's so wrong with this system that it allows abusive PIs to squeeze the life and talent out of so many young minds.",

Also, it\u2019s an important career skill to learn to work with difficult people, and if they are highly productive, it can go a long way for you. \n\nNothing is worth the risk of your mental health, but if you take it is as both a career and interpersonal learning opportunity then you may have more success in the situation by changing the way you are are thinking about it. \n\nTLDR: if you can stick it out and learn something by separating yourself emotionally from the advising situation you might benefit.",
