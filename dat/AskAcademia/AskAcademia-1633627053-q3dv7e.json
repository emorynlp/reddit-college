  "title:": "Having a really hard time returning to \"normal\" and worried it\u2019s affecting my education",
  "text": "Before the pandemic I attended a lot of conferences. I didn\u2019t really enjoy most of them but I knew they were important and made the best of them. Luckily conferences for 2020 moved to virtual (ones I was supposed to attend in person), but now we are in this weird situation where people seem to think the pandemic is over and are really pushing for \u201cnormal\u201d which means in-person conferences and other experiences. Even in normal times virtual was better for me as a poor graduate student who can't afford the $500+ plane ticket and hotel stay for a 1-2 day conference.\n\nI\u2019m really not ready for this. I had long covid. Covid brought back some of the worst depression and anxiety of my life that I was finally getting under control. A year after getting sick I feel like I\u2019m finally able to do proper cardio without feeling sick. Covid also possibly made my body develop antinuclear antibodies which means I\u2019m at a higher risk of autoimmune disease in the future which can be triggered by viruses. I\u2019m vaxxed but the threat of covid is always here now and it\u2019s really hard for me to deal with.\n\nSo every single event I have to weigh against whether it\u2019s worth possibly getting a bad breakthrough case that could turn to long covid again. I turned down an invitation to a big conference because the thought of getting on a plane and spending hundreds of dollars to go across the country and possibly expose myself just for a couple days of networking didn\u2019t seem worth it to me. I considered applying anyway with the hopes that they would move to virtual but unless a new variant pops up I don't think that will happen. And in that case if I don't feel safe (and/or can't scrape the money together) I'm cancelling and possibly making myself look even worse than if I didn't apply. But now I feel like I\u2019m paralyzed, like almost nothing is actually worth ruining my health. And like whenever I act like this people no longer understand, because they've decided things are getting back to normal so I should too. Whenever I bring this up people tell me that they feel safe (mainly because they're vaxxed) so I shouldn't worry so much. But they don't seem to understand the horrible threat of long covid. They get to go back to normal, attend events, and be happy, because they've never experienced what I did.\n\nSo now I\u2019m weighing whether I should go to anything. I haven\u2019t been able to travel for research because of it. I don\u2019t participate in department events anymore. I do attend virtual events when possible but those are becoming rarer and rarer now that people want to return to normal. Which by the way I feel like is just a generally ableist thing to do because I know so many people with money, time, or disability issues finally felt like they could participate in academic events. I feel like I am just trying to keep myself and family safe but I also feel like I am being constantly gaslighted by people who think I\u2019m being crazy for continuing to act like there is a pandemic going on, because there *is.* Only half of people are vaxxed in my state and cases are going down but still. I just hate that this is probably ruining my reputation and possibly career and research prospects because even though I LITERALLY STUDY PUBLIC HEALTH nobody around me seems to understand that not everybody feels comfortable with the state of things right now and that they shouldn't be abandoned.\n\nDoes anyone feel kind of like I do? How do you cope?",

          "text": "The plan for these conferences is to present in person. I recently reached out about just that for a conference I was planning to attend (I said I was interested but due to cost of travel and safety concerns I might not be able to attend), and they said they plan on fully in-person. They already cancelled before during the pandemic instead of moving to virtual. I know most of these won't have the technology set up for that option. I rarely, rarely see hybrid events or support for virtual attendance at in-person conferences at this point. I saw it as an option for a few in 2020 (before things got so bad they just moved everything to online).",

      "text": "I can\u2019t comment on how to get over the anxiety because I\u2019m not planning on leaving the house much when we finally get out on lockdown. But I agree that conferences should have more options for people. Many researchers are being hit hard from covid, labs are running out of money so things like funding for conferences is going to be difficult. Conferences have always suffered from a lack of accessibility options, the technology has been available for a while but there is a refusal to make modifications. It\u2019s far harder for parents of young children or people with a disability to travel for conferences but they either have to make it work or take the potential hit to their career. It\u2019s stupid.",

          "text": "It's pretty normal here at least in my field but that's another thing worse about US academia I guess. Sometimes the bigger conferences have travel grants or there are a couple I can apply to as a grad student but they usually only cover something like the plane ticket and then I have to fund my hotel stay and registration fees and food.\n\nAlso I'm not necessarily judging people for looking forward to in-person conferences, I just think it's crazy that we aren't moving forward with hybrid options to help accommodate more people re: safety, cost, accessibility issues, etc.",
