But if you have hobbies and do stuff in your free time (or goodness forbid have a family that you actually spend time with) you\u2019re surrounded be people who would like to loudly tell you how much more successful than you they are and the awards they receive and the exotic travel they\u2019ve been invited to. On the flip side, if you spend 80 hours a week at work, you\u2019re still not guaranteed those things. \n\nThe culture of academia is a trap. You have to approach it with the mindset of: gosh, I am so freaking lucky to get to spend most of my time studying something I love. There are downsides to office life I get to escape. I know more about X than anything in the world. And if it all falls apart or if I stop feeling happy about those previous statements, I will find a new career plan because I\u2019m smart, adaptable and not defined by the job.",

          "text": "\"The culture of academia is a trap\" is very \\*very\\* well put. \n\nGenerally speaking, people who work in academia are smart. And they have been told all their life they are smart. They are high achievers, competitive and think they can outplay the game. By the time they realise they can't, changing professions is challenging. The more and more pressure put on most academics, mixed with the conflicting metrics and progressively insecure workplace can drive many people without a history of mental illness to depression or worse (see [https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/stefan-grimm-death-prompts-questions-for-imperial-president/2019747.article](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/stefan-grimm-death-prompts-questions-for-imperial-president/2019747.article))\n\nOn top of that, academia is like sports where no matter what team you play for, your career is based on your ability to perform as an individual. It is challenging to separate the professional from the personal. For many academics, it is the same thing.",

      "text": "There's a lot wrong, even tragic, in this article, starting with the title. It's designed to shock, to get people to read, and maybe to spark discussion (so by those metrics it succeeds, I guess). Ultimately though, the article is about depression and suicide, which maybe couldn't be mentioned in the title, and not really about happiness, using its main character, Brickman, as a foil for the larger point the author is making.\n\nThe article begins by explicitly conflating pleasure and achievement with happiness -- this was apparently Brickman's personal lens (his personal and professional failures, impelled along by long-term underlying depression, are what drove him to suicide), and a common distractive goal for many of us, in and out of academia. The idea of \"getting ahead\" as the primary adult pursuit, and thus the root of happiness, is one deeply set in our culture. \n\nFor academics, the idea that your value (and thus your happiness) hinges on your promotion, tenure, publications, etc., is also deeply set. We focus so much these things that we blind ourselves to the fact that this ultimately doesn't lead to being happy with our lives. When we're finally forced to confront that reality, the result is an article like this one: clearly fulfillment and happiness isn't the answer, because we pursued what we were told would lead to that and it didn't work.\n\nI've researched and written in the area of emotions and how to model them. I eventually came back to a combination of Russell's circumplex of emotions combined with a quasi-Maslovian model (despite being told by Reviewer 2 that Maslow was \"out of fashion\"). You can think of emotions arising out of motivations at each Maslovian level, where each is more durable than the one before it: so physical pleasure is great, but fleeting. Delight and similar feelings from acquisition (of objects in particular) lasts a bit longer. Feelings of friendship and familial acceptance last longer still. The positive feelings of achievement and being valued for your skills and knowledge last longer still. And finally, feelings of fulfillment we get from contributing selflessly to the welfare of others or (especially) a larger group are the most enduring. \n\nEach of these has a kind of built-in off-ramp, where we fasten on to an approach to happiness and stop considering others that are psychologically more costly: some chase novelty and pleasure, or safety and security, despite finding again and again that these feelings don't last. The same is true with those who chase wealth or the visible aspects of materials security. For each of these there's a fast hedonic treadmill of highs and lows, and yet many people never get off. The same for those who chase fame, social or parasocial relationships, or who focus their efforts on making \"a happy family,\" though these last longer. There's nothing wrong with any of these, but they're all ultimately fleeting -- fame dies quickly, friendships fade, children eventually grow up and move on to their own lives.\n\nThe same is true of for those of us who decide that our value, our happiness, resides in acquiring and being known for acquiring knowledge, expertise, or skill. This pursuit can sustain you for years or even decades, but it too will fail. It's only when we turn outward from ourselves and leverage all the other successes we have -- pleasure, wealth, relationships, expertise -- in the positive pursuit of others' good, that we find a form of \"happiness\" that actually endures. Of course, getting there is difficult, and each of these can look like folly to someone stuck on a treadmill at a previous level. (There's much more to all this of course, but this comment is far too long as it is.)\n\nFinally, FWIW, I'm no stranger to depression, or to the value of enduring happiness. Oddly these can co-exist (IME). I certainly don't *feel* happy in the moment when I'm deep in depression. But I know that that dark night has an end, and that life on the other side of it is still good. Sometimes that's enough for me to stop worrying, stop trying to find the *cause* (itself an illusory pursuit) of how I'm feeling, and just get through it.",

In what other field is it your job to run your own program of scholarship, mentoring, and professional service, with the goal to expand the boundary of human knowledge? That's pretty intense, and can create a weird environment/set of expectations/\"culture of excellence\". but you're right, it's not the only field with high pressure to perform",

I think a lot of the issues mentioned in this thread are exacerbated, if not caused, by an unrealistic mindset of what academia is like or should be. It\u2019s a job that rewards study and analysis, deep thought and the ability to make reasoned arguments, and as a result you probably don\u2019t have to deal with as much BS as other careers. And I imagine a lot of the appeal is that you get a lot of autonomy and job security. But some people equate that with never having to deal with politics at all, or behave like a reasonable human being, and that\u2019s simply not true.\n\nThe 20% where I disagree is that, relative to other jobs, there is a lot more self-driven, long term projects that you have to motivate yourself to do, rather than someone assign to you. That to me is where the burnout can happen, sitting in front of your computer willing yourself to start a proposal that has a 5% chance of funding one student for two years.",
