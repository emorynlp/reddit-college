  "text": "I'm currently in industry (relevant to my academic background) and I'm seriously considering a move back to academia after finishing a PhD 5 years ago.\n\nI would like to move abroad (UK currently) to do this, partly to experience a different culture/way of life but also to try and get in a good research group. My current preference is either a group at Caltech or Stanford however there are top groups all round the world. \n\nMy question is, am I going to be able to enjoy life I e. Spend a bit of time travelling in the area, or is academic life in the US all consuming? I have a feeling I'm romanticising it a little.",

      "text": "Hi. Forst can I ask why you want to move from Industry ti Academia? Any particular reason? \nMy 2 cents on the issue; people are trying to from Academia to Industry and it is hard believe me. Its really easy to find a postdoc almost anywhere but the issues are, postdocs are underpaid as compared to industry (at least for biological sciences), there is a constant pressure to do more (more finding, more publications, more mentoring, more research) and it never ends. In my point of view its a dead end. And if you want to find time to enjoy life, that might mit be that easy in academia as compared to industry.",

      "text": "I think a lot if it depends on where you go and on your new lab environment. Stanford and Caltech are prestigious institutions, but that means there will be greater demand for more work. They're also in very expensive to live cities, and the salary for a postdoc starts at about $55k USD. That won't go very far in places like Stanford or Pasadena, or other places in large cities like Boston or NYC. There are other great institutions though, like in the Research Triangle in North Carolina - you have a pick of three excellent universities and a much more manageable cost of living with the same $55k stipend.\n\nBut no matter where you go, the lab environment will determine if you can travel. If you have a PI who doesn't support a healthy work-life balance then you're going to have issues. I've been a postdoc for 2 years now, and my PI fully supports time off for traveling and mental breaks. So if you do start interviewing abroad, you should ask the PI's lab members about their weekly and monthly routines, what they do for fun, and how often they travel (for fun and to visit family). That will hopefully give enough insight to help you pick a lab more aligned to your work and life goals. \n\nI hope this helps!",

I also dunno how much institutional prestige covaries with workload \u2014 seems like it\u2019d be swamped by between-lab variance (I\u2019m a lot a well-regarded lab there, w/ $100M+ in grants historically iirc and lotsa N-C-S papers yearly, and it\u2019s super relaxed and life-work balance-y).\n\nHousing costs are quite high though, but the extra $1k / month you get at minimum above the e.g. NIH payscale goes a long way towards alleviating that disparity, unless you\u2019re *really* itching to live somewhere extremely swanky.",

              "text": "Not the person you asked, but I did a postdoc at a well respected university in New England. Pay was lousy and I discovered all the women were being paid significantly less than the male postdocs (in my case $7k pa less than the male postdoc in my lab with 3 years less experience than me), all pay was frozen the whole time I was there and I was furloughed several times (this means mandatory unpaid leave - not the same as the furlough in the UK). In addition, I had \"good\" healthcare insurance through the university but healthcare was still relatively expensive, especially dental, and quite hit and miss as to the quality (more hit and miss than the NHS). The university was obsessed with appearance and spent insane amounts of money on landscaping while the insides of the buildings hadn't been updated since the 70s. As the US has no statutory paid leave, I technically didn't have any but my boss would let me take 5 days in summer and 5 days over Christmas. Lastly, the university was the subject of a Title IX lawsuit, which is a piece of federal legislation which amongst other things requires universities to protect students from sexual harrassment. It was as toxic as you can imagine.\n\nIn addition, the guns were terrifying and Sandy Hook happened when I was there and was a real shock to the system. The right wing and the racism was similarly hard to handle. \n\nThat all said, I had a lot of fun. I met some amazing people, and Americans are much more generous than Brits in many ways and I experienced a lot of generosity and kindness from people that was surprising and uplifting. If you like outdoor activities the US is amazing. I loved hiking around the state parks and climbing various hills and mountains. I also had a lovely small house right next to a lake which I would swim in in summer, and walk across in winter. It's an absolutely beautiful country and I still miss some of the lifestyle.",
