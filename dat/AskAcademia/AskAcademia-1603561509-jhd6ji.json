      "text": "Not a TT position, but a Lead Scientist position at a govt lab. I spent months prepping a perfect application package and then job-talk, and it went so terribly-bad on interview day... The job was in a city that my wife really wanted to live, letting her down was actually harder than not getting the job.\n\nI did eventually get a similar job in the same city and now interact with the group that didn't hire me and I actively collaborate with the person they hired. Through that collaboration, I've realized the second job (the one I got) is way better than the first, better group of scientists, better supervisor, and I've made huge advancements in my research and career because of opportunities I've had through my current job that I wouldn't have had in the first.\n\nLong story short, I've never been a fan of the \"everything happens for a reason\" aphorism. But sometimes things really do turn out for the better, even when the process is debilitatingly painful.\n\nStick with it, and have whiskey/wine/beer on hand for when self-administered platitudes don't seem to be working any more.",

      "text": "Echoing everything said here. My first Skype interview was for a TT position at a dream school with a long prolific history in my field. Literal MacArthur Genius recipient among the faculty interviewing me. I fucking BOMBED. Rambling, incoherent, trying too hard, intimidated, etc. I wanted to cry the moment I ended the call because I knew I fucked up. AND it was my birthday. I\u2019m serious.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve since had a few more Skype interviews and on campus interviews. In fact, the dream school invited me back two years later for an on campus interview for another TT position. I didn\u2019t get it, but I was able to land a TT offer during that same cycle and I\u2019m now an Assistant Prof at an R1.\n\nFirst, as others have said, congratulations on getting interviews. You\u2019ve done, and are doing, something right.\n\nSecond, everybody seems to go through this because we get very little training here. Virtual meetings are harder and will take some getting used to. They will get easier. Just keeping going \u2014 you will learn from this and get better.\n\nI would recommend that you try to anticipate what the search committee checklist includes. They need to know you\u2019re sane and that you can express yourself clearly. They\u2019re probably always going to ask about your research, what courses you would teach, how your teaching is inclusive, what projects or grants are upcoming, etc. They are just vetting you to see if you\u2019re legit. And you are because you got the interview. Have canned (or semi-canned) responses with an eye toward what\u2019s in it for them. For example, they usually ask about what courses you can teach and how you can incorporate undergrads into research because they are trying to increase course enrollment and majors. Greater enrollment and major numbers is financially (and otherwise) beneficial for them from a college and university perspective. They don\u2019t actually personally care about your courses or research (some might)! Just remember that it\u2019s really about THEM and what you bring to their department. That will take a little digging on your part to learn about their history, what they\u2019ve done, and maybe what they\u2019d like to do, sort of in a bigger picture departmental or college \u201cmission\u201d kind of way. That seems like a big task at face value but it\u2019s really not. Did somebody just retire and they\u2019re looking to fill that teaching void? Can they do that and also get a badass new faculty member? Bingo! Just try to find ways that you naturally check off as many boxes as possible.\n\nAnyway, I know this sucks and feels bad. Many of us have been there. But you can and will learn from this. It\u2019s so awesome that you\u2019re getting interviews. My mantra lately has been \u201cjust keep going.\u201d Manuscript or grant proposal rejections, bad teaching days, etc. Tenacity seems to be a bigger predictor of success than entirely avoiding failure by giving up. I hope this helps somehow. Good luck! You got this \ud83d\udc4d",

But I would be appalled if my colleagues were not taking their roles in search committees seriously. I've served on a couple dozen over the years and thankfully have never once seen that happen.\n\nThat said, the converse of #1 is true also: it's rarely as *good* as candidates seem to think either. I've had lots of experiences with cocky candidates who come in thinking the job offer is a sure thing and they are the shit...who often end up a distant third place to candidates who weren't cocky. But that's probably a function of the SLAC market, where we occasionally get someone who thinks they are slumming by interviewing outside of the R1s.",

My fourth interview likely the best. \n\nTake a bit of time to write down what you can remember about what they asked you, its all likely to come up again. You can practice answers versions of those questions for yourself, either in writing, or aloud to yourself/pet/partner/friend.  I found that once I had confidence in what I saw saying I could think on my feet a bit better. \n\nI also spent sometime wearing my interview outfits around so I didn't feel totally non-myself while wearing them.

On the flip side, I thought I rocked my first TT interview and they still went with someone else so your performance is only ever only part of the equation. Same advice applies. Assume it happened for a reason.
