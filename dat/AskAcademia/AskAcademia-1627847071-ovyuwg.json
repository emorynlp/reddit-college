  "text": "Hi all!\n\nCurrently in the first month of my PhD (humanities) and it got me thinking. As the title says: people who are currently finishing their PhD/have finished their PhD already: what is something you wished you knew from the get-go of your academic position? Something you might have wanted to tell your younger self?\n\nLooking forward to your responses!",

Only six ultimately finished, and I am the only one with a traditional academic career. I had no idea it would be anything like that at the outset.

The only reason to stay is if you want to add just a tiny bit to science and you are willing to give years of your life to do so. Nothing else is worth the trade off, and there is no point going half in. It's the loneliest thing you can do. Be prepared. If you are not sure, don't walk, run.\n\n2, forgive yourself. There may be days you don't shower, there will be days you don't sleep. Your immunity will dip with stress, you will probably require glasses if you don't yet and you will probably hurt your knees and back in the years ahead if you haven't already. So minimise the damage, exercise where you can, take care of your body, sleep and eat as well as you can. This is not a sprint and burn out is real.\n\n3. Read an article every day. Just one. It gets you ready for writing and is like exercise for your brain, you'll be stronger for it by the time you need to write up\n\n4. Keep a file of all the instructions you get, though it's better done at the start of post-grad, so you can revert back to things you've forgotten years later\n\n5. Work on your thesis every day. No matter the occasion, even if you just read bits of it for an hour. It takes ages to find the thread again if you've lost it.\n\n6. Forgive your supervisor. Sometimes you might not agree but they want you to finish, they are human and you are not their only priority. You are the expert on your thesis, more than anyone in the world, that's your responsibility now. If you don't know, learn. Don't miss appointments and always listen to advice kindly. You are new at this, they know the way\n\n7. It doesn't have to be perfect the first time, it just has to be in. You will have countless revisions, don't get stuck.\n\nThat should help a little. I could write a book about this, but I need to go finish my thesis first.\n\nMay the odds be ever in your favour",

Fridges have failed, study leaders have gotten sick and passed away, no plan is ensured to survive a PhD. I am not trying to scare anyone off. No. I am. But most importantly I am trying to adequately arm and prepare the ones that stay. \n\nThat's not even getting started on impostor syndrome or attaching your self worth to a piece of paper with no save points in-between.

Find a mentor, or ideally more than one, who you can trust to tell you the truth. Don't speak ill of anyone in your department, ever; try to avoid doing it at all as you never know who might be connected back to your department somehow. Join your professional organization, volunteer to be on committees, and go to the annual meeting if you can-- and when there, go to the luncheons, breakfast meetings, board meetings (if they are open), and the like. Put time into *watching and listening* to others do the politics. Read the headlines in the Chronicle and Inside Higher Ed at least weekly so you know what's going on outside your own school.\n\nI did all this from undergrad through grad school, mostly because I was really curious about how academia worked.

Find out who knows what events on campus have free food and subscribe to those email lists. Take full advantage of your campus resources (e.g., student health, counseling, food pantry if you need it). Serve on a graduate student association committee. Take full advantage of mentors, both in and outside of your department. Make friends with admins because they ultimately control now easy pretty much everything will be for you, from material acquisition to office space to paperwork.",

But if I could go back in time, I would probably have picked a Theme/Research Project more closely related with my goals and tastes; instead, I decided to work with people I knew as I was too affraid to end up working with someone I couldn't get along with. This was a bad idea, let me tell you. But at least my Supervisors are ok and we have a positive/balanced relationship.",
