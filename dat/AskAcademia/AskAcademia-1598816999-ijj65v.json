  "title:": "Had a really bad call with advisor\u2026not sure what to make of it, and unsure how to move forward",
  "text": "So I\u2019m entering my third year postdocing with a professor. Let\u2019s call him Dr. Smith. For context, we work at a top R1 university, and Dr. Smith is about to go up for tenure. For the first year and a half, I thought things were going great \u2013 we were publishing a number of things together (I graduated a couple years ago; my published or in prep paper count is >10), he seemed to think at least some of the work was good enough to try shooting for top-tier journals, he regularly gave me good feedback on my writing and my papers, etc etc.\n\nThere\u2019s more context I could give (and can add in comments), but let me jump to the crux of the issue:\n\nI\u2019ve had two bad calls with Dr. Smith. One in this past winter, and one a couple weeks ago. They were similar in content, but the latter was much worse. I\u2019ll summarize some of the things Dr. Smith said to me in these calls:\n\n- He says (twice) that no one is going to read two papers I\u2019ve led on, even though I\u2019ve already gotten good engagement on at least one of them.\n- He feels I don\u2019t push him enough (whereas a couple other senior lab members do, in his view).\n- He tells me that I\u2019m not \u2018cut-throat ambitious\u2019, which he admits is maybe mentally healthy, but, if I recall, he says something like I\u2019m not going to make it long-term in academia unless I can be more ambitious and do more ambitious work.\n- He feels he gives me projects on a silver platter and then I don\u2019t want to put the effort in on them (this is in reference to two projects that I have theoretical and practical concerns with and thus have worked on slowly or avoided working on entirely). He ultimately badgers me into completing one of these projects over the next couple weeks (which I am doing now). (**BUT SEE EDIT BELOW**)\n- He says he feels exploited by me. (He somewhat backpedals this 30 seconds later.)\n- He says I need to \u201cshit or get off the pot\u201d, in terms of deciding whether I want to pursue a long-term research-focused (ie TT) position in academia, and that I\u2019m taking the opportunity to postdoc with him from other, more ambitious people.\n\nThere's one or two other things I could mention but I'll leave it at that for now.\n\nI was pretty shocked by the call. Overall, I think he might be right about some things (I\u2019m not the most ambitious person), wrong about others (about no one reading my stuff). So in some respects I feel a little gaslit. But either way, it felt overly aggressive and kind of out of the blue, especially since I feel like he\u2019s given me positive feedback earlier.\n\nIt\u2019s been a couple weeks since the second call and honestly I\u2019m still stuck with it. I don\u2019t want to finish out the year resentful of Dr. Smith and unable to speak to him about more than the bare essentials about research. But I have a hard time seeing myself moving on from this call. And I\u2019m not entirely sure where to go with my future in academia (which, duh, a lot of us are).\n\nIf you all feel that Dr. Smith is right to say these things to me, please tell me that. I think the sooner I can get clarity about what to take away from this call (and my postdoc position, etc.), the sooner I can make peace with it all.\n\nEDIT: I appreciate everyone's feedback. After thinking about it a bit more, I think I may have underrepresented how much progress I've actually made on the two projects I said I slow-walked or avoided. It's not the case that I did *nothing* on them. For one, I helped write the start of a grant. For the other, I made quite a lot of progress in the spring, but then over the summer focused on other projects and on conference stuff. Admittedly, only part of that refocus was out of necessity, and yes, I've definitely been unenthusiastic about these projects and was not subtle about it. And I take the point that from an advisor's, real or perceived slow work is \"death\" to the relationship, as one person put it.",

Like you, I felt weird and shitty about it for several days and I still kind of do.\n\nUntil a mutual colleague of ours made a good point in passing yesterday- that (especially now because of the pandemic) we never know what others are going through. If they snap at us, it could be because that is their way of coping with the stress of the world right now. It may have nothing to do with us in reality, even though it may come across that way. \n\nNot saying that it excuses anyone\u2019s poor behavior and lashing out, but I suspect many of the personality types in academia may handle stress in this manner. Again, it isn\u2019t fair or right, but it did provide me with some food for thought and additional context towards this situation I had overlooked before.",

          "text": "I appreciate the sympathy, and I'm sorry you've gone through some similar things...\n\nAs I said elsewhere, I do think Dr. Smith has some trouble communicating. I asked him how long he had felt this way (\"this way\" being frustrated with me), and he said since the beginning (of our relationship). Da fuh? He gave me almost nothing but positive feedback for the first 18 months of our relationship.\n\nAnother thing is that he will admit that he has an obsessive, manic relationship with his work -- he'll work like crazy and then crash. He admits this is maybe not super healthy. My GF wonders if his blowup at me is somehow related to those tendencies. And yes, he could be under certain corona pressures, although I suspect his response to world affairs is to bury his head and work and pretend that none of it exists.\n\nTwo things more: (1) Dr. Smith will also openly talk about how much he hates teaching, and (2) I often think he has a difficult time respecting things he doesn't personally enjoy/find interesting. As I said elsewhere, I'm teaching this fall, and I think he's especially resentful of that time I'm taking away from research even though he's prorating my salary (although the teaching could lead to a full-time longterm job, so I feel like I had to take the teaching gig, for the sake of my future).",

              "text": "It can be hard to work with someone like that. When they're keyed up and manic, they are much more harsh and negative on how things are going. When things slow down or settle, they see things more positively. Add to everything now that he's going up for tenure and he's in a manic spiral. He may also be projecting his anxiety into you. \n\nYou don't need to match that energy. It's not healthy and even for him it's clearly not sustainable if he crashes. I would take what lessons you can, like finish projects he gives you and either argue him into seeing your way forward [make sure you're not just raising problems, but offering solutions] or just pushing through). But beyond that, just ride the waves of his mania and keep making the best decisions for you. No one can predict if a student will get a TT job or even be successful. Try to chalk up his negativity as something personal to him, not really about you.",

                      "text": "I have some of the same issues your advisor has, I think.\n\nI think the greatest lesson is that you can be kind of maniac and kind. I think his mania and obsession doesn't excuse being an asshole.\n\nIt's not completely crazy to want to sacrifice yourself for your work, I think. But I believe it warrants very careful consideration -- are you really going to save the world, or do you just want to sacrifice (or run away from life) for no reason and are looking for an excuse? Sometimes your sacrifices yield 0 extra benefit to a more balanced approach.\n\nBut mainly on being an asshole: some of the most inspiring and some of the greatest work ever was done by very, very kind and in many ways wonderful people (if you need inspiration, look up Claude Shannon and his life). This already disproves you have to be an asshole to be great. There are many reasons for this, from just an aesthetic point of view, to the fact that to go really far you need to collaborate and be kind in many ways (like accepting and valuing honestly the contribution and discoveries of others), although you do have to value your own work (self-kindness).\n\nI might try an open communication. Just my opinion though. Tell your advisor how you feel with relation to your approach to work, your family and your peers in as much detail as possible. I've learned the hard way several times that more communication is better in the vast majority of cases. Talk it through, listen to advisor, and hope he listens. If you've really explained and reflected about how you want to conduct things, and there's a fundamental incompatibility, then maybe it's really best you don't embark on a long journey with him. Or if you do at least your understand yourselves better.",

Once you have your plan, follow through and keep him updated every week via email or call. \n\nMy guess is the real issue is he feels like you're taking him for granted and he doesn't like feeling that he has no control over the situation. This is probably exacerbated with tenure concerns. None of this excuses his behavior. So the question is what do you really want from him? Figure it out and ask him for it after you've re-built some of the trust in a couple months.\n\nEdit - if you aren't already, give regular therapy a shot.

OP should treat this position as a time for himself/herself too. S/he is there to produce publications/etc and gain skills that will benefit his career.

It sounds like he needs to learn to be more subtle, to deliver bad news with empathy. But at least you get what he's saying now (maybe he was subtle before, but it didn't get through).\n\nIt sounds like you have two options now, both of which I would feel are reasonable from your current position. You can trust his advice, take that he was a jerk and internally forgive him, and double down on the projects he gave you to make them successful. That would repair the relationship, and put you on a good path to success. Or you can fade out a bit and do the minimum while looking for an escape route (another postdoc, industry job), which it sounds like you're leaning towards. I would not blame you for either.",

Usually my PI is right about things, but I also always need to understand why she's disagreeing with me. I'm learning to be her - it's not helpful to take things on faith and just do whatever she tells me without understanding why. She's a smart lady, but also none of us are idiots. If she can't convince me my concerns with a project are invalid, then I could not comfortably continue devoting hours to that project instead of pursuing a different one we can both agree on.",

I would never have done the work I have without her - but she wouldn't have gotten the work I've done without me. I respect her a great deal, but she is training me to be an independent researcher. That doesn't include me doing whatever she tells me even if I think it's really wrong. Because she understands that I'm a human with thoughts and beliefs of my own she respects that, even though sometimes she doesn't agree with me.\n\nI feel like the view that \"this person is your boss just do whatever they say\" lacks some nuance. OP's papers directly determine OP's career. Writing a bad paper just to appease their PI is objectively bad for their career prospects. The job market is tight and at least in my field, quality is a huge deal. While it's important to know which battles to pick, this person has hired OP for their skills and prior training. It's a bit odd to value that training only when OP's opinions conform to theirs. To complete a project I have to spend at least 20 hours to my PI's 1. I'm the one doing the work. If they can't convince me that's worth it, that project is not happening.",

The PI is on the line here, your funding is his debt, and somewhere he needs to justify your salary.  He may need specific results for specific reports or funding applications.  \n\nWhat we want from our post-docs is results and progress where directed.

As a woman in STEM, this pattern of communication is very familiar to me from male PIs. It\u2019s unhealthy and toxic and inexcusable, but it may be worth examining if there are other contextual factors that might explain why he is treating you this way. That can be helpful for strategizing how to handle this moving forward. It also might be worth it to reach out to other trainees working with him, to see if they have had similar interactions in the past (or present). That can help you to know if it\u2019s truly isolated to just you, or if others have been at the receiving end of similar criticism. And if they have figured out an effective means of navigating it they might be able to give you some constructive advice.  Sorry you are experiencing this. It sucks, and it can be really hard not to internalize it. It sounds like this person is a poor communicator and has poor emotional awareness. They may feel like they are giving you helpful advice, and may not realize how harsh or toxic they are being. Not an excuse, but a lot of men in academia are pretty clueless and careless with how they talk to their trainees.",
