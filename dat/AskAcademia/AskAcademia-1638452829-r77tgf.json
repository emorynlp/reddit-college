  "text": "Hello everyone, \n\nI'm not sure if this the right sub, if not then I am sorry \n\nI emailed a prof who had a very vague description for an interesting PhD Position on her website (Europe).\nI emailed her a short summary about me, my CV and why it's interesting to me and if she could send me more information if the project is stj available. \n\nSo far I got no answer (emailed 11 days ago)\n\nI am not sure if I should simply take silence as a rejection or if I should follow up? Maybe someone can share his*her experiences or opinion?\nThanks!",

Adding more to the pile isn't always going to elicit a positive outcome. \n\nI understand a lot of students do not want to spend money to apply to a program they may not get into and would like to have a bit of assurance that they would be accepted by finding a PI, but the way admissions works may or may not make that possible. We have a system that allows recommendations from a PI to the admissions committee but I can't guarantee anything. I wait until the deadline before I respond to anyone because I need to see the whole application package and compare it to others before making any emails to schedule interviews.",
