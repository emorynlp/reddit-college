  "text": "Hello everyone, \n\nI'm not sure if this the right sub, if not then I am sorry \n\nI emailed a prof who had a very vague description for an interesting PhD Position on her website (Europe).\nI emailed her a short summary about me, my CV and why it's interesting to me and if she could send me more information if the project is stj available. \n\nSo far I got no answer (emailed 11 days ago)\n\nI am not sure if I should simply take silence as a rejection or if I should follow up? Maybe someone can share his*her experiences or opinion?\nThanks!",
